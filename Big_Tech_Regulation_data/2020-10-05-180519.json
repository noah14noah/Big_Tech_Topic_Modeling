Samira Hussain, BBC News, Washington. We have been asking you today if you can live without Google. Do you think that Alphabet, the parent company, should have its wings clipped. We will discuss some of your comments a little later, as well. Later today Jack Ma, who is one of the best-known and richest businessmen in China, is stepping down from his post as the executive chairman of Alibaba. The announcement last year took many by surprise. Let's go to our Asia Business Hub, where Rico Hizon is following the story. So Jack Ma stepping down. What is he going to do? At 55 years old he is retiring from Alibaba. Well, he wants to get into education, Sally. And basically he is following through on his own advice which he shared two young leaders at the World Economic Forum in Davos last year. He said when you are in your mid- 50s or 60s, you should enjoy spending time with your grandchildren. And that is what he plans to do. But retirement aside, Sally, you probably know him as one of China's richest men, with a net worth of over $38 billion. He was born into a poor family and started his career as an English teacher, and he was even rejected for 30 different jobs, including one at KFC. He founded Alibaba, which is now worth $460 billion, in his apartment two decades ago. Well, he bought his first computer at the age of 43 and was surprised when no Chinese beers turned up in his search for beer, and the rest is history. From being a traditional e-commerce company 20 years ago, it is now a conglomerate that has businesses from logistics to food delivery and cloud computing. Sally. Quite a story, thank you very much. Good to see you. Now let's brief you on some other business stories: Nissan's chief executive, Hiroto Saikawa, has said he will step down next week. Mr Saikawa has been criticised for being overpaid as part of a bonus scheme, although he denies any wrongdoing. The latest announcement followed a meeting of the carmaker's board. Rating agency Moody has downgraded Ford's senior unsecured debt rating, putting the car company in junk territory. It also warned further downgrades could follow. Ford's shares fell 3.7% in after-hours trading. British Airways pilots are striking for a second day in an ongoing dispute over pay and conditions. Tens of thousands of passengers have been told not to go to airports, with the airline cancelling some 1,700 flights due to the disruption. Later, Apple will be holding its yearly launch event. We are expecting details on the next iPhone, and possibly some other product upgrades. But the talking point for Apple is more political in nature, with the looming threat of trade tariffs threatening to have a big effect on America's richest company. Our North America technology reporter Dave Lee will of course be there. Here is what he is looking out for. Apple is a company that craves control, which is why the next few months will be so interesting, starting with this iPhone launch. Most of Apple's products have not been affected by tariffs put in place by the US, but that could change. On 15 December, if Donald Trump keeps his word, almost all of Apple's products will be affected, including its lucrative iPhone. The question is, how is Apple going to handle it? Do they raise the price of their devices in a way that could, of course, upset their customers? Or do they swallow that cost, eating into their profit margins? Investors are not going to be happy about that. They could move production elsewhere, outside of China, but that would reduce their ability to make so many devices so quickly. Apple will hope that this event is about good news, a better camera on the iPhone, some new features on the Apple Watch, perhaps something completely new coming down the line. But never before in its history has Apple been in so little control of the performance of its business.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1WE-44d945a51c344db6aec71848781a695f</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1WE2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X15-5M01-DY08-30N9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402026</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"783\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

For the first time in six years, Apple announced a new desktop PC, it's going to cost $5,999 to start, which means it is being aimed squarely at the creative industries, a group of people who feel they have been slightly neglected by Apple in recent years. </p><p>Dave Lee, BBC News, in San Jose. Let's stay with the big tech giants, including Apple. The share price of the so called FAANG companies have slumped in the US. So that's FacebookAmazon, Apple, Netflix and Google's parent company, Alphabet. They saw $137 billion wiped off their stock market value. Here's Michelle Fleury in New York to explain why. What sparked the sell-off was the prospect of greater regulatory scrutiny. US anti-trust forces have apparently carved up jurisdiction for possible investigations into Google, Facebook, and was on and Apple. The wall street journal reported on Friday that the US Justice Department is preparing an anti- trust investigation into Google's business practices. The Washington post claim that the Federal Trade Commission is looking into potential anti-trust violations of Amazon. Bloomberg says the FTC might open a anti-trust probe into Facebook. It's not uncommon for the agencies to negotiate over who gets to that which companies and markets. It is to avoid duplication and stepping on each others' toes. It's also worth noting that the last big anti-trust suit in the United States was against Microsoft, that was roughly 20 years ago. Part of the challenges that it's hard to show American consumers that have been harmed. As a requirement of US anti-trust law. Big tech companies like Google and Facebook and they hang on a second, we are providing our services for free in exchange for people's personal data. But make no mistake, the threat here is real. For a while now, many Americans have come to believe that the tech industry has too much power and needs to be reined in. But Washington, well, it's tended to be hands. Silicon Valley was seen to be an engine of economic growth not to be tampered with, but opinion has shifted. Democrats say these firms are too powerful and are hurting consumers and society. To quote Bob Dylan, it seems for big tech companies, times are a changing. That is your business briefing. Supermarket customers will be able to fill up their own containers with products that were previously wrapped, as part of a new trial by one major supermarket. In an attempt to reduce plastic waste, products including pasta, wine and washing-up liquid will be available at Waitrose without any packaging. Our business correspondent Emma Simpson has all the details. We have all become used to taking our own bags to do our own grocery shopping, but what about taking your own plastic containers as well? In the corner of the supermarket, there is a refill station. You can park your own food from lentils and pastor to frozen fruit. No box, then borrow one or use an environmentally friendly bag. Some of these things, if they were rolled out across all shops and all customers, it would have - it would save thousands of tons of mastic in packaging and would completely change the way we shop. Is this commercially viable? That is what we need to find out do this test. By their reusable bottles and you can do wine and beer too, and lots of loose fruit and vegetables. Plenty of independent shops offer food on rap, but no supermarket's tried anything as varied as this. It's nice being able to weigh the amount, it's just more flexible and it looks better.

They are creating a unique e-mail address for every up you sign up with, so if there is a data breach down the line, that's not going to affect you as much and the data isn't going to be useful for advertisers either. For the first time in six years, Apple announced a new desktop PC, it's going to cost $5,999 to start, which means it is being aimed squarely at the creative industries, a group of people who feel they have been slightly neglected by Apple in recent years. Dave Lee, BBC News, in San Jose. </p><p>Let's stay with the big tech giants, including Apple. The share price of the so called FAANG companies have slumped in the US. So that's FacebookAmazon, Apple, Netflix and Google's parent company, Alphabet. They saw $137 billion wiped off their stock market value. Here's Michelle Fleury in New York to explain why. What sparked the sell-off was the prospect of greater regulatory scrutiny. US anti-trust forces have apparently carved up jurisdiction for possible investigations into Google, Facebook, and was on and Apple. The wall street journal reported on Friday that the US Justice Department is preparing an anti- trust investigation into Google's business practices. The Washington post claim that the Federal Trade Commission is looking into potential anti-trust violations of Amazon. Bloomberg says the FTC might open a anti-trust probe into Facebook. It's not uncommon for the agencies to negotiate over who gets to that which companies and markets. It is to avoid duplication and stepping on each others' toes. It's also worth noting that the last big anti-trust suit in the United States was against Microsoft, that was roughly 20 years ago. Part of the challenges that it's hard to show American consumers that have been harmed. As a requirement of US anti-trust law. Big tech companies like Google and Facebook and they hang on a second, we are providing our services for free in exchange for people's personal data. But make no mistake, the threat here is real. For a while now, many Americans have come to believe that the tech industry has too much power and needs to be reined in. But Washington, well, it's tended to be hands. Silicon Valley was seen to be an engine of economic growth not to be tampered with, but opinion has shifted. Democrats say these firms are too powerful and are hurting consumers and society. To quote Bob Dylan, it seems for big tech companies, times are a changing. That is your business briefing. Supermarket customers will be able to fill up their own containers with products that were previously wrapped, as part of a new trial by one major supermarket. In an attempt to reduce plastic waste, products including pasta, wine and washing-up liquid will be available at Waitrose without any packaging. Our business correspondent Emma Simpson has all the details. We have all become used to taking our own bags to do our own grocery shopping, but what about taking your own plastic containers as well? In the corner of the supermarket, there is a refill station. You can park your own food from lentils and pastor to frozen fruit. No box, then borrow one or use an environmentally friendly bag. Some of these things, if they were rolled out across all shops and all customers, it would have - it would save thousands of tons of mastic in packaging and would completely change the way we shop. Is this commercially viable? That is what we need to find out do this test. By their reusable bottles and you can do wine and beer too, and lots of loose fruit and vegetables. Plenty of independent shops offer food on rap, but no supermarket's tried anything as varied as this. It's nice being able to weigh the amount, it's just more flexible and it looks better. I think it's high time there was less plastic and more - just going back to Europe, I'm not sure it's enough, but it's a good start. Waitrose says this is a genuine test to find out if shoppers really have an appetite for change. Emma Simpson, BBC News, Oxford. What an interesting idea. We will talk about that in more detail</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1SC-d37770b8cbe443d1af6c9dcf23e81410</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1SC2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W88-1J41-DY08-30PN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400433</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"701\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

Well, that is really very unpopular with Theresa May and the Conservative Party's bedrock. Indeed, the vast majority of people feel that, as well. It is a very hard one to see how this is going to be able to gain support. </p><p>Again, it is not a guarantee that the government would support whatever Parliament came back with. That is what it is coming back to, this tussle between Parliament and the government. The Daily Telegraph is talking about the Tories needing experience at the helm. It quotes Chris Grayling, the head of the Department of Transport, saying Theresa May's successor must be a Brexiteer who can hand over to the next generation, as a Cabinet split emerges. Your thoughts on who might succeed her? This might make Chris Grayling a little less popular, and it was only a couple of years ago that Theresa May was seen as the steady rudder to see us through this. So the Telegraph has a rather short memory, because they were the people championing her experience, the Home Secretary who had been there a long time, who was very steady. What this does show is that nobody really knows. Knows what? Who might succeed Theresa May? Exactly, or who might garner enough support. If there were a general election, there is this question of what might happen then in terms of who might lead the party to a successful majority if there were to be a snap general election. And what was interesting watching the MPs do the studios yesterday was there wasn't much appetite for a general election, even from the opposition, because they are all so split on this. It is not a party political issue, it is much deeper than that. Do you have a sense of what might happen? It is so difficult to predict what the outcome of all of this will look like. No, I don't, and I don't think anybody does. When we were talking about the business section, investors and business people want some sort of certainty. Sentiment is pretty low. We heard from the other interview, there is incalculable damage being done to the image of Britain abroad, UK Inc. Moving onto the front page of Financial Times, Mark Zuckerberg's mea copper on regulation fails to check the backlash against big tech. -- mea culpa. He is even talking about perhaps other countries following the guide of the European Union with the introduction of GDP are rules, new regulations introduced last year which regulate to a great degree how data is used within Europe. What do you make of what he had to say? On one level you can be quite sceptical about it, it is sort of closing the stable door after the horse has bolted. You think of the problems which happened with Cambridge Analytica, the outrage that people's data is being used and mind. So Mark Zuckerberg has come up with a few suggestions as to how regulators might start to look at ways of managing online stuff, political advertising, privacy, data portability. What he means is people flocking your data. On the other angle, this is a new technology. This is relatively new, it has grown exponentially from somebody at University setting up a webpage. It is unsurprising regulators are playing catch up. So it is a sort of chicken and egg. He also talked about how they would assess on Facebook how various campaigns are funded and promoted on their social media site, so for example it has been seen that in the run-up to various votes in Parliament, meaningful vote one, two, three, et cetera, there has been a huge amount of money invested in various campaigns on Facebook in the run-up to these boats. Absolutely, and you look at the US, the Mueller report, and where is the funding for that? And how does that work online? This is what this regulation is seeking to manage. EFT talks about the fact it is failing to check the backlash against big tech, Facebook, Google and others. Even though there is this big backlash, their user numbers per month go up and up and up. People are still using Facebook, regardless of their feelings about it. And this is the irony, we get an amazing service, this platform where people share multiple images and communicate with people for free. There is no such thing as a free lunch, Sally. Lets have a look at the press in Slovakia, because they have a new president, a liberal woman, who surprisingly one in this</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1NR-16a712a060e44454a6444015da390123</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1NR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VSM-2BM1-DY08-352D-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400427</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"742\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

Well, that is really very unpopular with Theresa May and the Conservative Party's bedrock. Indeed, the vast majority of people feel that, as well. It is a very hard one to see how this is going to be able to gain support. </p><p>Again, it is not a guarantee that the government would support whatever Parliament came back with. That is what it is coming back to, this tussle between Parliament and the government. The Daily Telegraph is talking about the Tories needing experience at the helm. It quotes Chris Grayling, the head of the Department of Transport, saying Theresa May's successor must be a Brexiteer who can hand over to the next generation, as a Cabinet split emerges. Your thoughts on who might succeed her? This might make Chris Grayling a little less popular, and it was only a couple of years ago that Theresa May was seen as the steady rudder to see us through this. So the Telegraph has a rather short memory, because they were the people championing her experience, the Home Secretary who had been there a long time, who was very steady. What this does show is that nobody really knows. Knows what? Who might succeed Theresa May? Exactly, or who might garner enough support. If there were a general election, there is this question of what might happen then in terms of who might lead the party to a successful majority if there were to be a snap general election. And what was interesting watching the MPs do the studios yesterday was there wasn't much appetite for a general election, even from the opposition, because they are all so split on this. It is not a party political issue, it is much deeper than that. Do you have a sense of what might happen? It is so difficult to predict what the outcome of all of this will look like. No, I don't, and I don't think anybody does. When we were talking about the business section, investors and business people want some sort of certainty. Sentiment is pretty low. We heard from the other interview, there is incalculable damage being done to the image of Britain abroad, UK Inc. Moving onto the front page of Financial Times, Mark Zuckerberg's mea copper on regulation fails to check the backlash against big tech. -- mea culpa. He is even talking about perhaps other countries following the guide of the European Union with the introduction of GDP are rules, new regulations introduced last year which regulate to a great degree how data is used within Europe. What do you make of what he had to say? On one level you can be quite sceptical about it, it is sort of closing the stable door after the horse has bolted. You think of the problems which happened with Cambridge Analytica, the outrage that people's data is being used and mind. So Mark Zuckerberg has come up with a few suggestions as to how regulators might start to look at ways of managing online stuff, political advertising, privacy, data portability. What he means is people flocking your data. On the other angle, this is a new technology. This is relatively new, it has grown exponentially from somebody at University setting up a webpage. It is unsurprising regulators are playing catch up. So it is a sort of chicken and egg. He also talked about how they would assess on Facebook how various campaigns are funded and promoted on their social media site, so for example it has been seen that in the run-up to various votes in Parliament, meaningful vote one, two, three, et cetera, there has been a huge amount of money invested in various campaigns on Facebook in the run-up to these boats. Absolutely, and you look at the US, the Mueller report, and where is the funding for that? And how does that work online? This is what this regulation is seeking to manage. EFT talks about the fact it is failing to check the backlash against big tech, Facebook, Google and others. Even though there is this big backlash, their user numbers per month go up and up and up. People are still using Facebook, regardless of their feelings about it. And this is the irony, we get an amazing service, this platform where people share multiple images and communicate with people for free. There is no such thing as a free lunch, Sally. Lets have a look at the press in Slovakia, because they have a new president, a liberal woman, who surprisingly one in this election.

Your thoughts on who might succeed her? This might make Chris Grayling a little less popular, and it was only a couple of years ago that Theresa May was seen as the steady rudder to see us through this. So the Telegraph has a rather short memory, because they were the people championing her experience, the Home Secretary who had been there a long time, who was very steady. What this does show is that nobody really knows. Knows what? Who might succeed Theresa May? Exactly, or who might garner enough support. If there were a general election, there is this question of what might happen then in terms of who might lead the party to a successful majority if there were to be a snap general election. And what was interesting watching the MPs do the studios yesterday was there wasn't much appetite for a general election, even from the opposition, because they are all so split on this. It is not a party political issue, it is much deeper than that. Do you have a sense of what might happen? It is so difficult to predict what the outcome of all of this will look like. No, I don't, and I don't think anybody does. When we were talking about the business section, investors and business people want some sort of certainty. Sentiment is pretty low. We heard from the other interview, there is incalculable damage being done to the image of Britain abroad, UK Inc.

He is even talking about perhaps other countries following the guide of the European Union with the introduction of GDP are rules, new regulations introduced last year which regulate to a great degree how data is used within Europe. What do you make of what he had to say? On one level you can be quite sceptical about it, it is sort of closing the stable door after the horse has bolted. You think of the problems which happened with Cambridge Analytica, the outrage that people's data is being used and mind. So Mark Zuckerberg has come up with a few suggestions as to how regulators might start to look at ways of managing online stuff, political advertising, privacy, data portability. What he means is people flocking your data. On the other angle, this is a new technology. This is relatively new, it has grown exponentially from somebody at University setting up a webpage. It is unsurprising regulators are playing catch up. So it is a sort of chicken and egg. He also talked about how they would assess on Facebook how various campaigns are funded and promoted on their social media site, so for example it has been seen that in the run-up to various votes in Parliament, meaningful vote one, two, three, et cetera, there has been a huge amount of money invested in various campaigns on Facebook in the run-up to these boats. Absolutely, and you look at the US, the Mueller report, and where is the funding for that? And how does that work online? This is what this regulation is seeking to manage. EFT talks about the fact it is failing to check the backlash against big tech, Facebook, Google and others. Even though there is this big backlash, their user numbers per month go up and up and up.

If there were a general election, there is this question of what might happen then in terms of who might lead the party to a successful majority if there were to be a snap general election. And what was interesting watching the MPs do the studios yesterday was there wasn't much appetite for a general election, even from the opposition, because they are all so split on this. It is not a party political issue, it is much deeper than that. Do you have a sense of what might happen? It is so difficult to predict what the outcome of all of this will look like. No, I don't, and I don't think anybody does. When we were talking about the business section, investors and business people want some sort of certainty. Sentiment is pretty low. We heard from the other interview, there is incalculable damage being done to the image of Britain abroad, UK Inc. Moving onto the front page of Financial Times, Mark Zuckerberg's mea copper on regulation fails to check the backlash against big tech. -- mea culpa.

You think of the problems which happened with Cambridge Analytica, the outrage that people's data is being used and mind. So Mark Zuckerberg has come up with a few suggestions as to how regulators might start to look at ways of managing online stuff, political advertising, privacy, data portability. What he means is people flocking your data. On the other angle, this is a new technology. This is relatively new, it has grown exponentially from somebody at University setting up a webpage.

Again, it is not a guarantee that the government would support whatever Parliament came back with. That is what it is coming back to, this tussle between Parliament and the government. The Daily Telegraph is talking about the Tories needing experience at the helm. </p><p>It quotes Chris Grayling, the head of the Department of Transport, saying Theresa May's successor must be a Brexiteer who can hand over to the next generation, as a Cabinet split emerges. Your thoughts on who might succeed her? This might make Chris Grayling a little less popular, and it was only a couple of years ago that Theresa May was seen as the steady rudder to see us through this. So the Telegraph has a rather short memory, because they were the people championing her experience, the Home Secretary who had been there a long time, who was very steady. What this does show is that nobody really knows. Knows what? Who might succeed Theresa May? Exactly, or who might garner enough support.

Again, it is not a guarantee that the government would support whatever Parliament came back with. That is what it is coming back to, this tussle between Parliament and the government. The Daily Telegraph is talking about the Tories needing experience at the helm. </p><p>It quotes Chris Grayling, the head of the Department of Transport, saying Theresa May's successor must be a Brexiteer who can hand over to the next generation, as a Cabinet split emerges. Your thoughts on who might succeed her? This might make Chris Grayling a little less popular, and it was only a couple of years ago that Theresa May was seen as the steady rudder to see us through this. So the Telegraph has a rather short memory, because they were the people championing her experience, the Home Secretary who had been there a long time, who was very steady. What this does show is that nobody really knows. Knows what? Who might succeed Theresa May? Exactly, or who might garner enough support. If there were a general election, there is this question of what might happen then in terms of who might lead the party to a successful majority if there were to be a snap general election. And what was interesting watching the MPs do the studios yesterday was there wasn't much appetite for a general election, even from the opposition, because they are all so split on this. It is not a party political issue, it is much deeper than that. Do you have a sense of what might happen? It is so difficult to predict what the outcome of all of this will look like. No, I don't, and I don't think anybody does. When we were talking about the business section, investors and business people want some sort of certainty. Sentiment is pretty low. We heard from the other interview, there is incalculable damage being done to the image of Britain abroad, UK Inc. Moving onto the front page of Financial Times, Mark Zuckerberg's mea copper on regulation fails to check the backlash against big tech. -- mea culpa. He is even talking about perhaps other countries following the guide of the European Union with the introduction of GDP are rules, new regulations introduced last year which regulate to a great degree how data is used within Europe. What do you make of what he had to say? On one level you can be quite sceptical about it, it is sort of closing the stable door after the horse has bolted. You think of the problems which happened with Cambridge Analytica, the outrage that people's data is being used and mind. So Mark Zuckerberg has come up with a few suggestions as to how regulators might start to look at ways of managing online stuff, political advertising, privacy, data portability. What he means is people flocking your data. On the other angle, this is a new technology. This is relatively new, it has grown exponentially from somebody at University setting up a webpage. It is unsurprising regulators are playing catch up. So it is a sort of chicken and egg. He also talked about how they would assess on Facebook how various campaigns are funded and promoted on their social media site, so for example it has been seen that in the run-up to various votes in Parliament, meaningful vote one, two, three, et cetera, there has been a huge amount of money invested in various campaigns on Facebook in the run-up to these boats. Absolutely, and you look at the US, the Mueller report, and where is the funding for that? And how does that work online? This is what this regulation is seeking to manage. EFT talks about the fact it is failing to check the backlash against big tech, Facebook, Google and others. Even though there is this big backlash, their user numbers per month go up and up and up. People are still using Facebook, regardless of their feelings about it. And this is the irony, we get an amazing service, this platform where people share multiple images and communicate with people for free. There is no such thing as a free lunch, Sally. Lets have a look at the press in Slovakia, because they have a new president, a liberal woman, who surprisingly one in this election. What does this mean for Slovakia and the region? It is interesting, as you point out, regionally, where we have seen people like Viktor Orban, not particularly pro-European or pro integration, the winner is very much</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1LO-a982bbd49cb44953b86aa0817e3475f4</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1LO2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VSM-2BM1-DY08-3534-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400546</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"740\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

Especially with the general election around the corner. I obviously also think it is great we have somebody who is of Pakistani descent, who is the son of an immigrant, and immigrant himself, that somebody like that can become financed... Finance Minister. </p><p>That should just give every child out there who is from a minority background hope. The Irish Times front page, of course they have Johnson all over it. They also say we must be prepared for the extreme heat, and most European papers and media are talking about that as well. Most of it discusses the Cabinet, the changes we have already looks at. But that one paragraph where Leo Varradkar says I am looking forward to meeting Boris and talking to him in detail, because again his speech long on excitement and short on detail. Basically the backstop will have to stay in place -- Leo Varadkar. And the withdrawal agreement will have to stay in place. That has always been the line from Leo Varadkar, the Prime Minister of Ireland, and some of the leaders within Europe itself, and Brussels, but this is the issue. That was the one issue, the Irish backstop, that when Boris Johnson was Foreign Secretary and there was that famous meeting in Chequers, he walks away. Is very because I understand from keeping the peace in Northern Ireland why the border needs to be kept open. I also understand the EU. If the UK wants to leave the Common Market, you can't have it leading into an open border, so the backstop does make sense. One of the main dailies in Germany, Frankfurter Allgemeine, looking at this story in detail, quite a hard article looking at Johnson and about the fact that he wants this deadline of 31 October to be met regardless, deal or no deal, do or die, et cetera. They are focusing very much on that. They are focusing very much on that, and they obviously also focus on the #39 billion, because Boris said we will just keep back the #39 billion and in good German fashion they say that is really a big concern for them. We have a deal, and the UK now needs to pay. #39 billion which was a part of the withdrawal agreement that the UK would pay. I think that is their main concern, that they basically say how is he going to get to a negotiated deal in 99 days, and it looks like a no deal Brexit. Let's look at Boris one more time, on the Daily Mirror front page, a photograph of that moment when he met and had an audience with the Queen. She formally asked him to put together a new government. He says I don't know why anyone would want the job. It is not him, it is the queen who said that. He leaked what the Queen said, which is an absolute no-no. He broke protocol when he said she told him, I don't know why anybody would want the job. She may have a point, but when you look at what unfolded, it was a titanic shift in terms... The establishment have just become the back benches, and the back benches have become the establishment. Facebook, really quickly, a big fine, and we were expecting it to come. They probably had the money tucked away to one side. $5 billion, a pretty hefty sum of money, but for Facebook, making as much as it is on a monthly basis... When you have a $15 billion free cash flow, this $5 billion doesn't really matter. But I think your previous guest made a very good point, saying this doesn't matter, but if they look at anti-trust and they curb the way in which Facebook can do business, that will be a problem because they will have to reinvent themselves. And obviously with Libra they have met some hurdles. And your thoughts on the outlook for Facebook? Today we are talking about their stellar earnings, but they are being challenged on every side when it comes to regulators looking at every single aspect of their business. And it is not just the regulation, it is also the taxation. Let's not forget the Europeans and the G7 finance ministers were very, very clear that these big tech companies should start paying taxes where they earn them, because they put a lot of them through Ireland, for instance, a lot of the headquarters where they don't have to pay much tax. So they will be...

Thursday looks like being a day of extraordinary, perhaps even unprecedented, heat across some parts of the UK. The July record looks like it will be broken but this is the one also in danger, the UK all-time record from the heatwave of 2003 because we could beat that and get very close to 39 Celsius somewhere around the London area. Not guaranteed but there is a good chance that that is going to be broken. That is the temperature that will make the headlines but there is plenty of hot weather to come elsewhere. Plenty of sunshine from the word go and we know it is going to be a very warm and muggy start and those temperatures will just rocket as we go on through the morning. We are keeping more cloud close to Northern Ireland with the weather front here and breezy as well. Chance of a bit of rain the further west you are and it will be breezy elsewhere as well but just coming from a hot direction, that breeze, so there will not be a lot of relief. And, yes, the temperature close to London will make headlines but we will be close to 30 Celsius if not above elsewhere in England. Eastern parts of Wales, up towards the Central Belt in Scotland as well with the low 20s into Northern Ireland and a little more cloud around. There are some storms around to end the day. Central and eastern parts of England could see them. They will be hit and miss, more likely through parts of northern England and Scotland. The risk of torrential rain, hail and disruption. Still warm night going into Friday morning, of course, after the heat of the day so bear in mind that the later stages of Thursday into the night there could be some disruptive thundery downpours in places. But then it is all change. This weather front moves through and this is the cold front. Colder stretch but it is the leading edge of cool air coming in on Friday. There will be some cloud moving east and the chance of seeing some showers. They may turn heavy on thundery towards parts of eastern England later in the day.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1EM-1d08e10dfb884122bdef1c5d6f525c36</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1EM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WN4-PG21-DY08-3095-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400421</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"772\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

No napping is the top tip evolve. I can't stick that one. Chill your socks, number five. Put your socks in the freezer and put them on. I have a much better solution. Come and do the early morning newspaper review. You don't get to sleep because you have to be in the news flow. So you don't sleep at all. How much sleep you get at night, out of interest, on a normal day? Between three and five hours. So you are a little bit like Margaret Thatcher, she only had four hours a night. I am a clinical insomniac. Let's hear from some of our viewers, who have sent their opinions and views. Eddie says we fit these into our ceilings, they have fans in the ceilings which are remote-controlled lists. Drink water, avoid alcohol in the evening, avoid eating anything heavy. I would agree with that advice. Others have said they got fans. Mr Celtic said frozen gel packs are more efficient at cooling you down if you apply them to your pulse points, wrists or neck. Lots of practical solutions. Interesting. Thank you for your time. Maybe you are also an insomniac, which is why you are watching me. I will see you soon. Bye. Thursday looks like being a day of extraordinary, perhaps even unprecedented, heat across some parts of the UK. The July record looks like it will be broken but this is the one also in danger, the UK all-time record from the heatwave of 2003 because we could beat that and get very close to 39 Celsius somewhere around the London area. Not guaranteed but there is a good chance that that is going to be broken. That is the temperature that will make the headlines but there is plenty of hot weather to come elsewhere. Plenty of sunshine from the word go and we know it is going to be a very warm and muggy start and those temperatures will just rocket as we go on through the morning. We are keeping more cloud close to Northern Ireland with the weather front here and breezy as well. Chance of a bit of rain the further west you are and it will be breezy elsewhere as well but just coming from a hot direction, that breeze, so there will not be a lot of relief. And, yes, the temperature close to London will make headlines but we will be close to 30 Celsius if not above elsewhere in England. Eastern parts of Wales, up towards the Central Belt in Scotland as well with the low 20s into Northern Ireland and a little more cloud around. There are some storms around to end the day. Central and eastern parts of England could see them. They will be hit and miss, more likely through parts of northern England and Scotland. The risk of torrential rain, hail and disruption. Still warm night going into Friday morning, of course, after the heat of the day so bear in mind that the later stages of Thursday into the night there could be some disruptive thundery downpours in places. But then it is all change. This weather front moves through and this is the cold front. Colder stretch but it is the leading edge of cool air coming in on Friday. There will be some cloud moving east and the chance of seeing some showers. They may turn heavy on thundery</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1YL-79a73ef9f41f4752a8e1b3a8167ce08c</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1YL2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WN4-PG21-DY08-3099-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400425</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"763\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

So they will be... You know, when you are too successful, people will gun for you. I have tweeted this story this morning on BBC online. How to sleep in heatwave. It has the top ten tips. No napping is the top tip evolve. I can't stick that one. Chill your socks, number five. Put your socks in the freezer and put them on. I have a much better solution. Come and do the early morning newspaper review. You don't get to sleep because you have to be in the news flow. So you don't sleep at all. How much sleep you get at night, out of interest, on a normal day? Between three and five hours. So you are a little bit like Margaret Thatcher, she only had four hours a night. I am a clinical insomniac. Let's hear from some of our viewers, who have sent their opinions and views. Eddie says we fit these into our ceilings, they have fans in the ceilings which are remote-controlled lists. Drink water, avoid alcohol in the evening, avoid eating anything heavy. I would agree with that advice. Others have said they got fans. Mr Celtic said frozen gel packs are more efficient at cooling you down if you apply them to your pulse points, wrists or neck. Lots of practical solutions. Interesting. Thank you for your time. Maybe you are also an insomniac, which is why you are watching me. I will see you soon. Bye. Thursday looks like being a day of extraordinary, perhaps even unprecedented, heat across some parts of the UK. The July record looks like it will be broken but this is the one also in danger, the UK all-time record from the heatwave of 2003 because we could beat that and get very close to 39 Celsius somewhere around the London area. Not guaranteed but there is a good chance that that is going to be broken. That is the temperature that will make the headlines but there is plenty of hot weather to come elsewhere. Plenty of sunshine from the word go and we know it is going to be a very warm and muggy start and those temperatures will just rocket as we go on through the morning. We are keeping more cloud close to Northern Ireland with the weather front here and breezy as well. Chance of a bit of rain the further west you are and it will be breezy elsewhere as well but just coming from a hot direction, that breeze, so there will not be a lot of relief. And, yes, the temperature close to London will make headlines but we will be close to 30 Celsius if not above elsewhere in England. Eastern parts of Wales, up towards the Central Belt in Scotland as well with the low 20s into Northern Ireland and a little more cloud around. There are some storms around to end the day. Central and eastern parts of England could see them. They will be hit and miss, more likely through parts of northern England and Scotland. The risk of torrential rain, hail and disruption. Still warm night going</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1YN-84145d2b3aa248d7ba2bb70c10af51fe</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1YN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WN4-PG21-DY08-30B0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402030</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"751\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

No napping is the top tip evolve. I can't stick that one. Chill your socks, number five. Put your socks in the freezer and put them on. I have a much better solution. Come and do the early morning newspaper review. You don't get to sleep because you have to be in the news flow. So you don't sleep at all. How much sleep you get at night, out of interest, on a normal day? Between three and five hours. So you are a little bit like Margaret Thatcher, she only had four hours a night. I am a clinical insomniac. Let's hear from some of our viewers, who have sent their opinions and views. Eddie says we fit these into our ceilings, they have fans in the ceilings which are remote-controlled lists. Drink water, avoid alcohol in the evening, avoid eating anything heavy. I would agree with that advice. Others have said they got fans. Mr Celtic said frozen gel packs are more efficient at cooling you down if you apply them to your pulse points, wrists or neck. Lots of practical solutions. Interesting. Thank you for your time. Maybe you are also an insomniac, which is why you are watching me. I will see you soon. Bye. Thursday looks like being a day of extraordinary, perhaps even unprecedented, heat across some parts of the UK. The July record looks like it will be broken but this is the one also in danger, the UK all-time record from the heatwave of 2003 because we could beat that and get very close to 39 Celsius somewhere around the London area. Not guaranteed but there is a good chance that that is going to be broken. That is the temperature that will make the headlines but there is plenty of hot weather to come elsewhere. Plenty of sunshine from the word go and we know it is going to be a very warm and muggy start and those temperatures will just rocket as we go on through the morning. We are keeping more cloud close to Northern Ireland with the weather front here and breezy as well. Chance of a bit of rain the further west you are and it will be breezy elsewhere as well but just coming from a hot direction, that breeze, so there will not be a lot of relief. And, yes, the temperature close to London will make headlines but we will be close to 30 Celsius if not above elsewhere in England. Eastern parts of Wales, up towards the Central Belt in Scotland as well with the low 20s into Northern Ireland and a little more cloud around. There are some storms around to end the day. Central and eastern parts of England could see them. They will be hit and miss, more likely through parts of northern England and Scotland. The risk of torrential rain, hail and disruption. Still warm night going into Friday morning, of course, after the heat of the day so bear in mind that the later stages of Thursday into the night there could be some disruptive thundery downpours in places. But then it is all change. This weather front moves through and this is the cold front. Colder stretch but it is the leading edge of cool air coming in on Friday. There will be some cloud moving east and the chance of seeing some showers. They may turn heavy on thundery</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1OX-84f3fedc155445bfaf862647f8e58010</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1OX2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WN4-PG21-DY08-3096-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400431</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"763\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

But then it is all change. This weather front moves through and this is the cold front. Colder stretch but it is the leading edge of cool air coming in on Friday.

Facebook, really quickly, a big fine, and we were expecting it to come.

Today we are talking about their stellar earnings, but they are being challenged on every side when it comes to regulators looking at every single aspect of their business. And it is not just the regulation, it is also the taxation. Let's not forget the Europeans and the G7 finance ministers were very, very clear that these big tech companies should start paying taxes where they earn them, because they put a lot of them through Ireland, for instance, a lot of the headquarters where they don't have to pay much tax. So they will be... You know, when you are too successful, people will gun for you. I have tweeted this story this morning on BBC online. How to sleep in heatwave. It has the top ten tips. No napping is the top tip evolve. I can't stick that one. Chill your socks, number five. Put your socks in the freezer and put them on. I have a much better solution. Come and do the early morning newspaper review. You don't get to sleep because you have to be in the news flow. So you don't sleep at all. How much sleep you get at night, out of interest, on a normal day? Between three and five hours. So you are a little bit like Margaret Thatcher, she only had four hours a night. I am a clinical insomniac. Let's hear from some of our viewers, who have sent their opinions and views. Eddie says we fit these into our ceilings, they have fans in the ceilings which are remote-controlled lists. Drink water, avoid alcohol in the evening, avoid eating anything heavy. I would agree with that advice. Others have said they got fans. Mr Celtic said frozen gel packs are more efficient at cooling you down if you apply them to your pulse points, wrists or neck. Lots of practical solutions. Interesting. Thank you for your time. Maybe you are also an insomniac, which is why you are watching me. I will see you soon. Bye. Thursday looks like being a day of extraordinary, perhaps even unprecedented, heat across some parts of the UK. The July record looks like it will be broken but this is the one also in danger, the UK all-time record from the heatwave of 2003 because we could beat that and get very close to 39 Celsius somewhere around the London area. Not guaranteed but there is a good chance that that is going to be broken. That is the temperature that will make the headlines but there is plenty of hot weather to come elsewhere. Plenty of sunshine from the word go and we know it is going to be a very warm and muggy start and those temperatures will just rocket as we go on through the morning. We are keeping more cloud close to Northern Ireland with the weather front here and breezy as well. Chance of a bit of rain the further west you are and it will be breezy elsewhere as well but just coming from a hot direction, that breeze, so there will not be a lot of relief. And, yes, the temperature close to London will make headlines but we will be close to 30 Celsius if not above elsewhere in England. Eastern parts of Wales, up towards the Central Belt in Scotland as well with the low 20s into Northern Ireland and a little more cloud around. There are some storms around to end the day. Central and eastern parts of England could see them. They will be hit and miss, more likely through parts of northern England and Scotland. The risk of torrential rain, hail and disruption. Still warm night going into Friday morning, of course, after the heat of the day so bear in mind that the later stages of Thursday into the night there could be some disruptive thundery downpours in places. But then it is all change. This weather front moves through and this is the cold front. Colder stretch but it is the leading edge of cool air coming in on Friday. There will be some cloud moving east and the chance of seeing some showers. They may turn heavy on thundery</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1NE-2323e3a3105743d0bba0da1387091b2f</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1NE2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WN4-PG21-DY08-3097-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">401864</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"763\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

So they will be... You know, when you are too successful, people will gun for you. I have tweeted this story this morning on BBC online. How to sleep in heatwave. It has the top ten tips. No napping is the top tip evolve. I can't stick that one. Chill your socks, number five. Put your socks in the freezer and put them on. I have a much better solution. Come and do the early morning newspaper review. You don't get to sleep because you have to be in the news flow. So you don't sleep at all. How much sleep you get at night, out of interest, on a normal day? Between three and five hours. So you are a little bit like Margaret Thatcher, she only had four hours a night. I am a clinical insomniac. Let's hear from some of our viewers, who have sent their opinions and views. Eddie says we fit these into our ceilings, they have fans in the ceilings which are remote-controlled lists. Drink water, avoid alcohol in the evening, avoid eating anything heavy. I would agree with that advice. Others have said they got fans. Mr Celtic said frozen gel packs are more efficient at cooling you down if you apply them to your pulse points, wrists or neck. Lots of practical solutions. Interesting. Thank you for your time. Maybe you are also an insomniac, which is why you are watching me. I will see you soon. Bye. Thursday looks like being a day of extraordinary, perhaps even unprecedented, heat across some parts of the UK. The July record looks like it will be broken but this is the one also in danger, the UK all-time record from the heatwave of 2003 because we could beat that and get very close to 39 Celsius somewhere around the London area. Not guaranteed but there is a good chance that that is going to be broken. That is the temperature that will make the headlines but there is plenty of hot weather to come elsewhere. Plenty of sunshine from the word go and we know it is going to be a very warm and muggy start and those temperatures will just rocket as we go on through the morning. We are keeping more cloud close to Northern Ireland with the weather front here and breezy as well. Chance of a bit of rain the further west you are and it will be breezy elsewhere as well but just coming from a hot direction, that breeze, so there will not be a lot of relief. And, yes, the temperature close to London will make headlines but we will be close to 30 Celsius if not above elsewhere in England. Eastern parts of Wales, up towards the Central Belt in Scotland as well with the low 20s into Northern Ireland and a little more cloud around. There are some storms around to end the day. Central and eastern parts of England could see them. They will be hit and miss, more likely through parts of northern England and Scotland. The risk of torrential rain, hail and disruption. Still warm night going</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1WE-1f2c8ae11d0a40d3820ea91477c59cef</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1WE2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WN4-PG21-DY08-30B2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402026</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"751\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

So they will be... You know, when you are too successful, people will gun for you. I have tweeted this story this morning on BBC online. How to sleep in heatwave. It has the top ten tips. No napping is the top tip evolve. I can't stick that one. Chill your socks, number five. Put your socks in the freezer and put them on. I have a much better solution. Come and do the early morning newspaper review. You don't get to sleep because you have to be in the news flow. So you don't sleep at all. How much sleep you get at night, out of interest, on a normal day? Between three and five hours. So you are a little bit like Margaret Thatcher, she only had four hours a night. I am a clinical insomniac. Let's hear from some of our viewers, who have sent their opinions and views. Eddie says we fit these into our ceilings, they have fans in the ceilings which are remote-controlled lists. Drink water, avoid alcohol in the evening, avoid eating anything heavy. I would agree with that advice. Others have said they got fans. Mr Celtic said frozen gel packs are more efficient at cooling you down if you apply them to your pulse points, wrists or neck. Lots of practical solutions. Interesting. Thank you for your time. Maybe you are also an insomniac, which is why you are watching me. I will see you soon. Bye. Thursday looks like being a day of extraordinary, perhaps even unprecedented, heat across some parts of the UK. The July record looks like it will be broken but this is the one also in danger, the UK all-time record from the heatwave of 2003 because we could beat that and get very close to 39 Celsius somewhere around the London area. Not guaranteed but there is a good chance that that is going to be broken. That is the temperature that will make the headlines but there is plenty of hot weather to come elsewhere. Plenty of sunshine from the word go and we know it is going to be a very warm and muggy start and those temperatures will just rocket as we go on through the morning. We are keeping more cloud close to Northern Ireland with the weather front here and breezy as well. Chance of a bit of rain the further west you are and it will be breezy elsewhere as well but just coming from a hot direction, that breeze, so there will not be a lot of relief. And, yes, the temperature close to London will make headlines but we will be close to 30 Celsius if not above elsewhere in England. Eastern parts of Wales, up towards the Central Belt in Scotland as well with the low 20s into Northern Ireland and a little more cloud around. There are some storms around to end the day. Central and eastern parts of England could see them. They will be hit and miss, more likely through parts of northern England and Scotland. The risk of torrential rain, hail and disruption. Still warm night going into Friday morning, of course, after the heat of the day so bear in mind that the later stages of Thursday into the night there could be some disruptive thundery downpours in places. But then it is all change. This weather front moves through and this is the cold front. Colder stretch but it is the leading edge of cool air coming in on Friday. There will be some cloud moving east and the chance of seeing some showers. They may turn heavy on thundery</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1NW-a7c86bd3e13c449e85e51f854ee149b6</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1NW2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WN4-PG21-DY08-3094-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400429</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"763\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

He leaked what the Queen said, which is an absolute no-no. He broke protocol when he said she told him, I don't know why anybody would want the job. </p><p>She may have a point, but when you look at what unfolded, it was a titanic shift in terms... The establishment have just become the back benches, and the back benches have become the establishment. Facebook, really quickly, a big fine, and we were expecting it to come. They probably had the money tucked away to one side. $5 billion, a pretty hefty sum of money, but for Facebook, making as much as it is on a monthly basis... When you have a $15 billion free cash flow, this $5 billion doesn't really matter. But I think your previous guest made a very good point, saying this doesn't matter, but if they look at anti-trust and they curb the way in which Facebook can do business, that will be a problem because they will have to reinvent themselves. And obviously with Libra they have met some hurdles. And your thoughts on the outlook for Facebook? Today we are talking about their stellar earnings, but they are being challenged on every side when it comes to regulators looking at every single aspect of their business. And it is not just the regulation, it is also the taxation. Let's not forget the Europeans and the G7 finance ministers were very, very clear that these big tech companies should start paying taxes where they earn them, because they put a lot of them through Ireland, for instance, a lot of the headquarters where they don't have to pay much tax. So they will be... You know, when you are too successful, people will gun for you. I have tweeted this story this morning on BBC online. How to sleep in heatwave. It has the top ten tips. No napping is the top tip evolve. I can't stick that one. Chill your socks, number five. Put your socks in the freezer and put them on. I have a much better solution. Come and do the early morning newspaper review. You don't get to sleep because you have to be in the news flow. So you don't sleep at all. How much sleep you get at night, out of interest, on a normal day? Between three and five hours. So you are a little bit like Margaret Thatcher, she only had four hours a night. I am a clinical insomniac. Let's hear from some of our viewers, who have sent their opinions and views. Eddie says we fit these into our ceilings, they have fans in the ceilings which are remote-controlled lists. Drink water, avoid alcohol in the evening, avoid eating anything heavy. I would agree with that advice. Others have said they got fans. Mr Celtic said frozen gel packs are more efficient at cooling you down if you apply them to your pulse points, wrists or neck. Lots of practical solutions. Interesting. Thank you for your time. Maybe you are also an insomniac, which is why you are watching me. I will see you soon. Bye. Thursday looks like being a day of extraordinary, perhaps even unprecedented, heat across some parts of the UK. The July record looks like it will be broken but this is the one also in danger, the UK all-time record from the heatwave of 2003 because we could beat that and get very close to 39 Celsius somewhere around the London area. Not guaranteed but there is a good chance that that is going to be broken. That is the temperature that will make the headlines but there is plenty of hot weather to come elsewhere. Plenty of sunshine from the word go and we know it is going to be a very warm and muggy start and those temperatures will just rocket as we go on through the morning. We are keeping more cloud close to Northern Ireland with the weather front here and breezy as well. Chance of a bit of rain the further west you are and it will be breezy elsewhere as well but just coming from a hot direction, that breeze, so there will not be a lot of relief. And, yes, the temperature close to London will make headlines but we will be close to 30 Celsius if not above elsewhere in England. Eastern parts of Wales, up towards the Central Belt in Scotland as well with the low 20s into Northern Ireland and a little more cloud around. There are some storms around to end the day. Central and eastern parts of England could see them. They will be hit and miss, more likely through parts of northern England and Scotland. The risk of torrential rain, hail and disruption. Still warm night going</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1SO-fe0b69648ce04cf7a4afaf3153c8430b</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1SO2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WN4-PG21-DY08-309X-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400437</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"751\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

A resolution unveiled by Mitch McConnell, who leads the Republican majority in the Senate, could see a vote on the timetable as early as Thursday. Chuck Schumer, who leads the Democratic minority in the Senate, has called the proposals a cover-up and a national disgrace. So what can we expect to happen?</p><p> The BBC's Gary O'Donoghue reports from Washington. Will all senators now stand and remain standing, and raise their right-hand. Do you solemnly swear that in all things appertaining to the trail of the impeachment of Donald John Trump... Yes, these are 100 members of the United States Senate, but now they are also jurors and judges be they get to fix the rules of the trail and decide on guilt. we will be sitting there and chairs for about six hours a day starting at 1pm eastern time, six days a week, so this is going to be, I think, kind of a gruelling exercise but also one that will be public. The President faces two charges. The first is that he abused his power by pressuring the President of Ukraine to investigate one of his main democratic rivals, former Vice President Joe Biden. The second is that he obstructed Congress by trying to stop officials giving evidence and withholding documents. There are almost no rules for a trail like this and immigrants and Republicans are completely at odds over whether to call witnesses at all. That all means this trail could last anything from 2- six weeks. Democrats want to hear from John Bolton, who reportedly likened the pressure being put on Ukraine to a drug deal. But Republicans are threatening to retaliate, by insisting Joe Biden or his son appear too. In the coming days, Senate Republicans are going to face a choice. Will they take their cues from the White House and engage in a cover-up for President Trump? Or will they, in this most sacred of undertakings prescribed by the Constitution, vote for a fair trial with witnesses? The President continues to dismiss his impeachment as a hoax, instead focusing on his achievements. And what do I get out of it? Tell me? I'd get impeached! That's what they get out of it, by these radical left lunatics, I'd get impeached. But that's OK, the farmers are sticking with Trump. It would take a two-thirds majority to convict the President and remove him from office. That is extremely unlikely, nevertheless, these coming weeks will resonate for years to come. Let's brief you on some of the other stories making the news. New figures from the UN show that nearly half a billion people work less than they want to or not at all. The International Labour Organisation also forcasts that unemployment will rise by about two and a half million this year, due to a stagnating global economy. The agency believes this has profound and worrying implications for social cohesion. Malaysia has revealed it's sent back 150 shipping containers of illegally-imported plastic waste to the developed countries it came from. Richer countries have been sending plastic to Malaysia since 2018, when China banned most waste imports. But Malaysia's government has taken a stand, saying it doesn't want to be the world's garbage dump. Canadian lawyers representing the Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou at her extradition hearing have argued that the crimes the United States has accused her off would not be considered against the law in Canada. They say that Ms Meng should not be extradited to the US to face charges of fraud and violating American sanctions on Iran. More on that in Business Briefing. The head of Google has called for artificial intelligence to be regulated. Writing in the Financial Times, Sundar Pichai said it was \"too important not to\" impose regulation but argued for \"a sensible approach\". Last week it was revealed that the European Commission is considering a five-year ban on facial recognition. Priya Lakhani is the founder and CEO of Century Tech, she's with me now.

A resolution unveiled by Mitch McConnell, who leads the Republican majority in the Senate, could see a vote on the timetable as early as Thursday. Chuck Schumer, who leads the Democratic minority in the Senate, has called the proposals a cover-up and a national disgrace. So what can we expect to happen?</p><p> The BBC's Gary O'Donoghue reports from Washington. Will all senators now stand and remain standing, and raise their right-hand. Do you solemnly swear that in all things appertaining to the trail of the impeachment of Donald John Trump... Yes, these are 100 members of the United States Senate, but now they are also jurors and judges be they get to fix the rules of the trail and decide on guilt. we will be sitting there and chairs for about six hours a day starting at 1pm eastern time, six days a week, so this is going to be, I think, kind of a gruelling exercise but also one that will be public. The President faces two charges. The first is that he abused his power by pressuring the President of Ukraine to investigate one of his main democratic rivals, former Vice President Joe Biden. The second is that he obstructed Congress by trying to stop officials giving evidence and withholding documents. There are almost no rules for a trail like this and immigrants and Republicans are completely at odds over whether to call witnesses at all. That all means this trail could last anything from 2- six weeks. Democrats want to hear from John Bolton, who reportedly likened the pressure being put on Ukraine to a drug deal. But Republicans are threatening to retaliate, by insisting Joe Biden or his son appear too. In the coming days, Senate Republicans are going to face a choice. Will they take their cues from the White House and engage in a cover-up for President Trump? Or will they, in this most sacred of undertakings prescribed by the Constitution, vote for a fair trial with witnesses? The President continues to dismiss his impeachment as a hoax, instead focusing on his achievements. And what do I get out of it? Tell me? I'd get impeached! That's what they get out of it, by these radical left lunatics, I'd get impeached. But that's OK, the farmers are sticking with Trump. It would take a two-thirds majority to convict the President and remove him from office. That is extremely unlikely, nevertheless, these coming weeks will resonate for years to come. Let's brief you on some of the other stories making the news. New figures from the UN show that nearly half a billion people work less than they want to or not at all. The International Labour Organisation also forcasts that unemployment will rise by about two and a half million this year, due to a stagnating global economy. The agency believes this has profound and worrying implications for social cohesion. Malaysia has revealed it's sent back 150 shipping containers of illegally-imported plastic waste to the developed countries it came from. Richer countries have been sending plastic to Malaysia since 2018, when China banned most waste imports. But Malaysia's government has taken a stand, saying it doesn't want to be the world's garbage dump. Canadian lawyers representing the Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou at her extradition hearing have argued that the crimes the United States has accused her off would not be considered against the law in Canada. They say that Ms Meng should not be extradited to the US to face charges of fraud and violating American sanctions on Iran. More on that in Business Briefing. The head of Google has called for artificial intelligence to be regulated. Writing in the Financial Times, Sundar Pichai said it was \"too important not to\" impose regulation but argued for \"a sensible approach\". Last week it was revealed that the European Commission is considering a five-year ban on facial recognition. Priya Lakhani is the founder and CEO of Century Tech, she's with me now.

A resolution unveiled by Mitch McConnell, who leads the Republican majority in the Senate, could see a vote on the timetable as early as Thursday. Chuck Schumer, who leads the Democratic minority in the Senate, has called the proposals a cover-up and a national disgrace. So what can we expect to happen?</p><p> The BBC's Gary O'Donoghue reports from Washington. Will all senators now stand and remain standing, and raise their right-hand. Do you solemnly swear that in all things appertaining to the trail of the impeachment of Donald John Trump... Yes, these are 100 members of the United States Senate, but now they are also jurors and judges be they get to fix the rules of the trail and decide on guilt. we will be sitting there and chairs for about six hours a day starting at 1pm eastern time, six days a week, so this is going to be, I think, kind of a gruelling exercise but also one that will be public. The President faces two charges. The first is that he abused his power by pressuring the President of Ukraine to investigate one of his main democratic rivals, former Vice President Joe Biden. The second is that he obstructed Congress by trying to stop officials giving evidence and withholding documents. There are almost no rules for a trail like this and immigrants and Republicans are completely at odds over whether to call witnesses at all. That all means this trail could last anything from 2- six weeks. Democrats want to hear from John Bolton, who reportedly likened the pressure being put on Ukraine to a drug deal. But Republicans are threatening to retaliate, by insisting Joe Biden or his son appear too. In the coming days, Senate Republicans are going to face a choice. Will they take their cues from the White House and engage in a cover-up for President Trump? Or will they, in this most sacred of undertakings prescribed by the Constitution, vote for a fair trial with witnesses? The President continues to dismiss his impeachment as a hoax, instead focusing on his achievements. And what do I get out of it? Tell me? I'd get impeached! That's what they get out of it, by these radical left lunatics, I'd get impeached. But that's OK, the farmers are sticking with Trump. It would take a two-thirds majority to convict the President and remove him from office. That is extremely unlikely, nevertheless, these coming weeks will resonate for years to come. Let's brief you on some of the other stories making the news. New figures from the UN show that nearly half a billion people work less than they want to or not at all. The International Labour Organisation also forcasts that unemployment will rise by about two and a half million this year, due to a stagnating global economy. The agency believes this has profound and worrying implications for social cohesion. Malaysia has revealed it's sent back 150 shipping containers of illegally-imported plastic waste to the developed countries it came from. Richer countries have been sending plastic to Malaysia since 2018, when China banned most waste imports. But Malaysia's government has taken a stand, saying it doesn't want to be the world's garbage dump. Canadian lawyers representing the Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou at her extradition hearing have argued that the crimes the United States has accused her off would not be considered against the law in Canada. They say that Ms Meng should not be extradited to the US to face charges of fraud and violating American sanctions on Iran. More on that in Business Briefing. The head of Google has called for artificial intelligence to be regulated. Writing in the Financial Times, Sundar Pichai said it was \"too important not to\" impose regulation but argued for \"a sensible approach\". Last week it was revealed that the European Commission is considering a five-year ban on facial recognition. Priya Lakhani is the founder and CEO of Century Tech, she's with me now.

A resolution unveiled by Mitch McConnell, who leads the Republican majority in the Senate, could see a vote on the timetable as early as Thursday. Chuck Schumer, who leads the Democratic minority in the Senate, has called the proposals a cover-up and a national disgrace. So what can we expect to happen?</p><p> The BBC's Gary O'Donoghue reports from Washington. Will all senators now stand and remain standing, and raise their right-hand. Do you solemnly swear that in all things appertaining to the trail of the impeachment of Donald John Trump... Yes, these are 100 members of the United States Senate, but now they are also jurors and judges be they get to fix the rules of the trail and decide on guilt. we will be sitting there and chairs for about six hours a day starting at 1pm eastern time, six days a week, so this is going to be, I think, kind of a gruelling exercise but also one that will be public. The President faces two charges. The first is that he abused his power by pressuring the President of Ukraine to investigate one of his main democratic rivals, former Vice President Joe Biden. The second is that he obstructed Congress by trying to stop officials giving evidence and withholding documents. There are almost no rules for a trail like this and immigrants and Republicans are completely at odds over whether to call witnesses at all. That all means this trail could last anything from 2- six weeks. Democrats want to hear from John Bolton, who reportedly likened the pressure being put on Ukraine to a drug deal. But Republicans are threatening to retaliate, by insisting Joe Biden or his son appear too. In the coming days, Senate Republicans are going to face a choice. Will they take their cues from the White House and engage in a cover-up for President Trump? Or will they, in this most sacred of undertakings prescribed by the Constitution, vote for a fair trial with witnesses? The President continues to dismiss his impeachment as a hoax, instead focusing on his achievements. And what do I get out of it? Tell me? I'd get impeached! That's what they get out of it, by these radical left lunatics, I'd get impeached. But that's OK, the farmers are sticking with Trump. It would take a two-thirds majority to convict the President and remove him from office. That is extremely unlikely, nevertheless, these coming weeks will resonate for years to come. Let's brief you on some of the other stories making the news. New figures from the UN show that nearly half a billion people work less than they want to or not at all. The International Labour Organisation also forcasts that unemployment will rise by about two and a half million this year, due to a stagnating global economy. The agency believes this has profound and worrying implications for social cohesion. Malaysia has revealed it's sent back 150 shipping containers of illegally-imported plastic waste to the developed countries it came from. Richer countries have been sending plastic to Malaysia since 2018, when China banned most waste imports. But Malaysia's government has taken a stand, saying it doesn't want to be the world's garbage dump. Canadian lawyers representing the Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou at her extradition hearing have argued that the crimes the United States has accused her off would not be considered against the law in Canada. They say that Ms Meng should not be extradited to the US to face charges of fraud and violating American sanctions on Iran. More on that in Business Briefing. The head of Google has called for artificial intelligence to be regulated. Writing in the Financial Times, Sundar Pichai said it was \"too important not to\" impose regulation but argued for \"a sensible approach\". Last week it was revealed that the European Commission is considering a five-year ban on facial recognition. Priya Lakhani is the founder and CEO of Century Tech, she's with me now.

A resolution unveiled by Mitch McConnell, who leads the Republican majority in the Senate, could see a vote on the timetable as early as Thursday. Chuck Schumer, who leads the Democratic minority in the Senate, has called the proposals a cover-up and a national disgrace. So what can we expect to happen?</p><p> The BBC's Gary O'Donoghue reports from Washington. Will all senators now stand and remain standing, and raise their right-hand. Do you solemnly swear that in all things appertaining to the trail of the impeachment of Donald John Trump... Yes, these are 100 members of the United States Senate, but now they are also jurors and judges be they get to fix the rules of the trail and decide on guilt. we will be sitting there and chairs for about six hours a day starting at 1pm eastern time, six days a week, so this is going to be, I think, kind of a gruelling exercise but also one that will be public. The President faces two charges. The first is that he abused his power by pressuring the President of Ukraine to investigate one of his main democratic rivals, former Vice President Joe Biden. The second is that he obstructed Congress by trying to stop officials giving evidence and withholding documents. There are almost no rules for a trail like this and immigrants and Republicans are completely at odds over whether to call witnesses at all. That all means this trail could last anything from 2- six weeks. Democrats want to hear from John Bolton, who reportedly likened the pressure being put on Ukraine to a drug deal. But Republicans are threatening to retaliate, by insisting Joe Biden or his son appear too. In the coming days, Senate Republicans are going to face a choice. Will they take their cues from the White House and engage in a cover-up for President Trump? Or will they, in this most sacred of undertakings prescribed by the Constitution, vote for a fair trial with witnesses? The President continues to dismiss his impeachment as a hoax, instead focusing on his achievements. And what do I get out of it? Tell me? I'd get impeached! That's what they get out of it, by these radical left lunatics, I'd get impeached. But that's OK, the farmers are sticking with Trump. It would take a two-thirds majority to convict the President and remove him from office. That is extremely unlikely, nevertheless, these coming weeks will resonate for years to come. Let's brief you on some of the other stories making the news. New figures from the UN show that nearly half a billion people work less than they want to or not at all. The International Labour Organisation also forcasts that unemployment will rise by about two and a half million this year, due to a stagnating global economy. The agency believes this has profound and worrying implications for social cohesion. Malaysia has revealed it's sent back 150 shipping containers of illegally-imported plastic waste to the developed countries it came from. Richer countries have been sending plastic to Malaysia since 2018, when China banned most waste imports. But Malaysia's government has taken a stand, saying it doesn't want to be the world's garbage dump. Canadian lawyers representing the Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou at her extradition hearing have argued that the crimes the United States has accused her off would not be considered against the law in Canada. They say that Ms Meng should not be extradited to the US to face charges of fraud and violating American sanctions on Iran. More on that in Business Briefing. The head of Google has called for artificial intelligence to be regulated. Writing in the Financial Times, Sundar Pichai said it was \"too important not to\" impose regulation but argued for \"a sensible approach\". Last week it was revealed that the European Commission is considering a five-year ban on facial recognition. Priya Lakhani is the founder and CEO of Century Tech, she's with me now.

A resolution unveiled by Mitch McConnell, who leads the Republican majority in the Senate, could see a vote on the timetable as early as Thursday. Chuck Schumer, who leads the Democratic minority in the Senate, has called the proposals a cover-up and a national disgrace. So what can we expect to happen?</p><p> The BBC's Gary O'Donoghue reports from Washington. Will all senators now stand and remain standing, and raise their right-hand. Do you solemnly swear that in all things appertaining to the trail of the impeachment of Donald John Trump... Yes, these are 100 members of the United States Senate, but now they are also jurors and judges be they get to fix the rules of the trail and decide on guilt. we will be sitting there and chairs for about six hours a day starting at 1pm eastern time, six days a week, so this is going to be, I think, kind of a gruelling exercise but also one that will be public. The President faces two charges. The first is that he abused his power by pressuring the President of Ukraine to investigate one of his main democratic rivals, former Vice President Joe Biden. The second is that he obstructed Congress by trying to stop officials giving evidence and withholding documents. There are almost no rules for a trail like this and immigrants and Republicans are completely at odds over whether to call witnesses at all. That all means this trail could last anything from 2- six weeks. Democrats want to hear from John Bolton, who reportedly likened the pressure being put on Ukraine to a drug deal. But Republicans are threatening to retaliate, by insisting Joe Biden or his son appear too. In the coming days, Senate Republicans are going to face a choice. Will they take their cues from the White House and engage in a cover-up for President Trump? Or will they, in this most sacred of undertakings prescribed by the Constitution, vote for a fair trial with witnesses? The President continues to dismiss his impeachment as a hoax, instead focusing on his achievements. And what do I get out of it? Tell me? I'd get impeached! That's what they get out of it, by these radical left lunatics, I'd get impeached. But that's OK, the farmers are sticking with Trump. It would take a two-thirds majority to convict the President and remove him from office. That is extremely unlikely, nevertheless, these coming weeks will resonate for years to come.

There are some states in the US that have banned facial recognition and there is a general public perception that business technology safe unregulated? We have the story only a few weeks ago how some of them had been taken to these alleged training camps but actually been spotted on the streets and they used facial recognition technology. But we are talking about facial recognition, and is a bigger point here. The ability to use technology to identify someone to correlate data, and then to use machine learning... Actually, there is lots of technology we should look at. Being able to identify someone a distance using the heartbeat. Cameras are so good now that from a distance you can spot someone's fingerprint, broadcasting very specific codes where you can identify an individual through that particular code. If we ban facial recognition technology that is one step, and if they are regulating against it, actually you have got to look into the wider issue which is, all of these technologies, when data is being collected, Google is buying health data, the Fitbit for a reason. How using that technology to discriminate? On the other side of this is, the Microsoft President said this idea of regulation and banning facial recognition technology is taking a sledgehammer to a nut stopper he's talking about the fact that it is you really effectively with NGOs who are finding missing children and then reuniting them with their families stopping his talking about using technology and essentially learning more about it, but that comes with its risks.

In the coming days, Senate Republicans are going to face a choice. Will they take their cues from the White House and engage in a cover-up for President Trump? Or will they, in this most sacred of undertakings prescribed by the Constitution, vote for a fair trial with witnesses?</p><p> The President continues to dismiss his impeachment as a hoax, instead focusing on his achievements. And what do I get out of it? Tell me? I'd get impeached! That's what they get out of it, by these radical left lunatics, I'd get impeached. But that's OK, the farmers are sticking with Trump. It would take a two-thirds majority to convict the President and remove him from office. That is extremely unlikely, nevertheless, these coming weeks will resonate for years to come. Let's brief you on some of the other stories making the news. New figures from the UN show that nearly half a billion people work less than they want to or not at all. The International Labour Organisation also forcasts that unemployment will rise by about two and a half million this year, due to a stagnating global economy. The agency believes this has profound and worrying implications for social cohesion. Malaysia has revealed it's sent back 150 shipping containers of illegally-imported plastic waste to the developed countries it came from. Richer countries have been sending plastic to Malaysia since 2018, when China banned most waste imports. But Malaysia's government has taken a stand, saying it doesn't want to be the world's garbage dump. Canadian lawyers representing the Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou at her extradition hearing have argued that the crimes the United States has accused her off would not be considered against the law in Canada. They say that Ms Meng should not be extradited to the US to face charges of fraud and violating American sanctions on Iran. More on that in Business Briefing. The head of Google has called for artificial intelligence to be regulated. Writing in the Financial Times, Sundar Pichai said it was \"too important not to\" impose regulation but argued for \"a sensible approach\". Last week it was revealed that the European Commission is considering a five-year ban on facial recognition. Priya Lakhani is the founder and CEO of Century Tech, she's with me now. It seems that the head of a big tech company, trying to seize the initiative and suggest elation before regulation is imposed. There are some states in the US that have banned facial recognition and there is a general public perception that business technology safe unregulated? We have the story only a few weeks ago how some of them had been taken to these alleged training camps but actually been spotted on the streets and they used facial recognition technology. But we are talking about facial recognition, and is a bigger point here. The ability to use technology to identify someone to correlate data, and then to use machine learning... Actually, there is lots of technology we should look at. Being able to identify someone a distance using the heartbeat. Cameras are so good now that from a distance you can spot someone's fingerprint, broadcasting very specific codes where you can identify an individual through that particular code. If we ban facial recognition technology that is one step, and if they are regulating against it, actually you have got to look into the wider issue which is, all of these technologies, when data is being collected, Google is buying health data, the Fitbit for a reason. How using that technology to discriminate? On the other side of this is, the Microsoft President said this idea of regulation and banning facial recognition technology is taking a sledgehammer to a nut stopper he's talking about the fact that it is you really effectively with NGOs who are finding missing children and then reuniting them with their families stopping his talking about using technology and essentially learning more about it, but that comes with its risks.

In the coming days, Senate Republicans are going to face a choice. Will they take their cues from the White House and engage in a cover-up for President Trump? Or will they, in this most sacred of undertakings prescribed by the Constitution, vote for a fair trial with witnesses?</p><p> The President continues to dismiss his impeachment as a hoax, instead focusing on his achievements. And what do I get out of it? Tell me? I'd get impeached! That's what they get out of it, by these radical left lunatics, I'd get impeached. But that's OK, the farmers are sticking with Trump. It would take a two-thirds majority to convict the President and remove him from office. That is extremely unlikely, nevertheless, these coming weeks will resonate for years to come. Let's brief you on some of the other stories making the news. New figures from the UN show that nearly half a billion people work less than they want to or not at all. The International Labour Organisation also forcasts that unemployment will rise by about two and a half million this year, due to a stagnating global economy. The agency believes this has profound and worrying implications for social cohesion. Malaysia has revealed it's sent back 150 shipping containers of illegally-imported plastic waste to the developed countries it came from. Richer countries have been sending plastic to Malaysia since 2018, when China banned most waste imports. But Malaysia's government has taken a stand, saying it doesn't want to be the world's garbage dump. Canadian lawyers representing the Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou at her extradition hearing have argued that the crimes the United States has accused her off would not be considered against the law in Canada. They say that Ms Meng should not be extradited to the US to face charges of fraud and violating American sanctions on Iran. More on that in Business Briefing. The head of Google has called for artificial intelligence to be regulated. Writing in the Financial Times, Sundar Pichai said it was \"too important not to\" impose regulation but argued for \"a sensible approach\". Last week it was revealed that the European Commission is considering a five-year ban on facial recognition. Priya Lakhani is the founder and CEO of Century Tech, she's with me now. It seems that the head of a big tech company, trying to seize the initiative and suggest elation before regulation is imposed. There are some states in the US that have banned facial recognition and there is a general public perception that business technology safe unregulated? We have the story only a few weeks ago how some of them had been taken to these alleged training camps but actually been spotted on the streets and they used facial recognition technology. But we are talking about facial recognition, and is a bigger point here. The ability to use technology to identify someone to correlate data, and then to use machine learning... Actually, there is lots of technology we should look at. Being able to identify someone a distance using the heartbeat. Cameras are so good now that from a distance you can spot someone's fingerprint, broadcasting very specific codes where you can identify an individual through that particular code. If we ban facial recognition technology that is one step, and if they are regulating against it, actually you have got to look into the wider issue which is, all of these technologies, when data is being collected, Google is buying health data, the Fitbit for a reason. How using that technology to discriminate? On the other side of this is, the Microsoft President said this idea of regulation and banning facial recognition technology is taking a sledgehammer to a nut stopper he's talking about the fact that it is you really effectively with NGOs who are finding missing children and then reuniting them with their families stopping his talking about using technology and essentially learning more about it, but that comes with its risks. It is a huge issue for technology, we are always trying to keep up with the pace of change and we will have to see where it goes but he has come up saying what he is</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1SW-a46319a846c44f35843c6f7d1dd219f1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1SW2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y1H-FN71-JBH6-C0S5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400439</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"712\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 TVEyes, Inc.

The court aspect of the telecommunication is the most sensitive confidential information. So the UK government is trying to be responsive to the incredible pressure from the United States, so they are trying to put some measures in place that can be called risk mitigation. Even in the UK Huawei is considered high risk and is not included in the core infrastructure of the 5G network. </p><p>How was that an endorsement for Huawei? The United Kingdom, despite probably the greatest lobbying campaign in the history of the United States, less relative to the UK, despite that campaign, has decided to push back to the US and to allow the relationship, the 11 year relationship between Huawei and the UK to continue. That's not a giant victory. It's a small step forward. The kind of step that we hope will help demonstrate to the world that despite political pressure people can deal with that and people need to look and address real cyber security risk in a comprehensive manner. Interesting. The chief security officer of Huawei. Let us show you financial markets. The dollar has strengthened significantly on the latest economic news coming out of the United States. That has caused Japan to have a bit of a boost with a lovely week yen, which means its exports overseas are that much cheaper. That has helped markets in Japan. As you can see, elsewhere in Asia it is a mixed picture. That is your Business Briefing. Liverpool is the latest English city to declare that it wants to regulate its buses in a London-style system, in a bid for frequent services and cheaper fares. It's the latest sign that a shake-up of the way buses are managed in many parts of England is on the way, as our transport correspondent, Tom Burridge, reports. A shakeup for buses in Liverpool could be on the way. In England, buses outside of London are not regulated. That means bus companies decide which routes to run and they said fares. After a two-year study, the mayor of the Liverpool city region believes that should change. Well, where not in control of our own destiny, currently, as a transport authority and that's why we are looking at the powers in the 2017 act, the bus services act, to ensure that we can use the additional mayoral powers so that we can re- regulate our bus service by Steve Rotheram once a London star system, where buses are regulated. Transport for London, which reports to the mayor, decides the roots and sets the fares. And companies bid for contracts. Buses in London are frequent and cheap. But they are heavily subsidised by Transport for London. Greater Manchester is already on a similar journey to a regulated system like Liverpool. And the government backs other moves in other parts of England. But bus companies is a regulation isn't a silver bullet. More bus lanes, they say, is a greater priority, because congestion is often the biggest problem. Tom Burridge, BBC News. For more on that story, Breakfast is coming up at six o'clock with Sally Nugent and Charlie Stayt - they'll have all the day's news, business, and sport. This is The Briefing from BBC News. The latest headlines: Police in Germany say a man suspected of two mass shootings has been found dead at his home. Another Democratic debate in the US presidential race - and this time Michael Bloomberg joins the fray. Now it's time to look at the stories that are making the headlines in the media across the World. We begin with Google confirming reports first broken by Reuters that they'll move data on British customers outside of EU jurisdiction to the US, where they information will be left with less protection.

The court aspect of the telecommunication is the most sensitive confidential information. So the UK government is trying to be responsive to the incredible pressure from the United States, so they are trying to put some measures in place that can be called risk mitigation. Even in the UK Huawei is considered high risk and is not included in the core infrastructure of the 5G network. </p><p>How was that an endorsement for Huawei? The United Kingdom, despite probably the greatest lobbying campaign in the history of the United States, less relative to the UK, despite that campaign, has decided to push back to the US and to allow the relationship, the 11 year relationship between Huawei and the UK to continue. That's not a giant victory. It's a small step forward. The kind of step that we hope will help demonstrate to the world that despite political pressure people can deal with that and people need to look and address real cyber security risk in a comprehensive manner. Interesting. The chief security officer of Huawei. Let us show you financial markets. The dollar has strengthened significantly on the latest economic news coming out of the United States. That has caused Japan to have a bit of a boost with a lovely week yen, which means its exports overseas are that much cheaper. That has helped markets in Japan. As you can see, elsewhere in Asia it is a mixed picture. That is your Business Briefing. Liverpool is the latest English city to declare that it wants to regulate its buses in a London-style system, in a bid for frequent services and cheaper fares. It's the latest sign that a shake-up of the way buses are managed in many parts of England is on the way, as our transport correspondent, Tom Burridge, reports. A shakeup for buses in Liverpool could be on the way. In England, buses outside of London are not regulated. That means bus companies decide which routes to run and they said fares. After a two-year study, the mayor of the Liverpool city region believes that should change. Well, where not in control of our own destiny, currently, as a transport authority and that's why we are looking at the powers in the 2017 act, the bus services act, to ensure that we can use the additional mayoral powers so that we can re- regulate our bus service by Steve Rotheram once a London star system, where buses are regulated. Transport for London, which reports to the mayor, decides the roots and sets the fares. And companies bid for contracts. Buses in London are frequent and cheap. But they are heavily subsidised by Transport for London. Greater Manchester is already on a similar journey to a regulated system like Liverpool. And the government backs other moves in other parts of England. But bus companies is a regulation isn't a silver bullet. More bus lanes, they say, is a greater priority, because congestion is often the biggest problem. Tom Burridge, BBC News. For more on that story, Breakfast is coming up at six o'clock with Sally Nugent and Charlie Stayt - they'll have all the day's news, business, and sport. This is The Briefing from BBC News. The latest headlines: Police in Germany say a man suspected of two mass shootings has been found dead at his home. Another Democratic debate in the US presidential race - and this time Michael Bloomberg joins the fray. Now it's time to look at the stories that are making the headlines in the media across the World. We begin with Google confirming reports first broken by Reuters that they'll move data on British customers outside of EU jurisdiction to the US, where they information will be left with less protection. Another data story is on the front page of the Financial Times - the EU plans to force big tech companies to share data with smaller rivals to break the near monolopy held by the likes of Google and Amazon. The reality check section of the BBC News website looks at the UK's stricter immigration rules - in particular, can the shortfall in workers really be made up by British people not currently in work?</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1WM-18760bb2e9d74d12b71683107cfa2996</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1WM2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y7X-K3Y1-DY08-32VY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402028</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"693\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 TVEyes, Inc.

The United Kingdom, despite probably the greatest lobbying campaign in the history of the United States, less relative to the UK, despite that campaign, has decided to push back to the US and to allow the relationship, the 11 year relationship between Huawei and the UK to continue. That's not a giant victory. It's a small step forward. The kind of step that we hope will help demonstrate to the world that despite political pressure people can deal with that and people need to look and address real cyber security risk in a comprehensive manner. Interesting. The chief security officer of Huawei. Let us show you financial markets. The dollar has strengthened significantly on the latest economic news coming out of the United States. That has caused Japan to have a bit of a boost with a lovely week yen, which means its exports overseas are that much cheaper. That has helped markets in Japan. As you can see, elsewhere in Asia it is a mixed picture. That is your Business Briefing. Liverpool is the latest English city to declare that it wants to regulate its buses in a London-style system, in a bid for frequent services and cheaper fares. It's the latest sign that a shake-up of the way buses are managed in many parts of England is on the way, as our transport correspondent, Tom Burridge, reports. A shakeup for buses in Liverpool could be on the way. In England, buses outside of London are not regulated. That means bus companies decide which routes to run and they said fares. After a two-year study, the mayor of the Liverpool city region believes that should change. Well, where not in control of our own destiny, currently, as a transport authority and that's why we are looking at the powers in the 2017 act, the bus services act, to ensure that we can use the additional mayoral powers so that we can re- regulate our bus service by Steve Rotheram once a London star system, where buses are regulated. Transport for London, which reports to the mayor, decides the roots and sets the fares. And companies bid for contracts. Buses in London are frequent and cheap. But they are heavily subsidised by Transport for London. Greater Manchester is already on a similar journey to a regulated system like Liverpool. And the government backs other moves in other parts of England. But bus companies is a regulation isn't a silver bullet. More bus lanes, they say, is a greater priority, because congestion is often the biggest problem. Tom Burridge, BBC News. For more on that story, Breakfast is coming up at six o'clock with Sally Nugent and Charlie Stayt - they'll have all the day's news, business, and sport. This is The Briefing from BBC News. The latest headlines: Police in Germany say a man suspected of two mass shootings has been found dead at his home. Another Democratic debate in the US presidential race - and this time Michael Bloomberg joins the fray. Now it's time to look at the stories that are making the headlines in the media across the World. We begin with Google confirming reports first broken by Reuters that they'll move data on British customers outside of EU jurisdiction to the US, where they information will be left with less protection. Another data story is on the front page of the Financial Times - the EU plans to force big tech companies to share data with smaller rivals to break the near monolopy held by the likes of Google and Amazon.
