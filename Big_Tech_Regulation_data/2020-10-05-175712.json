And that is why we voted to leave the European Union nearly three years ago.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I voted to leave because I believe the EU is simply incompatible with national democracy. Free trade across borders creates prosperity, but the EU is a political project that resembles not a single market but an empire.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">National democracy is the only tried and tested way to govern fairly. It allows us to run the economy in our national interest, fund services and show solidarity with one another, by creating good, well-paid jobs for everyone, taxing people fairly and providing welfare for those who need it.</p><p>The EU cannot do these things. Just ask the young unemployed workers of Spain. Or almost anybody in Greece. Or the people of places such as Boston, Lincs, who experienced their communities change almost overnight thanks to the unlimited free movement of people.</p><p>And just ask any minister or diplomat whether the EU is capable of heeding public concern and changing direction. Or save yourself the time and listen to last week's grandstanding by the French President, Emmanuel Macron.</p><p>Out of the EU, free to govern ourselves, we can take back control. We can free ourselves from protectionist EU regulations, develop our own regional development funds and introduce free ports and enterprise zones to help boost the regional economy.</p><p>We can cut energy costs, back local businesses in public procurement, and reduce NHS commissioning costs. We can regulate big tech and cut VAT bills on everything from gas bills to tampons.</p><p>We can negotiate our own trade deals, control immigration and protect ourselves from terrorism unhindered by idiotic rulings by the European Court of Justice.</p><p>Right now, this optimistic vision for life after Brexit seems a long way away. And there is a real danger we will never see it at all.</p><p>The Government's Withdrawal Agreement is deeply flawed. It would mean, if we cannot agree our longterm future relationship with Europe, we end up in the dreaded \"backstop\", locking us into the EU's customs union and tying us to countless EU laws.</p><p>The EU says it dislikes the backstop as much as we do.</p><p>And it is true Brussels does not want it to be permanent.</p><p>But they are also adamant - whatever new small print that might be agreed at the last moment - that the EU must be able to veto our exit from the backstop.</p><p>Once we are in it, there will be only one way for Britain to get out again. And that is if we sign up to a permanent customs union and even more European laws.</p><p>Sabine Weyand, one of the EU's negotiators, boasts that the Withdrawal Agreement, \"requires the customs union as the basis of the future relationship\".</p><p>Thanks to the agreement, she says, \"the EU will retain all the controls\" over Britain.</p><p>Surely this means Eurosceptic MPs who, like me, voted for Brexit, believe passionately in Britain's independence, and hate the Withdrawal Agreement, should vote against it tonight? If only life was so simple.</p><p>If MPs reject Theresa May's deal, the House of Commons will certainly vote tomorrow to prevent a No Deal departure and on Thursday to delay Brexit instead. The EU says it will agree a delay, but we do not know how long we might have to wait to leave.</p><p>Some Leave supporters say this is fine, and we can leave without a deal at the end of the delay. The EU, they reason, will not keep granting extensions, and without an agreement in place, Britain can simply get out.</p><p>But the EU might well grant further extensions. After all, they have the likes of Tony Blair telling them Brexit can still be stopped. And during the delay Remainers in Parliament will mount new challenges to Brexit.</p><p>Some are working to bring about a Norway-style relationship, in which Britain would follow almost all EU rules and laws, including on free movement, as well as a customs union.</p><p>Others are trying to stop Brexit altogether through a second referendum.</p><p>And if they get their way, do not expect either the rules or the choice put to the people to be fair. They want to rig a second referendum in favour of staying in.</p><p>The Leavers - a minority in Parliament, remember - have nowhere to go.</p><p>Those who want to leave without a deal will be thwarted by the majority of MPs who are against it.</p><p>Those who want a different deal to the Withdrawal Agreement have been timed out by the Prime Minister.</p><p>They therefore face an awful choice. Vote against Theresa May's deal, and risk certain death with a Norwaystyle relationship or, worse, a rigged second referendum.</p><p>Or back the deal, risking only probable death as the backstop leads Britain to an eventual customs union.</p><p>Leave supporters in Parliament are understandably angry about the situation they find themselves in. Not only is the choice they are being forced to make unpalatable, it is about Brexit: The cause to which many of them have dedicated their careers.</p><p>They feel conned by a Prime Minister, a Cabinet and a Parliament they suspect never believed in their cause.</p><p>With a House of Commons divided along party lines and between a minority of Leavers and a majority of Remainers, leaving the EU was never going to be easy.</p><p>David Cameron knew this when he resigned in 2016, saying he did not want to stay on and do \"the hard s**t\".</p><p>But after so many missteps, so much lost trust, and swathes of her party feeling betrayed, Theresa May will soon face a day of reckoning with her MPs.</p><p>Before then, however, there is tonight's vote.</p><p>Brexit supporters hate this deal, and so do I. But as grotesquely flawed as it is, MPs who want to see Brexit through should vote in its favour.</p><p>In a choice between certain death and probable death, it is better to stay alive.</p><p>Nick Timothy is a former chief of staff to the Prime Minister.</p><p>Nowhere to go</p><p>Day of reckoning</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>SLEIGHT OF HANDS \u2026 the May deal shown off by Eurocrats at its launch last NovemberPENSIVE \u2026 May in Brussels last night</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THESUN-147261723</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THESUN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VMB-VGY1-JCBW-N1S6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">234674</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"956\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 NEWS GROUP NEWSPAPERS LTD All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Sun (England)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"31984\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 12, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>National Edition</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DKY8</classCode><className>BREXIT</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000949</classCode><className>INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC ORGANIZATIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001346</classCode><className>POLITICS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DL5Q</classCode><className>TYPES OF GOVERNMENT</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DH0Q</classCode><className>AGREEMENTS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009PXO</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION LAW</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000665</classCode><className>EXCISE &amp;

The media director at Danish music rights body Koda had been bargaining with Google's ubiquitous YouTube video-sharing platform about the amount of money local artists should be paid for their work being played on the site, when the tech giant flexed its muscles.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Google and Koda were part of a broader negotiation to replace individual country agreements in Denmark, Finland and Norway with a Nordic agreement, but when it came to extending an existing deal for Denmark, Google said it would only accept a price almost 70 per cent lower than before.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">When Koda rejected its offer and expected to haggle, Google simply pressed the nuclear button and banned Danish music from being used on YouTube at all.</p><p>\"We were deeply puzzled by Google's unwillingness to make a temporary contract extension on existing terms, until a new deal was finalised - as is normally the case during similar negotiations,\" Struve tells AFR Weekend.</p><p>It is a hardball big-tech tactic that is now very familiar to Australians as the country warms to its role as an unlikely world leader in attempting to keep a check on the runaway market power of Google and Facebook.</p><p>This week the social media giant joined the search giant in threatening extreme repercussions and the removal of services if it is forced to negotiate revenue sharing with local media companies, unless this happens on its own terms.</p><p>Google had reacted aggressively a week earlier to draft Australian Competition and Consumer Commission legislation that could see it paying millions to publishers for the use of their content.</p><p>Rather than soberly debating the flaws in the ACCC plans, it bombarded users of its various platforms such as Google Search and YouTube with messages saying the services they love were being endangered by unfair government reforms.</p><p>Google is now under greater pressure to negotiate for flexible payments with Australian news publishers after the ACCC signed an international co-operation agreement with the US Federal Trade Commission - just hours before news of an impending US antitrust case emerged on Friday.</p><p>Facebook, meanwhile, this week threatened to ban its Australian users from using all news content from recognised sources, despite being in the midst of a society-shaping fight against purveyors of fake news, amid a pandemic.</p><p>It was a clear signal that, just as in the case of plain packaging for cigarettes, Australia has global corporate giants running scared of a domino effect in global legislation. Facebook and Google would rather hurt local operations and users than risk that.</p><p>\"This move looks like it is more of a European play than an Australian one,\" says Rob Nicholls, University of NSW associate professor of competition law, regulations and policy.</p><p>In the European Union, amid similar lobbying from media companies, a new copyright harmonisation directive was passed last year, meaning publishers are entitled to seek payment from online platforms for snippets of news stories.</p><p>When France became the first country to enact the plan, Google refused to strike deals with publishers and changed its search results to only display headlines instead. It has since been sent back to the negotiating table by competition regulators, with the warning that a failure of negotiations would be considered an abuse of market power by the platforms.</p><p>The EU rules stretch beyond news stories to the use of video and music content across YouTube and Facebook. Nicholls says the companies fear other EU countries will be emboldened to start implementing these new rules if the new Australian laws gain traction.</p><p>\"If Facebook threatens to exit in Australia, the country with the 14th largest GDP, it is showing that it will do the same in each of the EU countries that follows the path of France,\" he says.</p><p>\"In Spain in 2014, Google stopped indexing news in response to an obligation to pay ... Facebook is playing a high-stakes lobbying and regulatory game, where consumers get a poor outcome either way.</p><p>\"By playing hardball in Australia, Facebook is sending a message to European Union jurisdictions where the advertising revenue is much, much higher.\"</p><p>Nicholls says the risk Australia faces in setting a new global benchmark is that it is such a small market that the tech platforms can afford to walk away rather than sign up.</p><p>But can Australian users expect a poorer quality experience on Google and Facebook if they lop off the functions that would attract charges under the ACCC code? Both companies claim that will not happen.</p><p>Facebook believes news content is readily interchangeable with other forms of content. It really does not care whether users are engaging with a news article or a video of cute animals, and says most users do not care either. But it also claims that it sent 2.3 billion clicks from Facebook's News Feed back to Australian news websites in the first five months of this year, suggesting many Australian consumers value that part of the service, and would miss it.</p><p>Despite employing both Agence France-Presse and Australian Associated Press in fact-checking roles, Facebook will also face accusations that a ban on reputable news sources would be hugely detrimental to its ongoing fight against fake news.</p><p>Google's Australia and New Zealand boss Melanie Silva has also played down the importance of news content to its Australian users, telling The Australian Financial Review back in May that this is a relatively minor part of the overall Google experience.</p><p>\"Users come to Google for many things, whether it's how-to videos, recipes, sport, weather, outfit ideas, or home insurance. News is a very small part of this content, and represents only a tiny number of queries,\" Silva says.</p><p>\"In the last year, news-related queries accounted for just over 1 per cent of total queries on Google Search in Australia.\"</p><p>In Denmark, where the threat of cutting off services over payments has been followed through, Struve says consumers and artists are feeling the negative effects.</p><p>After refusing during negotiations to accept a payment drop of 70 per cent, he received a response that demonstrated the consequences of pushing for anything more than the dominant platform was prepared to concede.</p><p>\"Google is very much driven by an 'our way or the highway' strategy, which we have seen very concretely in the current conflict,\" Struve laments.</p><p>\"We can only interpret its demand for such a drastic temporary price reduction as an attempt to put a price pressure on the joint Nordic agreement [which remains unsettled].</p><p>\"Almost 70 per cent of the Danish population streams music via YouTube, and 29 per cent of all the time Danes spend streaming music is spent on YouTube. So it is clear that Google's takedown is a major intervention, both for those who deliver the content and for those who use it.\"</p><p>With that in mind, it is not surprising that Australia's political leaders have come out strongly to make sure the public understands the size of the opponents their legislation is targeting. \"We don't respond to coercion or heavy-handed threats, wherever they come from,\" Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said after Facebook announced the possibility of blocking news content.</p><p>\"We're committed to these reforms, and we won't be bullied, no matter how big the international company is.\"</p><p>The dispute with Facebook and Google about advertising revenue sharing is just one facet of some significant big-tech battles being spearheaded in Australia by ACCC chairman Rod Sims.</p><p>The regulator is also investigating Google's acquisition of fitness band maker Fitbit, over concerns about its access to users' health data, and it is suing it over opaque user data tracking practices in its Android mobile operating system.</p><p>In a case with great relevance to global antitrust movements, the ACCC is also still promising to complete an investigation into the accusation that Google deliberately killed off a highly valued Australian advertising technology company, Unlockd, by arbitrarily banning its apps from its app store and advertising exchanges.</p><p>Facebook, meanwhile, also faces a separate ACCC probe into its recent $US400 million ($550 million) acquisition of online GIF repository Giphy, with concerns it could be used to help muscle out rivals to its market-cornering messaging products across Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp.</p><p>Jason Kint, the US-based CEO of Digital Content Next, a trade group representing digital publishers, believes Australia is making a significant contribution to global efforts to reduce the negative societal impacts of big-tech platforms' dominance.</p><p>He says critics of aspects of the ACCC draft code of conduct - who believe it to be a shakedown on behalf of media players - are ignoring its genesis in a broader and \"robust\" antitrust investigation.</p><p>\"When Google has its back against the wall, we've seen it get particularly aggressive in its lobbying tactics - but normally it happens behind the scenes, often through proxies. This, however, is both a public appeal and is beyond aggressive, particularly the use of its search monopoly to drive the public to its advocacy,\" Kint says.</p><p>\"[Critics of the ACCC legislation] seem to miss the significant antitrust investigation finding the imbalance in the market that underpins the drafting of the code. They use tired old arguments around the value of Google's traffic, while ignoring Google's monopoly position in search. If Google didn't exist, another search engine would be sending that same traffic.\"</p><p>While Google's lobbyists have tried to suggest that Australia faces a diplomatic rebuke from the US if it doesn't cool its aggressive pursuit of two of the country's biggest companies, US politicians have lately shown a bipartisan appetite for cracking down on the dominant platforms.</p><p>In July Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg, Amazon's Jeff Bezos, Google's Sundar Pichai and Apple's Tim Cook were subjected to an unprecedented six-hour grilling by the House judiciary committee's antitrust subcommittee, and US authorities now appear keen to offer support to smaller countries that take up the fight.</p><p>On Thursday, the US Federal Trade Commission moved to offer strength in numbers to Australia and others by signing a multilateral mutual assistance and co-operation framework with competition authorities in Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the United Kingdom.</p><p>Rather than all jurisdictions operating separately, the new framework aims to strengthen co-operation and provides the basis for further agreements that would permit the sharing of confidential information and the use of compulsory processes to aid each other's antitrust investigations.</p><p>\"This framework represents a new benchmark in cross-border antitrust co-operation ... It seeks to pave the way for better access to information and investigative assistance from the FTC's counterparts, while ensuring strong confidentiality safeguards,\" FTC chairman Joseph Simons said in a statement.</p><p>Having previously said that he has an appetite for further cases and inquiries into the negative impacts of big-tech dominance, the ACCC's Sims is optimistic that the new alliance with the FTC will help Australia to continue punching above its weight, and to land more meaningful blows.</p><p>\"We expect this co-operation will particularly benefit our existing and future investigations of digital platforms, which are being closely watched by many agencies globally,\" Sims says.P</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFREVW-doc7c6igo02qqu1fb24e3qy</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFREVW2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60SN-72T1-F0J6-J020-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">390780</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1954\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

Most significant, the proposal would require California to establish a data protection agency with the power to enforce the law and issue new regulations.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The group\u2019s leader said he wants to amend the law through a ballot initiative next year. In order to do so, the group will need to first collect the valid signatures of more than 620,000 registered voters in California.</p><p>\u201cPeople are waking up to the fact that they\u2019ve lost control of their information and are trying to take that control back,\u201d said Alastair Mactaggart, the founder and board chair of Californians for Consumer Privacy.</p><p>The new privacy effort is likely to further inflame a debate over who should regulate the vast stores of personal details that tech giants have amassed on billions of people. The law passed last year, the <url normalizedValue=\"http://cal-access.sos.ca.gov/Campaign/Committees/Detail.aspx?id=1400849&amp;amp;session=2017\">California Consumer Privacy Act</url>, will give consumers the right to see what personal information companies have compiled on them, delete that data and stop companies from selling it. It is scheduled to take effect next year.</p><p>But many tech companies and trade associations <url normalizedValue=\"http://cal-access.sos.ca.gov/Campaign/Committees/Detail.aspx?id=1400849&amp;amp;session=2017\">have urged Congress to pass weaker</url> federal privacy legislation that would overrule state laws. Trade associations have argued that it is too onerous for companies to comply with dozens of different state privacy laws and that American consumers should all have the same protections.</p><p>\u201cInternet companies stand ready with the broader business community to support unified, national privacy legislation,\u201d Michael Beckerman, chief executive of the Internet Association, said last week i<url normalizedValue=\"http://cal-access.sos.ca.gov/Campaign/Committees/Detail.aspx?id=1400849&amp;amp;session=2017\">n a statement</url>. The group\u2019s       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://cal-access.sos.ca.gov/Campaign/Committees/Detail.aspx?id=1400849&amp;amp;session=2017\">members include Amazon</url>, Facebook, Google, Microsoft and Uber.</p><p>Mr. Mactaggart, a real estate developer, started Californians for Consumer Privacy to push for a comprehensive state privacy law. He and two colleagues \u2014 Rick Arney, a financial industry executive, and Mary Stone Ross, a lawyer who had worked for the Central Intelligence Agency \u2014 drafted a consumer privacy bill and introduced it as a ballot initiative. Ashkan Soltani, a privacy expert, worked on technical parts of the bill.</p><p>More than 629,000 Californians signed petitions, qualifying the privacy bill for the ballot. But because it is more difficult to change a law passed through the ballot initiative process than one passed by lawmakers, the California Legislature quickly enacted a version of the ballot bill.</p><p>Many tech companies and trade groups have been working to defang the California Consumer Privacy Act ever since. The statute is believed to be the most comprehensive state consumer privacy law in the United States.</p><p>But after a recent spate of data-mining failures at Facebook and other tech giants, Mr. Mactaggart argues that Californians need stronger rights to control the spread and use of their personal information.</p><p>He plans to file a new ballot initiative on Wednesday. Among other things, it would give Californians the right to opt out of having sensitive details \u2014 like their race, ethnicity, precise location, health and financial data \u2014 used in advertising or marketing.</p><p>It would also require companies that use algorithms to automatically make decisions about insurance and lending to explain their system\u2019s reasoning to consumers.</p><p>California has long led the nation on consumer privacy. It was the first state to require companies to report data breaches, and to require companies to allow minors to delete their posts, tweets, photos and other material. In 1972, Californians voted to amend the state\u2019s Constitution to add privacy to its list of inalienable rights like freedom of speech and freedom of religion.</p><p>Mr. Mactaggart said he hoped that California would also become the first state to establish an independent data privacy regulator.</p><p>\u201cAn independent watchdog whose mission is to protect consumer privacy should ensure that businesses and consumers are well-informed about their rights and obligations,\u201d a draft of the proposed privacy ballot initiative says, \u201cand should vigorously enforce the law against businesses that violate consumers\u2019 privacy rights.\u201d</p><p>But it wouldn\u2019t be the first dedicated state consumer privacy office. In the early 2000s, California had a state agency, called the California Office of Privacy Protection. Now defunct, it developed industry standards for consumer data privacy and security practices.

In less than two generations, an autarky closed to the outside world has managed to insert itself into every facet of modern life. From the simplest manufactured goods to sophisticated hardware, from asphalt roads to nuclear power stations, Chinese companies, predominantly state-owned, have disrupted the global production and investment chain.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The history of economic development, from the invention of the wheel to the fourth industrial revolution, is a story of disruption pushing the boundaries of productivity growth and China's economic rise since its opening up in 1978 is no different. Such change has been welcome over the past few decades. China created jobs and wealth, while the rest of the world enjoyed a wider choice of products and services at lower prices.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Yet, all good things must come to an end. As the People's Republic reaches its 70th birthday, it is no longer seen as a benign force. Challenges to China's economic model are increasing, as witnessed by the trade and technology disputes between the Beijing and Washington.</p><p>What receives less coverage in the western press is how powerful forces unleashed by China's economic growth are disrupting its domestic economy. To present and future Chinese leaders, managing economic change while maintaining social stability is much more important than figuring out how to respond to the social media rumblings of a sitting US president.</p><p>For an economy as much as an individual, too much of a good thing can be detrimental. In the run-up to the global financial crisis, China's economy, and more importantly, Chinese jobs, depended on exports.</p><p>Facing a collapse in international demand and a sluggish domestic labour market, China decided to switch gears in early 2009 and launched an unprecedented debt-fuelled investment spree.</p><p>The fabled 'four trillion yuan stimulus', which amounted to a liquidity injection worth more than 12 per cent ofChina's 2008 gross domestic product, was credited with stabilizing the global economy. In comparison, the 'Obama stimulus' of 2009 in the United States, at just under $800 billion, amounted to only about 5.5 per cent of US GDP for 2008.</p><p>So began China's addiction to debt, a situation the country's financial regulators are finally starting to get to grips with, but only after realizing that going cold turkey during the latter stages of a global economic cycle is not a healthy condition either.</p><p>It is undeniable that ending its debt addiction has been painfully disruptive to the Chinese economy. While the trade dispute with the US dominated headlines over the past 18 months, growth strains were already showing in the first half of 2018.</p><p>UBS Investment Bank economists noted that 'regulatory and fiscal tightening' were the main reasons for decline in the growth rate. Firstly, there was a tightening of local government debt control which resulted in weaker infrastructure investment. Secondly, rules on shadow banking - one ofthe biggest sources ofgrowth in the use of borrowed money - were tightened, leading to higher borrowing costs, a decline in shadow credit, weaker bond issuance and higher defaults. As a result, towards the end of 2018 the overall share of credit in GDP had stabilized to between 20-25 per cent, half the levels seen a decade before.</p><p>Financial markets were torn between commending the attempt to contain unsustainable investment growth and worrying about the slowdown in the economy, especially in the housing market.</p><p>A slowdown in housing wealth is expected to hit consumption growth, and this has been corroborated by high-level data - consumption growth fell to 7.4 per cent year-on-year in 2018, from 7.5 per cent in 2017, and is expected to fall below 7.0 per cent in 2019. Nowhere was this felt more than in the car industry: monthly sales fell from near 30 per cent year-on-year growth in mid-2016 to outright contraction starting in July 2018, and we have not seen a positive number since.</p><p>The days of credit-fuelled investment growth are over, but before we ring alarm bells it is important to stress that much of this is by design.</p><p>Consumption is still growing faster than the overall growth rate of the economy, while the opposite is true for investment growth. As long as there is material divergence between the two, the Chinese economy is rebalancing in the right way.</p><p>However, as household consumption begins to power the economy, thereby creating jobs in the services rather than manufacturing sector, then government and companies, both state and private, need to adapt to changing patterns of behaviour. In this respect, as China opens up, one of the biggest disruptive forces is when households don't find the level of goods and services up to scratch and vote with their feet by looking abroad for answers.</p><p>Again, examining the car market, while total sales shrank by 6 per cent in China in 2018, buried in the fine print is the fact that domestic brands bore the brunt of the fall in demand. Without differentiating too much between imported cars versus domestically produced foreign-branded cars, lower prices for local names have not boosted demand. Even during a time ofconstrained household finances, it appears that Chinese consumers are willing to put a premium on quality, either perceived or real. This is a lesson that domestic firms badly need to learn, especially in industries that are less protected or where there is a weaker domestic footprint.</p><p>The race is now on for market dominance in electric or other fuel-efficient vehicles, where arguably there is no dominant global player. China is investing heavily in this industry and companies such as BYD and CATL have been categorized as disruptors in the field. Yet, with Tesla close to completing its first factory in China and foreign competitors' efforts coming to fruition, there is every chance that Chinese consumers will again turn away from Chinese brands, even if their prices are more competitive. Capital ultimately flows overseas, which hurts the country's balance of payments and affects the currency, and that is before we even start talking about perpetual worries of capital flight.</p><p>Like in many European countries, government subsidies and targeted regulation have incentivized investment in electric vehicles, but if Chinese brands fall behind in this race, questions will need to be asked whether a heavy state presence in this sector ultimately served as a hindrance. This brings us to the final, and perhaps, most significant disruptive risk, the rise of Chinese tech.</p><p>In the fourth quarter of 2006, one Chinese company made it on to the Financial Times' list ofthe world's most valuable publicly-traded companies - the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China. Within the top 10 were four energy companies, three banks and only one tech company. By the end of 2018, there was one bank left, while seven were tech companies, two being Chinese.</p><p>Two decades ago, Tencent was only known for its chat engine while Jack Ma was starting Alibaba in his flat. At the beginning of 2018 the two companies were worth a combined $1 trillion and are the pride of China. State involvement in their rise was minimal. The way these two companies have disrupted the global tech scene, not to mention Chinese society, is well documented. Beijing can, with justification, point to the tech hubs of Shenzhen and Hangzhou as examples of how privately driven tech innovation and an authoritarian system can co-exist.</p><p>Companies can generally innovate independently as long as the state retains a legal right to intervene when technology poses a threat to the system. However, the disruption to an established economic system is becoming hard to ignore.</p><p>Take fintech, for example. The proliferation of online banking has led to a 21 per cent decline in bricks-and-mortar bank branches across Europe over the past decade. We can judge for ourselves the disruption to the labour market in what is generally considered a white-collar industry. The same is happening in China but on a much bigger scale, as even street beggars now accept mobile payments by having a large QR code available. If large sections of society bypass the formal banking system entirely, the risk ofbranch closures is clear. The difference with Europe is that China is still a developing country and the government's legitimacy, especially in urban areas, relies on the creation of white-collar jobs.</p><p>If they are being destroyed faster than they can be replaced, through automation and artificial intelligence, and without a proper welfare system to support the population, the risk of social instability is clear. And that is before we start looking at conditions in rural areas where the labour force is largely unskilled and at even greater risk.</p><p>The bottom line is that while technology has done wonders for the Chinese people over the past decade, it may now have become too disruptive for its own good. Will Beijing ever ask the big tech companies to 'slow down'? Or could the answer lie in further liberalization which lets the market create the requisite jobs? Would the country actively target lower productivity growth to limit the disruption, or opt for highly progressive taxation?</p><p>China's economy has managed to defy expectations so consistently that whenever there is a wobble, the market retains confidence that, through monetary and fiscal stimulus coupled with administrative measures, it can find a way to muddle through.</p><p>There comes a point, however, when muddling through is no longer enough. Muddling through does not generate enough growth to create new jobs to offset domestically generated disruption, it does not create the wealth effect to encourage households to spend, it does not entice China's ambitious citizens to keep their capital or even themselves in the country.</p><p>After decades ofcreating the most disruptive economic growth model the world has ever seen, Beijing is finding the model selfdisruptive, though not yet self-destructive. There will be much on Xi Jinping's mind as he greets the crowds in Tiananmen Square on October 1. Hopefully, at the forefront will be the question: Do we have jobs for all the people, and if not, how do we create them?</p><p>Geoffrey Yu is Head of UK Investment Office at UBS Wealth Management</p><p>'Two decades ago, Tencent was only known for its chat engine and Jack Ma was starting Alibaba in his flat.

''We couldn't even see his eyes.''</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  Investigating  the accident, inspectors found a series of labor and safety violations at the factory, Yiuwah Stationery, which supplies cards, gift boxes and other paper goods to Disney, the British supermarket chain Tesco and other companies.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  The investigators also discovered that Mr. Liu was hired illegally, at 15, below the legal age limit here. Disney has called the situation at the factory ''unacceptable.'' </p><p>  In a statement issued Wednesday, Disney said it had instructed its vendors and licensees to ''cease new orders of any Disney-branded products in the Yiuwah factory'' until conditions were improved.</p><p>  A spokesman for Tesco said that company was also working to improve conditions at the factory.</p><p>  While the accident at the Yiuwah factory was particularly tragic, working conditions elsewhere are worsening.  A year and a half after a landmark labor law took effect in China, experts say conditions have actually deteriorated in southern China's export-oriented factories, which produce many of America's less expensive retail goods.</p><p>  With China's exports reeling and unemployment rising because of the global slowdown, there is growing evidence that factories are ignoring or evading the new  law, and that the government is reluctant to enforce it. </p><p>  Government critics say authorities fear that a crackdown on violators could lead to mass layoffs and even social unrest.</p><p>  ''The economic downturn has given regulators the perfect excuse to ignore the law,'' says Zhang Zhiru, director of the Shenzhen Chunfeng Labor Dispute Service, a nonprofit group that supports workers. ''I don't see any fundamental change.''</p><p>  But workers are fighting back. Earlier this month, the government said Chinese courts were trying to cope with a soaring number of labor disputes, apparently from workers emboldened by the promise of the new contract labor law. </p><p>  The number of labor disputes in China doubled to 693,000 in 2008, the first year the law was in effect, and are rising sharply this year, the government says. </p><p>  The law requires that all employees have a written contract that complies with minimum wage and safety requirements. It also strengthens the monopoly state-run labor union and makes it more difficult for companies to use temporary workers or to dismiss employees.</p><p>  Western companies that outsource to China say they have stepped up their monitoring of supplier factories to ensure they comply with the law. But they acknowledge that ensuring compliance is challenging in China. </p><p>  A spokesman for the local Dongguan government here said that they were strictly enforcing the new law. But in interviews, some factory owners acknowledged that they were seeking ways to get around it, complaining that the law's regulations were too costly and cumbersome.</p><p>  Lawyers say some local governments have issued their own competing rules or interpretations of the law that weaken it, to aid factory owners.</p><p>  ''Many local governments want to develop their own versions of the law,'' says Liu Cheng, a professor of law at Shanghai Normal University and one of the law's authors.</p><p>  China's huge and complicated labor market has long thrived on cheap labor and lax regulation. In recent years, labor rights advocates say they have seen incremental gains for workers. But they say there are growing signs of labor abuse. They point to a string of recent cases, like one several weeks ago in which  police in southern China's Anhui province said they had freed 30 mentally handicapped workers from what they called ''slave conditions'' in a brick kiln.</p><p>  On the same day, police said a fire in the dormitory of an illegal factory in southern Guangdong province killed 13 female workers and seriously injured four others.</p><p>  A few weeks earlier, 7,000 workers went on strike at a factory that supplies some of the world's biggest technology companies, saying they were being cheated on overtime wages and fed unsanitary food.</p><p>  Experts say cheating workers on wages, forcing them to log up to 200 hours of overtime a month and denying them health benefits is commonplace in China.</p><p>  Many factories are violating not just the new contract labor law, but also a 1994 law, which covered a broader set of labor and wage practices, they said. </p><p>  ''The employment contract in many factories here is a mere scrap of paper,'' says Liu Kaiming, director of the Institute of Contemporary Observation, a labor rights group in Shenzhen. ''Here is a common trick: The factory signs contracts with 1,000 workers but actually they've hired 2,000. The factory reports to the government saying they have 100 percent of their workers registered.''</p><p>  Heather White, a consultant who has inspected factories in China for Tommy Hilfiger, Polo Ralph Lauren and other big companies, says many exporters evade the law by subcontracting to so-called shadow factories, which operate under illegal conditions.</p><p>  ''The market is penalizing anyone who complies with the law,'' she says, meaning their products are more expensive. ''And so many companies are subcontracting'' to shadow factories.</p><p>  Labor rights groups that specialize in sneaking into Chinese factories and documenting their flaws say exporters' multinational clients are also responsible for their suppliers' practices.</p><p>  ''They are blatantly violating the labor law,'' says Charles Kernaghan, director of the National Labor Committee, based in Pittsburgh, which last February issued a scathing report on a factory making keyboards for big tech companies. ''They're forcing people to work 12-hour shifts. Their overtime far exceeds the legal limit.''</p><p>  But factory owners say that labor law enforcement has been weak and selective for years, and changing the rules now could lead to chaos, drive up prices and force many factories out of business.</p><p>  ''The government hasn't given us time to adjust,'' says Huang Zhenyuan, vice president of the Taiwan Merchant Association of Dongguan, which represents thousands of factories. ''When we came to China there was no legal environment. Now all has changed; it's too sudden.''</p><p>  Because of the downturn, 20 million migrant workers have already lost their jobs, Beijing says. The government recently put rules in place restricting factories from making large-scale layoffs without giving the government notice.</p><p>  But on an individual level, the struggle between having a job and economic security, and safety and personal dignity can be wrenching.</p><p>  Liu Pan, the worker crushed to death, was hired shortly after he had turned 15. He operated a giant machine that turned out boxes in a plant that Disney concedes had recently passed third-party audits. His salary was about $175 a month.</p><p>  Workers found his mutilated body stuck in the machine on the afternoon of April 5. </p><p>  Michael Li, a senior manager at Yiuwah, says the accident was not a reflection of labor conditions at the factory. He also said a Chinese government official helped manage the factory.</p><p>  But China Labor Watch, a nonprofit group based in New York, says it investigated conditions at the factory shortly after the death and found widespread violations of the labor law, including the hiring of children as young as 13, forced overtime and the failure of many workers to sign labor contacts.</p><p>  In a statement, Disney said only about 5 to 15 percent of the goods produced at Yiuwah were made for Disney and that Yiuwah had committed to correcting problems there.</p><p>  ''However, if improvement within acceptable and agreed upon time frames is not achieved,'' Disney said it would stop doing business with the factory.</p><p>  Yiuwah offered $22,000 to compensate for Mr. Liu's death, his family said. </p><p>  Liu Hong, Mr. Liu's father, does not even know how to begin to measure such compensation. </p><p>  ''I'm falling apart,'' he said as his wife tried to calm him. ''We are in the lowest class. So I still don't know if it's the highest compensation.

The dramatic flurry, however, only proves why you should spread your bets.\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Thanks to hopes that the economy and corporate profits will stop sagging this year, the average tech fund has lapped a rising market, shooting up some 41% over the past three months. In fact, some tech-heavy growth funds are actually up more than twice that much over the same period.\u00a0</p><p>The burst is rare good news to these ravaged funds' remaining, long-suffering shareholders. But it hasn't erased these funds' steep losses over the past two years, either. It would be easy to get swept up in this recent rally, but to the savvy fund investor, this splendid run-up underscores the primary (and perhaps tired) lesson fund investors have learned since 1999's tech mania: diversify.\u00a0</p><p>Here's why: Investment styles and market sectors, particularly the growth style and tech sector, tend to rise and fall in sudden, unpredictable gushes. If you ignore an area, you'll probably miss out on some big gains, but if you bet the farm on the leader du jour, as many did in 1999 and 2000, you'll eventually suffer outsize losses. So, spreading your money broadly among a blend of different stock funds positions you to benefit from eye-popping runs like this one, without losing your shirt when the siren song stops.\u00a0</p><p> \u00a0(Chart Omitted)\u00a0</p><p>To say tech and growth funds' powerful run isn't both powerful and intriguing would be silly. After all, plodding bond funds topped all flavors of growth and tech funds over the past two years.\u00a0</p><p>And in these heady 90 days, some of the most concentrated, aggressive and tech-obsessed funds out there have rung up gains that you'd expect from a volatile penny stock rather than a mutual fund. As you might imagine, the ultramercurial Van Wagoner funds, led by tech evangelist Garrett Van Wagoner, dominate the list of highfliers over the past three months. Some will wonder if the firm's controversial pricing of its private-company holdings helped out, but the returns are stunning nonetheless.\u00a0</p><p>The firm's Technology fund tops all tech funds, excluding leveraged trading funds, with an 80% gain. Its Emerging Growth and Post-Venture funds surged more than 80%. How did they ring up such high gains in such a short time? Collectively the firm's funds had 90% of their money in tech stocks, according to a Sept. 30 regulatory filing. Faves like software shop Embarcadero Technologies (EMBT:Nasdaq) and network switch maker McData(MCDTA:Nasdaq) propelled the funds. Both stocks are up some 150% over the past 90 days.\u00a0</p><p><table pgwide=\"520\"><tgroup cols=\"3\"><colspec align=\"left\" colnum=\"1\" colwidth=\"280\"/><colspec align=\"left\" colnum=\"2\" colwidth=\"112\"/><colspec align=\"left\" colnum=\"3\" colwidth=\"128\"/><tbody><row><entry nameend=\"4\" namest=\"1\">Curb Your Enthusiasm The highest fliers over the past 90 days had fallen hardest over the past year</entry></row><row><entry nameend=\"3\" namest=\"1\">Tech Funds</entry></row><row><entry>Fund</entry><entry>90-Day Return</entry><entry>One-Year Return</entry></row><row><entry>Van Wagoner Technology</entry><entry>79.8%</entry><entry>-55.5%</entry></row><row><entry>Berkshire Technology</entry><entry>70</entry><entry>-64.7</entry></row><row><entry>Berkshire Focus</entry><entry>69.3</entry><entry>-65.4</entry></row><row><entry>Black Oak Emerging Technology</entry><entry>69.2</entry><entry>-57.8</entry></row><row><entry>Firsthand E-Commerce</entry><entry>67.8</entry><entry>-38.8</entry></row><row><entry>S&amp;P 500</entry><entry>10.2</entry><entry>-11</entry></row><row><entry nameend=\"3\" namest=\"1\">Growth Funds</entry></row><row><entry>Fund</entry><entry>90-Day Return</entry><entry>One-Year Return</entry></row><row><entry>Van Wagoner Emerging Growth</entry><entry>86.7%</entry><entry>-52.6%</entry></row><row><entry>Van Wagoner Post-Venture</entry><entry>80.2</entry><entry>-55.5</entry></row><row><entry>ARK Social Issues Small-Cap Equity</entry><entry>63.7</entry><entry>N/A</entry></row><row><entry>Van Wagoner Micro-Cap Growth</entry><entry>57</entry><entry>-34</entry></row><row><entry>Van Wagoner Mid-Cap Growth</entry><entry>49.8</entry><entry>-59.7</entry></row><row><entry>S&amp;P 500</entry><entry>10.2</entry><entry>-11</entry></row><row><entry nameend=\"3\" namest=\"1\">Source: Morningstar.

The three Van Wagoner funds that are up more than 80% over the past 90 days have still lost more than half their value over the past year. If you're wondering how that's possible, consider that many of these ultra-aggressive funds and others of their ilk sported an 80% one-year loss not long ago. The Post-Venture and Technology funds are still in the red over the past three years, implying how far many investors still are from break-even.\u00a0</p><p><table pgwide=\"440\"><tgroup cols=\"4\"><colspec align=\"left\" colnum=\"4\" colwidth=\"136\"/><colspec align=\"left\" colnum=\"5\" colwidth=\"112\"/><colspec align=\"left\" colnum=\"6\" colwidth=\"96\"/><colspec align=\"left\" colnum=\"7\" colwidth=\"96\"/><tbody><row><entry nameend=\"4\" namest=\"1\">Now, That's Growth After two down years, tech and techy growth funds are reviving</entry></row><row><entry>Fund Category</entry><entry>90-Day Return</entry><entry>2001 Return</entry><entry>2000 Return</entry></row><row><entry>Technology</entry><entry>41.1%</entry><entry>-38.1%</entry><entry>-32.3%</entry></row><row><entry>Small-Cap Growth</entry><entry>23.4</entry><entry>-9</entry><entry>-4.4</entry></row><row><entry>Mid-Cap Growth</entry><entry>19.5</entry><entry>-21.3</entry><entry>-4.9</entry></row><row><entry>Large-Cap Growth</entry><entry>14.8</entry><entry>-23.5</entry><entry>-14.5</entry></row><row><entry>S&amp;P 500</entry><entry>10.2</entry><entry>-12</entry><entry>-9.1</entry></row><row><entry nameend=\"4\" namest=\"1\">Source: Morningstar. Returns through Jan. 2.</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></p><p>Obviously, these funds, a good fit for precious few investors, are drastic examples of how dangerous it can be to make a big bet on the tech sector or growth style. But tamer examples are just as illustrative. The Fidelity Aggressive Growth fund rode big tech bets to a 103% gain in 1999, and the big-cap fund from the nation's largest fund shop was among 2000's bestsellers. Since manager Erin Sullivan's departure, however, the fund has sputtered and now averages a 9% annual loss over the past three years.\u00a0</p><p>A $10,000 investment at the start of 2000 would've been worth less than $3,500 at the start of December, according to the latest data from Morningstar. Even if you'd been prescient enough to make the same investment on Jan. 1, 1999, you would still be in the red by more than $3,000. We recently found several funds that gained more than 100% in 1999 that have lost all of those gains and more.\u00a0</p><p>These bleak numbers don't mean you should completely avoid growth and tech funds, though many fund investors did last year. Rather, they prove that you should shoehorn them into a diversified portfolio, as a rough example illustrates.\u00a0</p><p>In the second half of the 1990s, cash flows to stock funds began skewing drastically toward growth and tech funds because those funds were performing best at the time. But if we compare one portfolio invested solely in big-cap growth funds with one split between only big-cap growth and tech-light, bargain-hunting big-cap value funds, we see why diversification makes sense in the long run.\u00a0</p><p>The all-growth portfolio and the growth/value portfolio both averaged about a 12% annual gain over the past decade. But the diversified portfolio's route to those returns was far smoother. Its worst quarterly loss was 17%, compared with 23% for the growth portfolio. A comparison of each portfolio's beta, or volatility, vs. the S&amp;P 500 underscores this point.\u00a0</p><p><table pgwide=\"616\"><tgroup cols=\"3\"><colspec align=\"left\" colnum=\"8\" colwidth=\"128\"/><colspec align=\"left\" colnum=\"9\" colwidth=\"168\"/><colspec align=\"left\" colnum=\"10\" colwidth=\"320\"/><tbody><row><entry nameend=\"4\" namest=\"1\">The Value of Owning Growth and Value Diversification doesn't hurt long-term returns, but does erode risk</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>100%: Large-Cap Growth</entry><entry>50%: Large-Cap Growth 50%: Large-Cap Value</entry></row><row><entry>One-Year Return</entry><entry>-23.6%</entry><entry>-13.3%</entry></row><row><entry>Five-Year Return</entry><entry>8.1</entry><entry>8.6</entry></row><row><entry>10-Year Return</entry><entry>12</entry><entry>12.5</entry></row><row><entry>Worst Quarter</entry><entry>-23.1</entry><entry>-16.6</entry></row><row><entry>Beta</entry><entry>1.3</entry><entry>0.99</entry></row><row><entry nameend=\"3\" namest=\"1\">Source: Morningstar. Data through Nov. 30.</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></p><p>If you're not familiar, the S&amp;P 500's beta is 1.0, and a lower beta implies less volatility, while a higher beta implies more bumps in the road. The all-growth portfolio had a 1.3 beta, so it tended to outdo the index by about 30% on the upside and fall about 30% further on the downside. The diversified portfolio's 0.99 beta indicates a less hectic ride.\u00a0</p><p>The bottom line is that it's easy to get swept up in the swirl of these gains, particularly if they continue for a spell. But tech and growth funds' recent hot streak and their losses in past years prove the same thing: Moderation is the fund investor's best policy.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

Our growth will closely match that of the growth of the Indian economy.\"In a freewheeling conversation with ET over video conference, Solomon spoke on a wide range of topics that impact global finance and corporates, touching upon issues as diverse as economic reforms in India, the timing of a possible global recession, the future path of US interest rates, global trade wars as well as the desirability of breaking up Big Tech firms like Facebook.The former chief operating officer of the bank, who took over last October from Lloyd Blankfein, the legendary risk titan, believes India is going to need significant amounts of capital - an area where the Wall Street bellwether can play a key role. \"If you think about the continuing digitisation of the economy in India, obviously that's going to create many opportunities.\" The reforms process, if continued under the new government, will further accelerate FDI inflows, he said.Low Chance of Global Recession: SolomonThe new $250 million, 1.2 million square foot Bengaluru office, which was inaugurated last Thursday and will serve as a global centre supporting innovation, represents Goldman's confidence in India's longterm potential.The ongoing trade war between the US and China has opened up new opportunities as global supply chains are being tweaked as companies seek to reduce their dependence on China. </p><p>However, based on interactions with top CEOs, he feels India might not be able to capitalise on it the way the US or Asian peers like Indonesia and Vietnam seem likely to.Solomon sees chances of a global recession in 2020 to be 'low'.Despite long-term optimism, Solomon had one word of caution. \"India is still a place where the regulatory impact on business slows economic growth.\" An optimist who would rather unwind on the DJ console after a hard week's work, he added, \"I am hopeful that that progress will continue and accelerate.\"Asked about changing regulatory goalposts in ecommerce and teething problems that hamper smooth implementation of new laws such as bankruptcy code, which in turn sends out mixed signals to global investors, Solomon argued that it is a commonplace practice around the world. \"It's par for the course when you are driving change in a major economy. While I am sure there are investors who are frustrated and want things to go quicker, we take a very long-term view... goal posts in any economy can keep shifting, including the US.\"The changing regulatory environment around the world, especially surrounding technology and privacy issues, has also seen growing demand to split large technology companies like Facebook. Solomon, whose firm has a vice like grip on tech IPOs in the US, along with rivals Morgan Stanley, is against breaking them up.\"Breaking up a company is a very, very difficult, complicated thing to do. Like any other business that becomes big and influential, Facebook will have to make adjustments,\" he says. He does see chances of heightened government regulations \"putting more rules, guard rails and parameters in place.\" For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ECOTMS-69626167</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ECOTMS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W84-SCR1-DXJR-H1T7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">362627</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"597\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Bennett Coleman &amp; Co.

It has more than 150 employees in seven cities, with about half of those in Spokane.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> The 20-year evolution demonstrates how smart growth and reliance on modern communications tools can give a small firm big advantages, even when it's not located in one of the nation's business centers.</p><p> \"It was never our dream to create a big law firm,\" said Hayes, 55. The two men, both electrical engineers by training, went through law school and met at a previous Spokane firm, Wells St. John. They got a chance to do patent work for Microsoftin 1994 and launched Lee &amp; Hayes as a virtual office in their homes, using email and a data connection system to exchange big files.</p><p> The first big tech boom took place over the next decade, with companies filing patents to establish ownership and protect their software, hardware and business practices. By 2000, Lee &amp; Hayes had moved into a downtown office and had a dozen attorneys on staff.</p><p> They had two major clients: Silicon Valley-based Hewlett Packard and Microsoft. Over the next several years, as the patent rush increased, they added clients such as Boeing, Amazon, Honeywell and Intel.</p><p> Helping them land work was the difficulty big companies like Microsofthad in finding enough patent attorneys in their own backyards. The result, Hayes said, was the big firms began hiring other firms to do that work.</p><p> \"When we started with Microsoftwe used to fly over there for every meeting about an invention,\" Hayes said. Soon the information could be exchanged by phone or videoconferences or by email.</p><p> Hayes helped develop the law firm's electronic database to keep track of all its cases and manage schedules.</p><p> \"Those companies would become bureaucratic as they got large, and sometimes they'd find themselves losing track of key deadlines. We kept on top of things and made sure they didn't need to nag us on projects. We were low-maintenance,\" he said.</p><p> The firm began looking to Asian markets in 2001 and opened a Seattle office.</p><p> Even the Great Recession couldn't slow patent and intellectual property work, said Lee, 49.</p><p> \"Some law firms saw their work come to a screeching halt,\" he said, \"but that didn't really slow down (patent work), because there were many companies that were trying to innovate out of the crisis.\"</p><p>PLAN TO ADD ATTORNEYS</p><p> During the past dozen years the firm has opened offices in Washington, D.C.; Atlanta; Rochester, New York; Austin, Texas; and Portland.</p><p> Its plans for growth include adding a dozen attorneys this year, with five of those in the Spokane office, and potential new offices in San Francisco and Hong Kong.</p><p> Lee said it's been easy to keep Spokane as the center of the network. Leasing office space here is far cheaper than in bigger cities. And because patent work is regulated by federal rules rather than a patchwork of state laws, the dispersed team of staff and attorneys easily shares ideas and develops projects online, he said.</p><p> Among Lee &amp; Hayes' newer customers are Alibaba, China's largest e-commerce company, and Gelli, a fast-growing Chinese-based auto manufacturer.</p><p> Most of the firm's intellectual property work is for clients outside Eastern Washington, but Lee &amp; Hayes has some local clients, such as Next IT, Pearson Packaging, Telect and others.</p><p> Greg Tenold, president of Spokane Valley-based Spokane Industries, has been using Lee &amp; Hayes for several years to protect his manufacturing company's patents, including one for high-end wine fermentation containers and for its ceramic-lined rock-crushing equipment.</p><p> \"Lee &amp; Hayes is the top firm in their field,\" said Tenold. \"They're a world-class firm, and we wanted to be associated with them, as they helped us establish the value of our intellectual property.\"</p><p>'STILL IN THE FIRST INNING'</p><p> At the 20-year mark, Lee &amp; Hayes needs to look to its succession plan so that the firm endures another 20 years, said firm CEO Shaun Cross.</p><p> When he came on board in 2008 he found the firm relied heavily on its Microsoftwork and on Lee to carry forward new initiatives. Cross and the partners developed a strategic plan to add more services and clients.</p><p> Three years ago Lee &amp; Hayes shook things up by adding litigation to its practice areas. It now has a stable of attorneys who help companies defend their patents, copyrights and trademarks in court.</p><p> It also added corporate consulting services, and expanded into medical fields. One of its clients is the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle.</p><p> Like Hayes, Lee wasn't looking to build a global law firm when the two started. But the growth of the firm became an economic necessity in maintaining the advantages Lee &amp; Hayes had established.</p><p> \"One of the most meaningful times in our history was when Dan and I realized, one day, that we were closer to being an institution than a small firm,\" Lee said.</p><p> \"We now had a responsibility because we were a firm that was creating meaningful jobs for people. That got us thinking about the future. How would we keep this thing going?\"</p><p> Lee said the company's hiring practices are deliberate and exhaustive; a three-page outline of what they're looking for in candidates can be boiled down to the \"no jerk rule.\" That means applicants who show excessive ego, a sense of entitlement or excessive vanity are weeded out, he said.</p><p> Said Cross: \"A lot of law firms have caustic attorneys. They may be used to behaving badly sometimes. If we see any of that trait, we won't tolerate it.\"</p><p> Those workers are the reason Lee &amp; Hayes has been named by an industry magazine as the best overall intellectual property law firm in the country for each of the past four years, Lee added.</p><p> Just as important, Lee said, was the firm being a finalist in the Washington's Best Workplaces awards chosen by the Puget Sound Business Journal.</p><p> There's more to come, Lee added. \"I do believe we're still like a startup. I consider Lee &amp; Hayes is still in the first inning of what it can become.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SPOKSR-26640670</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SPOKSR2015</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5FB6-9R21-JC0C-J4WF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">157554</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1031\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2015 Spokane Spokesman-Review</copyright><publicationName>Spokesman Review (Spokane, WA)</publicationName><edition>Main Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"02\" year=\"2015\"><dateText>February 11, 2015 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0001X0M</classCode><className>INTEL CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0002J2F</classCode><className>BOEING CO</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0002KLJ</classCode><className>HP INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS511210 SOFTWARE PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>SIC7372 PREPACKAGED SOFTWARE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>NAICS334413 SEMICONDUCTOR &amp;

We advise governments that, whatever their level of development, the important thing is to have harmonized regulation.\"</p><p>She said in Asia-Pacific that as well as talking to individual governments, the GSMA spent time with regional forums such as ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) to try to build common policies.</p><p>In a diverse region such as Asia-Pacific, priorities varied widely.</p><p>For countries such as South Korea and Japan, one of the major concerns was cross-border data flows, essential for data-intensive AI.</p><p>\"If you're China or India, you can create your own ecosystem. If you're a small country, you need a mechanism to get the data,\" she said.</p><p>Japan's Prime Minister Abe put the issue on the agenda for the Osaka G20 meeting held in July. It didn't go far -- leaders committed to nothing more than more discussion on digital commerce rules.</p><p>Lecchi acknowledged that even the GSMA had divided views.</p><p>It is in favor of cross-border data flows, but it also holds that every country has the right to issue its own laws for cybersecurity.</p><p>\"So there's a little bit of tension between the two. You want to reach a system where there are cross-border data flows but also cybersecurity is protected.\"</p><p>In developing countries, more fundamental issues, such as registering new births, are the focus.</p><p>Some countries don't give an ID to new-born babies, which makes it impossible to get a digital identity to prove who you are online.</p><p>\"So operators are helping register new births,\" said Lecchi.</p><p>When it comes to the competitive environment for operators, Lecchi notes that the ground rules seem to be shifting.</p><p>Telcos are heavily regulated but their OTT rivals are not.</p><p>\"Operators have had to deal with a playing field that is not level ever since the advent of the smartphone changed the rules of the game in 2008,\" she said.</p><p>But now Apple is facing anti-trust suits, while lawmakers and politicians are talking of reining in Facebook and Google.</p><p>Lecchi said she was seeing \"more awareness\" among regulators about competition conditions for telcos.</p><p>The belief that low-entry barriers would hold big tech firms in check is also being questioned.</p><p>\"I think economists in the US and Europe are changing their tune,\" said Lecchi.</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Light Reading India.

Berg[1] Gregory J. Casas[2] Calvin Ding[3] Vctor Manuel Fras Garcs[4] Robert Gago[5] Edoardo Gambaro[6] Greenberg Traurig, LLP[7] Alerts[8] United StatesA. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) 1.Allimentation and CrossAmerica agree to $3.5 million civil penalty.On July 6, 2020, retail fuel station and convenience store operator Allimentation Couche-Tard and its former affiliate CrossAmerica Partnersagreed[9]to pay a $3.5 million civil penalty to settle FTC allegations that they violated a 2018 FTC consent order requiring that they divest, by June 2018, 10 retail fuel stations in Minnesota and Wisconsin. The FTC alleged that the parties had failed to divest the required fuel centers to FTC-approved buyers in six Minnesota and three Wisconsin divestiture markets; failed to maintain the viability and competitiveness of the Hibbing, Minnesota retail fuel station and failed to divest it as an ongoing business; failed to submit accurate regularly required compliance reports regarding their efforts to divest these fuel centers; and failed to submit accurate regularly required compliance reports regarding their efforts to maintain the viability of the Hibbing retail fuel station. The FTC's 2018 divestiture order settled its complaint that the parties' acquisition of 380 retail fuel stations from Holiday Companies was anticompetitive because it increased the risk of both unilateral and coordinated anticompetitive effects in 10 local retail fuel markets.Elanco Animal Health and Bayer Animal Health ordered to divest products.On July 15, 2020, the FTCrequired[10]Elanco Animal Health and Bayer Animal Health, two global suppliers of animal products, to divest three animal health products to settle FTC charges that Elanco's proposed $7.6 billion acquisition of Bayer would be likely to cause anticompetitive effects in those markets. </p><p>The three impacted markets are low-dose prescription treatments for canine otitis externa; fast-acting oral treatments that kill fleas on dogs; and brand-name cattle pour-on insecticides. The FTC's complaint alleged that the acquisition would create a merger in the market for the first two products and that the third market would be highly concentrated because Elanco, the third largest competitor, would be acquiring Bayer, the market leader.Invidior, Inc. agrees to pay $10 million fine to settle opioid antitrust charges.On July 26, 2020, Invidior, Inc.agreed[11]to pay $10 million to settle FTC charges that it violated antitrust laws through a deceptive scheme to thwart lower-priced generic competition with its branded opioid replacement therapy drug Suboxone. Among other things, the FTC's complaint alleged that in an effort to thwart emerging generic competition, Invidior filed a meritless citizen petition with the FDA reciting unsupported safety claims and requesting that the FDA reject any generic Suboxone tablet application. The proposed stipulated judgment also permanently enjoined similar such conduct in the future. B. Department of Justice (DOJ) 1.Avanci's platform for licensing 5G communications technology to automotive industry.On July 28, 2020, the DOJissued[12]a Business Review Letter approving Avanci's proposed platform for licensing 5G cellular telecommunications technology for application in the automotive industry. The proposal provided for the licensing of cellular standard essential patents related to vehicle connectivity at fair, reasonable and nondiscriminatory (so-called 'FRAND') rates for incorporation by automakers into connected vehicles. Under the DOJ Business Review Letter process, DOJ's review of the Avanci proposal resulted in a conclusion that DOJ would not challenge the proposed action under the antitrust laws based on the information set forth in the proposal, the competition safeguards incorporated in the proposal, and the input received by DOJ from a broad range of stakeholders, including automakers, automotive suppliers, and potential licensors.2.Alleged conspiracy to manipulate procurement process relating to strategic petroleum reserve.On July 2, 2020, in a one-count complaint, the DOJcharged[13]Cajun Welding &amp;#38; Rentals, alleging that Cajun conspired to defraud the United States in violation of the Procurement Integrity Act. According to the complaint, Cajun conspired with unnamed co-conspirators by corrupting and impairing the government procurement process and by obtaining non-public pricing and cost information in order to secure subcontract awards in connection with the U.S. Department of Energy's operation of the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve.3.Taro Pharmaceuticals agrees to $205 million penalty for alleged collusion on generic drugs.On July 23, 2020, Taro Pharmaceuticalsagreed[14]to pay a $205 million criminal penalty under a deferred prosecution agreement based on DOJ charges that Taro conspired with a competitor and its executives to fix prices, allocate customers, and rig bids for generic drugs. The alleged conspiracies involved the marketing of generic drugs, from March 2013 through December 2015, for the prevention and control of seizures and to treat bipolar disorder, pain and arthritis, and various skin conditions. C. Litigation 1.In re Capacitors Antitrust Litig. (III), N.D. Cal., No. 17-md-2801On July 10, 2020, a class of direct purchasers received preliminary approval of a $252 million settlement in the civil class actions against several defendants in the market for electrolytic and film capacitors market. The agreements call for payments of $65 million by AVX Corp., $62 million by KEMET Electronics Corp., $45 million by Panasonic, $28 million by Holy Stone Enterprise Co., and $25 million by ELNA Co., as well as a seven-figure payment by Shinyei Technology Co., Shizuki Electric Co., and Taitsu Corp.Panasonic also agreed to provide cooperation against certain non-settling defendants.2.In re: Cathode Ray Tube (CRT) Antitrust Litigation, MDL No. 1917, in the U. S. District Court for the Northern District of California (Indirect Purchaser Claims)On July 23, 2020, in a public decision, the Ninth Circuit set aside its stay prohibiting disbursement of a $513 million settlement fund that resolves indirect purchasers claims by consumer and retailer classes related to defendant's' alleged antitrust violations in the market for the sale of cathode ray tubes.3.In re Rail Freight Fuel Surcharge Antitrust Litig., No. 07-mc-489 (D.D.C.).On July 28, 2020, the DOJ filed a statement of interest regarding the breadth of the possible antitrust exemptions set forth in the Staggers Act, a deregulatory statute that was enacted to give railroads flexibility in setting their own rates in exchange for antitrust immunity when they cooperate. The lawsuit alleges that the main rail carriers conspired on fuel charges billed to shippers. The carriers argued that the Staggers Act exempts discussion or agreement covering interline cargo trips. Plaintiffs argued that the Staggers Act allows the admission of interline rate discussions that might suggest a conspiracy, even if they only show parallel acts that could be legal.The DOJ stated that both sides went too far. According to the DOJ, the statute places the burden on railroads to establish that a rate discussion would not violate antitrust laws, 'which does not depend on whether the evidence is direct or circumstantial. Carriers cannot pluck discrete items of evidence from the record and argue, out of context, that the 'discussion or agreement'' is inadmissible 'because the item does not independently prove an antitrust violation.' The case is back before the district court as a multi-district litigation after the D.C. Circuit dismissed the certification of the class action last year.4.Food Lion LLC v. Dairy Farmers of Am. Inc., No. 20-cv-442 (M.D.N.C.).On July 24, 2020, the United States District Court for the Middle District of North Carolinadenied[15]Dairy Farmers of America's motion to dismiss a suit challenging its acquisition of the bankrupt Dean Foods, the country's largest milk producer. Dairy Farmers of America previously received regulatory approval to acquire Dean Foods, but the acquisition was challenged by Food Lion, a regional supermarket chain in North Carolina, and by the Maryland and Virginia Milk Producers Cooperative Association. According to the suit, the purchase will give Dairy Farmers of America market power at two levels of the supply chain, permitting it to 'wipe out any remaining pockets of competition.' In allowing the suit to proceed, the court disregarded the failing firm defense, which could have shielded Dairy Farmers of America from liability given that the purchase was the only plausible method for rescuing a distressed business. The suit seeks additional divestitures to reduce the impact on competition. A related suit is ongoing in Vermont federal court.5.Nat'l Football League v. Ninth Inning Inc., No. 19-1098 (U.S.).On July 14, 2020, a group of sports bars filed theirresponse[16]opposing the National Football League (NFL) petition for certiorari, asking the Supreme Court to overturn the Ninth Circuit's ruling that allowed sports bars to challenge the NFL's Sunday Ticket, the league's out-of-market television broadcast package. The NFL raises two challenges to the Ninth Circuit's opinion. First, the NFL challenges the appellate court's analysis under the rule of reason, claiming that the plaintiff's complaint lacked sufficient facts to move ahead to fact discovery. The NFL's second point is that the bar owners are indirect purchasers, and lack standing to raise an antitrust challenge. The NFL argues that plaintiffs purchased Sunday Ticket from DirecTV and not from the NFL. The Ninth Circuit held that the agreement between the NFL and DirecTV was an overarching conspiracy, and therefore presented an exception toIllinois Brick. The NFL alleges that the Ninth Circuit's ruling exacerbates a split in the circuits on this issue. In their response, the sports bars dispute that such a split exists. Mexico In July 2020, a Federal Circuit Court specialized in competition matters cancelled the Mexican Competition Commission's attempt to regulate Mexico City's Airport operation. The Court decided the dispute between the Mexican Competition Commission (COFECE,Comisi\u00f3n Federal de Competencia Econ\u00f3mica) and the Federal Ministry of Communications, which has the authority to regulate the operation of Mexico City's airport. The decision favored the federal government, significantly reducing COFECE's authority in various matters.In 2012, COFECE was granted the authority to define and regulate 'essential facilities.' There were high expectations as to the scope of this new superpower. In 2017, COFECE concluded that Mexico City's Airport (AICM,Aeropuerto Internacional de la Ciudad de Mxico) engaged in several activities that created anticompetitive effects. AICM challenged COFECE's actions as unconstitutional. The court agreed, holding that COFECE's decision exceeded its material and authorized limits, and that it interfered with the federal government and its agencies' powers. The Circuit Court stated that the Mexican Constitution granted the President, the SCT, and the DGAC the power to enforce public policies and regulate and supervise aviation and airport industries, with respect to air traffic and slot allocation regulations, and indirectly limited COFECE's alleged authority to regulate essential facilities in many circumstances. The NetherlandsA. Revised guidelines on sustainability agreements. On July 9, 2020, the Netherlands Authority for Consumers and Markets (ACM)opened a consultation[17]for revised guidelines on sustainability agreements. The consultation seeks to widen the scope of the statutory exemption from the cartel prohibition for those agreements aimed at achieving certain sustainability objectives, particularly environmental benefits. This should apply both with respect to the cartel prohibitions set forth in Section 6(1) of the Dutch Competition Act and Article 101(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). The consultation period ends on September. 30, 2020. B. Acquisition of Corendon by Sunweb requires further (phase 2) investigation. On July 13, 2020, the ACMruled[18]that further investigation is needed into the effects that the acquisition of Dutch tour operator Corendon by rival operator Sunweb will have on competition. Sunweb therefore cannot yet acquire Corendon. Sunweb and Corendon are both major providers of package tours to beach destinations on the Mediterranean coast, among other destinations. After the acquisition, few other package-tour providers would remain active in the Netherlands. The reduction in competition may lead to more expensive or lower-quality package tours for holiday-goers. In addition, the Sunweb/Corendon combination may become so large that other providers may have a harder time booking airplane seats for their package tours. C. Public-transportation companies cleared to create mobility platform, but under strict conditions. On July 9, 2020, the ACMheld[19]that Dutch Railways NS and the municipal public-transportation companies in the three largest Dutch cities - Amsterdam (GVB); Rotterdam (RET); and the Hague (HTM) - are allowed to create a digital mobility platform to which they admit other market participants that offer mobility services to travelers. The ACM has attached strict conditions to its clearance of this collaboration. These conditions serve to ensure that access to the platform is guaranteed for mobility-service providers, that innovation is stimulated, and that a level playing field will remain in place.Mobility services that help travelers plan, book, and pay for a trip from doorstep to destination are called 'Mobility as a Service' (MaaS). On their proprietary digital platforms, MaaS-providers combine different transportation services (such as train, bus, subway, car-sharing programs, and bike-sharing programs) as well as related services. According to ACM, the strict conditions that have been attached to the joint platform are sufficient to remove possible anticompetitive concerns. For example, NS, GVB, HTM, and RET have committed to offering other mobility providers and MaaS-providers access to the platform under equal conditions. In that context, they will not demand exclusivity. ACM will conduct a market study to take stock of the current situation regarding such access and integration for MaaS-providers (existing and potential ones): to which public-transportation services of other market participants do they currently have access, and under what conditions? United KingdomA. Litigation On July 3, 2020, the English High Courtgranted[20]the Competition and Markets Authority's (CMA) first application for a director disqualification order on competition law grounds. Michael Martin was a director of an estate agent firm that had agreed with five of its competitors on commission rates to be charged to residential customers. The Court ordered that Mr. Martin should be disqualified from being a director for seven years and ordered him to pay 100,000 in costs to the CMA. In previous cases, the CMA has accepted disqualification undertakings from directors of firms involved in cartel conduct, avoiding the need to apply to the court for an order. In this case, Mr. Martin challenged the CMA's case, claiming that he was unaware of the cartel. B. COVID-19: Andrew Tyrie on the impact of the COVID-19 crisis on competition policy. The CMA has published alink to a paper[21]by its outgoing chairman, Andrew Tyrie, entitledHow should competition policy react to coronavirus?The paper assesses the long- and short-term consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic for markets and competition.Lord Tyrie's thesis is that the pandemic is likely to make the UK economy less competitive by increasing market concentration, the power of digital markets, and public distrust of markets, and that competition policy and the UK competition authorities have a crucial role to play in mitigating the resulting problems. In the short term, he argues, the CMA's function should be to protect consumers from exploitation by businesses and to ensure that enforcement does not obstruct necessary business cooperation. In the longer term, Lord Tyrie argues, the pandemic is likely to reshape the economy, causing lasting changes to consumer behaviour, businesses, supply chains, and the regulatory environment. He refers to a need for stronger merger control, control over inefficient bailouts, and close oversight and monitoring of changes in markets and consumer outcomes across the UK economy. He advocates a dispassionate approach to controlling the power of 'Big Tech,' protection of the vulnerable, and protection of domestic competition. C. Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) 1.Ophthalmology: price-fixing cartel settlement.On July 1, 2020, the CMAannounced[22]a decision finding that Spire Healthcare, a private health care provider, and seven consultant ophthalmologists breached the Chapter I prohibition of the Competition Act 1998 by illegally fixing the price of initial ophthalmology consultation fees for private self-paying patients. The addressees of the decision admitted breaching the prohibition - the consultant ophthalmologists by agreeing to fix the price of initial consultations and Spire Healthcare by instigating and facilitating the infringement. The CMA imposed a fine of 1.2 million on Spire Healthcare. Fines imposed on six of the consultants ranged from 642 to 3,859. One consultant benefited from immunity under the CMA's leniency policy. The fines include a 20% 'settlement discount.'2.Pharmaceuticals: market-sharing settlement.On July 9, 2020, the CMA concluded a long-running antitrust investigation by issuing an infringementdecision[23], finding that various subsidiaries of Aspen Pharmacare, Amilco, and Tiofarma had breached the Chapter I prohibition and Article 101 TFEU by entering into a market-sharing agreement. According to the CMA's decision, the market-sharing agreement was aimed at ensuring that Aspen remained the sole supplier of fludrocortisone acetate tablets in the UK, a prescription-only drug mainly used to treat adrenal insufficiency (Addison's Disease). In return for staying out of the fludrocortisone market, Amilco received 30% of the increased prices charged by Aspen and Tiofarma was appointed as sole manufacturer of the drug for direct sale in the UK. According to the CMA, prices paid by the National Health Service (NHS) increased by up to 1,800% after the market-sharing agreement was carried out.Taking account of settlement discounts, the CMA imposed fines of approximately 2.3 million on the infringing companies and accepted director disqualification undertakings from an Amilco director, preventing him from taking up a director role or being involved in the management of any company based in England, Scotland, or Wales for five years. In addition, the CMA announced that Aspen has now paid 8 million in compensation directly to the NHS, as it had agreed to do under the commitments.3.Price gouging: abuse of dominance.On June 18, 2020, the CMAlaunched[24]four investigations under Chapter II of the Competition Act 1998 into four pharmacies and convenience stores, alleging that the firms were abusing a dominant market position by charging excessive and unfair prices for hand sanitizer during the COVID-19 crisis. The majority of these investigations were short-lived: on July 13, 2020, the CMA announced that it hadclosed[25]three of the investigations. In one investigation the CMA found no grounds for action, concluding that the hand sanitizer price charged was not excessive under competition law. The CMA closed two other investigations based on its prioritization principles. The fourth investigation remains ongoing.4.Additional merger control thresholds in force.On July 21, 2020, the Enterprise Act 2002 (Share of Supply Test) Amendment Order 2020 and Enterprise Act 2002 (Turnover Test) Amendment Order 2020 entered into force. Theseorders[26]amend sections 23 and 23A of the Enterprise Act 2002, thereby expanding the categories of transactions qualifying as 'relevant merger situations' over which the CMA has jurisdiction as part of the UK's voluntary merger control regime. The orders add three additional economic sectors - artificial intelligence, cryptographic authentication, and advanced materials - to the definition of 'relevant enterprise.' As a result, lower jurisdictional thresholds apply to transactions in these sectors: the CMA can assert jurisdiction if the target's UK turnover exceeds 1 million per annum or the target's share of supply of sales or purchases in the UK exceeds 25% (no increment required).These amendments mirror similar orders made in 2018 enacting lower jurisdictional thresholds for transactions involving targets active in the development or production of items for military or military and civilian use, quantum technology and computing hardware. Both the 2018 and 2020 orders allow UK government intervention on public interest grounds in transactions meeting the lower thresholds in the specified sectors. The UK Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) has published updated guidance taking account of the addition of these three economic sectors.5.Merger review round-up.The CMA continues to have a strong merger pipeline. In July 2020, notable actions include the CMA's announcements that: it hasreferred[27]the anticipated acquisition by Outbrain, Inc. by Taboola.com Ltd to in-depth phase 2 investigation - the parties are active in the supply of content recommendation platform services to publishers in the UK; it isconsidering undertakings[28]in lieu of reference to a phase 2 investigation of the anticipated acquisition by Stryker Corporation of Wright Medical Group N.V. - the phase 1 investigation concluded that the merger may be expected to result in a substantial lessening of competition in the supply of total ankle replacement prostheses products in the UK; it isconsidering undertakings[29]in lieu of reference to a phase 2 investigation of the completed acquisition by ION Investment Group Limited of Broadway Technology Holdings LLC - the parties provide trading systems to financial organizations which allow the trading of foreign exchange and fixed income securities; and itsprovisional findings[30]in its phase 2 investigation into the completed acquisition by Hunter Douglas N.V. of 247 Home Furnishings Ltd - the CMA has provisionally concluded the merger is likely to result in a substantial lessening of competition in the market for UK online retail supply of made to measure blinds.  PolandA. Fines for Idea Bank from the Polish Competition Authority for mis-selling investment products. On July 16, 2020, the Polish Competition and Consumers Protection Authority (UOKiK)issued[31]four decisions against Idea Bank, imposing fines totaling to over PLN 17.2 million on the bank and ordering the bank to pay PLN 38,000 in compensation to each consumer who purchased investment certificates issued by Lartiq. Three of these decisions concern the violation of consumer rights in offering complex financial products: investment certificates, structured deposits, and unit-linked life insurance plans. The fourth decision relates to applying abusive clauses in model agreements.UOKiK found that the bank was providing consumers with incorrect information about unit-linked life insurance plans with funds engaged in the Non-Standard Closed-End Securitization Fund. The company did not fulfill its disclosure obligation towards consumers with respect to the risk associated with the investments, while the risk of the investment was relatively high. The last of the decisions concerns the offering of structured investment deposits by Idea Bank. The bank is also obliged to post information about the decision of the UOKiK on its website. None of these decisions are yet final. Idea Bank may still appeal them. Once the decisions of the President of UOKiK become legally binding, they will have the status of a prejudicial ruling. B. UOKiK further proceedings in the agri-food sector. In July 2020, UOKiKconcluded[32]its inquiry into the biggest companies in the agri-food market; the inquiry was conducted under the Act on Contractual Advantage. UOKiK thoroughly analyzed the terms and conditions of agreements concluded between the retail chains, food producers and their suppliers, the terms of trade and pricing policy, as well as the mutual settlements. As a result, UOKiK initiated proceedings against the commercial retail chains: Auchan Polska, Eurocash, Makro Cash, and Carry Polska, SCA Intermarche - i.e., the entities that have not remedied the identified irregularities and have not settled payments to their suppliers. They have been accused by UOKiK of unfair abuse of contractual advantage. The maximum financial penalty is 3% of the annual turnover for each identified instance of such practices. ItalyA. ICA investigation on the boycott of free open-air cinemas. The Italian Competition Authority (ICA) recentlyopened[33]an investigation into the national association of the cinema and audiovisual industry (ANICA), which represents movie distributors, and the national association of the undertakings who manage cinemas (ANEC), in relation to alleged anticompetitive agreements in breach of Articles 101 TFEU and 2 of Italian law on competition (Law 287/1990). The investigation was opened following complaints from undertakings and associations who organize free open-air film screenings during the summer. The complainants contend that, since Summer 2018, ANICA and ANEC engaged in a collective boycott by denying or limiting access to movies. In particular, the investigation has shown that the movie distributors association issued guidelines and recommendations to its members which limited the licensing of movies to free open-air cinemas.On July 8, 2020, the ICA considered that such decisions were prima facie qualified as restrictions of competition under Article 101 TFEU and 2 of the Italian law on competition and imposed interim measures on ANICA and ANEC, ordering the immediate revocation of any communications on commercialization strategy. B. ICA's conditional approval of the merger between Intesa San Paolo and UBI Banca. On February 17, 2020, Italy's largest bank, Intesa San Paolo (ISP), launched a voluntary public purchase and exchange offer on all ordinary shares of UBI Banca (UBI), the fourth largest banking operator in Italy in terms of volumes handled. On May 12, 2020, the ICAopened[34]an in-depth investigation, stressing that the proposed transaction could lead to the creation or strengthening of ISP's dominant position in several local retail banking markets for current accounts, loans to consumers and small enterprises. Further competition concerns were identified in relation to other markets, such as those concerning the management of assets and funds and the distribution of life insurance products.The first set of remedies offered by ISP - contemplating the divestiture of 400 to 500 branches to Banca Popolare dell'Emilia Romagna (BPER) - was rejected by the ICA on grounds that, among others, the remedy package was not sufficiently clear-cut and, in any case, not suitable to remove the competition concerns identified in several regional markets. On July 16, 2020, the ICA conditionallyauthorized[35]the transaction on the basis of a revised divestiture package, which included a higher number of branches (over 500), most of which could be acquired by BPER. The public purchase and exchange offer process is ongoing. C. ICA's report on removing obstacles to the development of ultra-wide bands. On July 1, 2020, the ICA issued a report to several Italian authorities (i.e., the Government, the Italian Parliament, the Italian Communication Authority, and the Italian Association of Municipalities) on the development of ultra-wideband fixed and mobile infrastructure, aimed at highlighting several obstacles to its development, installation, and operation addressed. In summary, the ICA suggests reducing the administrative burdens and barriers to entry through interventions on the authorization procedures and restrictions to subcontracting. Moreover, the ICA encourages providing tools to support demand - through vouchers and electronic devices for less well-off families - pursuing the objectives of social inclusion and education in the digital world. Finally, the ICA suggests amending contract law in order to prevent operators from claiming unjustified fees in the event of an early withdrawal, e.g., to excessively restrict a customer's ability to change operator. European UnionA. European Court of Justice (ECJ) 1.EU-US data protection shield invalidated.In its July 16, 2020,judgment[36]inData Protection Commissioner v Facebook Ireland and Maximillian Schrems(Case C-311/18), the ECJ invalidated Decision 2016/1250 on the adequacy of the protection provided by the EU-US Data Protection Shield. However, it found that Commission Decision 2010/87 on standard contractual clauses for the transfer of personal data to processors established in third countries is valid. The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) provides that the transfer of such data to a third country may, in principle, take place only if the third country in question ensures an adequate level of data protection. According to the GDPR, the Commission may find that a third country ensures, by reason of its domestic law or its international commitments, an adequate level of protection. In the absence of an adequacy decision, such transfer may take place only if the personal data exporter established in the EU has provided appropriate safeguards, which may arise, in particular, from standard data protection clauses adopted by the Commission, and if data subjects have enforceable rights and effective legal remedies. Furthermore, the GDPR details the conditions under which such a transfer may take place in the absence of an adequacy decision or appropriate safeguards.2.A more open interpretation of the criteria of direct concern.In July 2020, the Advocate General issued anopinion[37]arguing in favor of a more open interpretation of the criteria of direct concern inRgion de Bruxelles-Capitale v. Commission Advocate General Bobek(Case C-352/19 P). The opinion considers that, by denying standing to the Brussels Capital Region concerning the approval of the active substance glyphosate, the General Court erred in law. On March 8, 2018, the Brussels Capital Region brought an action for annulment of Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2017/23241 renewing the approval of the active substance glyphosate before the General Court. By the order under appeal, the General Court declared the action inadmissible on the ground of lack of standing to bring proceedings. More specifically, the General Court held that the Brussels Capital Region was not directly affected by the contested regulation. In its appeal, the Brussels Capital Region asked the EJC to set aside the order under appeal, declare the action for annulment admissible, and refer the case back to the General Court. In his opinion, Advocate General Michal Bobek finds that by denying standing to the Brussels Capital Region, the General Court erred in law, misinterpreting the fourth paragraph of article 263 TFEU, as well as a number of provisions of applicable secondary law. B. EU Commission 1.Internet of things.On July 16, 2020 the EU Commissionlaunched[38]an antitrust competition inquiry into the Internet of Things. The inquiry will focus on consumer products and services that connect to a network, including voice assistants, mobile devices, smart home appliances, and wearables. As part of the inquiry, so-called information requests will be sent out to a wide range of players in the sector. This inquiry could result in both (i) investigations into potential breaches of competition law uncovered by the inquiry, as well as (ii) providing information for the Commission's proposals for the specific regulation of platforms as a part of the Commission's wider and ongoing focus on digital markets and the impact of big data on competition in consumer markets.2.Confidentiality of business secrets in private enforcement.On July 22, 2020, the EU Commission published itsnotice[39]on the communication on the protection of confidential information by national courts in proceedings for the private enforcement of EU competition law in the Official Journal of the European Union (2020/C 242/01). In the notice, the Commission provides the national courts of the Member States with guidance on how to treat requests for the disclosure of evidence containing business secrets.3.State Aid.As of July 27, 2020, the EU Commission has authorized the adoption of 217 state aid measures since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, with a view to enable Member States to directly support their economies against the collateral effects of the outbreak. In detail: 185 measures have been adopted under the State Aid Temporary Framework, aimed at supporting otherwise viable companies that have entered into financial difficulty as a result of the pandemic; 21 measures have been adopted under Article 107(2)b TFEU, in order to provide companies with adequate compensation for damages suffered because of the outbreak; 10 measures have been adopted under Article 107(3)b TFEU, with a view to address more generally the economic downturn deriving from the COVID-19 crisis. A single aid was granted under Article 107(3)c TFEU (i.e., aid to facilitate the development of certain economic activities or of certain economic areas) for the benefit of the major network airline operating in Portugal (TAP Air Portugal), which was not eligible to receive support under the State aid Temporary Framework.4.EU Commission conditionally clears acquisition of Lotos by PKN Orlen.On July 14, 2020, the EU Commissionapproved[40]the acquisition of Grupa Lotos by PKN Orlen. The approval is conditioned on full compliance with a commitments package offered by PKN Orlen.The EU Commission's conditional clearance to the merger of PKN Orlen with Grupa Lotos is one of the most important events for the Polish energy sector this year, as well as the largest merger of Polish companies. PKN ORLEN is the largest company in Poland and a leader in the fuel and energy market in the Central and Eastern Europe and the owner of one of the two Polish refineries (it also owns refineries in Lithuania and the Czech Republic). It operates on the wholesale and retail market of refined oil products in Poland, Austria, Czech Republic, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Germany and Slovakia. The other refinery in Poland is owned by Lotos. It operates mainly in Poland, but also in the Czech Republic, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Slovakia.Despite its initial serious competition concerns expressed in the Statement of Objection, the Commission after a one-year in-depth investigation found that a combination of divestitures and other commitments would enable the purchasers and other competitors to compete effectively with the merged entity in the relevant markets in Poland. The most important conditions of the EU Commission require PKN ORLEN to sell 30% of shares of the Lotos refinery, and also require PKN ORLEN to reserve for the purchaser approximately 50% of the refinery production capacity in diesel and gasoline, as well as access to 389 retail stations in Poland, constituting about 80% of the Lotos network. Interestingly, each of the parties currently is controlled by the Polish state. Ultimately, if the remedies are implemented, a significant portion of the Lotos assets would need to be sold to an independent investor. China In January 2020, China's State Administration of Market Regulation (SAMR), the Chinese governmental authority for regulating market competition, invited public opinion on the Draft Amendment to the Anti-Monopoly Law (the Draft). Solicitation of public comment concluded on Jan. 31, and the Draft is currently undergoing assessment by the State Council and the National People's Congress. While no fixed date for the formal adoption of the Draft has been announced, commentators have indicated that the Draft may be enacted in 2021.The Draft represents the first time that major changes to the current Chinese Anti-Monopoly Law (AML), which has been in effect since 2008, have been proposed. At present, no fixed timetable regarding the adoption of Draft has been announced.The Draft proposes notable changes to the existing AML. These include: (1) adding a definition of 'control' in merger reviews; (2) delegation of merger control revenue thresholds to the SAMR; (3) prohibition on companies aiding or abetting others to engage in a monopoly agreement; (4) special considerations for the internet industry in determining market dominance; and (5) significant increases in maximum fines for antitrust violations, with the maximum fine for monopoly agreements increased to up to 10% of the company's revenue in the previous year, or where the entity involved had no revenue in the previous year, a fine of up to RMB 50 million (approximately USD 7 million). JapanA. JFCT releases details of merger and acquisition reviews. On July 22, 2020, the Japan Fair Trade Commission (JFTC)released[41]the details of its merger and acquisition reviews conducted in the fiscal year 2020 (from April 2019 to March 2020). The JFTC received notifications for 310 mergers in the 2020 fiscal year. The JFTC has also published the details of examination of 10 major merger cases which may contribute to the reference of companies planning business combinations. B. Cease and desist letter issued to uniform makers. On July 11, 2020, the JFTCissued[42]a cease-and-desist order to local uniform makers for violation of Article 3 of the Antimonopoly Act (AMA) in a bid-rigging case tied to the supply of police uniforms to Yamagata Prefecture. One of the makers received a penalty of JPY 1.41 million (approximately USD 13,000). The makers had been colluding to decide on the winners of the supply contracts, as well as colluding on bid prices, since April 1, 2015. No administrative order was issued against one maker, and no penalty was imposed on the other maker, as the two makers sought leniency. Additionally, the JFTC has urged Yamagata Prefecture to improve its system of procuring uniforms for police officers.This article features contributions fromYuji Ogiwara,Gillian Sproul,Hans Urlus,Dawn(Dan) Zhang,Jacomijn Christ,Filip Drgas,Simon Harms,Marta Kownacka,Shuhei Mikiya,Pietro Missanelli,Jose Abel Rivera-Pedroza,Ippei Suzuki,Alan W.

Sono i Fang, Facebook, Amazon, Netflix e Google, societ\u00e0 che negli anni scorsi hanno messo il turbo ai rendimenti azionari statunitensi, totalizzando una capitalizzazione di mercato superiore a 2.700 miliardi di dollari. Ma adesso, per la prima volta, politici e regolatori sembrano intenzionati a intervenire su di essi e i loro modelli di business.Insieme alla crescita del business, degli utili e della generazione di cassa, questi Big Tech hanno visto aumentare anche l\u2019impatto su economie e consumatori, conquistati dai servizi, dalla trasparenza sui prezzi e dalle comodit\u00e0 che offrono. Non sorprende, quindi, che finora non ci sia stata una grande reazione del pubblico all\u2019influenza di queste aziende. </p><p>Adesso, per\u00f2, i regolatori stanno cominciando a metterle sotto la lente, pensiamo alla multa dell\u2019Antitrust inflitta dall\u2019Ue a Google lo scorso giugno o all\u2019azione dell\u2019Ue contro Amazon per gli aiuti di stato illegittimi ricevuti dal Lussemburgo. Le crescenti pressioni normative indicano che i governi sono sempre pi\u00f9 intenzionati a ridurre la posizione dominante degli operatori Fang e di societ\u00e0 analoghe sul mercato. La domanda pi\u00f9 pertinente, a questo punto, \u00e8 se questi leader della disruption tecnologica potranno divenire vittime degli effetti dirompenti che loro stessi hanno provocato. La pubblicit\u00e0 digitale, che ha aiutato le aziende Fang a muovere i primi passi, probabilmente rimarr\u00e0 sotto pressione. I \u00abbot\u00bb e gli algoritmi automatici hanno trasformato questo comparto, attirando miliardi, ma se i dubbi sull\u2019efficacia dei ricavi e delle pratiche pubblicitarie aumenteranno, potranno arrivare a minare seriamente i modelli di business dei social media e la redditivit\u00e0 dei Fang. Anche se i social media oggi sono parte della nostra vita quotidiana, \u00e8 difficile capire quanto realmente forte sia la fedelt\u00e0 al marchio. Le analisi indicano che l\u2019uso dei social media diminuirebbe se i consumatori dovessero pagare per accedervi, o in alternativa i consumatori passerebbero ad altri servizi gratuiti. Questo incide sulla longevit\u00e0 delle imprese. I Fang potrebbero perdere il favore del pubblico come gi\u00e0 accaduto in passato, in settori pi\u00f9 tradizionali, a societ\u00e0 di dimensioni e importanza simili. I titoli Fang oggi sono estremamente redditizi, ma buona parte della liquidit\u00e0 che generano continua a languire nei bilanci, con il risultato di lasciare inutilizzati miliardi di dollari che non vengono restituiti agli azionisti e non contribuiscono a sostenere la crescita economica, e in molti casi non sono neanche tassati. Probabilmente i regolatori cercheranno un modo per prendersi quella che considerano la loro fetta di questa torta.I Big Data, gli algoritmi predittivi e l\u2019intelligenza artificiale che sono alla base del successo dei Fang si basano tutti su una sola cosa: la raccolta e l\u2019analisi delle informazioni. Ma quando i dati in questione riguardano vite e abitudini di privati cittadini, questi non dovrebbero avere voce in capitolo su come tali dati vengono utilizzati? In Europa i regolatori sono d\u2019accordo. Il nuovo Regolamento Generale sulla Protezione dei Dati (Gdpr, General Data Protection Regulation) dell\u2019Ue intende riconoscere ai cittadini pi\u00f9 visibilit\u00e0 e controllo sulle proprie informazioni digitali e consegner\u00e0 ai regolatori un\u2019arma nuova e potente contro le aziende che non agiscono nel migliore interesse dei consumatori. La pressione politica potrebbe inoltre creare un nuovo obbligo relativo al \u00abdovere di diligenza\u00bb per realt\u00e0 come Facebook, ormai diventata una media company a tutti gli effetti. Con i critici che accusano la societ\u00e0 di sfruttare il proprio successo come influencer globale senza assumersi le responsabilit\u00e0 che ne derivano, il governo Usa potrebbe decidere di costringere alcune Big Tech ad addossarsi le onerose responsabilit\u00e0 editoriali e legali che gi\u00e0 pesano sui loro attuali competitor.Finora, i governi occidentali sono stati in genere ben contenti di lasciare che la Silicon Valley si controllasse da s\u00e9. Ma \u00e8 sempre pi\u00f9 chiaro che questo periodo di grazia sta terminando, soprattutto in Europa. Ci aspettiamo quindi che si sviluppi un terreno di confronto sempre pi\u00f9 uniforme tra i disrupter e i tradizionali incumbent.In effetti, appare sempre pi\u00f9 probabile che queste pressioni normative riusciranno ben presto a limitare l\u2019onnipotenza dei Fang negli Stati Uniti e in Europa, mercati ricchi ma piccoli rispetto alle opportunit\u00e0 disponibili in Cina per Baidu, Alibaba e Tencent, sostanzialmente gli equivalenti cinesi (noti con l\u2019acronimo Bat) dei Fang. Finora, i Bat non hanno dovuto affrontare lo stesso livello di crescente scrutinio imposto dai regolatori ai gruppi del Fang. Con una supervisione meno rigorosa e maggiori opportunit\u00e0 a disposizione, le popolazioni asiatiche sono esponenzialmente pi\u00f9 numerose, sembra proprio che i Bat siano pronti a decollare, mentre per i Fang si profilano guai all\u2019orizzonte.

Do you have plans to expand your business to handle a wider range of customer personal information in the future? Listen up, because missteps in complying with data privacy laws have huge consequences. </p><p>Just ask Big Tech. Failure to comply with transparency and notice requirements/obtain consent for ad personalization cost Google approximately $57 million dollars (fines for infringing certain provisions under GDPR can be up to the GREATER of 20 million Euros or 4% of worldwide revenues). The EU's General Data Protection Regulation ('GDPR') regulates the use of its' citizen personal data, including control over the export of EU personal data to countries outside of the EU. Implemented in May of 2018, GDPR simplified the EU's previously fragmented data privacy landscape into a single powerful force. After Google's recent fine, it's safe to say that U.S. businesses have a reason to pay close attention to this new regulation. Under GDPR, both data controllers and data processors suffer the consequences of failing to comply with GDPR. Controllers determine the purpose and means of processing personal data. Processors process personal data on behalf of controllers. For example, if Company A is selling something to consumers and determines the purpose and means of personal data processed and Company B is providing a service to consumers on behalf of Company A, Company A is the controller and Company B is the processor. Joint control of personal data exists where two or more controllers determine the purpose and means of data processing (joint control leads to joint legal responsibility). It's increasingly important to understand how your business partners are handling personal data. If a company you are doing business for or with is unable to explain their data processing habits in a clear and simple way, assume they will be unable to do so for consumers (a key requirement under GDPR). Aside from being choosy about business relationships, what can you do to avoid GDPR fines?Consider the many ways your company might become subject to GDPR. Do you have an employee in the EU? Do you target ads to the EU? Have you collected emails that end in '.uk'? Plan to understand and comply with GDPR requirements. If your company holds data on more than 50,000 people and does business in California, be mindful California passed its own version of GDPR via the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018. Understand the nature of all the data your company is collecting from consumers. Take prompt action to address the handling of any sensitive data. Be ready to explain the processing details for every type of personal data; however, be especially ready to explain how you process anything particularly invasive. Be transparent (concise, clear, and plain language accessible by the average audience member of the target audience) about the way any personal data is used and ensure consumers understand their rights over your company's use of their data. Keep communication to the consumer simple, this is not the time for complex legalese. Provide the information all at once in a single location. Once you've determined the personal data you control or process and ensured your consumer has full understanding of how you handle that personal data, you still need to get unambiguous and clear consent from the consumer for the use of his or her data in exactly the way you intend to use it.After California's passing of its own version of GDPR, it remains to be seen whether the U.S. ends up with federal legislation in alignment with GDPR or a patchwork of state laws layered on top of GDPR requirements. Companies need to plan for growth and act now with the type of forward thinking required to ensure an easy transition into the modern state of heightened awareness (and heightened consequences for mistakes) surrounding data privacy. </p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-JSUP1054111552433156636251762900212</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">JSUP-5263</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VMJ-8831-F03R-N38D-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"675\"/><timeReceived>11:25 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>JD Supra</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 12, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

a/k/a mining and drilling.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Or is it?\u00a0Or is our technology-based economy just extracting natural resources in different ways?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">For many years, the dirty little secret of the digital world has been that it takes a massive amount of energy to run our digital world.</p><p>Silicon Valley likes to project a clean and green image, but the server farms that keep our digital world running consume vast amounts of electricity to process and store information of dubious value.\u00a0What's the energy cost of millions of people looking a cute cat video?</p><p>The electricity needed to operate servers is just the first step.\u00a0The servers also generate heat and more electricity is needed to air condition the server farms.</p><p>Silicon Valley has managed to hide its energy dependence for a long time, but blockchain and coin mining operations are blowing Silicon Valley's cover.</p><p>Blockchain and coins and tokens utilize a worldwide network of computers organized into \"nodes.\"\u00a0In an ordinary data network, data is stored on one server, but that opens the network to hacking.\u00a0Blockchain networks protect data integrity by storing and processing the same data on thousands of computer nodes.\u00a0Someone would have to hack thousands of nodes to change the data.</p><p>That solves Silicon Valley's vulnerability to hacking, but the massive duplication is an electricity hog.\u00a0</p><p>Of course, what is stored on the blocks of a blockchain isn't necessarily raw data.\u00a0The blocks usually contain hashes that represent the data.\u00a0Hashes can turn very large amounts of data into much shorter strings of data.\u00a0The common 256-character hash may represent millions bits of information.</p><p>The purpose of a hash isn't to give you instant access to all the information.\u00a0The purpose is to allow you to verify the information by comparing hashes.\u00a0If all 256 characters of two hashes match perfectly, you know they represent exactly the same data.</p><p>The two biggest expenses of the people who operate the blockchain nodes are buying the computer hardware and paying the electric bills to operate them.</p><p>This has substantially increased the demand for certain types of computers and for cheap electricity.\u00a0Generally, electricity generated by dams is the cheapest source of electricity.\u00a0This has set off a gold rush of miners who are building large coin mining operations close to hydroelectric power sources.\u00a0That makes the Pacific Northwest America's coin mining capital.</p><p>Of course, increased demand for electric power competes with other industries and homes that also use electricity and the water that generates electric power.\u00a0Droughts decrease electricity supply.</p><p>In some places, local towns have banned additional coin mining operations.\u00a0There are running battles between locals, power companies and miners.\u00a0Allegedly, miners have been making threats to power companies.</p><p>This reminds us of the range wars in old western movies where famers, cattlemen and sheepherders battled over access to water and grasslands.</p><p>Will we have similar range wars between coin miners and everyone else?\u00a0</p><p>Will greens begin protesting big tech the way they oppose big oil and big coal?</p><p>Stranger things have happened.\u00a0Facebook used to be a popular company.\u00a0Now, just about everyone is upset with Facebook about something. \u00a0Who would have thought that so many people would unfriend poor Mark Zuckerberg?</p><p>Jim Verdonik leads Ward and Smith's fintech group in Raleigh and is the author of Crowdfunding: A Legal Guide to Investment and Platform Regulation.\u00a0Reach Jim at <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:jfv@wardandsmith.com\">jfv@wardandsmith.com</email></p><p>Did you find this article useful?

Not only have none of the predicted negative consequences occurred since Pai's more free-market version of net neutrality was enacted, but to the contrary data speeds have risen sharply, investment is up, and there have been no notable episodes of discrimination by ISPs.</p><p> The heart of the Pai order is a transparency rule, which replaces heavy-handed regulation with market discipline - in effect, if you want to treat traffic in a non-neutral fashion you can, but you have to explain what you're doing to your customers.</p><p> Ironically, the Big Tech companies continue to pursue reimposition of the heavy-handed Obama neutrality regulations on ISPs even as they fend off efforts to similarly regulate themselves or limit their liability protections.</p><p> But the success of the Pai order suggests a much more elegant solution: Big Tech should be subject to a transparency rule and, if they do in fact discriminate against certain content, they should explain how to their customers.</p><p> Such a rule could require clear disclosure of how traffic is treated, and clear specification of the standards used for limiting speech, including any possible viewpoint discrimination. Platforms that represent themselves to the public as neutral could be subject to civil complaints if they violate those representations.</p><p> A transparency rule would avoid the perils of more heavy-handed government regulation, dissipate the distrust toward Big Tech from the left and right, and harmonize the rules for ISPs with the rules for the edge giants they are increasingly competing with in the advertising market.</p><p> Crafting a transparency rule for Big Tech is easier said than done, of course. But just as with regulation of ISPs, it could be the least-bad option.</p><p> Copyright 2019 Phil Kerpen, distributed by Cagle Cartoons newspaper syndicate.

Covid-19 decimated us with postponements or cancellations of graduations, weddings and birthday parties since early March.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In spite of all the lockdowns and damage to our economy, I remain hopeful about the future. We finally received PPP funding to pay our workers. People are using my company to host smaller events that respect social distancing, and my creditors are giving us a break. I see a light at the end of the tunnel.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But members of Congress are intent on turning off the lights for good. They just held a hearing where they attacked big tech companies like Alphabet Inc.-owned Google and Facebook that serve as our lifeline. They believe that because big tech is big, somehow it's bad for everyone. That's not true for my small business, and it infuriates me that Congress is willing to sacrifice the futures of countless small businesses just to score political points.</p><p>My Palo Alto-based company rents out party equipment like helium tanks, popcorn and cotton candy machines, even tables and chairs. It's a very specific business. We have lots of competition, which means we must be able to offer competitive prices. A dip in the economy can make a huge difference in how many events we work and how much we earn annually.</p><p>Luckily, Google Ads help us cut down on costs. When my wife and I first opened our doors, we advertised in the Yellow Pages, but it was expensive and eating away at our profits. It wasn't sustainable. Google Ads are cheaper and increased sales by 900%. Today, we rely on smart and engaging digital advertising that attracts customers to our services. Without the digital safety net, we wouldn't have a business to save.</p><p>It's not right for politicians to use this moment to attack the companies that help businesses like mine. After everything we've been through, if companies like Google or Facebook are broken up, it would be a punch in the gut to every small business owner that's fighting to stay afloat. If I have to go back to the Yellow Pages and other traditional forms of advertising right now, it would be devastating.</p><p>I came here from Mexico. Through hard work and persistence, my wife and I have built a wonderful life. We have a beautiful family, a small home and a company that allows us to be a part of our customers' happy events. As immigrants, we took our shot as entrepreneurs and got a little lucky. Still, it would never have happened for us - and I'm sure for thousands or perhaps millions of other small businesses - without digital platforms.</p><p>Regardless of what happens, we will keep working hard. We're going to adapt to this new normal and restructure our business to account for social distancing and tighter budgets. All we're asking for is a little help from the elected officials who make the important decisions that affect whether we succeed or fail. I don't know if they recognize how many small businesses like mine are built on top of digital platforms, and the importance of consumer reviews that help validate small businesses.</p><p>If new laws or lawsuits targeting Big Tech make my digital advertising prices go up, make my ads less effective or mean that every customer review will have to be checked out by a lawyer before it is posted, my business and many more small businesses will suffer. I believe in commonsense regulations, but we must be smart about it.</p><p>With Covid-19 having driven countless people out of business already, this would be the worst time for politicians to bring down the digital platforms that are offering us a lifeline now and in the future.</p><p>Feliciano Zavala is the president of Peninsula Party Rentals in Palo Alto and is a member of the Connected Commerce Council, a membership group for digitally empowered small businesses.</p><p>Did you find this article useful?

A party that has long preached limited government, free expression and deregulation now has an administration pondering a politically motivated investigation of social media intended to justify a new wave of regulations.<br/><br/>Without question, social media companies such as Facebook, Twitter and YouTube as well as Google, the web's dominant search engine, have amassed great power in recent years and have had an almost unimaginable impact on politics and culture.<br/><br/>Twitter has long been the social media weapon of choice for conspiracy theorists and provocateurs such as Alex Jones. Jones is peddler of lies, most notably that the school shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, in 2012 was a hoax.<br/><br/>One by one, social media companies have come to the conclusion that they have no obligation to amplify his voice. On Thursday, Twitter became the last major company to ban or greatly limit him from its platform.<br/><br/>Enter Big Government: GOP edition.<br/><br/>Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced last week that he would convene a meeting with states to discuss ways that social media companies stifle free expression. This comes after some Republican members of Congress and the president complained that tech companies were stifling conservative voices.<br/><br/>We can think of nothing more repulsive to the values of the Constitution, or antithetical to Republican beliefs, than a government inquiry into the role of media in disseminating speech.<br/><br/>Do social media companies stifle some legitimate speech? Almost certainly they do. But if people have a beef with that, they should take it up with the various companies, not run to the government. What they will find is that such tech companies restrict speech in a limited number of instances to protect the quality of their product, and thus to make more money.<br/><br/>Social media companies are money-grubbing capitalists out to make a buck. Surely, the Republican Party can see the value in that, even in the age of Trump.<br/><br/>USA TODAY's editorial opinions are decided by its Editorial Board, separate from the news staff.  </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">RECSEA-uscp-71vk5lxqkjn1c5zxdns5</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">RECSEA2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5T80-GXT1-F0BC-M2SP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">317178</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-09-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"395\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Record Searchlight All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Record Searchlight (Redding, California)</publicationName><edition>1, Searchlight Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"09\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>September 13, 2018 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC000CFK7</classCode><className>TWITTER INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>TWTR (NYSE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"88\"><className>Relations With Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDYwNzQwQkYzMTI5NEFCMTkyMDM3QzFCNzE2MUE4MUM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QURCRDNBRjBGRTE0NEFBRUEzNUU1MzFGQjg3MTM4MDI</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000D0VJ</classCode><className>SOCIAL MEDIA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009TD5</classCode><className>US REPUBLICAN PARTY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DL87</classCode><className>DEMOCRACIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009RD1</classCode><className>INTERNET SOCIAL NETWORKING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000D0UY</classCode><className>US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2012</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>N813940MM</classCode><className>POLITICAL PARTIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DF5U</classCode><className>US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2016</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001669</classCode><className>TALKS &amp;

Adrian Wooldridge considered it inevitable that executives at Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google and Microsoft would be seen by the public in the same malign fashion as bankers and oil barons - symbols of a greedy nerd version of avaricious capitalism.</p><p><br/><br/>Wooldridge was right about the backlash - but he probably didn't count on how broad an indictment critics of the tech giants would bring. It was predictable that big tech companies would stand accused of operating in monopolistic ways and of stealthily monetizing information about individuals acquired from their online activities. But it's not just these practices that have poked holes in Silicon Valley's bubble of public regard and admiration. It's also how the tech giants have behaved in other ways.<br/><br/>With the release of its iPhone X, Apple joined Facebook and Google as companies pursuing facial recognition technologies that portend an end to old concepts of privacy. Despite their insistence otherwise, those firms and Microsoft have been called de facto silent partners to U.S. intelligence agencies' attempts to vacuum up information from people around the world without their consent. And despite all the benefits they bring, Facebook and Google are villains to both sides of the culture wars.<br/><br/>They're accused of enforcing left-wing speech codes on acceptable commentary and enabling the far right to spread election-skewing \"fake news\" and bigotry.<br/><br/>Now the backlash may be moving beyond rhetoric. In June, European Union regulators slammed Google with a record $2.7 billion fine for seeking to profit by manipulating online search requests.<br/><br/>In the U.S., the traditional American fear of giant corporations has begun to manifest itself. The same impulse that led to the break-up of Standard Oil in 1911 and AT&amp;T in 1982 is flaring as awareness grows of Google's and Facebook's hegemony in advertising and the realization sets in that Amazon may destroy more American jobs than China.<br/><br/>Google's troubles continued with an Aug. 30 report in The New York Times that Eric Schmidt of Google's parent company Alphabet had pressured the New America Foundation think tank to push out scholar Barry Lynn and his Open Markets research team. Lynn's sin? Publicly applauding the EU's fine against Google. Such bullying will haunt Google - at least if the anti-monopoly backlash plays out according to the traditional American script. But that's a huge if. Standard Oil and AT&amp;T had monopolistic control of gasoline supplies and telephone service, respectively. Google's and Facebook's chief services are addictive - and free.<br/><br/>Still, as everyday life makes clear, Americans are stirred up. The Trump and Sanders wings of the two largest political parties want and expect dramatic change. If they get their way, the most powerful forces in this country are likely to feel the fallout. And that is a category that very much includes Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google and Microsoft.  </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TIMREC-uscpcent02-6wr2gwnjcld19tf2zyja</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TIMREC2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PHF-3H51-F0BC-M0D2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">317182</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-12-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"520\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Wichita Falls Times Record News All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Times Record News (Wichita Falls, Texas)</publicationName><edition>1, TimesRecordNews Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"09\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>September 19, 2017 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>MSFT (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DLA3</classCode><className>ECONOMICS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DLDV</classCode><className>IDENTIFICATION TECHNOLOGIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001865</classCode><className>WRITERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>N551112MM</classCode><className>HOLDING COMPANIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST000CMR7</classCode><className>PARENT COMPANIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX001809</classCode><className>VOICE RECOGNITION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>STX001700</classCode><className>TELEPHONE BILLING FRAUD</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>STX000938</classCode><className>INTELLIGENCE SERVICES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>STX000722</classCode><className>FINES &amp;

A significant part of our success comes from the many low-cost digital tools offered by large tech companies.  </p><p>Their cheap advertising options, as well as business tools and e-commerce solutions, have opened up new windows of opportunity for our growing social venture. That's why it is disappointing to hear lawmakers and politicians boast about wanting to change or even split up the companies that keep us going.<br/><br/> Our story started as terrifying, but today is happy and hopeful. Our daughter was diagnosed with an aggressive form of cancer at age five. It was a trying time for us, but she was so brave throughout the treatments and hardly ever complained about the toll it took on her physically.<br/><br/> While completing her yearlong chemo treatment, our once-confident daughter wouldn't leave the house. She lost her hair, as is typical for chemo patients, and was embarrassed. We tried everything from hats (too hot) to wigs (itchy) to scarfs (uncomfortable).<br/><br/> Nothing worked until she threw on a t-shirt hoodie. It was perfect \u2013 lightweight and fun, plus it renewed her self-confidence because she could put the hoodie on or off whenever she pleased.<br/><br/> My daughter's confidence was back, and I was onto something. I decided to gift fashionable hoodies to children fighting cancer and their siblings. We would also sell hoodies online and use the proceeds to gift more hoodies to cancer-stricken children. I left my job as a data consultant and opened up shop in our basement.<br/><br/> My data background taught me that this enterprise would be tricky financially and require a strong e-presence to keep costs low. We used GoDaddy and Wix to create a website and QuickBooks to keep our finances in order.<br/><br/> Our most significant breakthrough came with Facebook ads, an invaluable resource to reaching customers affordably. We target customers with fun and engaging ads based on age, hobbies, and even if they have a connection to pediatric cancer. The ads drum up interest and have been a game changer in driving website visits. Facebook ads help us sell hoodies and raise more money.<br/><br/> Digital marketing platforms make it easy to test different messages to different audiences. We use MailChimp for free email marketing and integrate our mailing list with Google Analytics for website metrics \u2013 who clicks on the ads, which hoodies pique customers' interest and how we can market them better. We have Google Suite for internal operations and PayPal for shipping. It's all so easy.<br/><br/> Digital tools allow us to sell more shirts year after year, which means we donate more shirts to kids with cancer. We have given more than 7,000 hoodies so far, and our sales doubled last year.<br/><br/> These tools are essential, but they won't be around forever if some elected officials' desire to break up tech companies comes to fruition. We only have two employees and some volunteers. Every dollar we save in the cost of running our business means more kids we can help battling cancer. Digital tools and platforms have helped us help more kids than I dreamed possible.<br/><br/> Tech regulation is an important debate, but an essential component of that debate is the positive impact big tech has on small nonprofits. As Congress holds hearings on this issue, I urge Congressman Ken Buck and the other members of the House Antitrust, Commercial, and Administrative Law Committee to keep us in mind before making any reckless decisions. They may be aimed at \"big tech,\" but if they're not careful, they will end up hurting those they do not intend.<br/><br/> Allison Yacht is the founder and executive director of BraveHoods in Longmont and is a member of the Connected Commerce Council.  </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DLYCAM-a27692b112a1472db9ab9095483a9efb37b817ea</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DLYCAM2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60G2-8JD1-DY6H-Y0YJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">317177</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"634\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Prairie Mountain Publishing All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Daily Camera (Boulder, Colorado)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 28, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0009LLQ</classCode><className>GO DADDY GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC00023HP</classCode><className>PAYPAL HOLDINGS INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The bill meant to enhance privacy rights and consumer protection for residents of California, U.S. Given the size and importance of the state, the bill is of significance to the U.S. as a whole and to most of the world.To explore the impact on businesses, Anne Kimbol[2], Chief Privacy Officer for HITRUST[3] (a data protection standards development and certification organization) looks at how firms can identify and mitigate gaps and risks in their existing programs in order to comply with CCPA. DJ: What are the key points from the CCPA? Anne Kimbol: The CCPA focuses on the sale of personal information by for profit companies that meet certain revenue or records thresholds. </p><p>The definition of sale is fairly broad, although there are still questions about its exact applicability. The philosophy behind the law is that individuals should have control over how their data is used when companies are using or sharing it for commercial reasons. Before the Cambridge Analytica and related scandals, most people thought their data was used by companies to provide the particular service they sought and were unaware of the amount or value of disclosures of their personal information. Whether the law works as intended, only time will tell.  DJ: Why is HITRUST providing a strong basis for a CCPA assessment to its new release of its information risk and compliance framework? Kimbol: There are two reasons. The first is that almost every for profit business in the United States will have to comply with the CCPA given the number of consumers and size of the economy of California. HITRUST recognizes that in order to assess their compliance, these companies need a comprehensive information risk management framework through which to perform a risk-based analysis of their current privacy and security programs. Additionally, while the CCPA's focus on for profit businesses limits its applicability somewhat, the law is serving as a model for bills filed in other state legislatures and has created an expectation among individuals that they can have access to their data, ask for it to be deleted or corrected, and limit its uses. As is evident in the controls included in the HITRUST CSF, HITRUST believes compliance with laws should be a baseline not the goal of any information risk management program. Even if the CCPA does not apply to a particular business or use of data, that does not mean its requirements should be ignored. Consumer expectations around information risk management are increasing, and businesses must be prepared to answer questions about what measures they are taking to protect the data they hold. DJ: How is HITRUST is helping organizations quickly identify and mitigate gaps and risks in their existing programs? Kimbol: By performing a HITRUST CSF assessment, organizations can identify, using a risk-based approach, the strengths and weaknesses in their information risk management program. This not only identifies for them potential corrective action plans but allows them to prioritize resources to address the most crucial gaps first. While no system is unbreachable, by knowing and addressing its weaknesses, an organization can reduce the risk to its systems and data. DJ: How different is the CCPA - from the EU's GDPR? Kimbol: The CCPA is just different enough from the GDPR to create confusion in terms of compliance. California has a narrower definition of companies to which it applies and has a larger focus on revenue received from the sharing of data than GDPR. California also protects information that is identifiable to a household or device, which is unique and raises complex questions when it comes to the exercise of data subject rights. The exact rights a data subject has under the two fit the same basic description - notice, consent, access, portability, etc. - but the details of the rights themselves and how to exercise them vary substantially.  DJ: What work has HITRUST with the EU GDPR? Kimbol: HITRUST began including the GDPR in version 9.1 of the HITRUST CSF. Given its broad application, a substantial number of companies have had to look at complying with EU data protection law for the first time under GDPR. Ensuring that the HITRUST CSF contains GDPR information and helps companies comply with the regulation is key to the HITRUST Approach of Assess Once, Report Many. We are also following the GDPR certification process authorized under the regulation. We have taken part in open comment periods, drafted an application to become an accredited certification body, and submitted an application for the HITRUST CSF to be recognized as proper certification standards for the European Data Protection Seal, a designation made by the European Data Protection Board. While the details of the certification process have not been finalized in the EU, HITRUST is following it closely and is ready to respond when the time is right.  DJ: How is HITRUST supporting the development and implementation of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework? Kimbol: HITRUST is a strong supporter of NIST and the work they do to help enhance information protection in the United States and worldwide. The NIST Cybersecurity Framework provides a mechanism for assessing and maturing a cybersecurity program. The HITRUST CSF provides the details needed to implement those objectives and an assurance program to provide a means of objectively demonstrating the implementation of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework. With a HITRUST CSF Validated Assessment Report, clients receive a scorecard comparing their programs with the NIST cybersecurity objectives. If the program is of a certain standard, a HITRUST NIST Cybersecurity Framework certification will be provided. By including the NIST Cybersecurity Framework in the HITRUST CSF, HITRUST acknowledges its importance and value in the field while translating its requirements into implementable and assessable controls.DJ: Where do you see the future of privacy regulations heading? Kimbol: I think we will continue to see individual states in the US and individual countries worldwide developing their own privacy laws, each of which is likely to be just different enough to cause compliance and translation difficulties. Ideally, there would be a strong and enforceable international framework on privacy rights. Each country or division thereof would certainly have its own specific details, based on its own culture and norms, and no country would want to give up its sovereignty on such a key issue.  That said, a patchwork of laws does a disservice to individuals and society. Data has immense promise in helping solve some of our greatest problems, including public health issues, which can only be met if individuals feel comfortable sharing their data with entities who know how they can or cannot use it. We have bases for such a framework through the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Privacy Principles, Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Privacy Framework, and the Convention for the Protection of Individuals with Regard to Automatic Processing of Personal Data (Convention 108).  While Convention 108 was recently updated, we need to ensure that any such framework recognizes the weaknesses in the current notice and consent model, which is technically followed by big tech today. While it will never be a simple issue, we can protect people's privacy and use data for good; we just need to work together to make it happen.

Major progress has been made due to availability of massive data, powerful computing architectures and machine learning advancement. AI is playing an increasing role across domains such as healthcare, education, mobility and smart homes.</p><p>However, AI has also caused concerns all over the world, mainly because of a lack of ethical awareness and penetration of individual privacy. For example, the AI applications in facial recognition.</p><p>Joy Buolamwini, a computer scientist at the MIT Media Lab, a research laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, presented findings of her research on intersectional accuracy disparities in commercial gender classifications. In her research, Buolamwini showed facial recognition systems developed by tech companies such as Amazon, Microsoft and Google 1,000 faces and asked them to identify gender. The algorithms misidentified Michelle Obama, Oprah Winfrey and Serena Williams, the three iconic dark-skinned women, as male.</p><p>The bias in code can lead to discrimination against underrepresented groups and the most vulnerable individuals, Buolamwini said.</p><p>She also founded Algorithmic Justice League, a program through which she aims to highlight collective and individual harms that AI can cause - loss of opportunities, social stigmatization, workplace discrimination and inequality - and advocate for changes concerning regulating big tech companies and checking government's application of AI.</p><p>One of the key questions around AI governance and ethics, as a majority of attendees agreed, is how to regulate big tech companies.</p><p>This \"nascent technology will help us build powerful new materials, understand the climate in new ways and generate far more efficient energy - it could even cure cancer,\" said Eric Schmidt, former Google CEO and current technical advisor to Alphabet Inc.</p><p>This is all good, he continued. \"I don't want us, in these complicated debates about what we are doing, to forget that the scientists here at Stanford and other places are making progress on problems which were thought to be unsolvable ... because (without AI) they couldn't do the math at scale.\"</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/global/img/attachement/jpg/site1/20191112/a41f726719b21f34399f3c.jpg\">Link to Image</url></p><p>However, Marietje Schaake, a HAI International Policy Fellow and Dutch former member of the European Parliament who worked to pass the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation, argued that AI's potential shouldn't obscure its potential harms, which the law can help mitigate.</p><p>Large technology companies have a lot of power, Schaake said. \"And with great power should come great responsibility, or at least modesty. Some of the outcomes of pattern recognition or machine learning are reason for such serious concerns that pauses are justified. I don't think that everything that's possible should also be put in the wild or into society as part of this often quoted 'race for dominance'. We need to actually answer the question, collectively, 'How much risk are we willing to take?'\"</p><p>Like it or not, the age of AI is coming, and fast, and there is plenty to be concerned about, wrote Stanford HAI co-directors Fei-Fei Li and John Etchemendy.</p><p>The two believe the real threat lies in the fact that \"Most of the world, including the United States, is unprepared to reap many of the economic and societal benefits offered by AI or mitigate the inevitable risks\".</p><p>Getting there will take decades, they said. \"Yet, AI applications are advancing faster than our policies or institutions at a time in which science and technology are being underfunded, under-supported and even challenged. It's a national emergency in the making.\"</p><p>They asked the US government to commit $120 billion in research, data and computing resources, education and startup capital over the next decade to support a bold human-centered AI framework in order to retain America's competence and leading position in this field.</p><p>An open dialogue and collaboration among nations regarding AI research and governance is important, attendees said. Given the complexity of cultural differences and motivation variations among international stakeholders, however, it's unrealistic for the whole world to create a single AI vision and a once-and-for-all solution to the problems and issues.</p><p>Nevertheless, governments across the continents are in action.</p><p>In Europe, the European Union issued its first draft of the ethical guidelines for the development, deployment and use of AI in Dec 2018, an important step toward innovative and trustworthy AI \"made in Europe'\".</p><p>In Feb, the US president signed an executive order revealing the country's cohesive plan for US leadership in AI development. \"Continued American leadership in Artificial Intelligence is of paramount importance to maintaining the economic and national security of the United States,\" he said.</p><p>In China, the National New Generation Artificial Intelligence Governance Committee, which is under the Ministry of Science and Technology, in June released the New Generation AI Governance Principles - Developing Responsible AI.</p><p>The first official document of its kind issued in China on AI governance ethics, the principles include harmony and friendship, fairness and justice, inclusive and sharing, privacy protection, safety and controllability, shared responsibility, open collaboration and agile governance.</p><p>\"We want to ensure the reliability and safety of AI while promoting economic, social and ecological sustainable development,\" said Zhang Xu, deputy director of the strategic planning department under the Ministry of Science and Technology.</p><p>\"AI is advancing rapidly, but we still have time to get it right - if we act now,\" said Fei-fei Li.</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:junechang@chinadailyusa.com\">junechang@chinadailyusa.com</email></p><p>(China Daily Global 11/12/2019 page3)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CHNDLY-37522220</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CHNDLY2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XGK-0W81-DXKD-J3VN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">401290</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1085\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 China Daily Information Co All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>China Daily European Edition</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"4848\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"11\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>November 12, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"62\"><classCode>CC0002JIM</classCode><className>ALPHABET INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Calling Facebook a \"bully,\" \"immoral\" and the tech equivalent of the \"big polluters\" and climate killers he fought in the past, Guilbeault seemed to be running advance interference for the Trudeau government's looming plans to tax and regulate Google, Facebook and other tech companies.</p><p>Ottawa is expected to outline some aspects of its Big Tech attack in next week's throne speech. The apparent trigger for Guilbeault's multimedia appearances was news from Australia that Facebook would \"stop allowing\" news publishers and others from sharing local and international news if the government went ahead with its plan to force the social media giant to pay news publishers for the news and other media content that flows over the internet.</p><p>In a blog post on Aug. 31, Facebook's managing director in Australia warned that Aussie regulators are drafting a competition policy that would require Facebook to negotiate with a cabal of Australian media corporations over how much money the tech giant should pay as compensation for some of the news content that runs on their platforms. \"Assuming this draft code becomes law, we will reluctantly stop allowing publishers and people in Australia from sharing local and international news on Facebook and Instagram,\" he wrote.</p><p>Google Australia did not go that far, but it raised the same objections to the government's plan. The proposed \"news media content code,\" it said, \"would put the free services you use at risk in Australia.\"</p><p>Whether Ottawa has plans for a similar money-sharing code isn't known, although Guilbeault's rush to denounce Facebook does suggest something comparable is flying around the Liberal policy bat cave. He attacked Facebook for its \"bullying attitudes\" and said that Canada stands with Australia and won't tolerate \"any form of threats\" from the tech industry. He also warned Facebook that if it doesn't go along with governments around the world, it will face serious problems.</p><p>So what's all this about? What is this Australian bargaining code that Big Tech opposes and that Canada and other countries are supposedly looking at as one of the ways to fiscally tame the Big Tech monsters? It's a multi-billion-dollar Aussie battle between the tech giants and Australia's news giants, including Rupert Murdoch's News Corp., over snippets. The battle demonstrates the folly of looking at the tech economy through the wonky prism of competition theory and policy.</p><p>Snippets include the short extracts of news stories that appear on Facebook and in Google news searches. A Google search for the latest Donald Trump folly will produce a string of snippets, including headlines and one-sentence summaries from scores of media sources. The reader then clicks on the snippet and is taken to the media company's website for access to the full report.</p><p>Facebook and Google do not pay for snippets, which are supplied without cost by media companies that seek exposure for their content. Media companies such as News Corp. can sell ads around the full version of the stories that appear on their websites. Or they could charge readers by selling subscriptions.</p><p>In Australia, as elsewhere, news organizations argue that Facebook and Google are unfairly grabbing advertising dollars using free snippet content supplied by the media companies. To compensate, the news companies say the tech giants should pay for the use of the snippets. On the other side, theoretically, tech giants could also request payment from media companies for access to their internet platforms.</p><p>Enter the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), which operates one of the world's most activist competition enforcement agencies. In July, ACCC chair Rod Sims announced a \"draft mandatory code,\" which would enable Australian media to \"bargain with\" Google and Facebook to \"quickly secure fair payment for news content.\" To make sure the bargaining takes place fairly and promptly, Sims said a government-appointed arbitrator would move to force a deal after 45 days.</p><p>Note the competition policy irony. The proposed bargaining model involves creating a government-mandated cartel of Australian media companies that will be encouraged to collude in their financial negotiations with Facebook and Google - the theory being that the media companies do not have the bargaining power necessary to extract large sums from the tech giants.</p><p>And the media companies do want large sums for their snippets. Earlier this year, Australia's major broadcaster suggested that Google and Facebook should pay US$432 million ($570 million) to news organizations in compensation.</p><p>On the other side of the negotiations, Facebook estimated that Australian media companies already make big bucks off their free snippets. \"Over the first five months of 2020 we sent 2.3 billion clicks from Facebook's News Feed back to Australian news websites at no charge - additional traffic worth an estimated A$200 million ($193 million) to Australian publishers.\"</p><p>Facebook says that the ACCC's mandatory code establishes a system the leaves Facebook with a choice of either removing news entirely from its site, or \"accepting a system that let's publishers charge us for as much content as they want at a price with no clear limits.\"</p><p>That's just a snippet of what can be expected to come from Steven Guilbeault and the government in Ottawa as early as next week. !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2020 Postmedia Network Inc.

The apparent trigger for Guilbeault's multimedia appearances was news from Australia that Facebook would \"stop allowing\" news publishers and others from sharing local and international news if the government went ahead with its plan to force the social media giant to pay news publishers for the news and other media content that flows over the internet.</p><p>In a blog post on Aug. 31, Facebook's managing director in Australia warned that Aussie regulators are drafting a competition policy that would require Facebook to negotiate with a cabal of Australian media corporations over how much money the tech giant should pay as compensation for some of the news content that runs on their platforms. \"Assuming this draft code becomes law, we will reluctantly stop allowing publishers and people in Australia from sharing local and international news on Facebook and Instagram,\" he wrote.</p><p>Google Australia did not go that far, but it raised the same objections to the government's plan. The proposed \"news media content code,\" it said, \"would put the free services you use at risk in Australia.\"</p><p>Whether Ottawa has plans for a similar money-sharing code isn't known, although Guilbeault's rush to denounce Facebook does suggest something comparable is flying around the Liberal policy bat cave. He attacked Facebook for its \"bullying attitudes\" and said that Canada stands with Australia and won't tolerate \"any form of threats\" from the tech industry. He also warned Facebook that if it doesn't go along with governments around the world, it will face serious problems.</p><p>So what's all this about? What is this Australian bargaining code that Big Tech opposes and that Canada and other countries are supposedly looking at as one of the ways to fiscally tame the Big Tech monsters? It's a multi-billion-dollar Aussie battle between the tech giants and Australia's news giants, including Rupert Murdoch's News Corp., over snippets. The battle demonstrates the folly of looking at the tech economy through the wonky prism of competition theory and policy.</p><p>Snippets include the short extracts of news stories that appear on Facebook and in Google news searches. A Google search for the latest Donald Trump folly will produce a string of snippets, including headlines and one-sentence summaries from scores of media sources. The reader then clicks on the snippet and is taken to the media company's website for access to the full report.</p><p>Facebook and Google do not pay for snippets, which are supplied without cost by media companies that seek exposure for their content. Media companies such as News Corp. can sell ads around the full version of the stories that appear on their websites. Or they could charge readers by selling subscriptions.</p><p>In Australia, as elsewhere, news organizations argue that Facebook and Google are unfairly grabbing advertising dollars using free snippet content supplied by the media companies. To compensate, the news companies say the tech giants should pay for the use of the snippets. On the other side, theoretically, tech giants could also request payment from media companies for access to their internet platforms.</p><p>Enter the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), which operates one of the world's most activist competition enforcement agencies. In July, ACCC chair Rod Sims announced a \"draft mandatory code,\" which would enable Australian media to \"bargain with\" Google and Facebook to \"quickly secure fair payment for news content.\" To make sure the bargaining takes place fairly and promptly, Sims said a government-appointed arbitrator would move to force a deal after 45 days.</p><p>Note the competition policy irony. The proposed bargaining model involves creating a government-mandated cartel of Australian media companies that will be encouraged to collude in their financial negotiations with Facebook and Google - the theory being that the media companies do not have the bargaining power necessary to extract large sums from the tech giants.</p><p>And the media companies do want large sums for their snippets. Earlier this year, Australia's major broadcaster suggested that Google and Facebook should pay US$432 million ($570 million) to news organizations in compensation.</p><p>On the other side of the negotiations, Facebook estimated that Australian media companies already make big bucks off their free snippets. \"Over the first five months of 2020 we sent 2.3 billion clicks from Facebook's News Feed back to Australian news websites at no charge - additional traffic worth an estimated A$200 million ($193 million) to Australian publishers.\"</p><p>Facebook says that the ACCC's mandatory code establishes a system the leaves Facebook with a choice of either removing news entirely from its site, or \"accepting a system that let's publishers charge us for as much content as they want at a price with no clear limits.\"</p><p>That's just a snippet of what can be expected to come from Steven Guilbeault and the government in Ottawa as early as next week. !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2020 Postmedia Network Inc.

Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it is Wednesday, February 28th.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Your top stories right now at 7:00 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Return of the bears -- the Dow snapping a three-day winning streak  yesterday, closing down nearly 300 points.  Investors were spooked after  Federal Reserve Chairman J. Powell signaled that the strong economy could  lead to more interest rate hikes.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Futures indicating the markets are bouncing back a bit today.  Take a look.   We are basically back at the break-even level.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We've seen a pretty selloff in the last 10 minutes actually.  The Dow  Industrials now flat, as is the S&amp;P 500.  Nasdaq up a point.  But again  these are well off of the highs of the morning here. </p><p>Investors are waiting on the fourth quarter GDP.  It's due out in about 90  minutes.  Economists are looking for the GDP to show growth of 2.5 percent  in the fourth quarter.</p><p>In Europe this morning, stocks are lower across the board.  Take a look.   FT 100, CAC 40, DAX index down between a third of a percent and one-half of  1 percent.</p><p>In Asia overnight, red across the board.  Worst performers were in Hong  Kong and Japan, down 1.5 percent apiece.</p><p>The battle over gun control back in the U.S. as the students in Parkland,  Florida return to school today.  President Trump is set to host a  bipartisan meeting with lawmakers as they work to end gun violence.</p><p>Vice President Mike Pence promised the White House will do all it can to  keep students safe.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MIKE PENCE, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  No child, no teacher  should ever be in danger in an American school.  I want to make you a  promise.  We will not rest until we make our schools safe again.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  More on the debate coming up this morning.</p><p>Meanwhile FISA fight -- the details as Attorney General Jeff Sessions says  that the Justice Department will investigate potential abuses of the  Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act by the Obama administration against  the Trump campaign.</p><p>Then Jim Comey getting cheeky -- listen to this.  The former FBI director  takes yet another shot at President Trump on Twitter.  We'll tell you about  that.</p><p>Then Bill Gates slamming bitcoin -- why he says the crypto currency is  killing people.</p><p>And a dangerous viral trend -- how the Cinderella diet is putting people's  health at risk.</p><p>We've got all those stories coming up this morning.  And joining me to  break it all down: Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell; former Utah  Congressman, former House Oversight Committee chairman, and Fox News  contributor Jason Chaffetz; and the \"Wall Street Journal's\" editorial board  member, Fox News contributor Mary Kissel.</p><p>Great to see you.</p><p>MARY KISSEL, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Good morning -- Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good morning.  Good morning, everybody.  </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN HOST:  Lots to discuss today.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>JASON CHAFFETZ, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  That's not cute -- that whole  Cinderella thing -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  I don't know.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No, that's not cute at all.</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  I'm just saying.  I'm married.  I'm happy.  But that's not  attractive.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I want to see Cinderella wearing a bandanna, no makeup, sweating  like Richard Nixon with some running shoes on.  That's how you stay slim.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Well -- all these fads, diets, people believe in them.   And yes, you're right.  Just sort of -- get back to basics.</p><p>KISSEL:  Yes.  Basics.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Eat right and exercise.  </p><p>KISSEL:   Yes and meat and butter.  And jettison, you know, all these  carbs.  Apparently that's a new thing to do.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Sugar and flour.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, goodbye.</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  You're making me hungry.  I want some pancakes.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We had them yesterday.  It was National Pancake Day yesterday.</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  It was - </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You should have seen the stack we had right here.  It was this  high.  </p><p>CHAFFETZ:  You invited me on the wrong day.</p><p>KISSEL:   Wow, National Pancake Day.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: You don't get a belly like this by missing pancakes.  Come on.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We've got a big show this morning -- join us.   White House deputy press secretary Hogan Gidley is here.  Former RNC chair  and Mississippi Governor Haley Barbour is here.  Fox News senior judicial  analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano is here; along with Dr. Mikhail Varshavski,  better known as Dr. Mike.  We'll talk about diet and exercise with him.</p><p>You don't want to miss a moment of it.  So do stay with us.</p><p>We kick it off right here this hour.  We're taking a look at markets.   Futures are flat today now.  Markets were edging higher earlier as  investors await fourth quarter GDP numbers to come out, roughly 90 minutes  from now.  We're expecting the economy to show growth of 2.5 percent in the  fourth quarter.</p><p>My next guest chairs the subcommittee on monetary policy and trade in the  House Financial Services Committee.  Joining us right now is Kentucky  Congressman Andy Barr.  Congressman -- it's good to see you.  Thanks so  much for joining us.</p><p>REP. ANDY BARR (R), KENTUCKY:  Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So did what you see in terms of what's happening in the economy  today -- did that jibe with what you heard from Mr. Powell yesterday?  </p><p>BARR:  Yes, I think our new chairman of the Federal Reserve reinforced what  we're already seeing, which is that tax cuts and the regulatory relief  agenda -- that that agenda is working in the economy and that the economic  outlook is strong as a result of the fiscal stimulus that congress and the  President have injected into the economy.  And that gives the Fed greater  flexibility to continue its monetary normalization program, which is very  important to remove the distortions from our economy.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So what did you get from him yesterday?  I mean did you get a  sense that he's going to raise interest rates four times?  </p><p>BARR:  Well, I was encouraged that Chairman Powell did clearly communicate  the monetary policy trajectory.  He did indicate that the tax cuts were  working in terms of increasing household incomes, increasing wages.  The  consumer and the business confidence is very, very high.</p><p>And as a result, we do expect the Fed to continue to normalize and that's  very important, because this Fed chairman has inherited a very  unprecedented task and that is the task to unwind a very unconventional  balance sheet, a bloated balance sheet that creates risks and also a  protracted period of artificially-low rates.  We need to return to market- based rates.</p><p>That doesn't mean an unpredictable increase, dramatic increase in interest  rates.  It means a gradual, predictable increase in interest rates,  consistent with the growing economy.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  We were talking about that all morning -- $4.5 trillion  balance sheet needs to get unwound which is why you asked this question  yesterday.  Let's listen.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARR:  Are there any plans within the balance sheet normalization strategy  to roll off longer term assets more quickly, to counteract that flattening  yield curve?  </p><p>JEROME POWELL, CHAIRMAN, FEDERAL RESERVE:  You know, flattening of yield  curves in the past has been sort of a precursor of recessions, but largely  because in many prior recessions the Fed had to raise rates quickly to  hold, you know, to hold inflation down.</p><p>That's not the situation we have now.  There's always a risk of a recession  at any given point in time.  I don't see it as at all high at the moment.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So were you surprised that the markets reacted so violently  after the meeting?  </p><p>BARR:  No.  And I'm also not surprised at the general level of volatility.   And remember, some of these corrections are very healthy to avoid asset  bubbles.  We don't want excessive volatility but we also recognize that  normalizing monetary policy can be a very sound policy from the standpoint  of preventing asset bubbles, making sure that we are realigning valuations  and equities according to reality.</p><p>So it's not all together a bad thing to recalibrate as the markets continue  their overall upward trajectory.  Again, we don't want valuations to exceed  reality and so some level of correction here and there is a good thing, as  the market continues its long-term bull run.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE):  I see.</p><p>KISSEL:  What is Congress going to do -- by the way, this is Mary Kissel  here -- if we do see a spike in rates and that interest burden on the  government debt goes through the roof?  I mean that's a big risk, isn't it.   What are you guys doing about it?  </p><p>BARR:  It is a big risk.  But it's also important that we don't mask the  true problem with artificially low rates that create distortions in the  economy and excessive risk.  I think it's incumbent upon Congress and the  President to get serious about mandatory spending reform.</p><p>I would add that some of the critics of tax reform blame tax cuts for  larger deficits.  I think monetary normalization and unreformed mandatory  spending is what is likely to increase deficits.</p><p>And so that reinforces the need for us to continue pro-growth policies so  that we get revenue, not from tax cuts, but from more taxpayers.  And we  also reform mandatory spending so that we can force the government to live  within its means.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We're going to switch gears here.  Here's Jason Chaffetz.  Go  ahead.</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  Yes, Jason Chaffetz here.  It's good to see you -- Andy.</p><p>BARR:  Hey -- Jason.  Good to see you.</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  I served with Andy in the United States Congress.</p><p>I want to ask you about guns.  The House of Representatives passed a bill  that had the concealed carry reciprocity act coupled with the Fix NICS, the  National Instant Background Check System.  Do you think the House has an  appetite to separate those bills and run independently the Fix NICS  legislation?  And would that be palatable with what's going on in the  Senate?  </p><p>BARR:  Well, I would support that -- Jason.  I also support the reciprocity  bill.  I'm a co-sponsor of the reciprocity bill, our colleague Richard  Hudson's bill.</p><p>But I also support fixing the NICS and enhancing the NICS system.  And I  was one of many members of Congress also who signed a letter to the ATF to  revisit the bump stock after -- the bump stock regulations after Las Vegas.  </p><p>CHAFFETZ:  So why don't those things pass?  I mean if you're as  conservative as they get in the House, then why isn't Kevin McCarthy and  Paul Ryan pulling up those bills because we could pass both of those, even  three bills independently.  Why isn't that happening?  </p><p>BARR:  Well, as you know, Jason -- and I'm not sure if you were still in  the Congress at the time, but we did pass the fix NICS with the reciprocity  bill.</p><p>I'm in favor of separating and passing them again.  I think the Senate  needs to take action.  You know, there's a narrative out there that  Congress doesn't care or hasn't taken action on these mass murders.  That's  not true.  We passed the Helping Families and Mental Health Crisis Act as  part of the 21st Century Cures Act which helped to reform HIPAA with  respect to helping family members intervene with loved ones whoa re  suffering from mental illness.</p><p>We've also taken action on the bump stocks.  We passed the Fix NICS  program.  And I would also be in favor of some federal authority to give  local school districts the flexibility and the discretion to make our  schools safer and to use resources to either pay for law enforcement  officers in the schools, harden schools, metal detectors, even more  psychologists or counselors in the schools to monitor kids who have social  alienation and warning signs.</p><p>And you know, this is personal to me and Jason because our good friend  Steve Scalise was the victim last June of a gunman.  And you know, the one  lesson from that baseball field in Alexandria when many of our colleagues  were out there in harm's way, the lesson was that the best defense in a  situation like that is a well-armed, well-trained security guard.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>BARR:  And you know, I think local school districts should be able to  direct local decisions with Parent Teachers Associations on whether or not  they want to use resources to have security officers in their schools.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  You would think so -- Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Congressman -- I want to ask you what you think about your  Senator Rand Paul from your state of Kentucky about his pushback on this  Fix NICS bill because you are getting that from some conservatives with the  suggestion of how can you appeal if you're flagged in this background check  system.</p><p>So are some of your colleagues, whether in the House like Congressman Louis  Gohmert who we talked to yesterday, and then in the senate, getting in the  way of passing a clean bill to beef up a background check system that  already exists and works in this country?  </p><p>BARR:  Well, in the case of Texas, where you saw the Air Force fail to  provide the information to the NICS system, I think that's exactly what  we're trying to fix.  And I think we need to make sure that federal  agencies are actually providing the information to make the NICS system  work.</p><p>We can have all the checks in the world.  But if you don't have the  information in the background check system it doesn't work.  And I would  add that the Fix NICS bill that we passed out of the House already, that  bill actually enhanced some of the due process.</p><p>So I agree with Senator Paul.  We need procedural due process if the  government is, you know, taking away a constitutional right without due  process.  We need that due process.  But we also need to make sure that the  NICS system is working and clearly, it's not.</p><p>And I would also add in the case of the tragedy in Florida, this young man  was showing all of the warning signs -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>BARR:  -- and clearly there was a failure by law enforcement, our mental  health system and the education system to get that information so that that  young man was not -- could not purchase a firearm.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So you think there will be improvements this year?  You think  there will be any changes in legislation this year on this?</p><p>BARR:  Well, of course, we've already passed the bill out of the House.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  I know.</p><p>BARR:  We would encourage the Senate to do the same.  And I would be in  favor of separating those out consistent with my strong, strong support of  the Second Amendment.  And none of these reforms in my view would in any  way compromise our commitment to the Second Amendment.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Congressman -- let me move on.</p><p>Reverend Billy Graham will lie in honor today in the U.S. Capitol Rotunda.   He will be the fourth private citizen to lie in honor.  Your thoughts on  the storied life of Reverend Graham; can you tell us a little about what  you're expecting today in terms of the ceremony?  </p><p>BARR:  Well, it's altogether appropriate that the Congress is not in  session to honor the legacy and the tremendous contributions and the  spiritual leadership of Billy Graham -- Reverend Billy Graham who  ministered to so many Americans including U.S. presidents and members of  Congress.</p><p>We are so -- we're not only appreciative of his ministry but we're grateful  for the leadership that he provided to the country in good times and bad  times.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Let me ask you Congressman, before you go, on Financial  Services Committee -- how much of a priority is changing Dodd-Frank?  Is  that going to be a priority in the coming weeks?  When might we expect  changes here?  </p><p>BARR:  Well, I'm very optimistic that we have a bipartisan bill that's  moving through the Senate.  As you know, statutory changes to a law like  Dodd-Frank which has been a disaster in terms of clogging up our financial  markets -- we need 60 votes in the Senate.</p><p>So we have a modest reform bill that fixes some of the overreach from Dodd- Frank.  It's moving through the Senate.  We've passed a more ambitious bill  out of the House.  But that gives us a lot of optimism that we can provide  regulatory relief for community financial institutions.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So it should be coming in the coming weeks, then.</p><p>Congressman -- good to see you.  Thank you.</p><p>BARR:  Thank you -- good to see you too.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Andy Barr.</p><p>We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>A major retailer taking a stand on assault rifles.

Shares of Disney are down about 5 percent from a year ago.</p><p>There you go.</p><p>All right.  This is an interesting story.  Barbra Streisand, 75 years old,  revealing that two of her three dogs are clones.  Miss Scarlet and Miss  Violet were actually cloned from cells taken from her 14-year-old dog,  Samantha before Samantha died last year.  So the dogs look alike but  Streisand said she can't wait to see if they share Samantha's personality  as well.  Apparently she was a serious dog.</p><p>If you were wondering, the price to clone is $50,000 per pup.  And she  dressed them in different colors so she could tell them apart.  That's how  they got their names -- Scarlet and Violet.  Now you know.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I don't know if I like the story -- cloning your dog.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  With all the dogs -- you know what, with all the dogs in  shelters that are on at-risk lists that need homes, whether it's the dogs  on the streets of Puerto Rico and Miami, New York City, and you pay the  money to clone your dog.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Why not adopt a dog or puppy that needs you?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  You've got all that money, you could have 10 and save some  lives.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Cloning your dogs.   </p><p>CHAFFETZ:  Wasn't she going to move to Canada?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  She was supposed to move to Canada if President Trump won the  election.

She thinks  there was vote tampering.  She literally said that the last few days.  </p><p>CHAFFETZ:  I still want my money back from going to see \"Yentl\" -- still a  craw in my side.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  You're that old?</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We've got a tweet to tell you about.

Here's  what he said.  \"The Heritage Foundation has just stated that 64 percent of  the Trump agenda is already done -- faster than even Ronald Reagan.  We are  blown away, said Thomas Binion of Heritage.  President Trump is very  active, conservative and very effective.  Huge volume and spectrum of  issues.\"</p><p>The President just tweeted that.</p><p>Do you disagree with that?  He's patting himself on the back, definitely.   You're right.  </p><p>CHAFFETZ:  Yes.

Back in a  minute, we'll preview it.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>The fourth quarter GDP is due out in about an hour.  Growth is expected to  be 2.5 percent, according to Thompson Reuters.  This after Federal Reserve  Chairman J. Powell testified in front of the House Financial Services  Committee yesterday on his outlook for the economy.  Watch.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>POWELL:  It does feel to me that the next couple of years look quite strong  and you should see strong demand from consumers.  You should see businesses  investing and I would expect the next two years on the current path to be,  you know, to be good years for the economy.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  joining us now, Wells Fargo Investment Institute senior global  equity strategist Scott Wren.  Scott -- good to see you.</p><p>SCOTT WREN, SENIOR GLOBAL EQUITY STRATEGIST, WELLS FARGO INVESTMENT  INSTITUTE:  Hi -- Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The next couple years look strong, good growth.  What does that  mean for you in markets?  </p><p>WREN:  Well, for us I think strong is certainly a relative term.   Politicians always want to seem to pump up the growth very high, but if we  saw something in the 2.5 percent, 2.8 percent, maybe toward 3 type of  range, I think over the next couple of years, inflation stays reasonable.   I think stocks can do well in that kind of an environment.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  How come markets are so nervous about this?  </p><p>WREN:  Well, I would argue that 2018 is all about the central banks and  particularly the fed.  We've been on a 10 year monetary policy experiment.   It's coming to an end.</p><p>In any normal cycle the fed usually has trouble backing away.  This one's  going to be more difficult.  So when the market starts finally coming to  grips that we're going to have three hikes this year, which I think they  have, when in 2017 the stock market I think was mostly in denial, it's some  uncertainty.</p><p>J. Powell talked yesterday, as you mentioned, talks maybe 4 -- that's a  problem.  We've argued that 3 is ok, but anything over that is a head wind  for the market.  </p><p>CHAFFETZ:  You said reasonable inflation number.  What is a reasonable  expectation of inflation?  </p><p>WREN:  Well, Jason -- I tell you, we are -- let's say we got out of 2017  with 2, 2.1 CPI type of number.  Our number this year is 2.4 so inflation  is moving up.  That's way below the longer term average.  Of course,  personal consumption expenditures, PCE has been stuck at 1.5 percent, way  below where the Fed wants to see it.</p><p>So you know, I think the Fed's probably in the end going to let the economy  run a little hot.  I mean they've been trying to get inflation for 10  years.  They have not been successful.  They don't want to just choke it  off too quickly.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  When you talk about the central bank, our Central Bank  unprecedented monetary policy over the last 10 years, interest rates could  get away from them.  They can move on the short end.  But in terms of the  longer end and as treasury and mortgage securities roll off their balance  sheet as they try to reduce it later this year -- that's the great unknown.</p><p>You don't really have -- because, again, the market could take over and  you've already seen that start to happen with longer term interest rates.   They're only at 2.91 percent at the close yesterday on the 10 year but  Nevertheless, that's a major worry.  That's why people are so fixated on  that.  </p><p>WREN:  Well, I think they are -- Dagen.  And really we're in uncharted  territory.  I mean we've never had to roll off this much off a fed balance  sheet.  So that's more uncertainty.  I think any news that has to do with  wages, with employment, with inflation, with the fed, the market is going  to react meaningfully probably, one way or the other.</p><p>Yesterday it was J. Powell's comments.  I think on March 9th when the  employment data is released, the single most important data point this  month or in March, rather, I would argue is what did average hourly  earnings do year over year.  If that is less than 2.9, let's say it's 2.6 I  think the market will rally on that.  If it's 3 or 3.1, it's probably going  to be an ugly day.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Because those are two important dates.  March 1st, we get  the PCE indicator; March 9th we get the jobs number with the wages.  We'll  be watching that. </p><p>Real quick what are you telling clients to do right now?  Would you put new  money to work here?  </p><p>WREN:  Absolutely.  I think that what we want our clients doing,  industrials, consumer discretionary, health care, financials -- we want  them buying on the dips.  We've been pounding the table on this thing.</p><p>Now, it came and went pretty quick between February 2nd and February 9th.   It went down a lot and people were cautious because of the speed it went  down.  We want our clients in this market though.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We will leave it there.

They reauthorized it and  then like 48 hours later -- </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Yes.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: -- they announced all these potential abuses -- </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  I appreciate -- </p><p>Chef it's: -- of the FISA court.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: -- what Devin Nunes is doing but he in my opinion committed a  grave wrong by sitting on all this while Congress was debating the  reauthorization -- </p><p>CHAFFETZ:  Yes.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: -- of FISA.</p><p>He permitted more power in the hands of the very people whom he accused of  abusing that power.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Why?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE.  Yes, but there's been no evidence that Section 702  that was reauthorized has been abuse.</p><p>My question to you Judge is, what executive would want the FISA court to go  away because if that court went away, then the executive branch would be  wholly -- </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Directly responsible -- </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: -- responsible, directly responsible -- </p><p>NAPOLITANO: -- Correct.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: -- for the surveillance.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's -- </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  It's -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's a good point.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: -- it's extraordinary power to the executive branch.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow!</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Very difficult to get any entity, Congress or the president to  shrink its own power.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow!</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  It will take an extremely principled person to do that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, my goodness!</p><p>Well we've got to get to this as well because FBI, former FBI director Jim  Comey is bashing President Trump, again, ahead of his book release.</p><p>Comey tweeted out a picture of himself, recording the audio version of his  new tell-all book last night, and wrote, \"Lordy, this time there will be a  tape; audiobook almost finished.\"</p><p>His caption references president Trump's Tweet last year that conversations  between the two men have been recorded.</p><p>Judge your reaction to this?</p><p>He -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- he keeps poking the president --  </p><p>NAPOLITANO: -- Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- meanwhile all of this wrong-doing went on, on his watch.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Yes.</p><p>Yes, and I don't know what he's doing.</p><p>I am - he --  my guess he thought it was funny and, in some sense, it might  be a little, mildly humorous, 'this time there will be a tape' because when  president Trump said \"James Comey better hope there isn't a tape,' and then  Congress tried to get the tape and then the president said, \"OK, there  wasn't a tape.  I was just suggesting that he better hope that there isn't  one.\"</p><p>This is a reference to that.  I think it's inside the beltway and inside  base (ph) but -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  He's auditioning for those late-night talk shows -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Hmm --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL: -- because he needs those appearances to hump that lousy book -- </p><p>NAPOLITANO: Correct.</p><p>MCDOWELL: -- that's coming out.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Correct.  It may be a great book -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>NAPOLITANO: -- it may be a challenging (ph) book, it may be garbage, I  don't know.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Guys, we know that Jim Comey leaked something to his friend to  get it into \"The New York Times\" so that they could get a special counsel  in place.</p><p>Did he commit a felony?</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  I don't think he did because he prepared the document, it  would also depend on what's in the document; I don't believe that there was  anything classified in there but that too is being investigated by the  inspector general.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Well there's a lot of open --  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  So, -- </p><p>BARTIROMO: -- investigations now about classified leaks.</p><p>Jeff Sessions told me there are 27 open investigations right now of  classified leaks.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: -- Did he tell you --  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>NAPOLITANO: -- any of them go back into the Clinton --  into the Obama  administration?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  \"No.\"</p><p>But -- </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Who unmasked General Flynn and the ambassador Kislyak --  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: -- in the waning days of the Obama administration?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  And that was a clear felony which is what Devin Nunes - - </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Absolutely.</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- said on the -- </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Absolutely.</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- air as well.</p><p>Final word Dagen?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No, I was just going to say, the inspector general can find out  something - wrongdoing with Jim Comey and nothing happens to him except he  is on a book tour where the talk show hosts are genuflecting in his  presence.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  And he'll make a fortune.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well by the way --  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- the inspector general we're expecting it in March?</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  I think that's --  yes -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes -- </p><p>CHAFFETZ: -- I think it's -- </p><p>MCDOWELL: -- soon.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: -- within the next 45 days or so.</p><p>The -- </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Yes.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: -- administration will get about a thirty-day heads up, that is  the procedure.</p><p>They'll give it to him 30 days heads up but then they'll come --  I believe  to the Oversight Committee.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, well 10 people have already been reassigned or  fired, leading up to that report so we'll see if there's connection there.</p><p>Judge, thank you.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  My pleasure.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Judge Napolitano.</p><p>We'll be right back.</p><p>Stay with us, we're talking about NASA astronauts next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>BREAKING NEWS this morning, big news from the NFL.</p><p>Lauren Simonetti on it right now -- </p><p>SIMONETTI:  All right -- Maria, the NFL didn't take long to find a  replacement for its pizza sponsor.</p><p>As you know, just yesterday, the League broke off its relationship with  Papa John's.</p><p>And moments ago, it was announced that Pizza Hut is now the official pizza  sponsor of the NFL multi-year agreement that will offer Pizza Hut and array  of exclusive marketing rights connected with the League.</p><p>Shares of Yum!

Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I'm Maria Bartiromo. And it is Wednesday, February 28th.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Your top stories right now at 7:00 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Return of the bears -- the Dow snapping a three-day winning streak yesterday, closing down nearly 300 points. Investors were spooked after Federal Reserve Chairman J. Powell signaled that the strong economy could lead to more interest rate hikes.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Futures indicating the markets are bouncing back a bit today. Take a look. We are basically back at the break-even level.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We've seen a pretty selloff in the last 10 minutes actually. The Dow Industrials now flat, as is the S&amp;P 500. Nasdaq up a point. But again these are well off of the highs of the morning here.</p><p>Investors are waiting on the fourth quarter GDP. It's due out in about 90 minutes. Economists are looking for the GDP to show growth of 2.5 percent in the fourth quarter.</p><p>In Europe this morning, stocks are lower across the board. Take a look. FT 100, CAC 40, DAX index down between a third of a percent and one-half of 1 percent.</p><p>In Asia overnight, red across the board. Worst performers were in Hong Kong and Japan, down 1.5 percent apiece.</p><p>The battle over gun control back in the U.S. as the students in Parkland, Florida return to school today. President Trump is set to host a bipartisan meeting with lawmakers as they work to end gun violence.</p><p>Vice President Mike Pence promised the White House will do all it can to keep students safe.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MIKE PENCE, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: No child, no teacher should ever be in danger in an American school. I want to make you a promise. We will not rest until we make our schools safe again.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: More on the debate coming up this morning.</p><p>Meanwhile FISA fight -- the details as Attorney General Jeff Sessions says that the Justice Department will investigate potential abuses of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act by the Obama administration against the Trump campaign.</p><p>Then Jim Comey getting cheeky -- listen to this. The former FBI director takes yet another shot at President Trump on Twitter. We'll tell you about that.</p><p>Then Bill Gates slamming bitcoin -- why he says the crypto currency is killing people.</p><p>And a dangerous viral trend -- how the Cinderella diet is putting people's health at risk.</p><p>We've got all those stories coming up this morning. And joining me to break it all down: Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell; former Utah Congressman, former House Oversight Committee chairman, and Fox News contributor Jason Chaffetz; and the \"Wall Street Journal's\" editorial board member, Fox News contributor Mary Kissel.</p><p>Great to see you.</p><p>MARY KISSEL, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Good morning -- Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Good morning. Good morning, everybody.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN HOST: Lots to discuss today.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>JASON CHAFFETZ, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: That's not cute -- that whole Cinderella thing --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: I don't know.</p><p>BARTIROMO: No, that's not cute at all.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: I'm just saying. I'm married. I'm happy. But that's not attractive.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I want to see Cinderella wearing a bandanna, no makeup, sweating like Richard Nixon with some running shoes on. That's how you stay slim.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Well -- all these fads, diets, people believe in them. And yes, you're right. Just sort of -- get back to basics.</p><p>KISSEL: Yes. Basics.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Eat right and exercise.</p><p>KISSEL: Yes and meat and butter. And jettison, you know, all these carbs. Apparently that's a new thing to do.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Sugar and flour.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes, goodbye.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: You're making me hungry. I want some pancakes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We had them yesterday. It was National Pancake Day yesterday.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: It was -</p><p>BARTIROMO: You should have seen the stack we had right here. It was this high.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: You invited me on the wrong day.</p><p>KISSEL: Wow, National Pancake Day.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: You don't get a belly like this by missing pancakes. Come on.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. We've got a big show this morning -- join us. White House deputy press secretary Hogan Gidley is here. Former RNC chair and Mississippi Governor Haley Barbour is here. Fox News senior judicial analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano is here; along with Dr. Mikhail Varshavski, better known as Dr. Mike. We'll talk about diet and exercise with him.</p><p>You don't want to miss a moment of it. So do stay with us.</p><p>We kick it off right here this hour. We're taking a look at markets. Futures are flat today now. Markets were edging higher earlier as investors await fourth quarter GDP numbers to come out, roughly 90 minutes from now. We're expecting the economy to show growth of 2.5 percent in the fourth quarter.</p><p>My next guest chairs the subcommittee on monetary policy and trade in the House Financial Services Committee. Joining us right now is Kentucky Congressman Andy Barr. Congressman -- it's good to see you. Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>REP. ANDY BARR (R), KENTUCKY: Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So did what you see in terms of what's happening in the economy today -- did that jibe with what you heard from Mr. Powell yesterday?</p><p>BARR: Yes, I think our new chairman of the Federal Reserve reinforced what we're already seeing, which is that tax cuts and the regulatory relief agenda -- that that agenda is working in the economy and that the economic outlook is strong as a result of the fiscal stimulus that congress and the President have injected into the economy. And that gives the Fed greater flexibility to continue its monetary normalization program, which is very important to remove the distortions from our economy.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So what did you get from him yesterday? I mean did you get a sense that he's going to raise interest rates four times?</p><p>BARR: Well, I was encouraged that Chairman Powell did clearly communicate the monetary policy trajectory. He did indicate that the tax cuts were working in terms of increasing household incomes, increasing wages. The consumer and the business confidence is very, very high.</p><p>And as a result, we do expect the Fed to continue to normalize and that's very important, because this Fed chairman has inherited a very unprecedented task and that is the task to unwind a very unconventional balance sheet, a bloated balance sheet that creates risks and also a protracted period of artificially-low rates. We need to return to market- based rates.</p><p>That doesn't mean an unpredictable increase, dramatic increase in interest rates. It means a gradual, predictable increase in interest rates, consistent with the growing economy.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. We were talking about that all morning -- $4.5 trillion balance sheet needs to get unwound which is why you asked this question yesterday. Let's listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARR: Are there any plans within the balance sheet normalization strategy to roll off longer term assets more quickly, to counteract that flattening yield curve?</p><p>JEROME POWELL, CHAIRMAN, FEDERAL RESERVE: You know, flattening of yield curves in the past has been sort of a precursor of recessions, but largely because in many prior recessions the Fed had to raise rates quickly to hold, you know, to hold inflation down.</p><p>That's not the situation we have now. There's always a risk of a recession at any given point in time. I don't see it as at all high at the moment.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: So were you surprised that the markets reacted so violently after the meeting?</p><p>BARR: No. And I'm also not surprised at the general level of volatility. And remember, some of these corrections are very healthy to avoid asset bubbles. We don't want excessive volatility but we also recognize that normalizing monetary policy can be a very sound policy from the standpoint of preventing asset bubbles, making sure that we are realigning valuations and equities according to reality.</p><p>So it's not all together a bad thing to recalibrate as the markets continue their overall upward trajectory. Again, we don't want valuations to exceed reality and so some level of correction here and there is a good thing, as the market continues its long-term bull run.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE): I see.</p><p>KISSEL: What is Congress going to do -- by the way, this is Mary Kissel here -- if we do see a spike in rates and that interest burden on the government debt goes through the roof? I mean that's a big risk, isn't it. What are you guys doing about it?</p><p>BARR: It is a big risk. But it's also important that we don't mask the true problem with artificially low rates that create distortions in the economy and excessive risk. I think it's incumbent upon Congress and the President to get serious about mandatory spending reform.</p><p>I would add that some of the critics of tax reform blame tax cuts for larger deficits. I think monetary normalization and unreformed mandatory spending is what is likely to increase deficits.</p><p>And so that reinforces the need for us to continue pro-growth policies so that we get revenue, not from tax cuts, but from more taxpayers. And we also reform mandatory spending so that we can force the government to live within its means.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We're going to switch gears here. Here's Jason Chaffetz. Go ahead.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: Yes, Jason Chaffetz here. It's good to see you -- Andy.</p><p>BARR: Hey -- Jason. Good to see you.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: I served with Andy in the United States Congress.</p><p>I want to ask you about guns. The House of Representatives passed a bill that had the concealed carry reciprocity act coupled with the Fix NICS, the National Instant Background Check System. Do you think the House has an appetite to separate those bills and run independently the Fix NICS legislation? And would that be palatable with what's going on in the Senate?</p><p>BARR: Well, I would support that -- Jason. I also support the reciprocity bill. I'm a co-sponsor of the reciprocity bill, our colleague Richard Hudson's bill.</p><p>But I also support fixing the NICS and enhancing the NICS system. And I was one of many members of Congress also who signed a letter to the ATF to revisit the bump stock after -- the bump stock regulations after Las Vegas.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: So why don't those things pass? I mean if you're as conservative as they get in the House, then why isn't Kevin McCarthy and Paul Ryan pulling up those bills because we could pass both of those, even three bills independently. Why isn't that happening?</p><p>BARR: Well, as you know, Jason -- and I'm not sure if you were still in the Congress at the time, but we did pass the fix NICS with the reciprocity bill.</p><p>I'm in favor of separating and passing them again. I think the Senate needs to take action. You know, there's a narrative out there that Congress doesn't care or hasn't taken action on these mass murders. That's not true. We passed the Helping Families and Mental Health Crisis Act as part of the 21st Century Cures Act which helped to reform HIPAA with respect to helping family members intervene with loved ones whoa re suffering from mental illness.</p><p>We've also taken action on the bump stocks. We passed the Fix NICS program. And I would also be in favor of some federal authority to give local school districts the flexibility and the discretion to make our schools safer and to use resources to either pay for law enforcement officers in the schools, harden schools, metal detectors, even more psychologists or counselors in the schools to monitor kids who have social alienation and warning signs.</p><p>And you know, this is personal to me and Jason because our good friend Steve Scalise was the victim last June of a gunman. And you know, the one lesson from that baseball field in Alexandria when many of our colleagues were out there in harm's way, the lesson was that the best defense in a situation like that is a well-armed, well-trained security guard.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>BARR: And you know, I think local school districts should be able to direct local decisions with Parent Teachers Associations on whether or not they want to use resources to have security officers in their schools.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. You would think so -- Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Congressman -- I want to ask you what you think about your Senator Rand Paul from your state of Kentucky about his pushback on this Fix NICS bill because you are getting that from some conservatives with the suggestion of how can you appeal if you're flagged in this background check system.</p><p>So are some of your colleagues, whether in the House like Congressman Louis Gohmert who we talked to yesterday, and then in the senate, getting in the way of passing a clean bill to beef up a background check system that already exists and works in this country?</p><p>BARR: Well, in the case of Texas, where you saw the Air Force fail to provide the information to the NICS system, I think that's exactly what we're trying to fix. And I think we need to make sure that federal agencies are actually providing the information to make the NICS system work.</p><p>We can have all the checks in the world. But if you don't have the information in the background check system it doesn't work. And I would add that the Fix NICS bill that we passed out of the House already, that bill actually enhanced some of the due process.</p><p>So I agree with Senator Paul. We need procedural due process if the government is, you know, taking away a constitutional right without due process. We need that due process. But we also need to make sure that the NICS system is working and clearly, it's not.</p><p>And I would also add in the case of the tragedy in Florida, this young man was showing all of the warning signs --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>BARR: -- and clearly there was a failure by law enforcement, our mental health system and the education system to get that information so that that young man was not -- could not purchase a firearm.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So you think there will be improvements this year? You think there will be any changes in legislation this year on this?</p><p>BARR: Well, of course, we've already passed the bill out of the House.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right. I know.</p><p>BARR: We would encourage the Senate to do the same. And I would be in favor of separating those out consistent with my strong, strong support of the Second Amendment. And none of these reforms in my view would in any way compromise our commitment to the Second Amendment.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Congressman -- let me move on.</p><p>Reverend Billy Graham will lie in honor today in the U.S. Capitol Rotunda. He will be the fourth private citizen to lie in honor. Your thoughts on the storied life of Reverend Graham; can you tell us a little about what you're expecting today in terms of the ceremony?</p><p>BARR: Well, it's altogether appropriate that the Congress is not in session to honor the legacy and the tremendous contributions and the spiritual leadership of Billy Graham -- Reverend Billy Graham who ministered to so many Americans including U.S. presidents and members of Congress.</p><p>We are so -- we're not only appreciative of his ministry but we're grateful for the leadership that he provided to the country in good times and bad times.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Let me ask you Congressman, before you go, on Financial Services Committee -- how much of a priority is changing Dodd-Frank? Is that going to be a priority in the coming weeks? When might we expect changes here?</p><p>BARR: Well, I'm very optimistic that we have a bipartisan bill that's moving through the Senate. As you know, statutory changes to a law like Dodd-Frank which has been a disaster in terms of clogging up our financial markets -- we need 60 votes in the Senate.</p><p>So we have a modest reform bill that fixes some of the overreach from Dodd- Frank. It's moving through the Senate. We've passed a more ambitious bill out of the House. But that gives us a lot of optimism that we can provide regulatory relief for community financial institutions.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So it should be coming in the coming weeks, then.</p><p>Congressman -- good to see you. Thank you.</p><p>BARR: Thank you -- good to see you too.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Andy Barr.</p><p>We'll be right back.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>A major retailer taking a stand on assault rifles. Lauren Simonetti with the details and headlines now -- Lauren.</p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Breaking news this morning. Dick's Sporting Goods -- that's one of the country's largest sports retailers, they say they will no longer sell assault-style weapons. They will also no longer sell high-capacity magazines and they will not sell any gun to anyone under the age of 21 years old regardless of what the local laws are.</p><p>These are shares not moving just yet in the premarket but this is the one- year chart and you can see they're down 35 percent.</p><p>Well, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates had nothing good to say about crypto currencies. He was speaking at an \"Ask Me Anything\" Reddit event. And he suggested the technology is used by money launderers, terrorists and drug dealers.</p><p>Gates said the main value of money like bitcoin is their anonymity which allows users to hide from law enforcement, adding that long-term investments in the virtual currencies are super risky.</p><p>Well, McDonald's' Happy Meals will once again have Disney-themed toys in them, all this starting with \"The Incredibles 2\".</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Honey --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: What?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: -- where is my super suit?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: What?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Where is my super suit?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SIMONETTI: McDonald's and Disney are re-launching a multiyear deal. It starts with \"The Incredibles 2\". \"Incredibles 2\" -- that hits theaters in June.</p><p>Taking a look at shares of McDonald's -- they're up 25 percent from a year ago. Shares of Disney are down about 5 percent from a year ago.</p><p>There you go.</p><p>All right. This is an interesting story. Barbra Streisand, 75 years old, revealing that two of her three dogs are clones. Miss Scarlet and Miss Violet were actually cloned from cells taken from her 14-year-old dog, Samantha before Samantha died last year. So the dogs look alike but Streisand said she can't wait to see if they share Samantha's personality as well. Apparently she was a serious dog.</p><p>If you were wondering, the price to clone is $50,000 per pup. And she dressed them in different colors so she could tell them apart. That's how they got their names -- Scarlet and Violet. Now you know.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I don't know if I like the story -- cloning your dog.</p><p>MCDOWELL: With all the dogs -- you know what, with all the dogs in shelters that are on at-risk lists that need homes, whether it's the dogs on the streets of Puerto Rico and Miami, New York City, and you pay the money to clone your dog.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Why not adopt a dog or puppy that needs you?</p><p>MCDOWELL: You've got all that money, you could have 10 and save some lives.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Cloning your dogs.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: Wasn't she going to move to Canada?</p><p>BARTIROMO: She was supposed to move to Canada if President Trump won the election. She says I'm moving to Canada. She is still here.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: And cloning dogs.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And in an interview she suggests that the reason President Trump won is because of the voting machines got fooled with.</p><p>BARTIROMO: She thinks Hillary still won.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And that George Bush shouldn't have won either. She thinks there was vote tampering. She literally said that the last few days.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: I still want my money back from going to see \"Yentl\" -- still a craw in my side.</p><p>MCDOWELL: You're that old?</p><p>CHAFFETZ: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We've got a tweet to tell you about. The President just tweeted this. We'll see what he's thinking about this morning. Here's what he said. \"The Heritage Foundation has just stated that 64 percent of the Trump agenda is already done -- faster than even Ronald Reagan. We are blown away, said Thomas Binion of Heritage. President Trump is very active, conservative and very effective. Huge volume and spectrum of issues.\"</p><p>The President just tweeted that.</p><p>Do you disagree with that? He's patting himself on the back, definitely. You're right.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: Yes. I think things have been going well.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>KISSEL: Lots of winning -- Jason. Lots of winning.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Hey -- are you tired of winning yet?</p><p>CHAFFETZ: Well, get Barbra Streisand to Canada -- that would be winning.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Fourth quarter GDP numbers out in about an hour. Back in a minute, we'll preview it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>The fourth quarter GDP is due out in about an hour. Growth is expected to be 2.5 percent, according to Thompson Reuters. This after Federal Reserve Chairman J. Powell testified in front of the House Financial Services Committee yesterday on his outlook for the economy. Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>POWELL: It does feel to me that the next couple of years look quite strong and you should see strong demand from consumers. You should see businesses investing and I would expect the next two years on the current path to be, you know, to be good years for the economy.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: joining us now, Wells Fargo Investment Institute senior global equity strategist Scott Wren. Scott -- good to see you.</p><p>SCOTT WREN, SENIOR GLOBAL EQUITY STRATEGIST, WELLS FARGO INVESTMENT INSTITUTE: Hi -- Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: The next couple years look strong, good growth. What does that mean for you in markets?</p><p>WREN: Well, for us I think strong is certainly a relative term. Politicians always want to seem to pump up the growth very high, but if we saw something in the 2.5 percent, 2.8 percent, maybe toward 3 type of range, I think over the next couple of years, inflation stays reasonable. I think stocks can do well in that kind of an environment.</p><p>BARTIROMO: How come markets are so nervous about this?</p><p>WREN: Well, I would argue that 2018 is all about the central banks and particularly the fed. We've been on a 10 year monetary policy experiment. It's coming to an end.</p><p>In any normal cycle the fed usually has trouble backing away. This one's going to be more difficult. So when the market starts finally coming to grips that we're going to have three hikes this year, which I think they have, when in 2017 the stock market I think was mostly in denial, it's some uncertainty.</p><p>J. Powell talked yesterday, as you mentioned, talks maybe 4 -- that's a problem. We've argued that 3 is ok, but anything over that is a head wind for the market.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: You said reasonable inflation number. What is a reasonable expectation of inflation?</p><p>WREN: Well, Jason -- I tell you, we are -- let's say we got out of 2017 with 2, 2.1 CPI type of number. Our number this year is 2.4 so inflation is moving up. That's way below the longer term average. Of course, personal consumption expenditures, PCE has been stuck at 1.5 percent, way below where the Fed wants to see it.</p><p>So you know, I think the Fed's probably in the end going to let the economy run a little hot. I mean they've been trying to get inflation for 10 years. They have not been successful. They don't want to just choke it off too quickly.</p><p>MCDOWELL: When you talk about the central bank, our Central Bank unprecedented monetary policy over the last 10 years, interest rates could get away from them. They can move on the short end. But in terms of the longer end and as treasury and mortgage securities roll off their balance sheet as they try to reduce it later this year -- that's the great unknown.</p><p>You don't really have -- because, again, the market could take over and you've already seen that start to happen with longer term interest rates. They're only at 2.91 percent at the close yesterday on the 10 year but Nevertheless, that's a major worry. That's why people are so fixated on that.</p><p>WREN: Well, I think they are -- Dagen. And really we're in uncharted territory. I mean we've never had to roll off this much off a fed balance sheet. So that's more uncertainty. I think any news that has to do with wages, with employment, with inflation, with the fed, the market is going to react meaningfully probably, one way or the other.</p><p>Yesterday it was J. Powell's comments. I think on March 9th when the employment data is released, the single most important data point this month or in March, rather, I would argue is what did average hourly earnings do year over year. If that is less than 2.9, let's say it's 2.6 I think the market will rally on that. If it's 3 or 3.1, it's probably going to be an ugly day.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Because those are two important dates. March 1st, we get the PCE indicator; March 9th we get the jobs number with the wages. We'll be watching that.</p><p>Real quick what are you telling clients to do right now? Would you put new money to work here?</p><p>WREN: Absolutely. I think that what we want our clients doing, industrials, consumer discretionary, health care, financials -- we want them buying on the dips. We've been pounding the table on this thing.</p><p>Now, it came and went pretty quick between February 2nd and February 9th. It went down a lot and people were cautious because of the speed it went down. We want our clients in this market though.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. We will leave it there. Scott -- great to see you.</p><p>WREN: Thanks -- Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you so much. And we should point out that J.

The only issue here is that their Cloud so to speak is overseas.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Yes. So, the Supreme Court in my opinion and we talked about this during the break, is -- I just agree with Brad Smith because I wasn't in the courtroom and I didn't hear the oral argument, I'm not employed by his company but I think that the Supreme Court will side with Microsoft.</p><p>There is no question that law-enforcement has the - has the right to this but the Supreme Court cannot immunize the Microsoft officials in the foreign country from the consequences of violating the foreign --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE.

I was just suggesting that he better hope that there isn't one.\"</p><p>This is a reference to that.

Well there's a lot of open --</p><p>NAPOLITANO: So, --</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- investigations now about classified leaks.</p><p>Jeff Sessions told me there are 27 open investigations right now of classified leaks.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: -- Did he tell you --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>NAPOLITANO: -- any of them go back into the Clinton -- into the Obama administration?</p><p>BARTIROMO: \"No.\"</p><p>But --</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Who unmasked General Flynn and the ambassador Kislyak --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: -- in the waning days of the Obama administration?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.

Thank you.</p><p>VARSHAVSKI: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: `Doctor Mike' there.</p><p>Still ahead, Amazon has a nice ring to it, the technology chain buying the makers of the Smart Doorbell, how the -- how the deal could change the way you get your deliveries, next hour, right here, on MORNINGS WITH MARIA.</p><p>Back in a minute.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.

Former Utah Congressman,  former House Oversight Committee Chairman and Fox News Contributor, Jason  CHaffetz.  And the \"Wall Street Journal's\" Editorial Board Member, Fox News  Contributor, Mary Kissel is here.  Great to see you.  </p><p>MARY KISSEL, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Good morning Maria, thanks for having  us.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, good morning to you.</p><p>JASON CHAFFETZ, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Good morning.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN ANCHOR:  When I saw the guests was yesterday, \"I can't  wait to hear what Mary and Jason have to say.  So that means I'm going to  stifle.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  No, we don't want that.  We don't want -- but it's true, we're  grateful that you're both here this morning.  What's on your mind?  What's  most important in your mind right now?</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  I'm still reeling over what the republicans have done to run up  government spending.  I see a lot of good economic news, the GDP but the  government component in the run up and spending, I think it's going to  hamper the economy, I really do.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  $300 billion in spending.</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  It's a ridiculous number, you can't justify it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Yes, we'll talk more about that.  Mary, how about you?</p><p>KISSEL:  Yes.  Well I think they're on a shirt high because as you said,  you've got the four quarter GDP number coming out and say goodbye to the  new normal of two percent that turns out that America can grow much faster  than that.</p><p>But I think unfortunately republicans are taking that message to as you say  give back on the sugar high of government spending, not a good idea.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No.  We've been talking about that a lot for sure because now  we're talking about $1 trillion deficits from here on out.</p><p>KISSEL:  Yes we are.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KISSEL:  And we'll talk about it as the morning rolls on too.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Again, watching those yields, those yields going up to close and  above 2.9 percent yesterday on that testimony from Jay Powell.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Tough day.  We expected what he said though, so I don't know  why the markets were surprised.  We knew he was going to talk about higher  interest rates and the return of inflation.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Maybe sometimes investors need a hammer over the head so to  speak and that was it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll see about that.  Three hundred points lower yesterday,  this morning a bit of a bounce.  </p><p>Joining the conversation this morning, the CEO of Bayer is with me, Werner  Baumann is here talking about lots of news this morning in the drug  industry.  White House Deputy Press Secretary Hogan Gidley is with us.   Former RNC Chair and Founding Partner of the DGR Group, Haley Barbour joins  us.  Kentucky Congressman Andy Barr is here.  And Dr. Mikhail Varshavski  AKA Dr. Mike also joining us this morning.  </p><p>You don't want to miss moments of it so do stay with us.  And we kick it  off here with the top story, markets taking a hit yesterday after a new  Federal Reserve chairman Jay Powell delivered an upbeat assessments of the  U.S. economy on Capitol Hill leading investors to expect higher interest  rates.  Of course, the biggest economic news on the DACA today is the  second estimate of fourth quarter GDP.</p><p>It's expected to come in at two and a half percent, that would be down 0.1  of a percent from the initial expectation.  Your reaction to what we heard  from Jay Powell yesterday Mary in terms of what he said, what that means  from where we are today.</p><p>KISSLER:  Well the Federal Reserve always underestimates GDP growth in the  economy and they always under estimate the impact of tax cuts Maria.   They're also always behind the curve when it comes to inflation  expectations.</p><p>Jay Powell was not picked because he was an aggressive Fed chairman, Jay  Powell was picked because he was somebody that the White House liked and  thought wouldn't rock the boat.  So I think what you're going to see out of  him is, again, a very reasonable and predictable rate rise.  Whether or not  that leads them behind the curve, who knows, the bigger challenge and Dagen  and I were talking about this off air is what they're going to do with this  mega balance sheet that the Federal Reserve has accumulated?</p><p>We've never seen that in the history of the Federal Reserve before, it's a  big experiment and the question is, can the Federal Reserve get rid of that  balance sheet without turning the market upside down.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  The idea of unwinding $4.5 trillion Dagen.  We've talked about  it before, $50 billion a month, at some point we'll get there.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Coupled with the idea that we may see now four interest rate  hikes spook in markets.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  The market yesterday began fact -- this has been  discussed widely about four interest rate hikes this year but Futures  contracts linked to the Central Bank's rate policies yesterday showed one  third of a probability that it's going to move four times this year.</p><p>But it's the great unknown of the Fed -- I think the balance sheet will  shrink about $400 billion this year, $420 billion with the final quarter at  $50 billion will be rolling off in mortgage and Treasury securities.  But  this has put even more pressure on markets and on the Federal Reserve  because of what the republicans have done.</p><p>I don't disagree with the tax reform, I don't believe that it's going to  cost north of a $1 trillion.  I think because of the faster growth, because  of the higher tax receipts you've already seen in January.  However,  republicans make this pressure on the Fed worst and on the bond market  because they increased spending by $300 billion over to your period.   You're ramping up the supply of Treasury debt at a time when one major  source of the demand over the last 10 years is going away and that's  problematic. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  When Paul Ryan joined me two weeks ago Jason, one thing  he kept saying is, \"You've got to give to get.\"  Well you were in that seat  before, what would you have done had you been faced with a situation of,  \"OK, we need to spend this money on the military.  We need new money on --  for military and recover what's been happened from sequestration but, I'm  being held hostage by doing all this other stuff spending elsewhere.\"</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  Well look, if you look at what Chuck Schumer got, he got  everything that he wanted.  What did the republicans get in that deal?   They didn't get anything.  There was a 13 percent increase in domestic  spending and Rand Paul was absolutely right when he said, \"When we had $1  dollar deficits and it was Obama in the White House, we were all up and  arms.\"  And suddenly, now it's President Trump and we're OK with it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  They didn't do anything to curve that and for Paul Ryan to say,  \"Well now we're going to turn our attention to entitlement reform.\"  Come  on, there's no way you're getting this 60 votes on entitlement reform.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Not this year.</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  No.  There's no way to do it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But some of the things that they put money to, Dagen, you  mentioned it, what, the abstinence spending.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  $150 billion -- excuse me, million dollars for abstinence  education (INAUDIBLE) with social conservatives but it was billions of  dollars a year for child care, for health --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Community centers.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  For community health centers.  And I'll point to this because  this is in the news today, I think it was $6 billion to fight the opioid  crisis --</p><p>KISSEL:  Yes, that's it.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- when they had poultry little evidence of how that money has  been spend, it's already been allocated and how this be spent.  Like the --  you need proof of outcomes when you start throwing billions of dollars at a  problem.</p><p>KISSEL:  Yes.  But, again, I wonder about the political environment here  because President Trump wants to do a deal and I feel like Paul Ryan's  biggest worry is that democrats are going to go to the president and say,  \"Just spend a little more.  You'll be more popular.  We can do a deal  together.\"</p><p>And so Paul Ryan just took over what's in front of him because he didn't  want something that was even worst.</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  But I -- when did it become the new normal and totally  acceptable that for every dollar rise in defense spending, you have to  raise domestic spending.  There was no justification to raise the domestic  spending, you could make a case on the military but, again, I don't think  we went out and said, \"Hey, we need a new carrier group, we have to have  missile defense.\"  We never had that discussion in this country.  That bill  came about three and a half days.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Well let's worry now and like I said to Paul Ryan, now  it's in your face in terms of markets reacting to higher interest rates,  what that means for the debt.</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  And they still have to fund the government on March 23rd.  So  remember, they funded part of the military but they still have to go back  and actually pass a funding pill later in March.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And to -- we'll talk about the \"Wall Street Journal\" Editorial  page, Mary Kissel, because, again, it's -- the fact republicans won't fix  the entitlements that we have where one in five Americans is on Medicaid,  Medicare, and Social Security.</p><p>But now you have the likes of Senators Mike Lee and Marco Rubio talking  about this new entitlement joining arms with Ivanka Trump on paid family  leave federally mandated.  So, again, to call yourself a conservative is a  joke.</p><p>KISSEL:  Yes.  And rating the entitlements by the way propose (INAUDIBLE)  entitlements to pay for that.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>KISSEL:  There's a free lunch entitlement according to those two senators  which was just ridiculous.  Look Dagen, I think it's very disheartening,  republicans had a chance to have a major entitlement reform last week with  healthcare but they simply couldn't explain what the program was.</p><p>They had gone out and actually, I don't know, had three bullet points and  said, \"Hey America, do you want to make entitlements to give into the  people who actually need them instead of able bodied adults?  I think  Americans would have gotten behind that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Because most people recognize this is where the growth and  spending and that these programs are going out of business.  They are --  they're going broke.</p><p>KISSLER:  Yes, they are -- it's entitlements.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We're going to take a break.  When we comeback,  students are returning to school in Florida.  This morning, we're going to  speak with one of the students, a survivor.</p><p>Then scary moments out of Virginia Military Base after the contents of  mysterious envelops causes several people to get sick, we got the details  on that investigation.  </p><p>Then a first on Fox Business interview, I'm one-on-one with Bayer CEO  Werner Baumann.  We will talk about the company's $8 billion for U.S.  investment.  Back in a moments right here.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Another police officer shot in the line of duty,  this time in Idaho.  Lauren Simonetti with the details and headlines now,  Lauren.</p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FBN REPORTER:  Good morning Maria.  The suspected gunman  was shot and killed in the shootout.  Police say the shooter had a felony  warrant for his arrest, began firing at officers when they approached him.</p><p>All this happened near the Idaho, Washington state line, east of Spokane.   The officer hit with the bullet went into surgery, the police chief says he  was up and talking with other officers.</p><p>Well, 11 people including several marines sickened yesterday after a  suspicious letter was opened at Marine Corps headquarters near the  Pentagon.  Three people were taken to the hospital listed in stable  condition.  The envelope which contained an unknown substance was mailed to  joint base Myer Henderson in Virginia.  It's been sent to the FBI's lab and  Quantico for testing.  The building was evacuated, it is not clear at this  point who sent that letter.</p><p>Well, evidence now emerging that North Korea is profiting from the civil  war in Syria.  \"Confidential United Nations\" report says that North Korea  shipped 50 tons of supplies to Syria for using building, what it suspected  to be a chemical weapons factory.  The U.S. has accused Syria of using  chemical weapons in rebel controlled areas including recently in a suburb  of Damascus.</p><p>Meanwhile, take a look at these new satellite photos.  They show Iran  establishing another base in Syria.  Intelligence sources telling Fox News  that the base outside of Syria's capital is complete with hangers used to  store missiles capable of hitting Israel.</p><p>And in business, Amazon is buying a ring in a deal reportedly valued at  over $1 billion.  Amazon is expanding its home security business.  Ring  makes Wi-Fi connected cameras and doorbells.  This coming after Amazon  launched its own security carmeras which worked with its -- boy, this isn't  Alexa.  Ring devices capture a video that can be screened on smart phones.   And I guess you can tell if someone's going to steal your packages when  they're at your doorstep.</p><p>Look at Amazon shares, they're moving up half a percent, 15.19 in the  premarket, this is the stock that's up in the past year almost 80 percent,  Maria.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, that's a good line that you can watch if anyone is trying  to steal your packages.  It's true, you're right.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  Get off my door step.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's an interesting acquisition.  I like this company.  I've  always liked the idea that you can just go on your phone and see who's at  your doorbell.  What do you think Dagen?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I think that they've done a great job of advertising where the  millennials are.  You will hear these ring advertisements on Podcasts  galore.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Really?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And I'm a voracious consumer of Podcast.  So they've done an  incredible job and they've been able to grow their business despite some  naysayers. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Amazon keeps on expanding.</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  I use the vivid system (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You do?  OK.</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  And I can watch right now, I can see what's going on and it  automatically takes clips.  Somebody who rings my doorbell, they walk up  and it buzzes me on my phone, so I know anytime.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I like that.</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  And my kids realized when you have a system like this, it's not  as much about keeping people from the outside getting in, as it is also to  keeping them inside from getting out.  And we have a teenager, that's a  good system. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That is great.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I don't -- I don't think I want to know what's going on in  Brooklyn in the middle of the night, actually.  So, I do not have one of  these systems.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, it looks good.  I think it's the whole technology around  safety and security and being able to look at all your doors that on your  phone is pretty interesting.  And it's interesting that Amazon is acquiring  it. </p><p>All right, we are going to take a break.  When we come back, students at  Stoneman Douglas high school returning to class today.  Exactly, two weeks  after 17 people were killed.  I will talk to one of the students on his  thoughts about going back and the expectations for school safety now.  </p><p>The investors are expecting growth of 2.5 percent when we get the second  quarter -- the second reading for the fourth quarter GDP later this  morning.  We will see how the markets react.  Futures right now, indicating  a gain at the start of trading.  These are the high of the morning right  here, up 50 points on the Dow Jones Industrial average.  We'll be right  back.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back, fourth-quarter earnings from Bayer just out this  morning.  The German drug maker and agriculture giant misexpectations on  revenue due in part to a head from U.S. tax reform.  The stock sell to a 15  month low on the news.  And joining us right now, for the first time on FOX  NEWS's interview is the CEO of Bayer, Werner Baumann.  Werner, it's good to  have you on the program this morning.  Thank you so much.</p><p>WERNER BAUMANN, CEO, BAYER:  Hi, Maria. Good morning. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let me kick it off with the quarter.  Can you tell us what  growth -- the growth in the quarter, what would you say was the standout  this last three months?</p><p>BAUMANN:  Well, we've seen -- as we've seen in the entire year.  A very  good performance in pharma, so sales in pharma advanced again by roughly  four percent.  If you look at our key growth product, so blood thinner,  Xarelto, Eylea, then some of our cancer products, all of them have done  well both in quarter four but for also the entire year.  So, our pharma  business had another record here.  Quite frankly, the other businesses,  things did not go down well in 2017.  </p><p>So consumer is a difficult business in particular in the U.S. and then in  crop we had significant oversupply in the market in Brazil that our crop  protection products as our competitors as well.  We had to cleanse the  situation in quarter two and have since made very good progress I have to  say in getting the situation under control and actually advancing again.   So we are quite optimistic for our crop business going into 2018. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, I want to talk about the consumer business.  You say that  it was -- it was a little under pressure in the U.S. That's interesting to  know, given that the economics in the U.S. have been improving.  But let me  start with you $66 billion deal to acquire Monsanto.  We are waiting on  approvals from European regulators and the U.S. The company's hoping this  deal will close this year.  But I guess, are you expecting the approval in  the second quarter?  From the E.U.?</p><p>BAUMANN:  Yes, Maria.  Based on where we are right now, we've seen very,  very good progress.  This by now, roughly half of the 30 approvals we need.   They are in very good discussions after say that the European Commission  making good progress there and also that the DOJ.  Even though with the  DOJ, we are a little bit behind the process where we are with the European  Commission.  But overall, as you have mentioned, that we are quite  confident, that we are going to close this on section in the second  quarter.  And that we will also obtain the approvals necessary to do so.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, as we wait for the E.U. approval sometime in the second  quarter, what are the plans in terms of divestitures, in terms of raising  money once you get that approval?  Are you expecting to do a secondary  offering of right to issue once you get that approval?</p><p>BAUMANN:  Yes, Maria.  First of all, looking at the divestitures we have  already announced actually in October -- mid-October last year, that a very  large part of our buyers, seat business and our non-selective herbicides  platform.  Delivered to link product lines are going to be divested to  BISF.  Of course, always contingent on the over transaction coming to a  closing.  And we continue to be in discussion so that, with some select  further areas that are in the interest of the regulators also to strengthen  overall competition, also innovation competition in our industry.  That  discussion is over all regardless whether you look at the Europeans or the  Department of Justice.  Very constructive, we have recently announced also  today in our call that we are now also going to divest of our vegetable  seeds business.  I cannot at this point in time say that this is what's it  going to be because these discussions are still on going.  </p><p>On the same question regarding the financing, this is going to be a mix of  equity and debt.  So that we have already mentioned that based on the very  good sales proceeds on the divestiture of our (INAUDIBLE) at stake, the --  these need less equity than we had expected, but there's still will be a  rise offering here. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I see, I see.  Now you and several other European business  leaders took part in a round table discussion with President Trump in Davos  last month.  I know the President said that he is a fan of the company, but  let me ask you this, in terms of your expectations in terms of investments  in the United States, tell us what that looks like and what do you think is  behind this weakness that you just mentioned in terms of the consumer in  the U.S?</p><p>BAUMANN:  Well, first of all, we have been in the U.S. for more than 150  years and we have great interest in also advancing on business but the  overall economy in the U.S. and we will do our fair share in contributing.   Regarding with my encounters with President Trump, I have to say that both  party were very well-informed and well briefed.  Got a good discussion  along the lines of what we have already communicated on hat this  combination is going to be about and of course he's a very loyal customer  of the aspirin, which is always nice to see.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, for sure.  And -- but did you say that the consumer  business is weak in the U.S. right now?</p><p>BAUMANN:  Yes, the consumer business overall is actually impact that the  cross actually also our competitors business by fairly dramatic and record  change in consumer behaviors.  The stronger advance of online buying with  that less (INAUDIBLE) if you look at the you know, stationary retail, DR,  abducting to live.  We need to do this faster.  We also need to step up our  innovation capabilities and that is what we are working on.  But clearly  2017 was not a good year for our consumer business.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, we will leave it there.  Werner, and it's good to  have you on the program.  Great to see you, thanks so much for joining us  this morning.</p><p>BAUMANN:  Thank you, thank you, Maria. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Werner Baumann there, CEO at Bayer.  Coming up, TSA bomb  detection goes from airports to underground.  The agency testing new  equipment for train stations that could detect a potential suicide bomber.   This coming after a failed attack in a New York subway last year.  </p><p>And then Apple and Amazon they are the undisputed leaders in the tech  industry in the market.  But who's up next?  You might be surprised by what  and where the next big tech titan comes from.  Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Wednesday morning, everybody, thanks so  much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Wednesday, February  28th, your top stories right now, 6:30 a.m. on the East Coast.  Stocks  looking to rebound this morning, take a look at Futures, indicating a gain  at the start of trading of about 40 points, NASDAQ, S&amp;P 500, also positive.   We are waiting on the second reading of the fourth quarter GDP.  </p><p>Economists are looking for growth of 2 1/2 percent in the GDP, for the  final month of 2017, this, after markets were rattled yesterday, following  testimony from Federal Reserve Chairman, Jake Powell.  His comments  suggesting that the Central Bank may raise interest rates more than the  three times that are expected.  As a result, markets plummeted.  Dow  Industrials, yesterday, down 300 points better than one percent, NASDAQ,  S&amp;P 500 also down one and a quarter percent.  </p><p>Global markets are taking a cue from the U.S. this morning and trading  lower, FT 100, down a quarter of a percent, CAC Quarante in Paris, down a  third of a percent, DAX Index in Germany down one quarter of a percent.   Similar story in Asia overnight, declines across the board, worst performer  was Hong Kong, down 1 1/2 percent on the Hang Seng.  </p><p>A new layer of security to report, the TSA is now testing new technology to  detect suicide vests, how it works, coming up.  President Trump, one step  closer to fulfilling another campaign promise.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Do not worry.  We are going  to build the wall, OK?  Don't worry.  Don't even think about it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  A judge ruling in favor of the administration, allowing  construction plans to begin for the border wall.  And the White House  changing its tune on trade, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, now  suggesting President Trump may negotiate a return to the Trans-Pacific  Partnership, the details, coming up.  Then, the world's largest plane, one  step closer to its first passenger flight, more on the latest milestone for  the jet that's backed by Paul Allen, all that coming up.  </p><p>But first, this top story this half an hour, students will return to  Marjory Stoneman Douglas High  School this morning, two weeks, after the shooting, 17 students and  teachers were killed on that Valentine's Day massacre.  Joining me right  now is a survivor of the shooting, Junior Kyle Kashuv, Kyle, thank you so  much for being with us this morning.</p><p>KYLE KASHUV, JUNIOR, MARJORY STONEMAN DOUGLAS HIGH SCHOOL:  Thank you for  having me, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  First, we all want to say our condolences.  Our hearts go out  to you and your families and all of your friends and colleagues there at  High School.  How do you feel about going back to school today?</p><p>KASHUV:  I mean, it's really sad coming back to school, but then, it's also  really exciting to meet my peers and to be able to connect once again at  school.  I am optimistic that -- I'm optimistic going back to school.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're optimistic about going back to school?  Have you spoken  to your friends about it?  I mean, do you think it's the right time now?   It's two weeks.</p><p>KASHUV:  I think it's the right time.  I mean, everyone is still saddened  by what happened but, we understand that.  We still have to return to  school and there's no other time better than now, to do so.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Of course, of course.  Now, the calls for Sheriff Scott  Israel's resignation are growing louder.  What's your take on this?  The  Broward County Sheriff has said, he will not step down.  Listen to what he  said.  I want to get your reaction.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SCOTT ISRAEL, SHERIFF, BROWARD COUNTY:  I can only take responsibility for  what I knew about.  I exercise my due diligence.  I've given amazing  leadership to this age --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Amazing leadership?</p><p>ISRALE:  I've worked -- yes.  And, of course, I won't resign.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Kyle?</p><p>KASHUV:  I this it's a completely -- I think it's completely, like,  understandable that we realize that how (INAUDIBLE) it is that the Broward  Sheriff's Department failed on so many different levels and they didn't act  properly.  And I think that it is a representation of his leadership.  He  has to be held accountable for the inaction of the Broward Sheriff's  Department.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Jason Chaffetz.</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  Kyle, hi, this is Jason Chaffetz.  God bless you.  I can't  imagine what it's like for you and your, you know, fellow students to go  back to school, but, you know, there are --</p><p>KASHUV:  Thank you.</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  In different schools, they have people that you, kind of, really  worried about and concerned about.  Do you think that video games and stuff  that you see in the media and the movies, do you think that affects some of  your classmates there?</p><p>KASHUV:  No, I really don't think that video games have a, somewhat, even  slightly an effect on children and the way they act, they really don't,  because we can clearly tell reality from video games, there's a clear  divide.</p><p>KISSEL:  Kyle, it's Mary Kissel here.  I just want to echo what Maria and  Jason said that our thoughts and prayers are with you and the other  students.  A lot of the talk has been about things like gun control and  school safety, that yet, it's clear that there were breakdowns on many  levels, particularly in the mental health system, very, very difficult for  someone like the shooter, to get the help that he needs.  I think he even  called and asked for help at one point.  Has that been part of the  discussion between you and your classmates?  Is that gaining any traction  down there?</p><p>KASHUV:  It is.  I figured we definitely understand that we have a lacking  in the department for emotional support at our schools.  And right now, we  clearly see a lot of movement and legislation that trying to enact that.   I'm -- right now, I'm working on an app developing, to allow moms to,  maybe, volunteer at schools for emotional support and since we're so  understaffed.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Kyle, it's Dagen McDowell, has this school stepped up and said  that they're going to provide counselling to you and your fellow students  if you want it, having been traumatized, obviously, going through such a  traumatic event that most of us can't even -- can't even comprehend?</p><p>KASHUV: Really, the entire community has stepped up, and there were support  counselling at the Portland YMCA, and it was really helpful to a lot of my  friends.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And Kyle, you've called yourself a conservative, right?  And as  a supporter -- </p><p>KASHUV:  Yes, Ma'am.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  of the second amendment?  Has this impact --</p><p>KASHUV:  Yes, Ma'am.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Has this incident impacted your views?</p><p>KASHUV:  It's only slightly.  I still believe in the second amendment and  its importance to our nation.  I really -- it's dissatisfying to see the  Never Again Movement, slightly switched from simply making sure that this  will never happen again to gun control, but at the end of the day, I still  think that the entire community and the Never Again Movement, is still  heavily pushing to make sure that school shootings will be a thing in the  past.  And I really -- I'm really happy to see the entire community come  together as a bipartisan issue to work for a better change. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, especially since there were so many signs and signals that  were there and were missed.  Do -- had you ever seen or heard about Nikolas  Cruz?  And obviously, he was told don't come back (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>KASHUV:  Up until this incident --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I'm sorry?</p><p>KASHUV:  Up until, like, the school shooting, I had never known of his  existence but my friends did.  I had some friends that were in class with  him, and they always told -- they told me now, that they always knew  something was off about him.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What did they say about him?  What did -- what did people know  about him?</p><p>KASHUV:  They said that he was -- he was an outcast.  He wasn't really  understood.  They considered him somewhat of a weirdo, if I could quote.   He didn't have a lot of friends, but no one ever thought that he would do  such a thing.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  So, the Governor, Rick Scott, has some proposals on the  table for the state, including arming teachers, administrators.  Listen to  this.  I want to get your reaction.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GOV. RICK SCOTT (R), FLORIDA:  My plan is to spend $500 million to make our  school safe, to invest dollars in mental illness to make sure this never  happens again.  We need to increase the collaboration between our local  sheriffs, our police departments, our schools, Department of Children and  Families and DJJ.  We have got to make sure we have an increased law  enforcement presence in all of our schools.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So Kyle, what do you think about those ideas?  I mean, a minute  ago, you said you would like to see mothers volunteer.  Would you want to  see teachers armed?</p><p>KASHUV:  I think, that simply proposing that, here -- I think it's really  complex issue.  And in certain counties, there's a response time of maybe,  like. 15 minutes for the police to reach the school.  And studies show that  the first shots in a school shooting, only in five minutes, so practically,  the school is unarmed for 15 minutes and unable to defend themselves, and  simply, like, giving teachers the opportunity to, like, defend their  students, is a good thing.  And all levels of the school system in that  county, have to allow the teacher, and the teacher himself or herself has  to voluntarily do the training to be able to carry a gun at school.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Kyle, where were you when you first learned there was an active  shooter in school?</p><p>KASHUV:  I was in a very close adjacent building.  And in the beginning, I  thought that it was -- it didn't sound like gun shots at all because they  were so muffled, but I later realized that because it's in the freshman  building, they sounded muffled.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And what happened?  What did you -- what were you told?  Can  you walk us through it?</p><p>KASHUV:  Yes, ma'am.  So, I was in my last period class, and there was a  fire drill, so I was gradually walking out, and then, I didn't want to  leave the classroom and then I heard (INAUDIBLE) announcement saying,  evacuate immediately.  We evacuated immediately into the main hallway, and  then we heard two pops.  I didn't think it was gunshots.  </p><p>People started panicking, so I want to run back into my teacher's  classroom, and he closed the door on me.  He closed the door on, like, a  few of my fellow students and he wouldn't let us in, which he followed a  procedure, he did.  He feels terrible for what he did but it's completely  understandable because he had no idea who the shooter was.  </p><p>So, then we quickly ran to another teacher's room and she piled us in  there.  We then -- we hid in the closet for two hours and then constantly,  we were getting feeds from our friends and our family were contacting us  and everyone was hysterically crying, and I was trying to calm everyone  down.  Then, it took a while for SWAT to come get us because we've such a  big campus.  They had to take a while to clear it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How do think things change at the school now?</p><p>KASHUV:  Can you repeat that?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How do you think things will change now, at the school?</p><p>KASHUV:  I think, now, a little -- like, as of right now, there's going to  be a bigger police presence on campus, but sadly, I don't think that  anything is going to really change in the next coming week.  I think  everything is going to stay the same.  I don't think that we're going to  have -- the only thing -- the only difference, we're going to have  increased security by police office.  I don't think that anything,  specifically, other than that, will change in the security at our school.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Kyle.  We appreciate you joining us this morning.   We all send love --</p><p>KASHUV:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  and support to you and all of your friends and colleagues at  the school.  Kyle, good luck going back today, thank you.</p><p>KASHUV:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Kyle Kashuv, joining us there.  Coming up, immigration  crackdown despite a heads up from the mayor, ICE officials has arrested  more than 150 illegal immigrants in a sweep in a California Sanctuary City.   We're going to talk about that and why she gave the heads up to the  criminals, and then, a major new milestone for the world's largest plane,  details, coming up, back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back, TSA, Transportation Security Administration,  testing technology, now, in New York City that detects suicide vests,  Lauren Simonetti with all the details, now, Lauren.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  Pretty unbelievable, Maria, those tests taking place this week  with Amtrak at New York's Penn Station, the move, coming after that failed  pipe bomb attempt in a subway passage way back in December.  That was just  a couple blocks from Penn station.  This vest detection technology uses  special cameras that can scan for explosive devices, but the TSA says the  equipment can see through clothing, no privacy concerns because the image  is animated.  </p><p>Well, a massive ICE sweep in Northern California, more than 150 illegal  immigrants taken into custody despite warnings from the mayor of Oakland.   The top ice officials said the mayor's warning lightly gave criminals a  chance to escape.  The agency is now asking the Department of Justice to  look into whether she violated any laws with that warning.</p><p>Meanwhile, big win for President Trump and his border wall.  A federal  judge ruling against an environmental challenge to the wall, saying  Congress and the President share responsibilities to protect the country.   Border wall construction plans can now move forward.</p><p>While there is a chance that the U.S. may rejoin the Transpacific  Partnership or the TPP.  Treasury Secretary, Steve Mnuchin, says  renegotiation is on the table and that he's been in talks with other  countries about what it would take for the us to recommit.  President Trump  as you know, withdrew from President Obama's signature trade agreement last  year but Secretary Steve Mnuchin adding rejoining is not a priority for the  administration at the moment.  </p><p>And a new way to launch satellite into outer space, now the Strata Launch - - the world's largest airplane which can reach a speed of 46 miles an hour  on the taxiway, that's a big deal.  It's has a wingspan of 385 feet.  It  can carry 100,000 pounds.  It's designed to bring rockets to the  stratosphere for a more affordable launch for a low orbit satellites.  The  Strata Launch could make its first test flight by next year.  And of  course, Maria, Microsoft Co-Founder, Paul Allen, is backing this.  This is  his company.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  All right.  Lauren, thank you so much.  I want to talk  about this testing at Penn Station.  What do you thinL?  </p><p>CHAFFETZ:  Coincidentally I was at Penn Station, and I saw them doing this  testing.  I think it's good technology.  Let's remember that the Pentagon  spent more than $20 billion trying to figure out how to identify,  improvised explosive devices.  And you know what, the single best way to do  it is, dogs.  We can have all the technology we want, we need more dogs,  because dogs can find these things, they're mobile, and they're the best  deterrent that we have.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We now have smart dogs or so, yes, I agree with that.  </p><p>KISSEL:  Should we be more concerned about the TSA?  And I was looking at  some of these tests that they do, where they try to get bombmaking  materials through the security at airports, and they fail the majority of  the time, the overwhelming majority of the time.  Is that an agency that  needs more congressional oversight?  </p><p>CHAFFETZ:  It does and they need to look at the priority.  Because you know  what, dogs, they don't have lobbyists, but the people that sell these  machines, by the hundreds of millions of dollars, they do have lobbyists.   And often times, they're deploying technology that doesn't work.  The  Pentagon doesn't send this technology overseas, they don't have this  technology at the White House.  When you walk in to go into the oval  office, you don't go through this machine, you walk by a dog.  That's why  they use them it's because they're the most effective things.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Very deterrent, but by the way, I know you know this but $0.60  of the TSA fee that we pay when we fly, $0.60 of the $5.60 goes to deficit  reduction.  There is a billion-and-a half-dollars-plus being diverted for  deficit reduction rather than it being spent on actual airport security  every year.  </p><p>KISSEL:  You wonder where all that money goes, you know, when you go  through JFK or LaGuardia, you see all these people standing around, are  they really looking out for our security?  Is that a crack force that's  going to find the next bomb?  </p><p>CHAFFETZ:  Security badges that airports biggest thing.  There are 13,000  people with a security badge at Dulles airport in Washington D.C.  One of  those people slipping by at the wrong time, and you got a real problem.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And a TSA agent smacked my dog in the face by an accident,  because he messing with it in August.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's incredible.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, so, that's what they're busy doing.  Hitting fluffy, little  15-pound animals.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That was Charlie.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, I'm not joking.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I'm sorry to hear that.  We'll take break.  When we come back,  the rise of the new Silicon Valley; how the Middle East is giving its  California tech mecca a run for its money and market share.  We're going to  take a look.  Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Now, the latest in Silicon Valley, Apple shares hitting all- time high yesterday.  Take a look, 178.50 is where the stock is now, up 30  percent this past year.  Netflix is still driving the so-called fang stocks  already up better than 45 percent this year.  Joining us right now to talk  more about tech and where the growth in the world is today is Chemi Peres,  Chairman of the Peres Center for Peace and Innovation, and Managing General  Partner of Pitango Venture Capital.  Chemi, good to see you.  Thanks so  much for joining us.  </p><p>CHEMI PERES, CHAIRMAN, PERES CENTER FOR PEACE AND INNOVATION AND MANAGING  GENERAL PARTNER OF PITANGO VENTURE CAPITAL:  Good to see you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Tell us what you're doing at Pitango and where you see growth  in terms of innovation in the world today.  You've been investing in a  number of areas in tech.  </p><p>PERES:  For the best 25 years, we've been investing in Israeli technology,  we're investing at growth stage, at early-stage, and incubation.  And I  think that the great thing that we're seeing; number one, probably, is  cybersecurity, where it is a great concern around the world.  Terrorism is  globalized, so we are taking care of that.  Secondly, there's tremendous  innovation in A.I., machine learning, and deep learning to connect devices  and machines to the Internet, to create new services.  Thirdly, most likely  is a precision medicine to help us get better and earlier.  </p><p>And probably, I would say, in addition to those kinds of innovations, we're  seeing also the attempt to decentralize the currency systems, to give it  more freedom through blockchain technologies.  And I think that what you've  seen right now in terms of the share prices, you see that the greatest  companies today in the world are technology companies pushing away, you  know, oil, and gas, and chemicals, and construction. So, we are moving to a  new world.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We sure are.</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  Artificial intelligence is a big promise.  There's a lot of good  that can be done, there's also a lot of bad that can be done with  artificial intelligence.  So, where do you see that going, and how do we  control it or does it need to be controlled?  </p><p>PERES:  So, first of all, you are very much right.  Technology without  moral values is very dangerous, so we have to develop more values.  One of  the trends that we're seeing also in the investment space, is that people  are trying to achieve double bottom line, make progress on technology, but  at the same time, make the world safer by using technology for the better.   And I think this is a great challenge that human beings are facing in the  next 10 to 20 years.  </p><p>KISSEL:  Chemi, should we be thinking about Israel is the second Silicon  Valley?  And for investors out there that are sick of the fang stocks here  in the United States, you know, what are the companies that they should be  looking at over there?  </p><p>PERES:  So, I think you shouldn't look at it as a second Silicon Valley,  you should look at it as a first innovation nation.  It's a nation that  both created not from the land but from the mind.  Everything that happen  in Israel was not build upon the land.  We cannot use the land for natural  resources for food or water.  Everything that we do, state foundation,  security, economy, and peace-building is only with our brain.  So, you  should think of Israel as an empire of the mind, as a model for nations  that would like to transition themselves from the old world where they rely  on the land, to the new world which is limitless based on the brain power.   That's the way you need to look at it.</p><p>KISSEL:  Companies?  Any companies?</p><p>PERES:  Companies, probably the biggest company now emerging is  Technologies Checkpoint, which is doing security, and other great company,  I would say, is the company that Intel-acquired Mobile Eye, which now is  turning to be a center for autonomous driving in Israel.  But you know, we  have 7,000 companies in Israel, and probably five percent of them are  emerging as new, great ideas.  And I think that in the next 10 years, we'll  see tremendous number of Israeli companies really changing the world.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Your father used to talk about this a lot.  The late great  Shimon Peres, which talks about Israel as this hub for innovation.  Why is  that?  Why has Israel been able to really compete with the best of the best  in terms of innovation and technology growth?  </p><p>PERES:  So, as I said there, Maria, basically, you cannot build anything,  because we have -- on the land, because our land is so small, it does not  provide any shelter, no food, no water.  So, we had to build everything on  our brain power.  So, number one is necessity, and the second thing I think  is the notion that Israel wants to make the world better, to change the  world for better.  My father would say, most likely, that our biggest  contribution for human beings is dissatisfaction; we're never satisfied  with everything.  So, we need to check everything with technology.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I like that.  Great.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  By the way, the president announced, obviously, his future  plans with the City of Jerusalem back in December of 2017 to move the  embassy to Jerusalem.  You're happy with this decision, obviously?  </p><p>PERES:  Obviously, I'm very happy.  Not everything that is done for Israel  is necessarily bad for other people.  That should've been done in 1947 when  Israel was established as a nation.  Celebrating our 70th anniversary.  I  think it's a great present to fix what was wrong.  It should have been,  from day one, our capital.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Chemi, it's good to see you.  </p><p>PERES:  Good to see you, too.  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Chemi Peres.  We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Wednesday morning, everybody.  Thanks so  much for joining us.

Futures are flat today now.  Markets were edging higher earlier as  investors await fourth quarter GDP numbers to come out, roughly 90 minutes  from now.  We're expecting the economy to show growth of 2.5 percent in the  fourth quarter.</p><p>My next guest chairs the subcommittee on monetary policy and trade in the  House Financial Services Committee.  Joining us right now is Kentucky  Congressman Andy Barr.  Congressman -- it's good to see you.  Thanks so  much for joining us.</p><p>REP. ANDY BARR (R), KENTUCKY:  Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So did what you see in terms of what's happening in the economy  today -- did that jibe with what you heard from Mr. Powell yesterday?  </p><p>BARR:  Yes, I think our new chairman of the Federal Reserve reinforced what  we're already seeing, which is that tax cuts and the regulatory relief  agenda -- that that agenda is working in the economy and that the economic  outlook is strong as a result of the fiscal stimulus that congress and the  President have injected into the economy.  And that gives the Fed greater  flexibility to continue its monetary normalization program, which is very  important to remove the distortions from our economy.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So what did you get from him yesterday?  I mean did you get a  sense that he's going to raise interest rates four times?  </p><p>BARR:  Well, I was encouraged that Chairman Powell did clearly communicate  the monetary policy trajectory.  He did indicate that the tax cuts were  working in terms of increasing household incomes, increasing wages.  The  consumer and the business confidence is very, very high.</p><p>And as a result, we do expect the Fed to continue to normalize and that's  very important, because this Fed chairman has inherited a very  unprecedented task and that is the task to unwind a very unconventional  balance sheet, a bloated balance sheet that creates risks and also a  protracted period of artificially-low rates.  We need to return to market- based rates.</p><p>That doesn't mean an unpredictable increase, dramatic increase in interest  rates.  It means a gradual, predictable increase in interest rates,  consistent with the growing economy.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  We were talking about that all morning -- $4.5 trillion  balance sheet needs to get unwound which is why you asked this question  yesterday.  Let's listen.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARR:  Are there any plans within the balance sheet normalization strategy  to roll off longer term assets more quickly, to counteract that flattening  yield curve?  </p><p>JEROME POWELL, CHAIRMAN, FEDERAL RESERVE:  You know, flattening of yield  curves in the past has been sort of a precursor of recessions, but largely  because in many prior recessions the Fed had to raise rates quickly to  hold, you know, to hold inflation down.</p><p>That's not the situation we have now.  There's always a risk of a recession  at any given point in time.  I don't see it as at all high at the moment.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So were you surprised that the markets reacted so violently  after the meeting?  </p><p>BARR:  No.  And I'm also not surprised at the general level of volatility.   And remember, some of these corrections are very healthy to avoid asset  bubbles.  We don't want excessive volatility but we also recognize that  normalizing monetary policy can be a very sound policy from the standpoint  of preventing asset bubbles, making sure that we are realigning valuations  and equities according to reality.</p><p>So it's not all together a bad thing to recalibrate as the markets continue  their overall upward trajectory.  Again, we don't want valuations to exceed  reality and so some level of correction here and there is a good thing, as  the market continues its long-term bull run.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE):  I see.</p><p>KISSEL:  What is Congress going to do -- by the way, this is Mary Kissel  here -- if we do see a spike in rates and that interest burden on the  government debt goes through the roof?  I mean that's a big risk, isn't it.   What are you guys doing about it?  </p><p>BARR:  It is a big risk.  But it's also important that we don't mask the  true problem with artificially low rates that create distortions in the  economy and excessive risk.  I think it's incumbent upon Congress and the  President to get serious about mandatory spending reform.</p><p>I would add that some of the critics of tax reform blame tax cuts for  larger deficits.  I think monetary normalization and unreformed mandatory  spending is what is likely to increase deficits.</p><p>And so that reinforces the need for us to continue pro-growth policies so  that we get revenue, not from tax cuts, but from more taxpayers.  And we  also reform mandatory spending so that we can force the government to live  within its means.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We're going to switch gears here.  Here's Jason Chaffetz.  Go  ahead.</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  Yes, Jason Chaffetz here.  It's good to see you -- Andy.</p><p>BARR:  Hey -- Jason.  Good to see you.</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  I served with Andy in the United States Congress.</p><p>I want to ask you about guns.  The House of Representatives passed a bill  that had the concealed carry reciprocity act coupled with the Fix NICS, the  National Instant Background Check System.  Do you think the House has an  appetite to separate those bills and run independently the Fix NICS  legislation?  And would that be palatable with what's going on in the  Senate?  </p><p>BARR:  Well, I would support that -- Jason.  I also support the reciprocity  bill.  I'm a co-sponsor of the reciprocity bill, our colleague Richard  Hudson's bill.</p><p>But I also support fixing the NICS and enhancing the NICS system.  And I  was one of many members of Congress also who signed a letter to the ATF to  revisit the bump stock after -- the bump stock regulations after Las Vegas.  </p><p>CHAFFETZ:  So why don't those things pass?  I mean if you're as  conservative as they get in the House, then why isn't Kevin McCarthy and  Paul Ryan pulling up those bills because we could pass both of those, even  three bills independently.  Why isn't that happening?  </p><p>BARR:  Well, as you know, Jason -- and I'm not sure if you were still in  the Congress at the time, but we did pass the fix NICS with the reciprocity  bill.</p><p>I'm in favor of separating and passing them again.  I think the Senate  needs to take action.  You know, there's a narrative out there that  Congress doesn't care or hasn't taken action on these mass murders.  That's  not true.  We passed the Helping Families and Mental Health Crisis Act as  part of the 21st Century Cures Act which helped to reform HIPAA with  respect to helping family members intervene with loved ones whoa re  suffering from mental illness.</p><p>We've also taken action on the bump stocks.  We passed the Fix NICS  program.  And I would also be in favor of some federal authority to give  local school districts the flexibility and the discretion to make our  schools safer and to use resources to either pay for law enforcement  officers in the schools, harden schools, metal detectors, even more  psychologists or counselors in the schools to monitor kids who have social  alienation and warning signs.</p><p>And you know, this is personal to me and Jason because our good friend  Steve Scalise was the victim last June of a gunman.  And you know, the one  lesson from that baseball field in Alexandria when many of our colleagues  were out there in harm's way, the lesson was that the best defense in a  situation like that is a well-armed, well-trained security guard.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>BARR:  And you know, I think local school districts should be able to  direct local decisions with Parent Teachers Associations on whether or not  they want to use resources to have security officers in their schools.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  You would think so -- Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Congressman -- I want to ask you what you think about your  Senator Rand Paul from your state of Kentucky about his pushback on this  Fix NICS bill because you are getting that from some conservatives with the  suggestion of how can you appeal if you're flagged in this background check  system.</p><p>So are some of your colleagues, whether in the House like Congressman Louis  Gohmert who we talked to yesterday, and then in the senate, getting in the  way of passing a clean bill to beef up a background check system that  already exists and works in this country?  </p><p>BARR:  Well, in the case of Texas, where you saw the Air Force fail to  provide the information to the NICS system, I think that's exactly what  we're trying to fix.  And I think we need to make sure that federal  agencies are actually providing the information to make the NICS system  work.</p><p>We can have all the checks in the world.  But if you don't have the  information in the background check system it doesn't work.  And I would  add that the Fix NICS bill that we passed out of the House already, that  bill actually enhanced some of the due process.</p><p>So I agree with Senator Paul.  We need procedural due process if the  government is, you know, taking away a constitutional right without due  process.  We need that due process.  But we also need to make sure that the  NICS system is working and clearly, it's not.</p><p>And I would also add in the case of the tragedy in Florida, this young man  was showing all of the warning signs -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>BARR:  -- and clearly there was a failure by law enforcement, our mental  health system and the education system to get that information so that that  young man was not -- could not purchase a firearm.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So you think there will be improvements this year?  You think  there will be any changes in legislation this year on this?</p><p>BARR:  Well, of course, we've already passed the bill out of the House.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  I know.</p><p>BARR:  We would encourage the Senate to do the same.  And I would be in  favor of separating those out consistent with my strong, strong support of  the Second Amendment.  And none of these reforms in my view would in any  way compromise our commitment to the Second Amendment.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Congressman -- let me move on.</p><p>Reverend Billy Graham will lie in honor today in the U.S. Capitol Rotunda.   He will be the fourth private citizen to lie in honor.  Your thoughts on  the storied life of Reverend Graham; can you tell us a little about what  you're expecting today in terms of the ceremony?  </p><p>BARR:  Well, it's altogether appropriate that the Congress is not in  session to honor the legacy and the tremendous contributions and the  spiritual leadership of Billy Graham -- Reverend Billy Graham who  ministered to so many Americans including U.S. presidents and members of  Congress.</p><p>We are so -- we're not only appreciative of his ministry but we're grateful  for the leadership that he provided to the country in good times and bad  times.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Let me ask you Congressman, before you go, on Financial  Services Committee -- how much of a priority is changing Dodd-Frank?  Is  that going to be a priority in the coming weeks?  When might we expect  changes here?  </p><p>BARR:  Well, I'm very optimistic that we have a bipartisan bill that's  moving through the Senate.  As you know, statutory changes to a law like  Dodd-Frank which has been a disaster in terms of clogging up our financial  markets -- we need 60 votes in the Senate.</p><p>So we have a modest reform bill that fixes some of the overreach from Dodd- Frank.  It's moving through the Senate.  We've passed a more ambitious bill  out of the House.  But that gives us a lot of optimism that we can provide  regulatory relief for community financial institutions.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So it should be coming in the coming weeks, then.</p><p>Congressman -- good to see you.  Thank you.</p><p>BARR:  Thank you -- good to see you too.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Andy Barr.</p><p>We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>A major retailer taking a stand on assault rifles.

Shares of Disney are down about 5 percent from a year ago.</p><p>There you go.</p><p>All right.  This is an interesting story.  Barbra Streisand, 75 years old,  revealing that two of her three dogs are clones.  Miss Scarlet and Miss  Violet were actually cloned from cells taken from her 14-year-old dog,  Samantha before Samantha died last year.  So the dogs look alike but  Streisand said she can't wait to see if they share Samantha's personality  as well.  Apparently she was a serious dog.</p><p>If you were wondering, the price to clone is $50,000 per pup.  And she  dressed them in different colors so she could tell them apart.  That's how  they got their names -- Scarlet and Violet.  Now you know.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I don't know if I like the story -- cloning your dog.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  With all the dogs -- you know what, with all the dogs in  shelters that are on at-risk lists that need homes, whether it's the dogs  on the streets of Puerto Rico and Miami, New York City, and you pay the  money to clone your dog.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Why not adopt a dog or puppy that needs you?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  You've got all that money, you could have 10 and save some  lives.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Cloning your dogs.   </p><p>CHAFFETZ:  Wasn't she going to move to Canada?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  She was supposed to move to Canada if President Trump won the  election.

She thinks  there was vote tampering.  She literally said that the last few days.  </p><p>CHAFFETZ:  I still want my money back from going to see \"Yentl\" -- still a  craw in my side.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  You're that old?</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We've got a tweet to tell you about.

Here's  what he said.  \"The Heritage Foundation has just stated that 64 percent of  the Trump agenda is already done -- faster than even Ronald Reagan.  We are  blown away, said Thomas Binion of Heritage.  President Trump is very  active, conservative and very effective.  Huge volume and spectrum of  issues.\"</p><p>The President just tweeted that.</p><p>Do you disagree with that?  He's patting himself on the back, definitely.   You're right.  </p><p>CHAFFETZ:  Yes.

Back in a  minute, we'll preview it.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>The fourth quarter GDP is due out in about an hour.  Growth is expected to  be 2.5 percent, according to Thompson Reuters.  This after Federal Reserve  Chairman J. Powell testified in front of the House Financial Services  Committee yesterday on his outlook for the economy.  Watch.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>POWELL:  It does feel to me that the next couple of years look quite strong  and you should see strong demand from consumers.  You should see businesses  investing and I would expect the next two years on the current path to be,  you know, to be good years for the economy.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  joining us now, Wells Fargo Investment Institute senior global  equity strategist Scott Wren.  Scott -- good to see you.</p><p>SCOTT WREN, SENIOR GLOBAL EQUITY STRATEGIST, WELLS FARGO INVESTMENT  INSTITUTE:  Hi -- Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The next couple years look strong, good growth.  What does that  mean for you in markets?  </p><p>WREN:  Well, for us I think strong is certainly a relative term.   Politicians always want to seem to pump up the growth very high, but if we  saw something in the 2.5 percent, 2.8 percent, maybe toward 3 type of  range, I think over the next couple of years, inflation stays reasonable.   I think stocks can do well in that kind of an environment.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  How come markets are so nervous about this?  </p><p>WREN:  Well, I would argue that 2018 is all about the central banks and  particularly the fed.  We've been on a 10 year monetary policy experiment.   It's coming to an end.</p><p>In any normal cycle the fed usually has trouble backing away.  This one's  going to be more difficult.  So when the market starts finally coming to  grips that we're going to have three hikes this year, which I think they  have, when in 2017 the stock market I think was mostly in denial, it's some  uncertainty.</p><p>J. Powell talked yesterday, as you mentioned, talks maybe 4 -- that's a  problem.  We've argued that 3 is ok, but anything over that is a head wind  for the market.  </p><p>CHAFFETZ:  You said reasonable inflation number.  What is a reasonable  expectation of inflation?  </p><p>WREN:  Well, Jason -- I tell you, we are -- let's say we got out of 2017  with 2, 2.1 CPI type of number.  Our number this year is 2.4 so inflation  is moving up.  That's way below the longer term average.  Of course,  personal consumption expenditures, PCE has been stuck at 1.5 percent, way  below where the Fed wants to see it.</p><p>So you know, I think the Fed's probably in the end going to let the economy  run a little hot.  I mean they've been trying to get inflation for 10  years.  They have not been successful.  They don't want to just choke it  off too quickly.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  When you talk about the central bank, our Central Bank  unprecedented monetary policy over the last 10 years, interest rates could  get away from them.  They can move on the short end.  But in terms of the  longer end and as treasury and mortgage securities roll off their balance  sheet as they try to reduce it later this year -- that's the great unknown.</p><p>You don't really have -- because, again, the market could take over and  you've already seen that start to happen with longer term interest rates.   They're only at 2.91 percent at the close yesterday on the 10 year but  Nevertheless, that's a major worry.  That's why people are so fixated on  that.  </p><p>WREN:  Well, I think they are -- Dagen.  And really we're in uncharted  territory.  I mean we've never had to roll off this much off a fed balance  sheet.  So that's more uncertainty.  I think any news that has to do with  wages, with employment, with inflation, with the fed, the market is going  to react meaningfully probably, one way or the other.</p><p>Yesterday it was J. Powell's comments.  I think on March 9th when the  employment data is released, the single most important data point this  month or in March, rather, I would argue is what did average hourly  earnings do year over year.  If that is less than 2.9, let's say it's 2.6 I  think the market will rally on that.  If it's 3 or 3.1, it's probably going  to be an ugly day.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Because those are two important dates.  March 1st, we get  the PCE indicator; March 9th we get the jobs number with the wages.  We'll  be watching that. </p><p>Real quick what are you telling clients to do right now?  Would you put new  money to work here?  </p><p>WREN:  Absolutely.  I think that what we want our clients doing,  industrials, consumer discretionary, health care, financials -- we want  them buying on the dips.  We've been pounding the table on this thing.</p><p>Now, it came and went pretty quick between February 2nd and February 9th.   It went down a lot and people were cautious because of the speed it went  down.  We want our clients in this market though.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We will leave it there.

The press doesn't know,  we don't have eyes and ears in the courtroom.</p><p>(b), just as important, there is no adversary.</p><p>If you are presenting a document to me and you're not telling me everything  about it, your adversary is going to point that out to me but where there  is no adversary it's very easy for you to pull the wool over my eyes.</p><p>There was a proposal not too long ago to have a standing adversary in the - - </p><p>CHAFFETZ:  Yes.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: -- FISA court.  The adversary doesn't represent the person  whose surveillance is sought but the adversary challenges the government's  documents which would force the government to -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But -- </p><p>NAPOLITANO: -- dot every \"i\" and -- </p><p>BARTIROMO: -- so nobody -- </p><p>NAPOLITANO: -- cross every \"t\" -- </p><p>BARTIROMO: -- challenges anything?</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Correct.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE.  But if the process is so corrupted Judge, if you have  let's say a president Hillary Clinton and her friends at the top of the  FBI, if that had happened and you have this process -- </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  They could surveil anybody.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: -- They could surveil anybody.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Right.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE.  So, isn't it time to talk about getting rid of this  court?</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Absolutely.</p><p>I've been arguing since 1978, Jason was a little boy but this court has  been unconstitutional.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Devin Nunes has said that --  he suggested, Luke we need a FISA  court but, but, but, I if this kind of abuse of continues we may look to  not fund this FISA court.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: A, it tampers with the standard that's in the Constitution,  from probable cause of crime to probable cause of speaking to a foreign  person, that is a radically lower standard.</p><p>Congress can change the Constitution and it's purported to do so.  B, it  meets a secret.  C, it's not a real court because there's no adversary in  the courtroom.</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  But Congress just reauthorized it.  They reauthorized it and  then like 48 hours later -- </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Yes.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: -- they announced all these potential abuses -- </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  I appreciate -- </p><p>Chef it's: -- of the FISA court.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: -- what Devin Nunes is doing but he in my opinion committed a  grave wrong by sitting on all this while Congress was debating the  reauthorization -- </p><p>CHAFFETZ:  Yes.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: -- of FISA.</p><p>He permitted more power in the hands of the very people whom he accused of  abusing that power.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Why?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE.  Yes, but there's been no evidence that Section 702  that was reauthorized has been abuse.</p><p>My question to you Judge is, what executive would want the FISA court to go  away because if that court went away, then the executive branch would be  wholly -- </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Directly responsible -- </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: -- responsible, directly responsible -- </p><p>NAPOLITANO: -- Correct.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: -- for the surveillance.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's -- </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  It's -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's a good point.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: -- it's extraordinary power to the executive branch.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow!</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Very difficult to get any entity, Congress or the president to  shrink its own power.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow!</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  It will take an extremely principled person to do that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, my goodness!</p><p>Well we've got to get to this as well because FBI, former FBI director Jim  Comey is bashing President Trump, again, ahead of his book release.</p><p>Comey tweeted out a picture of himself, recording the audio version of his  new tell-all book last night, and wrote, \"Lordy, this time there will be a  tape; audiobook almost finished.\"</p><p>His caption references president Trump's Tweet last year that conversations  between the two men have been recorded.</p><p>Judge your reaction to this?</p><p>He -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- he keeps poking the president --  </p><p>NAPOLITANO: -- Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- meanwhile all of this wrong-doing went on, on his watch.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Yes.</p><p>Yes, and I don't know what he's doing.</p><p>I am - he --  my guess he thought it was funny and, in some sense, it might  be a little, mildly humorous, 'this time there will be a tape' because when  president Trump said \"James Comey better hope there isn't a tape,' and then  Congress tried to get the tape and then the president said, \"OK, there  wasn't a tape.  I was just suggesting that he better hope that there isn't  one.\"</p><p>This is a reference to that.  I think it's inside the beltway and inside  base (ph) but -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  He's auditioning for those late-night talk shows -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Hmm --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL: -- because he needs those appearances to hump that lousy book -- </p><p>NAPOLITANO: Correct.</p><p>MCDOWELL: -- that's coming out.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Correct.  It may be a great book -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>NAPOLITANO: -- it may be a challenging (ph) book, it may be garbage, I  don't know.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Guys, we know that Jim Comey leaked something to his friend to  get it into \"The New York Times\" so that they could get a special counsel  in place.</p><p>Did he commit a felony?</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  I don't think he did because he prepared the document, it  would also depend on what's in the document; I don't believe that there was  anything classified in there but that too is being investigated by the  inspector general.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Well there's a lot of open --  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  So, -- </p><p>BARTIROMO: -- investigations now about classified leaks.</p><p>Jeff Sessions told me there are 27 open investigations right now of  classified leaks.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: -- Did he tell you --  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>NAPOLITANO: -- any of them go back into the Clinton --  into the Obama  administration?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  \"No.\"</p><p>But -- </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Who unmasked General Flynn and the ambassador Kislyak --  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: -- in the waning days of the Obama administration?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  And that was a clear felony which is what Devin Nunes - - </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Absolutely.</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- said on the -- </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Absolutely.</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- air as well.</p><p>Final word Dagen?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No, I was just going to say, the inspector general can find out  something - wrongdoing with Jim Comey and nothing happens to him except he  is on a book tour where the talk show hosts are genuflecting in his  presence.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  And he'll make a fortune.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well by the way --  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- the inspector general we're expecting it in March?</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  I think that's --  yes -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes -- </p><p>CHAFFETZ: -- I think it's -- </p><p>MCDOWELL: -- soon.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: -- within the next 45 days or so.</p><p>The -- </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Yes.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: -- administration will get about a thirty-day heads up, that is  the procedure.</p><p>They'll give it to him 30 days heads up but then they'll come --  I believe  to the Oversight Committee.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, well 10 people have already been reassigned or  fired, leading up to that report so we'll see if there's connection there.</p><p>Judge, thank you.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  My pleasure.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Judge Napolitano.</p><p>We'll be right back.</p><p>Stay with us, we're talking about NASA astronauts next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>BREAKING NEWS this morning, big news from the NFL.</p><p>Lauren Simonetti on it right now -- </p><p>SIMONETTI:  All right -- Maria, the NFL didn't take long to find a  replacement for its pizza sponsor.</p><p>As you know, just yesterday, the League broke off its relationship with  Papa John's.</p><p>And moments ago, it was announced that Pizza Hut is now the official pizza  sponsor of the NFL multi-year agreement that will offer Pizza Hut and array  of exclusive marketing rights connected with the League.</p><p>Shares of Yum!

Since then what we've  seen is incoming data that suggests a strengthening in the economy.

The first is called STOP  School Violence Act, that would reauthorized the Federal grant program.   And the second is the Fix NICS bill which  would penalize government should  they not report criminal records into the background check system.   Yesterday, the White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders also signaled that  more support for legislation could come by week's end.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>SARAH HUCKABEE SNADERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  Anything further will  come later this week.  The President as I've said expects to meet with a  number of lawmakers tomorrow from both sides of the aisle and wants some  more information about specifics after that.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURMAN:  As you mentioned for the first time since the shooting, students  at Marjory Stoneman Douglas Senior High School in Parkland, Florida  returning to their classrooms this morning on this program earlier today.   Junior Kyle Kashuv said he is not so certain that anything will change at  least in the upcoming weeks as it relates to safety at his school.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KYLE KASHUV, MARJORY STONEMAN DOUGLAS HIGH SCHOOL:  Sadly I don't think  that anything is going to really change in the next coming weeks.  I think  everything is going to stay the same.  I don't think that we're going to  have -- the only thing -- the only difference we're going to have increased  security by police officers. I don't think that anything specifically other  than that will change in the security of other schools.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BURMAN:  Meantime, the business fallout is continuing Dick's Sporting Goods  making a major announcement this morning saying that they will stop selling  all assault-style rifles in their stores along with high-capacity magazines  and make sure that whoever buys a gun in their store is at least 21 years  old.  This comes as lawmakers in the State of New York, Virginia, Ohio, and  Alabama are now courting Delta Airlines.  </p><p>Maria, you know, the background to this one, Delta pulled some benefits for  NRA members after the shooting.  Lawmakers in the State of Georgia said  that they might yank a tax benefit for Delta.  Here at White House, I asked  the Press Secretary Sarah Sanders about this yesterday and the White House  is not weighing in.  Maria?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Hmm.  Well, I mean, it's odd to say this least.  Blake, thank  you.  We're going to keep covering this.  Blake Burman is at the White  House.  Joining us now to continue the conversation is former Mississippi  governor, former RNC Chairman now founding partner at BGR Group, Haley  Barbour. Governor, it's good to see you, sir.  Thanks so much for joining  us.</p><p>HALEY BARBOUR, FOUNDING PARTNER, BGR GROUP:  Thank you, Maria.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Where do you stand on all this?  Dick's Sporting Goods today,  one of the largest sports retailers in the country announcing it will stop  selling assault fire rifles.  Is that significant to you?</p><p>BARBOUR:  Well, I mean, it's a -- it's a big industry when you go into a  gun store or a sporting goods store, sells guns, you're going to see that  these assault-looking rifles are very prominent and when you ask the store  owner will say it's because all the customers see it on television, they  see it in the movies, and they are enamored of learning more about these --  about these guns.  So if Dick's does this, or if Dick's does this, they are  going to be turning their back on fair amount of the market and that's a  private decision that they have to make as a business decision.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But isn't it -- isn't it worth having the discussion?  I mean,  I'm all about freedoms and my rights.  I don't want my second amendment  rights touched but assault rifles, why do people need assault rifles?  </p><p>BARBOUR:  Well -- I mean, first of all, there's a huge difference between  people in urban areas and people in rural areas.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.  </p><p>BARBOUR:  When you get in a rural area, you could be 30 minutes from the  nearest deputy sheriff.  And if something happens in at your home or in the  area where you are, to one of your neighbors, it could be like I say 30  minutes before law enforcement can get there.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.  That's a fair point.  </p><p>BARBOUR:  So people need a way to -- need a way to protect themselves,  their families and their property.  And let's don't kid ourselves, if  you're at outlaw guns, only outlaws will have guns.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Good point.  </p><p>BARBOUR:  So --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And Governor Barbour, I think that what people just want in  terms of this gun safety debate is some -- they want evidence-based  decisions because people always point to the \"assault weapons ban\" from  1994 to 2002.  And if you look at all of the studies done, that ban had a  negligible impact on gun crime.  Instead those studies point to improved  background checks, now that was 18 weapons that these assault weapons were  banned for really cosmetic reasons.  </p><p>You look at this new assault weapons ban that was introduced by the  Democrats in the House and the way they start defining these weapons, they  clearly are going after semiautomatic handguns as well.  That is clearly  the direction and proponents of the second amendment, that's what they've  always been worried about and people need to understand that's why there's  pushback on broadly banning classes of guns in this country.  </p><p>BARBOUR:  Well, there's no question that probably there are more  semiautomatic handguns in the United States than there are long rifles,  because that's the way -- we don't have as many revolvers as we had when I  was growing up and more semiautomatic.  But you make a very important  point, we need to look at everything, we need to look at mental health,  mental health is a gigantic issue here and the failures of law enforcement  in this case are really mind-boggling.  How many times over and over and  over was this young man reported and yet nothing was ever done about it. </p><p>Which says -- as the young man said on tape a while ago, we are going to  have to harden schools.  How much we do it and how we do it, whether  President Trump's idea to let schoolteachers be armed.  Of course, I'm sure  what he means is only ones who want to, only ones who volunteer, only ones  that take the training, but even if you do that you're still going to need  stronger law enforcement in the schools to protect the people by their soft  targets attract this kind of terrible thing like the church in Texas where  again, the shooter should have been known and should have never been able  to buy a gun but our system broke down, we just got to make our system work  better.  </p><p>KISSEL:  But Governor, Mary Kissel here, it seems to me like the companies  are interested in virtue signaling and the politicians the same, you know,  it is a complex issue, you mentioned mental health, there is a balance to  be struck between the privacy of the individual and the ability to notify  law enforcement, that's a nuance sophisticated conversation to have.  Is  anybody having that conversation? </p><p>BARBOUR:  Well, there need to be because if you're -- if you're next door  neighbor is a grumpy old man, that doesn't mean he is a threat to society.   But if -- but if your next door neighbor behaves like this young boy, this  19-year-old kid did, then absolutely law enforcement or some form of a  judicial system needs to come into this, and his rights of privacy do not  exceed the right of the public to be safe.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  These are all really important points that you make,  Governor.  Let me ask you about immigration because ICE is now saying that  its agents arrested 150 illegal immigrants in the greater San Francisco Bay  area since the weekend.  That despite the fact that Oakland's mayor alerted  the public to the operation that ICE agents were coming.  This comes as a  Federal judge in that rejected a legal challenge to the Trump  administration's plan to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border,  essentially giving the project a green light.  President Trump tweeted  about this this morning, he says, I have decided that sections of the wall  the California wants built now will not be built until the wall is  approved.  Big victory yesterday, the president says with rulings from the  courts that allow us to proceed.  Our country must have border security.   Governor, your reaction, what about the Oakland mayor alerting the illegals  that ICE managers were coming for them?</p><p>BARBOUR:  Well, I thought almost everything she said was unbelievable.  I  mean, let's just suppose for the sake of our government, Memphis, Tennessee  said we're not going to enforce the civil rights law.  I mean, that's what  she said, we're not going to enforce the immigration law, she said  specifically.  It's a Federal law and we don't have to -- we don't have to  abide by it.  That is -- I mean if that were to happen to the civil rights  law this country would be up in arms and rightly so.  But this sanctuary  city business puts people at risk and it puts people at risk who visit  Oakland, California, not just the people that live there.  And certainly,  there are states' rights in our country, we do have a 10th amendment but  the idea that they could just turn up their nose at Federal law -- it's  pretty far out if you ask me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I think it's incredible actually.  Extraordinary how they  get away with that, just ignoring Federal law.  It's -- and continues with  sanctuary city.  Thank you, Governor.</p><p>BARBOUR:  Thank you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good to see you, sir.  Haley Barbour there.  Coming up.  Amazon  knocking on the door for a deal.  The technology giant buys smart doorbell  maker, Ring.  In a deal reportedly valued a billion dollars.  How the home  security market could change.  Back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Later today the President will join lawmaker  honoring America's pastor, the late Billy Graham.  Lauren Simonetti with  the details.  Lauren?</p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Hi, Maria.  The evangelist will  become the fourth private citizen ever to light honor in the capitol  rotunda.  He joined a very short list which includes Rosa Parks in 2005 and  two capital policemen killed in the line of duty, the late preacher's  casket will sit in the capital throughout the day as President Trump,  members of Congress, and the public pay their respects.  His body will then  flown back to North Carolina tomorrow.</p><p>Well, buyers plan to acquire Monsanto reportedly clearing a major hurdle.   Sources telling Reuters the buyer is set to win conditional E.U.  (INAUDIBLE) approval to acquire the world's biggest seed producer, you  discussed, Maria, the $62 billion deal with Bayer CEO earlier today.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WERNER BAUMANN, CEO, BAYER:  We have seen very, very good progress, with --  I know roughly half of the 30 approvals we need, we are in very good  discussions I have to say with the European commission making good progress  there.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  Bayer also reporting adjusted fourth quarter core earnings that  came in slightly below expectations.  Let's show you shares of Monsanto up  almost one percent in premarket trading.  Bayer shares are up nearly 10  percent from a year ago.  There you have it.  </p><p>All right.  Well, Wal-Mart is trying to reach middle-class session  conscious shoppers unveiling for new private label brands to step up its  competition with Amazon and Target.  Wal-Mart also refreshing the Web site  this spring with the focus on fashion plus home furnishing.  Wal-Mart  shares not moving much in premarket trading but the stock up about 30  percent in the past year.</p><p>Well, Ford is bringing its self-driving cars to the streets of Miami.  The  cars are going to make deliveries and they're going to taxi passengers.   Ford teaming up with Dominos to try delivering pizza in these futuristic  vehicles for the time being safety drivers will stay behind the wheel of  all of the Ford.

So the navigation app Waymo is releasing this 360 degree video  that shows you what its cars see including the traffic around them with the  hope of making you feel more comfortable, gaining your trust.  Waymo is  owned by parent company Alphabet, those shares up 30 percent over the past  year.  Maria?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Thank you, Lauren.  We'll take a break.  When we  come back, James Comey versus President Trump.  The former FBI director's  latest jab at the Commander-in-Chief on Twitter.  Back in a minute.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>POWELL:  Our current framework says that the committee would be concerned  with sustained or persistent deviations of inflation above or below two  percent.  And I would say that framework is working.  Market understands  it, we've been -- we've been trying to get up to two percent.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That was the new chairman of the Federal Reserve Jay Powell  yesterday fueling expectancies of inflation and multiple rate increase this  year during his Capitol Hill testimony.  Markets took a big hit after his  upbeat assessment of the U.S. economy .  It was down 300 points on the Dow  Industrials as you see.  This morning futures are stabilizing pointing to a  higher opening which happens in about an hour.  Joining us right now to  talk more about markets and your money, Mahoney Asset Management president,  Ken Mahoney.  Ken, good to see you.</p><p>KEN MAHONEY, PRESIDENT, MAHONEY ASSET MANAGEMENT:  Good to see you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us this morning.  What did you  take away from Jay Powell's testimony yesterday and its impact on markets  and the economy? </p><p>MAHONEY:  You know, he really was not hawkish.  I know that's the headlines  this morning, hawkish, hawkish, he wasn't.  You know, we were over bought  to begin with, we needed something to shake things up a little bit.  So, to  me it was not hawkish and, you know, three rate hikes, four rate hikes  versus the physical stimulus that's coming.  Again, I'll side with the  physical stimulus.  All the moneys that's coming into companies that they  could buy back stock and so forth.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So when you look at the backdrop right now, you're talking  about earnings and the S&amp;P 500 expected to be up 20 percent, 2018.   Economic growth of what, 2-1/2, three percent?  We're  expecting the GDP  number any minute.  What's your take on that?  </p><p>MAHONEY:  Yes.  So our take is that things are really going to be -- pretty  strong.  I think about the buybacks right now, $600 billion of the buy  backs this year.  So why the Fed may be raising a little bit.  Look, this  is definitely the clash of the titans, right?  This textbook you kind of go  through and say, wait a second, fiscal monetary which is going to win?   Now, it's going to create more volatility.  What was unusual is leading  into February.  You have 13 months in a row, the market is going up of only  three percent drawdown.  That's crazy.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MAHONEY:  So going forward we have to be a little bit more nimble, there  will be volatility but we can actually make volatility to your friend by  kind of trading along with that.  </p><p>KISSEL:  And when you say fiscal stimulus, this differs from the Obama era  where the stimulus was really just the Fed goosing the market and  government spending that crushed private sector growth.  This to me looks  more sustainable, doesn't it?  Because you actually have a rollback in the  red tape, you got the tax cuts encouraging business investment which is  what's been lacking for so many years.</p><p>MAHONEY:  Right.  I mean, can you imagine sitting onboard now, and the  question is, what do you do with all this cash?  Do we buy back stock, 600  billion buybacks perhaps this year.  Do we increase the dividends, do we  buy our competitors.  Do we -- these are all good decisions.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  This is decisions towards growth.  </p><p>MAHONEY:  These are all good decisions that would be made at the board  level.  It's nice to have that stimulus that we're talking about.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>KISSEL:  Yes.  But I just want to clarify that because when Democrats talk  about fiscal stimulus, what they mean is we want more government spending,  we want more control over the economy and we're going in the opposite  direction as the right direction.    MAHONEY:  Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Just to back up what you said Journal story today, more than a  fifth companies is in the S&amp;P 500 have boosted their dividends to  shareholders so far this year, not one is lashed with dividend, that's the  first time that's happened in seven years.  Pretty incredible.</p><p>KISSEL:  Yes.  But I guess the question is, are we going to get the kind of  business investment that you need to keep this economy growing above three  percent?</p><p>MAHONEY:  I think so.  I mean, look, there's so many -- things are going  back-and-forth right now.  And right now, it's all about the Fed,  (INAUDIBLE) Powell will not be -- he will be in the headlines next week but  we all doing his thing and we back to talking about taxes again. So, you  know (INAUDIBLE) the focus was about Powell.  </p><p>I think he did a tremendous job yesterday talking about growth.  And look,  I don't think we're going to get into this pickle where we get to better  economic numbers and then that's good news for the economy, bad news for  the market.  I don't think we're going to do that again.  Meaning, you  know, bad news meaning rates going to go higher.  I think we're in good  situation where good news for economy is good news force the U.S.'s stocks,  and therefore that's a good place.  </p><p>CHAFFETZ:  What are your concerns about inflation?  What are the pivot  points in which you get concerned?  </p><p>MAHONEY:  Yes.  We only see that yet, I mean, yes, there's wage growth and  the Fed governors are (INAUDIBLE) last week talking about this that there's  wage growth that's happening but that really kind of going in the other  side of that.  We really have not seen much in the way of inflation.  And,  you know, look, just a couple of years ago we're looking at going to  recession perhaps and here are the headlines, talking about this goldilocks  environment being little bit too hot.  Guess what, I think it will take a  little bit too hot, we'll take the 10-year inching up a little bit, we'll  take that.  Now, look, the opposite is when did the 10 years started going  down?  What would people be saying, oh no, my gosh, the economy is -- guess  what, we're inching up a little bit.  The 10-year is telling us and the  stock market is telling us, that the growth that lies ahead.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So what do you want to do?  How do you want to invest here?  </p><p>MAHONEY:  So I still like the leaders, going into this February sell-off we  had, those leaders were Boeing, those leaders were Facebook, Apple, they  got crushed those good-buying opportunity coming out the other side.  Those  are still the winners.  Now, we would stay away though from those interest  sensitive sectors, home builders have not really bounced since that  February drought.  Look at homebuilders, auto, those inter-sensitive areas  we're not going to go near , we're going to stick with the leaders.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll leave it there.  Ken, great to see you.</p><p>MAHONEY:  Good to see you as well.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  Ken Mahoney there.  We got the GDP right  after this after short break.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Wednesday morning, everybody. Thanks so  much for joining us.  We are waiting on the GDP, it is Wednesday, February  28th.  Here are your top stories 8:30 a.m. on the Eastern rather.  The  economy in focus right now, we're watching markets, going into the GDP  number an we're going to get that number in about 10 seconds.  Economists  are expecting growth for the fourth quarter of 2-1/2 percent, that's what  we are waiting on and we are watching markets right now trading up ahead of  the number, up 15 points on the Dow Jones Industrial Average, up 1-1/4 on  the S&amp;P 500, and up 17 points on the NASDAQ.  </p><p>And the GDP out, 2.5 percent, right in line with expectations on the GDP.   The number is exactly what people were expecting.  This is the second  reading of the fourth-quarter GDP up 2-1/2 percent.  Of course, this after  markets were rattled yesterday, following testimony from the Federal  Reserve Chairman Jay Powell.  His comments suggesting that the central bank  may raise interest rates more than three times this year, and that is what  sent the Dow Industrials down 300 points yesterday, S&amp;P 500 down 35 points,  and the NASDAQ, down 91.  We're getting the numbers, and it is right in  line with expectations at 2-1/2 percent.  The actual versus the estimate of  2-1/2 percent.</p><p>This morning, markets are trading up on this news as you can see just after  the number was reported.  The market did improve just a bit.  Dow  Industrials now up 25 points, S&amp;P 500 up 2-1/4, and the NASDAQ up 18  points.  Global markets?  Well, they are also active this morning.  Take a  look initially, markets were really taking a cue from Wall Street, and  that's similar to what we're seeing right now, no stabilization here.  FT- 100 flat, CAC Quarante down a quarter of a percent, DAX Index down a  fraction as well.  In Asia overnight, declines across the board.  Worst  performer was Hong Kong and Japan down about 1-1/2 percent apiece.  </p><p>The second reading of the fourth-quarter GDP in line with expectations.   Let's talk about reaction here.  Dagen, this is what we were looking for.   I can't imagine.  This number is going to upset markets this morning, 2-1/2  percent.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  No, as long as it's right in line with expectations, and two,  Jay, the Fed Chairman, Jay Powell, of what he said yesterday.  He is very  positive about the growth outlook in part because of the tax reform coming  down to Washington.  Two good years for the economy at this point.  We do  not see even market volatility as weighing heavily on the outlook for  economic activity.  He pointed to that.  I think that you will also want to  watch the 10-year yield because so much of the action in the stock market  has been driven by that.  But, again, if it didn't come in a little bit  hotter in the fourth-quarter, maybe you would have gotten a little -- seen  some shaky markets.  But this is, again, right in line with expectations. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, and the markets actually picking up steam here, up 30  points now on the industrial average.  Because yesterday, Mary, the worry  was, was that the economy is actually too hot.  This is sort of those --  one of those Goldilocks numbers, isn't it?</p><p>KISSEL:  Yes, but we've been in such an unusual interest rate environment  for so long, Maria.  I think a lot of investors are just getting used to a  normal environment again, and, you know, I have to agree with your last  guest, Ken Mahoney, he said that he didn't think Jay Powell's comments were  hawkish at all, and I have to agree with him.  I mean, yes, three or four  rate hikes but it's coming from such a low level, and what we're seeing  here is a fairly robust economy, well above two percent, moving towards  three percent, perhaps even 3-1/2 percent growth over the next coming  quarters.  That's good news, that's very, very good news, and a supportive  global growth environment on top of that out of Europe and Japan, just  something not a lot of people are talking about. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  By the way, we should point out that it's 2-1/2 percent which  is in line with expectations, but it's down from the earlier estimate which  was 2.6 percent.</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  I still worry about the government spending.  I don't think  there was any justification to increase by more than 10 percent, domestic  discretionary spending.  You're going to have a trillion-dollar deficit  added on top of that we already have.  I don't think there is any  justification for that.  And it's one part of the economy in the market,  that it just shouldn't be going that direction. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And we agree with you, we talk about it repeatedly, that your  upping, you're running, even higher deficits, and upping the amount of  supply that the -- in terms of borrowing, in terms of the treasury supply  at a time when the Federal Reserve which has been a major buyer of treasury  and mortgage debt over the last 10 years, is now pulling back from that.   And I will say because this is what Ken was talking about, avoiding  interest rate sensitive sectors.  </p><p>You've had a pretty big drop in new home sales in January and the month  prior in December.  And you are seeing softening at the local level because  mortgage rates are heading up, and that marginal buyer is now locked out of  the market because they can't really afford the mortgages that are being  offered, and I think that's, well, something to watch particularly as  longer term rates move up.</p><p>KISSEL:  I mean, essentially, the administration is betting that the tax  cut and the benefits from the tax cuts are going to run for a long time,  that and also cutting the red tape, that will somehow outrun or at least  stave off this interest rate scare that people are so worried about that  you're talking about. </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  The tax reform did reduce the amount of mortgage and interest  deduction, you can say.</p><p>KISSEL:  Hey, even Warren Buffet is coming around to the -- to the benefits  of the tax reform.  I never thought you'd see that.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, he got a huge benefit for his company, didn't he?</p><p>KISSEL:  Yes, he sure did.  Don't we underestimate the benefit of tax cuts?   We always underestimate the benefits.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No, I agree, I don't think it's going to be, well, it cost a  trillion dollars but I do think that there's certain pockets that are good  of the economy like housing that are going to get hurt by this.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  By the way, we should point out that this GDP number is  decelerating from what we saw in the third-quarter.  I mean, in the third- quarter, we had growth of 3.2 percent.  And in the fourth quarter, the  initial reading was 2.6 percent.  So, anyway you look at it, things have  slowed down a bit in the couple of -- in the last couple of months.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But this was before the tax reform goes --</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  Yes, it was. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  So, that's before the tax reform and spending.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Exactly, yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  So, in this -- in this, you will see -- you will see it pick up  steam. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We want to -- we want to get the White House reaction to this  number.  Hogan Gidley is the Deputy White House Press Secretary.  He's  joining us right now, and of course, we also want to talk about students  returning to class at Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida  exactly two weeks after 17 people were killed.  In Washington, the  President is set to meet with a bipartisan congressional group on school  safety today, trying to make progress on legislation to combat gun  violence.  </p><p>Joining us right now from the White House, Deputy Press Secretary Hogan  Gidley.  Hogan, thanks very much for joining us this morning.  Before we  get into the return to school, let me get your take on what's happening in  the economy right now because the GDP is just out, and it shows a growth  number of 2.5 percent but that's down from 3-1/4 percent in the third- quarter what's going on, things have decelerated.</p><p>HOGAN GIDLEY, WHITE HOUSE DEPUTY PRESS SECRETARY:  Well, they have, but the  overall economy is strong, and as I just heard, Dagen, I think pointed out  and she's absolutely right, that's before the tax cuts even took effect.   We had some massive hurricanes, unprecedented amounts of damage, but also  destruction that occurred in so many places across the country.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wait a second, all of this -- all of this is before the tax  plan.  We're talking about the fourth-quarter.  So, the tax plan went into  effect the beginning of '18.  </p><p>GIDLEY:  But I'm saying -- right, but I'm saying expectations are that that  will actually go up, it's still much higher obviously than President Barack  Obama's economy which he said 1.9 percent was the new norm.  We're on the  way up, most economists say we're going to be hovering close to potentially  four percent, as this year continues on, and that's where we expect to be.   The economy is strong, businesses are coming back to this country, as you  well know, consumer confidence is at all-time high, and we expect that to  continue to grow even more into the new year.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, in terms of economic policy, what are the President's  priorities at this point, Hogan?  Because, I know that he wants to work on  Dodd-Frank, and he's been rolling back regulations in a big way since the  start of his presidency.  That should add further spice to this market.   What's the priority in terms of economic policy in the coming six or eight  months?</p><p>GIDLEY:  It will, but look, let's talk about those regulations and their  rollback.  The big way kind of doesn't begin to describe it.  Look, he said  that he would cut two regulations for every one that he put into place.  He  far exceeded that, and he's cutting 22 regulations for every one that gets  put into place.  Obviously, that spurs on consumer confidence but also  security and stabilization in business growth, and that's what this  President is all about, as you know.  And the rapid turnaround of this  economy is no coincidence.  </p><p>It's because we have someone in office who understands the economy, who's  going to push to make this tax cut permanent for individuals as he did with  the corporate tax rate cut, but there's a pattern emerging here with this  President, and that is he's taking on topics and issues that haven't been  addressed in the better part of 30 to 40 years.  He's coming in in a year's  time, he's accomplishing record-setting things, and recording setting time,  and he's growing this economy, something that the government quite frankly,  has been crippling under the last eight years.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  So, are you expecting movement on Dodd-Frank in the  coming few months?</p><p>GIDLEY:  We'll see.  I don't want to get ahead of what President is going  to say or do, but we obviously know that that's what the President wants to  be, he wants to eliminate all hindrances to economic well-being in this  country.  He wants to prop up middle America, as you saw with the tax cuts,  it didn't just effect the corporate tax rate that people have been talking  about for 30 or 40 years, but it also cut taxes for the middle-income  people in this country, and that's where he's going to continuing to go. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, I mean, we're getting a report this morning that the  President is looking to roll back the Volcker Rule, for example, and this  is a rule, obviously where proprietary trading firms do -- cannot do  proprietary trading and just trade for customers but not their own, so is  that something that's going to be changed over the near-term, the Volcker  Rule.</p><p>GIDLEY:  Again, I can't get ahead of what the President is going to say or  do.  He's going to talk also about trade today.  He's going to make some  announcements on that as well.  That should impact the economy, too,  because, look, for far too long, what we've been talking about in this  country, politicians as you know, for decades, go out on a campaign trail  and what they say is we want free and fair trade.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>GIDLEY:  Well, the free trade is always there.  It's the fair part that  politicians seem to ignore once they get in office.  And this President  comes in and says, no more.  This has been dogging our country for decades.   It's going to stop now and it's going to stop on my watch, and so, we'll  see what he announces later today.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  On trade, is the U.S. going to re-enter TPP.</p><p>GIDLEY:  Again, I can't get ahead of what the President is going to say or  do, Maria.  I appreciate you pushing me that direction but the President  has some ideas to how to fix this economy.  He's done a masterful job so  far and we expect that to continue.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Hogan, the President obviously has been spending a lot of time  on efforts to try to come up with solutions for gun safety, school safety,  really.  The President is hoping to jumpstart some real action on  background checks or other plans.  Tell me where that stands right now, and  what does need to be done, in terms of background checks? </p><p>GIDLEY:  Donald Trump is not just the President of the United States.  He's  also a father and he's also a grandfather.  And what he wants is what  everybody in this country wants, which is safety and security for our  children when they go to school, that's just the bottom line.  Legislation  can't just feel good, it actually has to do good.  And that's what the  President is trying to get to the bottom of now when he's talking to all  the relevant stakeholders.  The country was privy to a meeting he had with  grieving families, from the Parkland shooting, other relative stakeholders  from around the Washington, D.C. area, parents, teachers, students --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>GIDLEY:  -- just pouring out their heart, they were angry, they were upset.   They were upset --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  No, that was a -- that was a good idea we did the  listening session.</p><p>GIDLEY:  Right.  But they were also hopeful that something would get done.   So, the President then went met with local law enforcement, then he met  with governors, people who were on the frontlines of all these issues and  how they can be impacted at the local level because, as you know, state and  federal partnerships are key if we're going to actually accomplish  something here.  But when he meets with the Congressional leaders today  from individual congressional districts, bipartisan, bicameral, they've got  to come up with solutions that actually protect children.  We can't just  talk about it anymore.  The American people deserve better.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, is he -- is he prepared to put forth an executive order  bypassing Congress to raise the age limit for getting a gun?</p><p>GIDLEY:  Well, it depends on what happens after the talks, it depends on  what Congress decides to do and also with the local areas decide to do as  well.  The President sees that there's obviously a gaping hole in security.   There was a systematic failure here at every level of government, whether  it was the FBI, whether it was the county sheriff, and then the deputy  sitting outside the school that were trained and had a gun and still didn't  go inside to protect those kids.  Obviously, failures exist, the audit  continues, and once we get that information, the President will make  recommendations this week on what he feels should be done to protect  students in our schools. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What do you make of all these companies waiting into this  issue?  Dick's Sporting Goods this morning says that it's no longer going  to sell automatic-style weapons.  It's going to require consumers to be 21  years old to purchase any firearm, regardless of the law of the land,  Dick's Sporting Goods says.  What do you -- what do you make of the private  sector making these changes?  Is that legal?</p><p>GIDLEY:  Yes, I don't know if it's legal or not, I'm not an attorney, but  it doesn't seem to match up with federal law.  But I mean, look, we've got  states all over the country, deciding to thumb their nose at the federal  government and the laws on the books whether it's California and sanctuary  cities, for example.  But look, these businesses have made decisions based  on pressure from outside groups.  I guess they have the right to do that, I  guess groups have the right to protest, but the bottom line is we have, you  know, 6 million gun owners that are members of the NRA that are law-abiding  citizens.  This President supports the second amendment, supports the NRA  and their efforts to keep our country safe.  And we have a constitutional  right in this country to keep and bear arms.  And so, if a business decides  that they're going to kowtow to pressure from outside groups, I guess they  can do that, but then they're going to have to suffer the consequences  should other side come out and put pressure on them as well.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Hogan, let me ask you about that big announcement from the  President yesterday, announcing that his digital strategist, Brad Prascale  will run the Trump 2020 campaign.  Why did the president make this  announcement now, telling everybody he is in fact running for re-election?</p><p>GIDLEY:  I love you keep asking me questions I really can't talk about.   That's a campaign issue.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Why not?</p><p>GIDLEY:  Well, it's a campaign issue, I have to refer you over to the  campaign to have that discussion.  But look, the President is going to have  a myriad of successes to run on in the 2020 election.  As you know, the  Heritage Foundation just put out a survey basically saying that this  President has already accomplished 64 percent of his agenda, Ronald Reagan,  the standard bearer of our party for a long time and of government success  for the Republicans was only at 47 percent at this time.  So, as I  mentioned before, it's record-setting accomplishments and record-setting  time for Donald Trump.  And whoever the campaign manager is for this  President, they'll have a lot to push moving into the election cycle.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Hogan, great stuff, thanks so much for joining us  this morning.</p><p>GIDLEY:  Thanks so much, Maria.  Have a great day.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Hogan Gidley joining us there.  Thank you.  We'll be right  back.  Back in a minute.  Markets at the highs right now up 50 points on  the GDP number.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Lowe's under pressure this morning, reporting  earnings as well.  Nicole Petallides on the floor of the New York Stock  Exchange.  Nic, good morning to you.</p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FBN ANCHOR:  Good morning, Maria.  So, we are seeing  Lowe's under extreme pressure this morning.  We see the Dow Futures higher  but Lowe's will be to the downside and likely to be one of the biggest  losers here on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, down 70-1/4  percent right now, the quarterly numbers.  What happened to Lowe's when  Home Depot six quarters in a row beat?  Well, Lowe's missed.  They missed  on their quarterly profit, the growth margin, all a miss.  Same-store sales  growth going forward to guidance.  Well, that's going to slow, too.  They  said they've been spending a lot in order to fend off big competition, so  it's clear at this time that Home Depot is really king in the home  improvement retailing.</p><p>And then we take a look at Amazon.  Amazon, a new acquisition, and this is  Ring.  $1 billion.  Ring is home security.  Everybody has been seeing the  commercials or video doorbells, that is the idea, it adds to Blink which is  what they got last year.  And it takes on some of the other guys.  Well,  ADT is to the downside this morning.  Alphabet's home unit, a home -- smart  home security unit.  So, if this is just Amazon expanding beyond and now  that it'll also contribute to Amazon Key where they actually have a smart  lock, and you go in, you have your package or your fresh food drops up.   So, that's big acquisition, they're buying the start-up Ring for $1  billion, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Nic, thank you so much.  Technology titans facing a  boycott for ties to the National Rifles Association.  Joining me now, the  host of \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY,\" Stuart Varney weighing in.  Stu, good morning  to you.</p><p>STUART VARNEY, FBN ANCHOR:  Good morning, Maria.  This seems to be three  separate things going on here.  You have the news this morning that Dick's  Sporting Goods is not going to sell these assault-style rifles to anybody  under 21.  We got that piece of news.  I think that's their business, it's  their policy.  Do as you will, Dick's Sporting Goods.  Then there is the  Boycott NRA Movement, like against Delta, United Airlines, that kind of  thing.  I'm worded about that because it's the politicization of business.   When I buy a product or a service, I buy according to price and quality,  not according to the politics of the company selling me that product or  service.  </p><p>But the most pernicious attack on free speech, in my opinion, comes from  this attempt to silence the NRA on Amazon, Google, Roku, and Apple.  Those  organizations run videos of the NRA from the NRA, and there is now a  serious movement to ban them from all those outlets.  That is deliberately  stomping on free speech.  The left does not like guns, so shut up the NRA.   I think that's absolutely flat-out wrong.  There is no question.  This is  an ongoing story as businesses forced to react to the ongoing problem with  guns. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I'm surprised that so many businesses have reacted this  way, Dagen.  I mean, I am.  I -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And I want to get see people get mad that Planned Parenthood is  now reportedly involved in these -- helping these Parkland, Florida  students organize.</p><p>VARNEY:  Yes, you know -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  So how the wise Planned Parenthood involved in gun control laws?   Just asking.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>VARNEY:  I'd just like to know how we get rifles out of the hands of  demented 19-year-olds.  If you could do that, you solve a lot of problems.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, good point.</p><p>VARNEY:  But I don't have an answer.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Stu, we'll see you in 10 minutes.  Thank you.  \"VARNEY &amp;  COMPANY\" top of the hour right after MORNINGS WITH MARIA.  We'll be right  back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Another milestone for LeBron.  Jared Max with  sports headlines now.  Jared?</p><p>JARED MAX, FOX NEWS SPORTSCASTER:  Good morning, Maria.  First time in  LeBron's 15-year career, he has averaged a triple-double for every game in  one month.  Double digits, three statistical categories.  LeBron became the  oldest player in NBA history to accomplish this eclectic feet when he  helped the Cavalier beat the Nets last night, LeBron also the first NBA  player to total more than 30,000 points, 8,000 rebounds, 8,000 assists.   LeBron thinks the NBA can assist teenage athletes who have the talent to  become pro-basketball players but don't feel suited or interested in  playing NCAA ball but don't want to go overseas to play.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>LEBRON JAMES, AMERICAN BASKETBALL PLAYER:  NCAA is historic.  We know it.   I'm sorry.  It's going to make headlines that (INAUDIBLE) sign at 14 but  they get put into this farm system where they'll able to grow and be around  other professionals for three or four years.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MAX:  LeBron says the NCAA is corrupt.  Wants to see the NBA create a farm  system.  </p><p>Move over Papa John's, here comes Pizza Hut.  The new official sponsor of  the NFL for pizza.  Multi-year deal includes collected use of 32 NFL team  trademarks to facilitate local exclusive team partnerships.  NFL  Commissioner Roger Goodell says, we're thrilled to have Pizza Hut as a  partner.</p><p>Let's take a look at Pizza Hut's parent Yum! Brands on the stock board.   Now, Pizza Hut assumes Papa John's role as the official pizza of the NFL.   Papa John's came under fire last season when the company founder John  Schnatter suggested sales were down because of the NFL's mishandling of  players kneeling for the anthem.  The two mutually decided to part ways  yesterday.  </p><p>As Major League Baseball rosters fill out with younger, less expensive  talent, some high-priced free agents are still looking for work.  And so,  the players association has filed a grievance against four baseball teams:  the Marlins, the Rays, the Pirates, and the A's.  All accused of failing to  appropriately spend revenue sharing money to improve their clubs.</p><p>Hey, do you see the mascots that were chosen for the 2020 Summer Olympics  in Tokyo?  Students from 16,769 elementary schools in Japan chose the  mascots and the winner was drawn by a graduate of Cabrillo College in  California, Ryo Taniguchi.  One student who voted for the design said it  looks futuristic but also represents Japan traditions.  Some of the  (INAUDIBLE) that didn't quite make the cut are these guys.  Plus, it could  work as Olympic mascots.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Cool.  What are you expecting from Tokyo 2020?</p><p>MAX:  Hopefully, a little bit more fun and less controversy than these  Olympics.  Where it's just strictly about the game and maybe two years from  now, we get to a different point where people can make comments about each  other and we keep the politics outside of sports.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Did you watch it?</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, yes.  You did, we did.</p><p>KISSEL:  I love the Olympics.  Absolutely.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.  OK.</p><p>KISSEL:  Watch it every year.  Oh, I love to win.</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>CHAFFETZ:  The women who won the cross-country, that --</p><p>MAX:  Awesome.</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  That was -- </p><p>MAX:  The (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But the ratings were not what past Olympics were.  That's why I  asked because it wasn't as much of a must watch as in past.</p><p>KISSEL:  Oh, our figure skaters stink but our snowboarders are amazing.</p><p>MAX:  Snowboard cross.  I would watch it every night.  Snowboard cross.</p><p>KISSEL:  It's incredible what they do.</p><p>MAX:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you, Jared.  Jared Max.  Catch his sports reports on Fox  News Headlines 24/7 or Sirius XM 115.  We're back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Great panel today.  Thank you so much Mary Kissel, Jason  Chaffetz, it's great to see you.</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Dagen McDowell, great show.  We will see you tomorrow,  everybody.

FT-100 down a third of a  percent, CAC Quarante in Paris down one half of one percent, and the DAX  Index in Germany down a third of a percent, forty points lower.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In Asia overnight, we're right across the board, take a look.  Worst  performer there, Japan.  Nikkei Average down almost one and a half percent.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The battle over gun control, as the students in Parkland, Florida return to  school today, President Trump is set to host a bipartisan meeting with  lawmakers as they work to end gun violence.  I'll speak with one of the  students from Marjory Stone Douglas High School about his return to school  later this hour.  </p><p>And the debate is having a major impact on the business world as well.  The  latest as several states including New York, Ohio, court -- Delta Airlines  following Georgia lawmaker's threat to end any tax benefits for Delta over  its decision to cut ties with the NRA.  </p><p>A health scare in the Virginia Military Base, the details as 11 people fall  ill after opening a letter containing an unknown substance.  We'll bring  you the latest.</p><p>And a deal at their doorstep, Amazon putting a ring on it, acquiring the  smart doorbell maker for $! Billion, what it means for your deliveries,  coming up this morning.</p><p>All those stories coming up this morning and joining me to talk all about  it, Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowelll.  Former Utah Congressman,  former House Oversight Committee Chairman and Fox News Contributor, Jason  CHaffetz.  And the \"Wall Street Journal's\" Editorial Board Member, Fox News  Contributor, Mary Kissel is here.  Great to see you.  </p><p>MARY KISSEL, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Good morning Maria, thanks for having  us.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, good morning to you.</p><p>JASON CHAFFETZ, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Good morning.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN ANCHOR:  When I saw the guests was yesterday, \"I can't  wait to hear what Mary and Jason have to say.  So that means I'm going to  stifle.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  No, we don't want that.  We don't want -- but it's true, we're  grateful that you're both here this morning.  What's on your mind?  What's  most important in your mind right now?</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  I'm still reeling over what the republicans have done to run up  government spending.  I see a lot of good economic news, the GDP but the  government component in the run up and spending, I think it's going to  hamper the economy, I really do.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  $300 billion in spending.</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  It's a ridiculous number, you can't justify it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Yes, we'll talk more about that.  Mary, how about you?</p><p>KISSEL:  Yes.  Well I think they're on a shirt high because as you said,  you've got the four quarter GDP number coming out and say goodbye to the  new normal of two percent that turns out that America can grow much faster  than that.</p><p>But I think unfortunately republicans are taking that message to as you say  give back on the sugar high of government spending, not a good idea.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No.  We've been talking about that a lot for sure because now  we're talking about $1 trillion deficits from here on out.</p><p>KISSEL:  Yes we are.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KISSEL:  And we'll talk about it as the morning rolls on too.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Again, watching those yields, those yields going up to close and  above 2.9 percent yesterday on that testimony from Jay Powell.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Tough day.  We expected what he said though, so I don't know  why the markets were surprised.  We knew he was going to talk about higher  interest rates and the return of inflation.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Maybe sometimes investors need a hammer over the head so to  speak and that was it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll see about that.  Three hundred points lower yesterday,  this morning a bit of a bounce.  </p><p>Joining the conversation this morning, the CEO of Bayer is with me, Werner  Baumann is here talking about lots of news this morning in the drug  industry.  White House Deputy Press Secretary Hogan Gidley is with us.   Former RNC Chair and Founding Partner of the DGR Group, Haley Barbour joins  us.  Kentucky Congressman Andy Barr is here.  And Dr. Mikhail Varshavski  AKA Dr. Mike also joining us this morning.  </p><p>You don't want to miss moments of it so do stay with us.  And we kick it  off here with the top story, markets taking a hit yesterday after a new  Federal Reserve chairman Jay Powell delivered an upbeat assessments of the  U.S. economy on Capitol Hill leading investors to expect higher interest  rates.  Of course, the biggest economic news on the DACA today is the  second estimate of fourth quarter GDP.</p><p>It's expected to come in at two and a half percent, that would be down 0.1  of a percent from the initial expectation.  Your reaction to what we heard  from Jay Powell yesterday Mary in terms of what he said, what that means  from where we are today.</p><p>KISSLER:  Well the Federal Reserve always underestimates GDP growth in the  economy and they always under estimate the impact of tax cuts Maria.   They're also always behind the curve when it comes to inflation  expectations.</p><p>Jay Powell was not picked because he was an aggressive Fed chairman, Jay  Powell was picked because he was somebody that the White House liked and  thought wouldn't rock the boat.  So I think what you're going to see out of  him is, again, a very reasonable and predictable rate rise.  Whether or not  that leads them behind the curve, who knows, the bigger challenge and Dagen  and I were talking about this off air is what they're going to do with this  mega balance sheet that the Federal Reserve has accumulated?</p><p>We've never seen that in the history of the Federal Reserve before, it's a  big experiment and the question is, can the Federal Reserve get rid of that  balance sheet without turning the market upside down.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  The idea of unwinding $4.5 trillion Dagen.  We've talked about  it before, $50 billion a month, at some point we'll get there.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Coupled with the idea that we may see now four interest rate  hikes spook in markets.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  The market yesterday began fact -- this has been  discussed widely about four interest rate hikes this year but Futures  contracts linked to the Central Bank's rate policies yesterday showed one  third of a probability that it's going to move four times this year.</p><p>But it's the great unknown of the Fed -- I think the balance sheet will  shrink about $400 billion this year, $420 billion with the final quarter at  $50 billion will be rolling off in mortgage and Treasury securities.  But  this has put even more pressure on markets and on the Federal Reserve  because of what the republicans have done.</p><p>I don't disagree with the tax reform, I don't believe that it's going to  cost north of a $1 trillion.  I think because of the faster growth, because  of the higher tax receipts you've already seen in January.  However,  republicans make this pressure on the Fed worst and on the bond market  because they increased spending by $300 billion over to your period.   You're ramping up the supply of Treasury debt at a time when one major  source of the demand over the last 10 years is going away and that's  problematic. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  When Paul Ryan joined me two weeks ago Jason, one thing  he kept saying is, \"You've got to give to get.\"  Well you were in that seat  before, what would you have done had you been faced with a situation of,  \"OK, we need to spend this money on the military.  We need new money on --  for military and recover what's been happened from sequestration but, I'm  being held hostage by doing all this other stuff spending elsewhere.\"</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  Well look, if you look at what Chuck Schumer got, he got  everything that he wanted.  What did the republicans get in that deal?   They didn't get anything.  There was a 13 percent increase in domestic  spending and Rand Paul was absolutely right when he said, \"When we had $1  dollar deficits and it was Obama in the White House, we were all up and  arms.\"  And suddenly, now it's President Trump and we're OK with it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  They didn't do anything to curve that and for Paul Ryan to say,  \"Well now we're going to turn our attention to entitlement reform.\"  Come  on, there's no way you're getting this 60 votes on entitlement reform.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Not this year.</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  No.  There's no way to do it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But some of the things that they put money to, Dagen, you  mentioned it, what, the abstinence spending.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  $150 billion -- excuse me, million dollars for abstinence  education (INAUDIBLE) with social conservatives but it was billions of  dollars a year for child care, for health --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Community centers.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  For community health centers.  And I'll point to this because  this is in the news today, I think it was $6 billion to fight the opioid  crisis --</p><p>KISSEL:  Yes, that's it.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- when they had poultry little evidence of how that money has  been spend, it's already been allocated and how this be spent.  Like the --  you need proof of outcomes when you start throwing billions of dollars at a  problem.</p><p>KISSEL:  Yes.  But, again, I wonder about the political environment here  because President Trump wants to do a deal and I feel like Paul Ryan's  biggest worry is that democrats are going to go to the president and say,  \"Just spend a little more.  You'll be more popular.  We can do a deal  together.\"</p><p>And so Paul Ryan just took over what's in front of him because he didn't  want something that was even worst.</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  But I -- when did it become the new normal and totally  acceptable that for every dollar rise in defense spending, you have to  raise domestic spending.  There was no justification to raise the domestic  spending, you could make a case on the military but, again, I don't think  we went out and said, \"Hey, we need a new carrier group, we have to have  missile defense.\"  We never had that discussion in this country.  That bill  came about three and a half days.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Well let's worry now and like I said to Paul Ryan, now  it's in your face in terms of markets reacting to higher interest rates,  what that means for the debt.</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  And they still have to fund the government on March 23rd.  So  remember, they funded part of the military but they still have to go back  and actually pass a funding pill later in March.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And to -- we'll talk about the \"Wall Street Journal\" Editorial  page, Mary Kissel, because, again, it's -- the fact republicans won't fix  the entitlements that we have where one in five Americans is on Medicaid,  Medicare, and Social Security.</p><p>But now you have the likes of Senators Mike Lee and Marco Rubio talking  about this new entitlement joining arms with Ivanka Trump on paid family  leave federally mandated.  So, again, to call yourself a conservative is a  joke.</p><p>KISSEL:  Yes.  And rating the entitlements by the way propose (INAUDIBLE)  entitlements to pay for that.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>KISSEL:  There's a free lunch entitlement according to those two senators  which was just ridiculous.  Look Dagen, I think it's very disheartening,  republicans had a chance to have a major entitlement reform last week with  healthcare but they simply couldn't explain what the program was.</p><p>They had gone out and actually, I don't know, had three bullet points and  said, \"Hey America, do you want to make entitlements to give into the  people who actually need them instead of able bodied adults?  I think  Americans would have gotten behind that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Because most people recognize this is where the growth and  spending and that these programs are going out of business.  They are --  they're going broke.</p><p>KISSLER:  Yes, they are -- it's entitlements.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We're going to take a break.  When we comeback,  students are returning to school in Florida.  This morning, we're going to  speak with one of the students, a survivor.</p><p>Then scary moments out of Virginia Military Base after the contents of  mysterious envelops causes several people to get sick, we got the details  on that investigation.  </p><p>Then a first on Fox Business interview, I'm one-on-one with Bayer CEO  Werner Baumann.  We will talk about the company's $8 billion for U.S.  investment.  Back in a moments right here.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Another police officer shot in the line of duty,  this time in Idaho.  Lauren Simonetti with the details and headlines now,  Lauren.</p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FBN REPORTER:  Good morning Maria.  The suspected gunman  was shot and killed in the shootout.  Police say the shooter had a felony  warrant for his arrest, began firing at officers when they approached him.</p><p>All this happened near the Idaho, Washington state line, east of Spokane.   The officer hit with the bullet went into surgery, the police chief says he  was up and talking with other officers.</p><p>Well, 11 people including several marines sickened yesterday after a  suspicious letter was opened at Marine Corps headquarters near the  Pentagon.  Three people were taken to the hospital listed in stable  condition.  The envelope which contained an unknown substance was mailed to  joint base Myer Henderson in Virginia.  It's been sent to the FBI's lab and  Quantico for testing.  The building was evacuated, it is not clear at this  point who sent that letter.</p><p>Well, evidence now emerging that North Korea is profiting from the civil  war in Syria.  \"Confidential United Nations\" report says that North Korea  shipped 50 tons of supplies to Syria for using building, what it suspected  to be a chemical weapons factory.  The U.S. has accused Syria of using  chemical weapons in rebel controlled areas including recently in a suburb  of Damascus.</p><p>Meanwhile, take a look at these new satellite photos.  They show Iran  establishing another base in Syria.  Intelligence sources telling Fox News  that the base outside of Syria's capital is complete with hangers used to  store missiles capable of hitting Israel.</p><p>And in business, Amazon is buying a ring in a deal reportedly valued at  over $1 billion.  Amazon is expanding its home security business.  Ring  makes Wi-Fi connected cameras and doorbells.  This coming after Amazon  launched its own security carmeras which worked with its -- boy, this isn't  Alexa.  Ring devices capture a video that can be screened on smart phones.   And I guess you can tell if someone's going to steal your packages when  they're at your doorstep.</p><p>Look at Amazon shares, they're moving up half a percent, 15.19 in the  premarket, this is the stock that's up in the past year almost 80 percent,  Maria.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, that's a good line that you can watch if anyone is trying  to steal your packages.  It's true, you're right.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  Get off my door step.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's an interesting acquisition.  I like this company.  I've  always liked the idea that you can just go on your phone and see who's at  your doorbell.  What do you think Dagen?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I think that they've done a great job of advertising where the  millennials are.  You will hear these ring advertisements on Podcasts  galore.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Really?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And I'm a voracious consumer of Podcast.  So they've done an  incredible job and they've been able to grow their business despite some  naysayers. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Amazon keeps on expanding.</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  I use the vivid system (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You do?  OK.</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  And I can watch right now, I can see what's going on and it  automatically takes clips.  Somebody who rings my doorbell, they walk up  and it buzzes me on my phone, so I know anytime.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I like that.</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  And my kids realized when you have a system like this, it's not  as much about keeping people from the outside getting in, as it is also to  keeping them inside from getting out.  And we have a teenager, that's a  good system. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That is great.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I don't -- I don't think I want to know what's going on in  Brooklyn in the middle of the night, actually.  So, I do not have one of  these systems.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, it looks good.  I think it's the whole technology around  safety and security and being able to look at all your doors that on your  phone is pretty interesting.  And it's interesting that Amazon is acquiring  it. </p><p>All right, we are going to take a break.  When we come back, students at  Stoneman Douglas high school returning to class today.  Exactly, two weeks  after 17 people were killed.  I will talk to one of the students on his  thoughts about going back and the expectations for school safety now.  </p><p>The investors are expecting growth of 2.5 percent when we get the second  quarter -- the second reading for the fourth quarter GDP later this  morning.  We will see how the markets react.  Futures right now, indicating  a gain at the start of trading.  These are the high of the morning right  here, up 50 points on the Dow Jones Industrial average.  We'll be right  back.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back, fourth-quarter earnings from Bayer just out this  morning.  The German drug maker and agriculture giant misexpectations on  revenue due in part to a head from U.S. tax reform.  The stock sell to a 15  month low on the news.  And joining us right now, for the first time on FOX  NEWS's interview is the CEO of Bayer, Werner Baumann.  Werner, it's good to  have you on the program this morning.  Thank you so much.</p><p>WERNER BAUMANN, CEO, BAYER:  Hi, Maria. Good morning. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let me kick it off with the quarter.  Can you tell us what  growth -- the growth in the quarter, what would you say was the standout  this last three months?</p><p>BAUMANN:  Well, we've seen -- as we've seen in the entire year.  A very  good performance in pharma, so sales in pharma advanced again by roughly  four percent.  If you look at our key growth product, so blood thinner,  Xarelto, Eylea, then some of our cancer products, all of them have done  well both in quarter four but for also the entire year.  So, our pharma  business had another record here.  Quite frankly, the other businesses,  things did not go down well in 2017.  </p><p>So consumer is a difficult business in particular in the U.S. and then in  crop we had significant oversupply in the market in Brazil that our crop  protection products as our competitors as well.  We had to cleanse the  situation in quarter two and have since made very good progress I have to  say in getting the situation under control and actually advancing again.   So we are quite optimistic for our crop business going into 2018. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, I want to talk about the consumer business.  You say that  it was -- it was a little under pressure in the U.S. That's interesting to  know, given that the economics in the U.S. have been improving.  But let me  start with you $66 billion deal to acquire Monsanto.  We are waiting on  approvals from European regulators and the U.S. The company's hoping this  deal will close this year.  But I guess, are you expecting the approval in  the second quarter?  From the E.U.?</p><p>BAUMANN:  Yes, Maria.  Based on where we are right now, we've seen very,  very good progress.  This by now, roughly half of the 30 approvals we need.   They are in very good discussions after say that the European Commission  making good progress there and also that the DOJ.  Even though with the  DOJ, we are a little bit behind the process where we are with the European  Commission.  But overall, as you have mentioned, that we are quite  confident, that we are going to close this on section in the second  quarter.  And that we will also obtain the approvals necessary to do so.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, as we wait for the E.U. approval sometime in the second  quarter, what are the plans in terms of divestitures, in terms of raising  money once you get that approval?  Are you expecting to do a secondary  offering of right to issue once you get that approval?</p><p>BAUMANN:  Yes, Maria.  First of all, looking at the divestitures we have  already announced actually in October -- mid-October last year, that a very  large part of our buyers, seat business and our non-selective herbicides  platform.  Delivered to link product lines are going to be divested to  BISF.  Of course, always contingent on the over transaction coming to a  closing.  And we continue to be in discussion so that, with some select  further areas that are in the interest of the regulators also to strengthen  overall competition, also innovation competition in our industry.  That  discussion is over all regardless whether you look at the Europeans or the  Department of Justice.  Very constructive, we have recently announced also  today in our call that we are now also going to divest of our vegetable  seeds business.  I cannot at this point in time say that this is what's it  going to be because these discussions are still on going.  </p><p>On the same question regarding the financing, this is going to be a mix of  equity and debt.  So that we have already mentioned that based on the very  good sales proceeds on the divestiture of our (INAUDIBLE) at stake, the --  these need less equity than we had expected, but there's still will be a  rise offering here. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I see, I see.  Now you and several other European business  leaders took part in a round table discussion with President Trump in Davos  last month.  I know the President said that he is a fan of the company, but  let me ask you this, in terms of your expectations in terms of investments  in the United States, tell us what that looks like and what do you think is  behind this weakness that you just mentioned in terms of the consumer in  the U.S?</p><p>BAUMANN:  Well, first of all, we have been in the U.S. for more than 150  years and we have great interest in also advancing on business but the  overall economy in the U.S. and we will do our fair share in contributing.   Regarding with my encounters with President Trump, I have to say that both  party were very well-informed and well briefed.  Got a good discussion  along the lines of what we have already communicated on hat this  combination is going to be about and of course he's a very loyal customer  of the aspirin, which is always nice to see.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, for sure.  And -- but did you say that the consumer  business is weak in the U.S. right now?</p><p>BAUMANN:  Yes, the consumer business overall is actually impact that the  cross actually also our competitors business by fairly dramatic and record  change in consumer behaviors.  The stronger advance of online buying with  that less (INAUDIBLE) if you look at the you know, stationary retail, DR,  abducting to live.  We need to do this faster.  We also need to step up our  innovation capabilities and that is what we are working on.  But clearly  2017 was not a good year for our consumer business.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, we will leave it there.  Werner, and it's good to  have you on the program.  Great to see you, thanks so much for joining us  this morning.</p><p>BAUMANN:  Thank you, thank you, Maria. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Werner Baumann there, CEO at Bayer.  Coming up, TSA bomb  detection goes from airports to underground.  The agency testing new  equipment for train stations that could detect a potential suicide bomber.   This coming after a failed attack in a New York subway last year.  </p><p>And then Apple and Amazon they are the undisputed leaders in the tech  industry in the market.  But who's up next?  You might be surprised by what  and where the next big tech titan comes from.  Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Wednesday morning, everybody, thanks so  much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Wednesday, February  28th, your top stories right now, 6:30 a.m. on the East Coast.  Stocks  looking to rebound this morning, take a look at Futures, indicating a gain  at the start of trading of about 40 points, NASDAQ, S&amp;P 500, also positive.   We are waiting on the second reading of the fourth quarter GDP.  </p><p>Economists are looking for growth of 2 1/2 percent in the GDP, for the  final month of 2017, this, after markets were rattled yesterday, following  testimony from Federal Reserve Chairman, Jake Powell.  His comments  suggesting that the Central Bank may raise interest rates more than the  three times that are expected.  As a result, markets plummeted.  Dow  Industrials, yesterday, down 300 points better than one percent, NASDAQ,  S&amp;P 500 also down one and a quarter percent.  </p><p>Global markets are taking a cue from the U.S. this morning and trading  lower, FT 100, down a quarter of a percent, CAC Quarante in Paris, down a  third of a percent, DAX Index in Germany down one quarter of a percent.   Similar story in Asia overnight, declines across the board, worst performer  was Hong Kong, down 1 1/2 percent on the Hang Seng.  </p><p>A new layer of security to report, the TSA is now testing new technology to  detect suicide vests, how it works, coming up.  President Trump, one step  closer to fulfilling another campaign promise.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Do not worry.  We are going  to build the wall, OK?  Don't worry.  Don't even think about it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  A judge ruling in favor of the administration, allowing  construction plans to begin for the border wall.  And the White House  changing its tune on trade, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, now  suggesting President Trump may negotiate a return to the Trans-Pacific  Partnership, the details, coming up.  Then, the world's largest plane, one  step closer to its first passenger flight, more on the latest milestone for  the jet that's backed by Paul Allen, all that coming up.  </p><p>But first, this top story this half an hour, students will return to  Marjory Stoneman Douglas High  School this morning, two weeks, after the shooting, 17 students and  teachers were killed on that Valentine's Day massacre.  Joining me right  now is a survivor of the shooting, Junior Kyle Kashuv, Kyle, thank you so  much for being with us this morning.</p><p>KYLE KASHUV, JUNIOR, MARJORY STONEMAN DOUGLAS HIGH SCHOOL:  Thank you for  having me, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  First, we all want to say our condolences.  Our hearts go out  to you and your families and all of your friends and colleagues there at  High School.  How do you feel about going back to school today?</p><p>KASHUV:  I mean, it's really sad coming back to school, but then, it's also  really exciting to meet my peers and to be able to connect once again at  school.  I am optimistic that -- I'm optimistic going back to school.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're optimistic about going back to school?  Have you spoken  to your friends about it?  I mean, do you think it's the right time now?   It's two weeks.</p><p>KASHUV:  I think it's the right time.  I mean, everyone is still saddened  by what happened but, we understand that.  We still have to return to  school and there's no other time better than now, to do so.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Of course, of course.  Now, the calls for Sheriff Scott  Israel's resignation are growing louder.  What's your take on this?  The  Broward County Sheriff has said, he will not step down.  Listen to what he  said.  I want to get your reaction.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SCOTT ISRAEL, SHERIFF, BROWARD COUNTY:  I can only take responsibility for  what I knew about.  I exercise my due diligence.  I've given amazing  leadership to this age --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Amazing leadership?</p><p>ISRALE:  I've worked -- yes.  And, of course, I won't resign.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Kyle?</p><p>KASHUV:  I this it's a completely -- I think it's completely, like,  understandable that we realize that how (INAUDIBLE) it is that the Broward  Sheriff's Department failed on so many different levels and they didn't act  properly.  And I think that it is a representation of his leadership.  He  has to be held accountable for the inaction of the Broward Sheriff's  Department.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Jason Chaffetz.</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  Kyle, hi, this is Jason Chaffetz.  God bless you.  I can't  imagine what it's like for you and your, you know, fellow students to go  back to school, but, you know, there are --</p><p>KASHUV:  Thank you.</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  In different schools, they have people that you, kind of, really  worried about and concerned about.  Do you think that video games and stuff  that you see in the media and the movies, do you think that affects some of  your classmates there?</p><p>KASHUV:  No, I really don't think that video games have a, somewhat, even  slightly an effect on children and the way they act, they really don't,  because we can clearly tell reality from video games, there's a clear  divide.</p><p>KISSEL:  Kyle, it's Mary Kissel here.  I just want to echo what Maria and  Jason said that our thoughts and prayers are with you and the other  students.  A lot of the talk has been about things like gun control and  school safety, that yet, it's clear that there were breakdowns on many  levels, particularly in the mental health system, very, very difficult for  someone like the shooter, to get the help that he needs.  I think he even  called and asked for help at one point.  Has that been part of the  discussion between you and your classmates?  Is that gaining any traction  down there?</p><p>KASHUV:  It is.  I figured we definitely understand that we have a lacking  in the department for emotional support at our schools.  And right now, we  clearly see a lot of movement and legislation that trying to enact that.   I'm -- right now, I'm working on an app developing, to allow moms to,  maybe, volunteer at schools for emotional support and since we're so  understaffed.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Kyle, it's Dagen McDowell, has this school stepped up and said  that they're going to provide counselling to you and your fellow students  if you want it, having been traumatized, obviously, going through such a  traumatic event that most of us can't even -- can't even comprehend?</p><p>KASHUV: Really, the entire community has stepped up, and there were support  counselling at the Portland YMCA, and it was really helpful to a lot of my  friends.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And Kyle, you've called yourself a conservative, right?  And as  a supporter -- </p><p>KASHUV:  Yes, Ma'am.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  of the second amendment?  Has this impact --</p><p>KASHUV:  Yes, Ma'am.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Has this incident impacted your views?</p><p>KASHUV:  It's only slightly.  I still believe in the second amendment and  its importance to our nation.  I really -- it's dissatisfying to see the  Never Again Movement, slightly switched from simply making sure that this  will never happen again to gun control, but at the end of the day, I still  think that the entire community and the Never Again Movement, is still  heavily pushing to make sure that school shootings will be a thing in the  past.  And I really -- I'm really happy to see the entire community come  together as a bipartisan issue to work for a better change. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, especially since there were so many signs and signals that  were there and were missed.  Do -- had you ever seen or heard about Nikolas  Cruz?  And obviously, he was told don't come back (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>KASHUV:  Up until this incident --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I'm sorry?</p><p>KASHUV:  Up until, like, the school shooting, I had never known of his  existence but my friends did.  I had some friends that were in class with  him, and they always told -- they told me now, that they always knew  something was off about him.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What did they say about him?  What did -- what did people know  about him?</p><p>KASHUV:  They said that he was -- he was an outcast.  He wasn't really  understood.  They considered him somewhat of a weirdo, if I could quote.   He didn't have a lot of friends, but no one ever thought that he would do  such a thing.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  So, the Governor, Rick Scott, has some proposals on the  table for the state, including arming teachers, administrators.  Listen to  this.  I want to get your reaction.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GOV. RICK SCOTT (R), FLORIDA:  My plan is to spend $500 million to make our  school safe, to invest dollars in mental illness to make sure this never  happens again.  We need to increase the collaboration between our local  sheriffs, our police departments, our schools, Department of Children and  Families and DJJ.  We have got to make sure we have an increased law  enforcement presence in all of our schools.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So Kyle, what do you think about those ideas?  I mean, a minute  ago, you said you would like to see mothers volunteer.  Would you want to  see teachers armed?</p><p>KASHUV:  I think, that simply proposing that, here -- I think it's really  complex issue.  And in certain counties, there's a response time of maybe,  like. 15 minutes for the police to reach the school.  And studies show that  the first shots in a school shooting, only in five minutes, so practically,  the school is unarmed for 15 minutes and unable to defend themselves, and  simply, like, giving teachers the opportunity to, like, defend their  students, is a good thing.  And all levels of the school system in that  county, have to allow the teacher, and the teacher himself or herself has  to voluntarily do the training to be able to carry a gun at school.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Kyle, where were you when you first learned there was an active  shooter in school?</p><p>KASHUV:  I was in a very close adjacent building.  And in the beginning, I  thought that it was -- it didn't sound like gun shots at all because they  were so muffled, but I later realized that because it's in the freshman  building, they sounded muffled.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And what happened?  What did you -- what were you told?  Can  you walk us through it?</p><p>KASHUV:  Yes, ma'am.  So, I was in my last period class, and there was a  fire drill, so I was gradually walking out, and then, I didn't want to  leave the classroom and then I heard (INAUDIBLE) announcement saying,  evacuate immediately.  We evacuated immediately into the main hallway, and  then we heard two pops.  I didn't think it was gunshots.  </p><p>People started panicking, so I want to run back into my teacher's  classroom, and he closed the door on me.  He closed the door on, like, a  few of my fellow students and he wouldn't let us in, which he followed a  procedure, he did.  He feels terrible for what he did but it's completely  understandable because he had no idea who the shooter was.  </p><p>So, then we quickly ran to another teacher's room and she piled us in  there.  We then -- we hid in the closet for two hours and then constantly,  we were getting feeds from our friends and our family were contacting us  and everyone was hysterically crying, and I was trying to calm everyone  down.  Then, it took a while for SWAT to come get us because we've such a  big campus.  They had to take a while to clear it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How do think things change at the school now?</p><p>KASHUV:  Can you repeat that?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How do you think things will change now, at the school?</p><p>KASHUV:  I think, now, a little -- like, as of right now, there's going to  be a bigger police presence on campus, but sadly, I don't think that  anything is going to really change in the next coming week.  I think  everything is going to stay the same.  I don't think that we're going to  have -- the only thing -- the only difference, we're going to have  increased security by police office.  I don't think that anything,  specifically, other than that, will change in the security at our school.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Kyle.  We appreciate you joining us this morning.   We all send love --</p><p>KASHUV:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  and support to you and all of your friends and colleagues at  the school.  Kyle, good luck going back today, thank you.</p><p>KASHUV:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Kyle Kashuv, joining us there.  Coming up, immigration  crackdown despite a heads up from the mayor, ICE officials has arrested  more than 150 illegal immigrants in a sweep in a California Sanctuary City.   We're going to talk about that and why she gave the heads up to the  criminals, and then, a major new milestone for the world's largest plane,  details, coming up, back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back, TSA, Transportation Security Administration,  testing technology, now, in New York City that detects suicide vests,  Lauren Simonetti with all the details, now, Lauren.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  Pretty unbelievable, Maria, those tests taking place this week  with Amtrak at New York's Penn Station, the move, coming after that failed  pipe bomb attempt in a subway passage way back in December.  That was just  a couple blocks from Penn station.  This vest detection technology uses  special cameras that can scan for explosive devices, but the TSA says the  equipment can see through clothing, no privacy concerns because the image  is animated.  </p><p>Well, a massive ICE sweep in Northern California, more than 150 illegal  immigrants taken into custody despite warnings from the mayor of Oakland.   The top ice officials said the mayor's warning lightly gave criminals a  chance to escape.  The agency is now asking the Department of Justice to  look into whether she violated any laws with that warning.</p><p>Meanwhile, big win for President Trump and his border wall.  A federal  judge ruling against an environmental challenge to the wall, saying  Congress and the President share responsibilities to protect the country.   Border wall construction plans can now move forward.</p><p>While there is a chance that the U.S. may rejoin the Transpacific  Partnership or the TPP.  Treasury Secretary, Steve Mnuchin, says  renegotiation is on the table and that he's been in talks with other  countries about what it would take for the us to recommit.  President Trump  as you know, withdrew from President Obama's signature trade agreement last  year but Secretary Steve Mnuchin adding rejoining is not a priority for the  administration at the moment.  </p><p>And a new way to launch satellite into outer space, now the Strata Launch - - the world's largest airplane which can reach a speed of 46 miles an hour  on the taxiway, that's a big deal.  It's has a wingspan of 385 feet.  It  can carry 100,000 pounds.  It's designed to bring rockets to the  stratosphere for a more affordable launch for a low orbit satellites.  The  Strata Launch could make its first test flight by next year.  And of  course, Maria, Microsoft Co-Founder, Paul Allen, is backing this.  This is  his company.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  All right.  Lauren, thank you so much.  I want to talk  about this testing at Penn Station.  What do you thinL?  </p><p>CHAFFETZ:  Coincidentally I was at Penn Station, and I saw them doing this  testing.  I think it's good technology.  Let's remember that the Pentagon  spent more than $20 billion trying to figure out how to identify,  improvised explosive devices.  And you know what, the single best way to do  it is, dogs.  We can have all the technology we want, we need more dogs,  because dogs can find these things, they're mobile, and they're the best  deterrent that we have.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We now have smart dogs or so, yes, I agree with that.  </p><p>KISSEL:  Should we be more concerned about the TSA?  And I was looking at  some of these tests that they do, where they try to get bombmaking  materials through the security at airports, and they fail the majority of  the time, the overwhelming majority of the time.  Is that an agency that  needs more congressional oversight?  </p><p>CHAFFETZ:  It does and they need to look at the priority.  Because you know  what, dogs, they don't have lobbyists, but the people that sell these  machines, by the hundreds of millions of dollars, they do have lobbyists.   And often times, they're deploying technology that doesn't work.  The  Pentagon doesn't send this technology overseas, they don't have this  technology at the White House.  When you walk in to go into the oval  office, you don't go through this machine, you walk by a dog.  That's why  they use them it's because they're the most effective things.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Very deterrent, but by the way, I know you know this but $0.60  of the TSA fee that we pay when we fly, $0.60 of the $5.60 goes to deficit  reduction.  There is a billion-and-a half-dollars-plus being diverted for  deficit reduction rather than it being spent on actual airport security  every year.  </p><p>KISSEL:  You wonder where all that money goes, you know, when you go  through JFK or LaGuardia, you see all these people standing around, are  they really looking out for our security?  Is that a crack force that's  going to find the next bomb?  </p><p>CHAFFETZ:  Security badges that airports biggest thing.  There are 13,000  people with a security badge at Dulles airport in Washington D.C.  One of  those people slipping by at the wrong time, and you got a real problem.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And a TSA agent smacked my dog in the face by an accident,  because he messing with it in August.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's incredible.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, so, that's what they're busy doing.  Hitting fluffy, little  15-pound animals.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That was Charlie.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, I'm not joking.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I'm sorry to hear that.  We'll take break.  When we come back,  the rise of the new Silicon Valley; how the Middle East is giving its  California tech mecca a run for its money and market share.  We're going to  take a look.  Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Now, the latest in Silicon Valley, Apple shares hitting all- time high yesterday.  Take a look, 178.50 is where the stock is now, up 30  percent this past year.  Netflix is still driving the so-called fang stocks  already up better than 45 percent this year.  Joining us right now to talk  more about tech and where the growth in the world is today is Chemi Peres,  Chairman of the Peres Center for Peace and Innovation, and Managing General  Partner of Pitango Venture Capital.  Chemi, good to see you.  Thanks so  much for joining us.  </p><p>CHEMI PERES, CHAIRMAN, PERES CENTER FOR PEACE AND INNOVATION AND MANAGING  GENERAL PARTNER OF PITANGO VENTURE CAPITAL:  Good to see you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Tell us what you're doing at Pitango and where you see growth  in terms of innovation in the world today.  You've been investing in a  number of areas in tech.  </p><p>PERES:  For the best 25 years, we've been investing in Israeli technology,  we're investing at growth stage, at early-stage, and incubation.  And I  think that the great thing that we're seeing; number one, probably, is  cybersecurity, where it is a great concern around the world.  Terrorism is  globalized, so we are taking care of that.  Secondly, there's tremendous  innovation in A.I., machine learning, and deep learning to connect devices  and machines to the Internet, to create new services.  Thirdly, most likely  is a precision medicine to help us get better and earlier.  </p><p>And probably, I would say, in addition to those kinds of innovations, we're  seeing also the attempt to decentralize the currency systems, to give it  more freedom through blockchain technologies.  And I think that what you've  seen right now in terms of the share prices, you see that the greatest  companies today in the world are technology companies pushing away, you  know, oil, and gas, and chemicals, and construction. So, we are moving to a  new world.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We sure are.</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  Artificial intelligence is a big promise.  There's a lot of good  that can be done, there's also a lot of bad that can be done with  artificial intelligence.  So, where do you see that going, and how do we  control it or does it need to be controlled?  </p><p>PERES:  So, first of all, you are very much right.  Technology without  moral values is very dangerous, so we have to develop more values.  One of  the trends that we're seeing also in the investment space, is that people  are trying to achieve double bottom line, make progress on technology, but  at the same time, make the world safer by using technology for the better.   And I think this is a great challenge that human beings are facing in the  next 10 to 20 years.  </p><p>KISSEL:  Chemi, should we be thinking about Israel is the second Silicon  Valley?  And for investors out there that are sick of the fang stocks here  in the United States, you know, what are the companies that they should be  looking at over there?  </p><p>PERES:  So, I think you shouldn't look at it as a second Silicon Valley,  you should look at it as a first innovation nation.  It's a nation that  both created not from the land but from the mind.  Everything that happen  in Israel was not build upon the land.  We cannot use the land for natural  resources for food or water.  Everything that we do, state foundation,  security, economy, and peace-building is only with our brain.  So, you  should think of Israel as an empire of the mind, as a model for nations  that would like to transition themselves from the old world where they rely  on the land, to the new world which is limitless based on the brain power.   That's the way you need to look at it.</p><p>KISSEL:  Companies?  Any companies?</p><p>PERES:  Companies, probably the biggest company now emerging is  Technologies Checkpoint, which is doing security, and other great company,  I would say, is the company that Intel-acquired Mobile Eye, which now is  turning to be a center for autonomous driving in Israel.  But you know, we  have 7,000 companies in Israel, and probably five percent of them are  emerging as new, great ideas.  And I think that in the next 10 years, we'll  see tremendous number of Israeli companies really changing the world.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Your father used to talk about this a lot.  The late great  Shimon Peres, which talks about Israel as this hub for innovation.  Why is  that?  Why has Israel been able to really compete with the best of the best  in terms of innovation and technology growth?  </p><p>PERES:  So, as I said there, Maria, basically, you cannot build anything,  because we have -- on the land, because our land is so small, it does not  provide any shelter, no food, no water.  So, we had to build everything on  our brain power.  So, number one is necessity, and the second thing I think  is the notion that Israel wants to make the world better, to change the  world for better.  My father would say, most likely, that our biggest  contribution for human beings is dissatisfaction; we're never satisfied  with everything.  So, we need to check everything with technology.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I like that.  Great.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  By the way, the president announced, obviously, his future  plans with the City of Jerusalem back in December of 2017 to move the  embassy to Jerusalem.  You're happy with this decision, obviously?  </p><p>PERES:  Obviously, I'm very happy.  Not everything that is done for Israel  is necessarily bad for other people.  That should've been done in 1947 when  Israel was established as a nation.  Celebrating our 70th anniversary.  I  think it's a great present to fix what was wrong.  It should have been,  from day one, our capital.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Chemi, it's good to see you.  </p><p>PERES:  Good to see you, too.  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Chemi Peres.  We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Wednesday morning, everybody.  Thanks so  much for joining us.

Futures are flat today now.  Markets were edging higher earlier as  investors await fourth quarter GDP numbers to come out, roughly 90 minutes  from now.  We're expecting the economy to show growth of 2.5 percent in the  fourth quarter.</p><p>My next guest chairs the subcommittee on monetary policy and trade in the  House Financial Services Committee.  Joining us right now is Kentucky  Congressman Andy Barr.  Congressman -- it's good to see you.  Thanks so  much for joining us.</p><p>REP. ANDY BARR (R), KENTUCKY:  Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So did what you see in terms of what's happening in the economy  today -- did that jibe with what you heard from Mr. Powell yesterday?  </p><p>BARR:  Yes, I think our new chairman of the Federal Reserve reinforced what  we're already seeing, which is that tax cuts and the regulatory relief  agenda -- that that agenda is working in the economy and that the economic  outlook is strong as a result of the fiscal stimulus that congress and the  President have injected into the economy.  And that gives the Fed greater  flexibility to continue its monetary normalization program, which is very  important to remove the distortions from our economy.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So what did you get from him yesterday?  I mean did you get a  sense that he's going to raise interest rates four times?  </p><p>BARR:  Well, I was encouraged that Chairman Powell did clearly communicate  the monetary policy trajectory.  He did indicate that the tax cuts were  working in terms of increasing household incomes, increasing wages.  The  consumer and the business confidence is very, very high.</p><p>And as a result, we do expect the Fed to continue to normalize and that's  very important, because this Fed chairman has inherited a very  unprecedented task and that is the task to unwind a very unconventional  balance sheet, a bloated balance sheet that creates risks and also a  protracted period of artificially-low rates.  We need to return to market- based rates.</p><p>That doesn't mean an unpredictable increase, dramatic increase in interest  rates.  It means a gradual, predictable increase in interest rates,  consistent with the growing economy.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  We were talking about that all morning -- $4.5 trillion  balance sheet needs to get unwound which is why you asked this question  yesterday.  Let's listen.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARR:  Are there any plans within the balance sheet normalization strategy  to roll off longer term assets more quickly, to counteract that flattening  yield curve?  </p><p>JEROME POWELL, CHAIRMAN, FEDERAL RESERVE:  You know, flattening of yield  curves in the past has been sort of a precursor of recessions, but largely  because in many prior recessions the Fed had to raise rates quickly to  hold, you know, to hold inflation down.</p><p>That's not the situation we have now.  There's always a risk of a recession  at any given point in time.  I don't see it as at all high at the moment.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So were you surprised that the markets reacted so violently  after the meeting?  </p><p>BARR:  No.  And I'm also not surprised at the general level of volatility.   And remember, some of these corrections are very healthy to avoid asset  bubbles.  We don't want excessive volatility but we also recognize that  normalizing monetary policy can be a very sound policy from the standpoint  of preventing asset bubbles, making sure that we are realigning valuations  and equities according to reality.</p><p>So it's not all together a bad thing to recalibrate as the markets continue  their overall upward trajectory.  Again, we don't want valuations to exceed  reality and so some level of correction here and there is a good thing, as  the market continues its long-term bull run.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE):  I see.</p><p>KISSEL:  What is Congress going to do -- by the way, this is Mary Kissel  here -- if we do see a spike in rates and that interest burden on the  government debt goes through the roof?  I mean that's a big risk, isn't it.   What are you guys doing about it?  </p><p>BARR:  It is a big risk.  But it's also important that we don't mask the  true problem with artificially low rates that create distortions in the  economy and excessive risk.  I think it's incumbent upon Congress and the  President to get serious about mandatory spending reform.</p><p>I would add that some of the critics of tax reform blame tax cuts for  larger deficits.  I think monetary normalization and unreformed mandatory  spending is what is likely to increase deficits.</p><p>And so that reinforces the need for us to continue pro-growth policies so  that we get revenue, not from tax cuts, but from more taxpayers.  And we  also reform mandatory spending so that we can force the government to live  within its means.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We're going to switch gears here.  Here's Jason Chaffetz.  Go  ahead.</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  Yes, Jason Chaffetz here.  It's good to see you -- Andy.</p><p>BARR:  Hey -- Jason.  Good to see you.</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  I served with Andy in the United States Congress.</p><p>I want to ask you about guns.  The House of Representatives passed a bill  that had the concealed carry reciprocity act coupled with the Fix NICS, the  National Instant Background Check System.  Do you think the House has an  appetite to separate those bills and run independently the Fix NICS  legislation?  And would that be palatable with what's going on in the  Senate?  </p><p>BARR:  Well, I would support that -- Jason.  I also support the reciprocity  bill.  I'm a co-sponsor of the reciprocity bill, our colleague Richard  Hudson's bill.</p><p>But I also support fixing the NICS and enhancing the NICS system.  And I  was one of many members of Congress also who signed a letter to the ATF to  revisit the bump stock after -- the bump stock regulations after Las Vegas.  </p><p>CHAFFETZ:  So why don't those things pass?  I mean if you're as  conservative as they get in the House, then why isn't Kevin McCarthy and  Paul Ryan pulling up those bills because we could pass both of those, even  three bills independently.  Why isn't that happening?  </p><p>BARR:  Well, as you know, Jason -- and I'm not sure if you were still in  the Congress at the time, but we did pass the fix NICS with the reciprocity  bill.</p><p>I'm in favor of separating and passing them again.  I think the Senate  needs to take action.  You know, there's a narrative out there that  Congress doesn't care or hasn't taken action on these mass murders.  That's  not true.  We passed the Helping Families and Mental Health Crisis Act as  part of the 21st Century Cures Act which helped to reform HIPAA with  respect to helping family members intervene with loved ones whoa re  suffering from mental illness.</p><p>We've also taken action on the bump stocks.  We passed the Fix NICS  program.  And I would also be in favor of some federal authority to give  local school districts the flexibility and the discretion to make our  schools safer and to use resources to either pay for law enforcement  officers in the schools, harden schools, metal detectors, even more  psychologists or counselors in the schools to monitor kids who have social  alienation and warning signs.</p><p>And you know, this is personal to me and Jason because our good friend  Steve Scalise was the victim last June of a gunman.  And you know, the one  lesson from that baseball field in Alexandria when many of our colleagues  were out there in harm's way, the lesson was that the best defense in a  situation like that is a well-armed, well-trained security guard.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>BARR:  And you know, I think local school districts should be able to  direct local decisions with Parent Teachers Associations on whether or not  they want to use resources to have security officers in their schools.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  You would think so -- Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Congressman -- I want to ask you what you think about your  Senator Rand Paul from your state of Kentucky about his pushback on this  Fix NICS bill because you are getting that from some conservatives with the  suggestion of how can you appeal if you're flagged in this background check  system.</p><p>So are some of your colleagues, whether in the House like Congressman Louis  Gohmert who we talked to yesterday, and then in the senate, getting in the  way of passing a clean bill to beef up a background check system that  already exists and works in this country?  </p><p>BARR:  Well, in the case of Texas, where you saw the Air Force fail to  provide the information to the NICS system, I think that's exactly what  we're trying to fix.  And I think we need to make sure that federal  agencies are actually providing the information to make the NICS system  work.</p><p>We can have all the checks in the world.  But if you don't have the  information in the background check system it doesn't work.  And I would  add that the Fix NICS bill that we passed out of the House already, that  bill actually enhanced some of the due process.</p><p>So I agree with Senator Paul.  We need procedural due process if the  government is, you know, taking away a constitutional right without due  process.  We need that due process.  But we also need to make sure that the  NICS system is working and clearly, it's not.</p><p>And I would also add in the case of the tragedy in Florida, this young man  was showing all of the warning signs -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>BARR:  -- and clearly there was a failure by law enforcement, our mental  health system and the education system to get that information so that that  young man was not -- could not purchase a firearm.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So you think there will be improvements this year?  You think  there will be any changes in legislation this year on this?</p><p>BARR:  Well, of course, we've already passed the bill out of the House.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  I know.</p><p>BARR:  We would encourage the Senate to do the same.  And I would be in  favor of separating those out consistent with my strong, strong support of  the Second Amendment.  And none of these reforms in my view would in any  way compromise our commitment to the Second Amendment.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Congressman -- let me move on.</p><p>Reverend Billy Graham will lie in honor today in the U.S. Capitol Rotunda.   He will be the fourth private citizen to lie in honor.  Your thoughts on  the storied life of Reverend Graham; can you tell us a little about what  you're expecting today in terms of the ceremony?  </p><p>BARR:  Well, it's altogether appropriate that the Congress is not in  session to honor the legacy and the tremendous contributions and the  spiritual leadership of Billy Graham -- Reverend Billy Graham who  ministered to so many Americans including U.S. presidents and members of  Congress.</p><p>We are so -- we're not only appreciative of his ministry but we're grateful  for the leadership that he provided to the country in good times and bad  times.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Let me ask you Congressman, before you go, on Financial  Services Committee -- how much of a priority is changing Dodd-Frank?  Is  that going to be a priority in the coming weeks?  When might we expect  changes here?  </p><p>BARR:  Well, I'm very optimistic that we have a bipartisan bill that's  moving through the Senate.  As you know, statutory changes to a law like  Dodd-Frank which has been a disaster in terms of clogging up our financial  markets -- we need 60 votes in the Senate.</p><p>So we have a modest reform bill that fixes some of the overreach from Dodd- Frank.  It's moving through the Senate.  We've passed a more ambitious bill  out of the House.  But that gives us a lot of optimism that we can provide  regulatory relief for community financial institutions.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So it should be coming in the coming weeks, then.</p><p>Congressman -- good to see you.  Thank you.</p><p>BARR:  Thank you -- good to see you too.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Andy Barr.</p><p>We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>A major retailer taking a stand on assault rifles.  Lauren Simonetti with  the details and headlines now -- Lauren.  </p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Breaking news this morning.  Dick's  Sporting Goods -- that's one of the country's largest sports retailers,  they say they will no longer sell assault-style weapons.  They will also no  longer sell high-capacity magazines and they will not sell any gun to  anyone under the age of 21 years old regardless of what the local laws are.</p><p>These are shares not moving just yet in the premarket but this is the one- year chart and you can see they're down 35 percent.</p><p>Well, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates had nothing good to say about crypto  currencies.  He was speaking at an \"Ask Me Anything\" Reddit event.  And he  suggested the technology is used by money launderers, terrorists and drug  dealers.</p><p>Gates said the main value of money like bitcoin is their anonymity which  allows users to hide from law enforcement, adding that long-term  investments in the virtual currencies are super risky.</p><p>Well, McDonald's' Happy Meals will once again have Disney-themed toys in  them, all this starting with \"The Incredibles 2\".  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Honey -- </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  What?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  -- where is my super suit?  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  What?  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Where is my super suit?  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SIMONETTI:  McDonald's and Disney are re-launching a multiyear deal.  It  starts with \"The Incredibles 2\".  \"Incredibles 2\" -- that hits theaters in  June.</p><p>Taking a look at shares of McDonald's -- they're up 25 percent from a year  ago.  Shares of Disney are down about 5 percent from a year ago.</p><p>There you go.</p><p>All right.  This is an interesting story.  Barbra Streisand, 75 years old,  revealing that two of her three dogs are clones.  Miss Scarlet and Miss  Violet were actually cloned from cells taken from her 14-year-old dog,  Samantha before Samantha died last year.  So the dogs look alike but  Streisand said she can't wait to see if they share Samantha's personality  as well.  Apparently she was a serious dog.</p><p>If you were wondering, the price to clone is $50,000 per pup.  And she  dressed them in different colors so she could tell them apart.  That's how  they got their names -- Scarlet and Violet.  Now you know.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I don't know if I like the story -- cloning your dog.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  With all the dogs -- you know what, with all the dogs in  shelters that are on at-risk lists that need homes, whether it's the dogs  on the streets of Puerto Rico and Miami, New York City, and you pay the  money to clone your dog.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Why not adopt a dog or puppy that needs you?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  You've got all that money, you could have 10 and save some  lives.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Cloning your dogs.   </p><p>CHAFFETZ:  Wasn't she going to move to Canada?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  She was supposed to move to Canada if President Trump won the  election.  She says I'm moving to Canada.  She is still here.  </p><p>CHAFFETZ:  And cloning dogs.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And in an interview she suggests that the reason President Trump  won is because of the voting machines got fooled with.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  She thinks Hillary still won.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And that George Bush shouldn't have won either.  She thinks  there was vote tampering.  She literally said that the last few days.  </p><p>CHAFFETZ:  I still want my money back from going to see \"Yentl\" -- still a  craw in my side.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  You're that old?</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We've got a tweet to tell you about.  The President just  tweeted this.  We'll see what he's thinking about this morning.  Here's  what he said.  \"The Heritage Foundation has just stated that 64 percent of  the Trump agenda is already done -- faster than even Ronald Reagan.  We are  blown away, said Thomas Binion of Heritage.  President Trump is very  active, conservative and very effective.  Huge volume and spectrum of  issues.\"</p><p>The President just tweeted that.</p><p>Do you disagree with that?  He's patting himself on the back, definitely.   You're right.  </p><p>CHAFFETZ:  Yes.  I think things have been going well.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KISSEL:  Lots of winning -- Jason.  Lots of winning.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Hey -- are you tired of winning yet?  </p><p>CHAFFETZ:  Well, get Barbra Streisand to Canada -- that would be winning.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Fourth quarter GDP numbers out in about an hour.  Back in a  minute, we'll preview it.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>The fourth quarter GDP is due out in about an hour.  Growth is expected to  be 2.5 percent, according to Thompson Reuters.  This after Federal Reserve  Chairman J. Powell testified in front of the House Financial Services  Committee yesterday on his outlook for the economy.  Watch.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>POWELL:  It does feel to me that the next couple of years look quite strong  and you should see strong demand from consumers.  You should see businesses  investing and I would expect the next two years on the current path to be,  you know, to be good years for the economy.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  joining us now, Wells Fargo Investment Institute senior global  equity strategist Scott Wren.  Scott -- good to see you.</p><p>SCOTT WREN, SENIOR GLOBAL EQUITY STRATEGIST, WELLS FARGO INVESTMENT  INSTITUTE:  Hi -- Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The next couple years look strong, good growth.  What does that  mean for you in markets?  </p><p>WREN:  Well, for us I think strong is certainly a relative term.   Politicians always want to seem to pump up the growth very high, but if we  saw something in the 2.5 percent, 2.8 percent, maybe toward 3 type of  range, I think over the next couple of years, inflation stays reasonable.   I think stocks can do well in that kind of an environment.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  How come markets are so nervous about this?  </p><p>WREN:  Well, I would argue that 2018 is all about the central banks and  particularly the fed.  We've been on a 10 year monetary policy experiment.   It's coming to an end.</p><p>In any normal cycle the fed usually has trouble backing away.  This one's  going to be more difficult.  So when the market starts finally coming to  grips that we're going to have three hikes this year, which I think they  have, when in 2017 the stock market I think was mostly in denial, it's some  uncertainty.</p><p>J. Powell talked yesterday, as you mentioned, talks maybe 4 -- that's a  problem.  We've argued that 3 is ok, but anything over that is a head wind  for the market.  </p><p>CHAFFETZ:  You said reasonable inflation number.  What is a reasonable  expectation of inflation?  </p><p>WREN:  Well, Jason -- I tell you, we are -- let's say we got out of 2017  with 2, 2.1 CPI type of number.  Our number this year is 2.4 so inflation  is moving up.  That's way below the longer term average.  Of course,  personal consumption expenditures, PCE has been stuck at 1.5 percent, way  below where the Fed wants to see it.</p><p>So you know, I think the Fed's probably in the end going to let the economy  run a little hot.  I mean they've been trying to get inflation for 10  years.  They have not been successful.  They don't want to just choke it  off too quickly.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  When you talk about the central bank, our Central Bank  unprecedented monetary policy over the last 10 years, interest rates could  get away from them.  They can move on the short end.  But in terms of the  longer end and as treasury and mortgage securities roll off their balance  sheet as they try to reduce it later this year -- that's the great unknown.</p><p>You don't really have -- because, again, the market could take over and  you've already seen that start to happen with longer term interest rates.   They're only at 2.91 percent at the close yesterday on the 10 year but  Nevertheless, that's a major worry.  That's why people are so fixated on  that.  </p><p>WREN:  Well, I think they are -- Dagen.  And really we're in uncharted  territory.  I mean we've never had to roll off this much off a fed balance  sheet.  So that's more uncertainty.  I think any news that has to do with  wages, with employment, with inflation, with the fed, the market is going  to react meaningfully probably, one way or the other.</p><p>Yesterday it was J. Powell's comments.  I think on March 9th when the  employment data is released, the single most important data point this  month or in March, rather, I would argue is what did average hourly  earnings do year over year.  If that is less than 2.9, let's say it's 2.6 I  think the market will rally on that.  If it's 3 or 3.1, it's probably going  to be an ugly day.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Because those are two important dates.  March 1st, we get  the PCE indicator; March 9th we get the jobs number with the wages.  We'll  be watching that. </p><p>Real quick what are you telling clients to do right now?  Would you put new  money to work here?  </p><p>WREN:  Absolutely.  I think that what we want our clients doing,  industrials, consumer discretionary, health care, financials -- we want  them buying on the dips.

The press doesn't know,  we don't have eyes and ears in the courtroom.</p><p>(b), just as important, there is no adversary.</p><p>If you are presenting a document to me and you're not telling me everything  about it, your adversary is going to point that out to me but where there  is no adversary it's very easy for you to pull the wool over my eyes.</p><p>There was a proposal not too long ago to have a standing adversary in the - - </p><p>CHAFFETZ:  Yes.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: -- FISA court.  The adversary doesn't represent the person  whose surveillance is sought but the adversary challenges the government's  documents which would force the government to -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But -- </p><p>NAPOLITANO: -- dot every \"i\" and -- </p><p>BARTIROMO: -- so nobody -- </p><p>NAPOLITANO: -- cross every \"t\" -- </p><p>BARTIROMO: -- challenges anything?</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Correct.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE.

So, isn't it time to talk about getting rid of this  court?</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Absolutely.</p><p>I've been arguing since 1978, Jason was a little boy but this court has  been unconstitutional.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Devin Nunes has said that --  he suggested, Luke we need a FISA  court but, but, but, I if this kind of abuse of continues we may look to  not fund this FISA court.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: A, it tampers with the standard that's in the Constitution,  from probable cause of crime to probable cause of speaking to a foreign  person, that is a radically lower standard.</p><p>Congress can change the Constitution and it's purported to do so.  B, it  meets a secret.  C, it's not a real court because there's no adversary in  the courtroom.</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  But Congress just reauthorized it.  They reauthorized it and  then like 48 hours later -- </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Yes.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: -- they announced all these potential abuses -- </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  I appreciate -- </p><p>Chef it's: -- of the FISA court.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: -- what Devin Nunes is doing but he in my opinion committed a  grave wrong by sitting on all this while Congress was debating the  reauthorization -- </p><p>CHAFFETZ:  Yes.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: -- of FISA.</p><p>He permitted more power in the hands of the very people whom he accused of  abusing that power.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Why?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE.  Yes, but there's been no evidence that Section 702  that was reauthorized has been abuse.</p><p>My question to you Judge is, what executive would want the FISA court to go  away because if that court went away, then the executive branch would be  wholly -- </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Directly responsible -- </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: -- responsible, directly responsible -- </p><p>NAPOLITANO: -- Correct.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: -- for the surveillance.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's -- </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  It's -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's a good point.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: -- it's extraordinary power to the executive branch.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow!</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Very difficult to get any entity, Congress or the president to  shrink its own power.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow!</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  It will take an extremely principled person to do that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, my goodness!</p><p>Well we've got to get to this as well because FBI, former FBI director Jim  Comey is bashing President Trump, again, ahead of his book release.</p><p>Comey tweeted out a picture of himself, recording the audio version of his  new tell-all book last night, and wrote, \"Lordy, this time there will be a  tape; audiobook almost finished.\"</p><p>His caption references president Trump's Tweet last year that conversations  between the two men have been recorded.</p><p>Judge your reaction to this?</p><p>He -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- he keeps poking the president --  </p><p>NAPOLITANO: -- Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- meanwhile all of this wrong-doing went on, on his watch.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Yes.</p><p>Yes, and I don't know what he's doing.</p><p>I am - he --  my guess he thought it was funny and, in some sense, it might  be a little, mildly humorous, 'this time there will be a tape' because when  president Trump said \"James Comey better hope there isn't a tape,' and then  Congress tried to get the tape and then the president said, \"OK, there  wasn't a tape.  I was just suggesting that he better hope that there isn't  one.\"</p><p>This is a reference to that.

Well there's a lot of open --  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  So, -- </p><p>BARTIROMO: -- investigations now about classified leaks.</p><p>Jeff Sessions told me there are 27 open investigations right now of  classified leaks.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: -- Did he tell you --  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>NAPOLITANO: -- any of them go back into the Clinton --  into the Obama  administration?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  \"No.\"</p><p>But -- </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Who unmasked General Flynn and the ambassador Kislyak --  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: -- in the waning days of the Obama administration?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.

Good Wednesday morning,  everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us this morning.  I'm Maria  Bartiromo.  Happy Wednesday.  It is Wednesday, February 28th.  Your top  stories right now 8:00 a.m. on the East Coast.  Economic boom.  Investors  are waiting the second reading on the fourth quarter GDP, it's due out in  30 minutes.  We will have the numbers as soon as they hit the tape.  </p><p>Economists are expecting the GDP to come in and show growth of 2-1/2  percent going into the number.  Futures indicating a gain at the start of  trading despite a big sell-off yesterday, Dow Industrials expected to be up  20 points at the start, NASDAQ up 13.  Here's the damage yesterday, stocks  were hit hard with the Dow closing down about 300 points after investors  were spooked with Federal Reserve Chairman Jay Paul's comments.  He signal  the strong economy could lead to further interest rate hikes.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JAY POWELL, CHAIRMAN, FEDERAL RESERVE:  The December meeting, the median  participant called for three-rate increases in 2018.  Since then what we've  seen is incoming data that suggests a strengthening in the economy.  We  have seen some data that will in my case add some confidence to my view  that inflation is moving up the target. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And with that markets sold off, global market following suit.   FT-100 is up 1-1/2 points in London but the CAC quarante in Paris is down a  third of a percent.  The DAX Index in Germany down a quarter of a percent.   In Asia overnight, right across the board.  Markets there taking a cue from  Wall Street, Hong Kong, Japan both down 1-1/2 percent.  The battle over gun  control back in the U.S. as the students in Parkland, Florida return to  school today.</p><p>President Trump is set to host a bipartisan meeting with lawmakers as they  work to end gun violence. The debate having a major impact on the business  world as well.  This morning we learned that Dick's Sporting Goods also  shaking things up.  It says it will no longer sell assault-style rifles, it  will require shoppers to be 21 years old to purchase any firearm,  regardless of what the local laws say.  Then a deal at their doorstep,  Amazon putting a ring on it acquiring the smart doorbell maker for $1  billion.  What it means for your deliveries coming up this morning.</p><p>Plus this, Pizza Hut gobbling up a slice of the NFL, the details as the  company replaces Papa John's as the NFL's official pizza sponsor.  All  those stories coming up this morning and joining me to break it all down,  Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell, former Utah Congresswoman, former  House Oversight Committee Chairman and Fox News Contributor, Jason  Chaffetz.  And the Wall Street Journal's editorial board member, Fox News  Contributor, Mary Kissel.  Great to see you.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN ANCHOR:  Great news on Pizza Hut.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MARY KISSEL, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  I like it --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Papa John's.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You do?</p><p>KISSEL:  Yes.  Absolutely, there's no contest there.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Just to let you know on this set, that's blasphemy.</p><p>KISSEL:  What?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  So -- because again, pizza is -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We don't -- we really like homemade pizza where, you know -- </p><p>KISSEL:  The fancy pizza. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  My father had a restaurant, we sold pizza, so we're pizza  snobs.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>JASON CHAFFETZ, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: -- right here.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The only question that needs answering is coal fired or wood  fired.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Thank you.  Thank you.</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's what happens when you're a pizza snob.  What were you  saying, was it pizza-related?  </p><p>CHAFFETZ:  Yes, yes.  Pizza.  I don't care.  Just put some pizza up here.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Still mad about -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>CHAFFETZ:  I miss pancakes day.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, that's right.  You like that stack we had on yesterday.   That was incredible.  All right.  We got a big show this day and this hour,  big hour coming up.  White House Deputy Press Secretary Hogan Gidley is  here.  A lot of questions for him.  Former Republican National Committee  Chairman and former Mississippi Governor, Haley Barbour making an  appearance, along with the host of \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" Stuart Varney  weighing in as well.  </p><p>You don't want to miss a moment of it, stay with us for a big hour.  And we  kick it off here with this.  Students in Parkland, Florida returning to  Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School today, two weeks to the day after 17  students were murdered and teachers, they were gunned down.  This comes as  a bipartisan group of lawmakers are in Washington meeting with the  President to talk about legislative ways to combat gun violence.  Blake  Burman is covering the story.  He's at the White House right now.  Blake,  good morning to you.</p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Maria, good morning to you as well.  That  meeting with lawmakers here at the White House later this afternoon at  3:00, to further the conversation on school safety.  This comes as the  White House has signaled its support for two different pieces of  legislation in response to the Parkland shooting.  The first is called STOP  School Violence Act, that would reauthorized the Federal grant program.   And the second is the Fix NICS bill which  would penalize government should  they not report criminal records into the background check system.   Yesterday, the White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders also signaled that  more support for legislation could come by week's end.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>SARAH HUCKABEE SNADERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  Anything further will  come later this week.  The President as I've said expects to meet with a  number of lawmakers tomorrow from both sides of the aisle and wants some  more information about specifics after that.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURMAN:  As you mentioned for the first time since the shooting, students  at Marjory Stoneman Douglas Senior High School in Parkland, Florida  returning to their classrooms this morning on this program earlier today.   Junior Kyle Kashuv said he is not so certain that anything will change at  least in the upcoming weeks as it relates to safety at his school.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KYLE KASHUV, MARJORY STONEMAN DOUGLAS HIGH SCHOOL:  Sadly I don't think  that anything is going to really change in the next coming weeks.  I think  everything is going to stay the same.  I don't think that we're going to  have -- the only thing -- the only difference we're going to have increased  security by police officers. I don't think that anything specifically other  than that will change in the security of other schools.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BURMAN:  Meantime, the business fallout is continuing Dick's Sporting Goods  making a major announcement this morning saying that they will stop selling  all assault-style rifles in their stores along with high-capacity magazines  and make sure that whoever buys a gun in their store is at least 21 years  old.  This comes as lawmakers in the State of New York, Virginia, Ohio, and  Alabama are now courting Delta Airlines.  </p><p>Maria, you know, the background to this one, Delta pulled some benefits for  NRA members after the shooting.  Lawmakers in the State of Georgia said  that they might yank a tax benefit for Delta.  Here at White House, I asked  the Press Secretary Sarah Sanders about this yesterday and the White House  is not weighing in.  Maria?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Hmm.  Well, I mean, it's odd to say this least.  Blake, thank  you.  We're going to keep covering this.  Blake Burman is at the White  House.  Joining us now to continue the conversation is former Mississippi  governor, former RNC Chairman now founding partner at BGR Group, Haley  Barbour. Governor, it's good to see you, sir.  Thanks so much for joining  us.</p><p>HALEY BARBOUR, FOUNDING PARTNER, BGR GROUP:  Thank you, Maria.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Where do you stand on all this?  Dick's Sporting Goods today,  one of the largest sports retailers in the country announcing it will stop  selling assault fire rifles.  Is that significant to you?</p><p>BARBOUR:  Well, I mean, it's a -- it's a big industry when you go into a  gun store or a sporting goods store, sells guns, you're going to see that  these assault-looking rifles are very prominent and when you ask the store  owner will say it's because all the customers see it on television, they  see it in the movies, and they are enamored of learning more about these --  about these guns.  So if Dick's does this, or if Dick's does this, they are  going to be turning their back on fair amount of the market and that's a  private decision that they have to make as a business decision.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But isn't it -- isn't it worth having the discussion?  I mean,  I'm all about freedoms and my rights.  I don't want my second amendment  rights touched but assault rifles, why do people need assault rifles?  </p><p>BARBOUR:  Well -- I mean, first of all, there's a huge difference between  people in urban areas and people in rural areas.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.  </p><p>BARBOUR:  When you get in a rural area, you could be 30 minutes from the  nearest deputy sheriff.  And if something happens in at your home or in the  area where you are, to one of your neighbors, it could be like I say 30  minutes before law enforcement can get there.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.  That's a fair point.  </p><p>BARBOUR:  So people need a way to -- need a way to protect themselves,  their families and their property.  And let's don't kid ourselves, if  you're at outlaw guns, only outlaws will have guns.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Good point.  </p><p>BARBOUR:  So --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And Governor Barbour, I think that what people just want in  terms of this gun safety debate is some -- they want evidence-based  decisions because people always point to the \"assault weapons ban\" from  1994 to 2002.  And if you look at all of the studies done, that ban had a  negligible impact on gun crime.  Instead those studies point to improved  background checks, now that was 18 weapons that these assault weapons were  banned for really cosmetic reasons.  </p><p>You look at this new assault weapons ban that was introduced by the  Democrats in the House and the way they start defining these weapons, they  clearly are going after semiautomatic handguns as well.  That is clearly  the direction and proponents of the second amendment, that's what they've  always been worried about and people need to understand that's why there's  pushback on broadly banning classes of guns in this country.  </p><p>BARBOUR:  Well, there's no question that probably there are more  semiautomatic handguns in the United States than there are long rifles,  because that's the way -- we don't have as many revolvers as we had when I  was growing up and more semiautomatic.  But you make a very important  point, we need to look at everything, we need to look at mental health,  mental health is a gigantic issue here and the failures of law enforcement  in this case are really mind-boggling.  How many times over and over and  over was this young man reported and yet nothing was ever done about it. </p><p>Which says -- as the young man said on tape a while ago, we are going to  have to harden schools.  How much we do it and how we do it, whether  President Trump's idea to let schoolteachers be armed.  Of course, I'm sure  what he means is only ones who want to, only ones who volunteer, only ones  that take the training, but even if you do that you're still going to need  stronger law enforcement in the schools to protect the people by their soft  targets attract this kind of terrible thing like the church in Texas where  again, the shooter should have been known and should have never been able  to buy a gun but our system broke down, we just got to make our system work  better.  </p><p>KISSEL:  But Governor, Mary Kissel here, it seems to me like the companies  are interested in virtue signaling and the politicians the same, you know,  it is a complex issue, you mentioned mental health, there is a balance to  be struck between the privacy of the individual and the ability to notify  law enforcement, that's a nuance sophisticated conversation to have.  Is  anybody having that conversation? </p><p>BARBOUR:  Well, there need to be because if you're -- if you're next door  neighbor is a grumpy old man, that doesn't mean he is a threat to society.   But if -- but if your next door neighbor behaves like this young boy, this  19-year-old kid did, then absolutely law enforcement or some form of a  judicial system needs to come into this, and his rights of privacy do not  exceed the right of the public to be safe.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  These are all really important points that you make,  Governor.  Let me ask you about immigration because ICE is now saying that  its agents arrested 150 illegal immigrants in the greater San Francisco Bay  area since the weekend.  That despite the fact that Oakland's mayor alerted  the public to the operation that ICE agents were coming.  This comes as a  Federal judge in that rejected a legal challenge to the Trump  administration's plan to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border,  essentially giving the project a green light.  President Trump tweeted  about this this morning, he says, I have decided that sections of the wall  the California wants built now will not be built until the wall is  approved.  Big victory yesterday, the president says with rulings from the  courts that allow us to proceed.  Our country must have border security.   Governor, your reaction, what about the Oakland mayor alerting the illegals  that ICE managers were coming for them?</p><p>BARBOUR:  Well, I thought almost everything she said was unbelievable.  I  mean, let's just suppose for the sake of our government, Memphis, Tennessee  said we're not going to enforce the civil rights law.  I mean, that's what  she said, we're not going to enforce the immigration law, she said  specifically.  It's a Federal law and we don't have to -- we don't have to  abide by it.  That is -- I mean if that were to happen to the civil rights  law this country would be up in arms and rightly so.  But this sanctuary  city business puts people at risk and it puts people at risk who visit  Oakland, California, not just the people that live there.  And certainly,  there are states' rights in our country, we do have a 10th amendment but  the idea that they could just turn up their nose at Federal law -- it's  pretty far out if you ask me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I think it's incredible actually.  Extraordinary how they  get away with that, just ignoring Federal law.  It's -- and continues with  sanctuary city.  Thank you, Governor.</p><p>BARBOUR:  Thank you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good to see you, sir.  Haley Barbour there.  Coming up.  Amazon  knocking on the door for a deal.  The technology giant buys smart doorbell  maker, Ring.  In a deal reportedly valued a billion dollars.  How the home  security market could change.  Back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Later today the President will join lawmaker  honoring America's pastor, the late Billy Graham.  Lauren Simonetti with  the details.  Lauren?</p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Hi, Maria.  The evangelist will  become the fourth private citizen ever to light honor in the capitol  rotunda.  He joined a very short list which includes Rosa Parks in 2005 and  two capital policemen killed in the line of duty, the late preacher's  casket will sit in the capital throughout the day as President Trump,  members of Congress, and the public pay their respects.  His body will then  flown back to North Carolina tomorrow.</p><p>Well, buyers plan to acquire Monsanto reportedly clearing a major hurdle.   Sources telling Reuters the buyer is set to win conditional E.U.  (INAUDIBLE) approval to acquire the world's biggest seed producer, you  discussed, Maria, the $62 billion deal with Bayer CEO earlier today.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WERNER BAUMANN, CEO, BAYER:  We have seen very, very good progress, with --  I know roughly half of the 30 approvals we need, we are in very good  discussions I have to say with the European commission making good progress  there.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  Bayer also reporting adjusted fourth quarter core earnings that  came in slightly below expectations.  Let's show you shares of Monsanto up  almost one percent in premarket trading.  Bayer shares are up nearly 10  percent from a year ago.  There you have it.  </p><p>All right.  Well, Wal-Mart is trying to reach middle-class session  conscious shoppers unveiling for new private label brands to step up its  competition with Amazon and Target.  Wal-Mart also refreshing the Web site  this spring with the focus on fashion plus home furnishing.  Wal-Mart  shares not moving much in premarket trading but the stock up about 30  percent in the past year.</p><p>Well, Ford is bringing its self-driving cars to the streets of Miami.  The  cars are going to make deliveries and they're going to taxi passengers.   Ford teaming up with Dominos to try delivering pizza in these futuristic  vehicles for the time being safety drivers will stay behind the wheel of  all of the Ford.  Over the last year, Ford shares are down 16 percent.  </p><p>But many riders as we talk about autonomous vehicles are nervous about the  concept.  So the navigation app Waymo is releasing this 360 degree video  that shows you what its cars see including the traffic around them with the  hope of making you feel more comfortable, gaining your trust.  Waymo is  owned by parent company Alphabet, those shares up 30 percent over the past  year.  Maria?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Thank you, Lauren.  We'll take a break.  When we  come back, James Comey versus President Trump.  The former FBI director's  latest jab at the Commander-in-Chief on Twitter.  Back in a minute.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>POWELL:  Our current framework says that the committee would be concerned  with sustained or persistent deviations of inflation above or below two  percent.  And I would say that framework is working.  Market understands  it, we've been -- we've been trying to get up to two percent.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That was the new chairman of the Federal Reserve Jay Powell  yesterday fueling expectancies of inflation and multiple rate increase this  year during his Capitol Hill testimony.  Markets took a big hit after his  upbeat assessment of the U.S. economy .  It was down 300 points on the Dow  Industrials as you see.  This morning futures are stabilizing pointing to a  higher opening which happens in about an hour.  Joining us right now to  talk more about markets and your money, Mahoney Asset Management president,  Ken Mahoney.  Ken, good to see you.</p><p>KEN MAHONEY, PRESIDENT, MAHONEY ASSET MANAGEMENT:  Good to see you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us this morning.  What did you  take away from Jay Powell's testimony yesterday and its impact on markets  and the economy? </p><p>MAHONEY:  You know, he really was not hawkish.  I know that's the headlines  this morning, hawkish, hawkish, he wasn't.  You know, we were over bought  to begin with, we needed something to shake things up a little bit.  So, to  me it was not hawkish and, you know, three rate hikes, four rate hikes  versus the physical stimulus that's coming.  Again, I'll side with the  physical stimulus.  All the moneys that's coming into companies that they  could buy back stock and so forth.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So when you look at the backdrop right now, you're talking  about earnings and the S&amp;P 500 expected to be up 20 percent, 2018.   Economic growth of what, 2-1/2, three percent?  We're  expecting the GDP  number any minute.  What's your take on that?  </p><p>MAHONEY:  Yes.  So our take is that things are really going to be -- pretty  strong.  I think about the buybacks right now, $600 billion of the buy  backs this year.  So why the Fed may be raising a little bit.  Look, this  is definitely the clash of the titans, right?  This textbook you kind of go  through and say, wait a second, fiscal monetary which is going to win?   Now, it's going to create more volatility.  What was unusual is leading  into February.  You have 13 months in a row, the market is going up of only  three percent drawdown.  That's crazy.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MAHONEY:  So going forward we have to be a little bit more nimble, there  will be volatility but we can actually make volatility to your friend by  kind of trading along with that.  </p><p>KISSEL:  And when you say fiscal stimulus, this differs from the Obama era  where the stimulus was really just the Fed goosing the market and  government spending that crushed private sector growth.  This to me looks  more sustainable, doesn't it?  Because you actually have a rollback in the  red tape, you got the tax cuts encouraging business investment which is  what's been lacking for so many years.</p><p>MAHONEY:  Right.  I mean, can you imagine sitting onboard now, and the  question is, what do you do with all this cash?  Do we buy back stock, 600  billion buybacks perhaps this year.  Do we increase the dividends, do we  buy our competitors.  Do we -- these are all good decisions.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  This is decisions towards growth.  </p><p>MAHONEY:  These are all good decisions that would be made at the board  level.  It's nice to have that stimulus that we're talking about.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>KISSEL:  Yes.  But I just want to clarify that because when Democrats talk  about fiscal stimulus, what they mean is we want more government spending,  we want more control over the economy and we're going in the opposite  direction as the right direction.    MAHONEY:  Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Just to back up what you said Journal story today, more than a  fifth companies is in the S&amp;P 500 have boosted their dividends to  shareholders so far this year, not one is lashed with dividend, that's the  first time that's happened in seven years.  Pretty incredible.</p><p>KISSEL:  Yes.  But I guess the question is, are we going to get the kind of  business investment that you need to keep this economy growing above three  percent?</p><p>MAHONEY:  I think so.  I mean, look, there's so many -- things are going  back-and-forth right now.  And right now, it's all about the Fed,  (INAUDIBLE) Powell will not be -- he will be in the headlines next week but  we all doing his thing and we back to talking about taxes again. So, you  know (INAUDIBLE) the focus was about Powell.  </p><p>I think he did a tremendous job yesterday talking about growth.  And look,  I don't think we're going to get into this pickle where we get to better  economic numbers and then that's good news for the economy, bad news for  the market.  I don't think we're going to do that again.  Meaning, you  know, bad news meaning rates going to go higher.  I think we're in good  situation where good news for economy is good news force the U.S.'s stocks,  and therefore that's a good place.  </p><p>CHAFFETZ:  What are your concerns about inflation?  What are the pivot  points in which you get concerned?  </p><p>MAHONEY:  Yes.  We only see that yet, I mean, yes, there's wage growth and  the Fed governors are (INAUDIBLE) last week talking about this that there's  wage growth that's happening but that really kind of going in the other  side of that.  We really have not seen much in the way of inflation.  And,  you know, look, just a couple of years ago we're looking at going to  recession perhaps and here are the headlines, talking about this goldilocks  environment being little bit too hot.  Guess what, I think it will take a  little bit too hot, we'll take the 10-year inching up a little bit, we'll  take that.  Now, look, the opposite is when did the 10 years started going  down?  What would people be saying, oh no, my gosh, the economy is -- guess  what, we're inching up a little bit.  The 10-year is telling us and the  stock market is telling us, that the growth that lies ahead.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So what do you want to do?  How do you want to invest here?  </p><p>MAHONEY:  So I still like the leaders, going into this February sell-off we  had, those leaders were Boeing, those leaders were Facebook, Apple, they  got crushed those good-buying opportunity coming out the other side.  Those  are still the winners.  Now, we would stay away though from those interest  sensitive sectors, home builders have not really bounced since that  February drought.  Look at homebuilders, auto, those inter-sensitive areas  we're not going to go near , we're going to stick with the leaders.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll leave it there.  Ken, great to see you.</p><p>MAHONEY:  Good to see you as well.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  Ken Mahoney there.  We got the GDP right  after this after short break.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Wednesday morning, everybody. Thanks so  much for joining us.  We are waiting on the GDP, it is Wednesday, February  28th.  Here are your top stories 8:30 a.m. on the Eastern rather.  The  economy in focus right now, we're watching markets, going into the GDP  number an we're going to get that number in about 10 seconds.  Economists  are expecting growth for the fourth quarter of 2-1/2 percent, that's what  we are waiting on and we are watching markets right now trading up ahead of  the number, up 15 points on the Dow Jones Industrial Average, up 1-1/4 on  the S&amp;P 500, and up 17 points on the NASDAQ.  </p><p>And the GDP out, 2.5 percent, right in line with expectations on the GDP.   The number is exactly what people were expecting.  This is the second  reading of the fourth-quarter GDP up 2-1/2 percent.  Of course, this after  markets were rattled yesterday, following testimony from the Federal  Reserve Chairman Jay Powell.  His comments suggesting that the central bank  may raise interest rates more than three times this year, and that is what  sent the Dow Industrials down 300 points yesterday, S&amp;P 500 down 35 points,  and the NASDAQ, down 91.  We're getting the numbers, and it is right in  line with expectations at 2-1/2 percent.  The actual versus the estimate of  2-1/2 percent.</p><p>This morning, markets are trading up on this news as you can see just after  the number was reported.  The market did improve just a bit.  Dow  Industrials now up 25 points, S&amp;P 500 up 2-1/4, and the NASDAQ up 18  points.  Global markets?  Well, they are also active this morning.  Take a  look initially, markets were really taking a cue from Wall Street, and  that's similar to what we're seeing right now, no stabilization here.  FT- 100 flat, CAC Quarante down a quarter of a percent, DAX Index down a  fraction as well.  In Asia overnight, declines across the board.  Worst  performer was Hong Kong and Japan down about 1-1/2 percent apiece.  </p><p>The second reading of the fourth-quarter GDP in line with expectations.   Let's talk about reaction here.  Dagen, this is what we were looking for.   I can't imagine.  This number is going to upset markets this morning, 2-1/2  percent.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  No, as long as it's right in line with expectations, and two,  Jay, the Fed Chairman, Jay Powell, of what he said yesterday.  He is very  positive about the growth outlook in part because of the tax reform coming  down to Washington.  Two good years for the economy at this point.  We do  not see even market volatility as weighing heavily on the outlook for  economic activity.  He pointed to that.  I think that you will also want to  watch the 10-year yield because so much of the action in the stock market  has been driven by that.  But, again, if it didn't come in a little bit  hotter in the fourth-quarter, maybe you would have gotten a little -- seen  some shaky markets.  But this is, again, right in line with expectations. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, and the markets actually picking up steam here, up 30  points now on the industrial average.  Because yesterday, Mary, the worry  was, was that the economy is actually too hot.  This is sort of those --  one of those Goldilocks numbers, isn't it?</p><p>KISSEL:  Yes, but we've been in such an unusual interest rate environment  for so long, Maria.  I think a lot of investors are just getting used to a  normal environment again, and, you know, I have to agree with your last  guest, Ken Mahoney, he said that he didn't think Jay Powell's comments were  hawkish at all, and I have to agree with him.  I mean, yes, three or four  rate hikes but it's coming from such a low level, and what we're seeing  here is a fairly robust economy, well above two percent, moving towards  three percent, perhaps even 3-1/2 percent growth over the next coming  quarters.  That's good news, that's very, very good news, and a supportive  global growth environment on top of that out of Europe and Japan, just  something not a lot of people are talking about. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  By the way, we should point out that it's 2-1/2 percent which  is in line with expectations, but it's down from the earlier estimate which  was 2.6 percent.</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  I still worry about the government spending.  I don't think  there was any justification to increase by more than 10 percent, domestic  discretionary spending.  You're going to have a trillion-dollar deficit  added on top of that we already have.  I don't think there is any  justification for that.  And it's one part of the economy in the market,  that it just shouldn't be going that direction. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And we agree with you, we talk about it repeatedly, that your  upping, you're running, even higher deficits, and upping the amount of  supply that the -- in terms of borrowing, in terms of the treasury supply  at a time when the Federal Reserve which has been a major buyer of treasury  and mortgage debt over the last 10 years, is now pulling back from that.   And I will say because this is what Ken was talking about, avoiding  interest rate sensitive sectors.  </p><p>You've had a pretty big drop in new home sales in January and the month  prior in December.  And you are seeing softening at the local level because  mortgage rates are heading up, and that marginal buyer is now locked out of  the market because they can't really afford the mortgages that are being  offered, and I think that's, well, something to watch particularly as  longer term rates move up.</p><p>KISSEL:  I mean, essentially, the administration is betting that the tax  cut and the benefits from the tax cuts are going to run for a long time,  that and also cutting the red tape, that will somehow outrun or at least  stave off this interest rate scare that people are so worried about that  you're talking about. </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  The tax reform did reduce the amount of mortgage and interest  deduction, you can say.</p><p>KISSEL:  Hey, even Warren Buffet is coming around to the -- to the benefits  of the tax reform.  I never thought you'd see that.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, he got a huge benefit for his company, didn't he?</p><p>KISSEL:  Yes, he sure did.  Don't we underestimate the benefit of tax cuts?   We always underestimate the benefits.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No, I agree, I don't think it's going to be, well, it cost a  trillion dollars but I do think that there's certain pockets that are good  of the economy like housing that are going to get hurt by this.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  By the way, we should point out that this GDP number is  decelerating from what we saw in the third-quarter.  I mean, in the third- quarter, we had growth of 3.2 percent.  And in the fourth quarter, the  initial reading was 2.6 percent.  So, anyway you look at it, things have  slowed down a bit in the couple of -- in the last couple of months.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But this was before the tax reform goes --</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  Yes, it was. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  So, that's before the tax reform and spending.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Exactly, yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  So, in this -- in this, you will see -- you will see it pick up  steam. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We want to -- we want to get the White House reaction to this  number.  Hogan Gidley is the Deputy White House Press Secretary.  He's  joining us right now, and of course, we also want to talk about students  returning to class at Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida  exactly two weeks after 17 people were killed.  In Washington, the  President is set to meet with a bipartisan congressional group on school  safety today, trying to make progress on legislation to combat gun  violence.  </p><p>Joining us right now from the White House, Deputy Press Secretary Hogan  Gidley.  Hogan, thanks very much for joining us this morning.  Before we  get into the return to school, let me get your take on what's happening in  the economy right now because the GDP is just out, and it shows a growth  number of 2.5 percent but that's down from 3-1/4 percent in the third- quarter what's going on, things have decelerated.</p><p>HOGAN GIDLEY, WHITE HOUSE DEPUTY PRESS SECRETARY:  Well, they have, but the  overall economy is strong, and as I just heard, Dagen, I think pointed out  and she's absolutely right, that's before the tax cuts even took effect.   We had some massive hurricanes, unprecedented amounts of damage, but also  destruction that occurred in so many places across the country.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wait a second, all of this -- all of this is before the tax  plan.  We're talking about the fourth-quarter.  So, the tax plan went into  effect the beginning of '18.  </p><p>GIDLEY:  But I'm saying -- right, but I'm saying expectations are that that  will actually go up, it's still much higher obviously than President Barack  Obama's economy which he said 1.9 percent was the new norm.  We're on the  way up, most economists say we're going to be hovering close to potentially  four percent, as this year continues on, and that's where we expect to be.   The economy is strong, businesses are coming back to this country, as you  well know, consumer confidence is at all-time high, and we expect that to  continue to grow even more into the new year.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, in terms of economic policy, what are the President's  priorities at this point, Hogan?  Because, I know that he wants to work on  Dodd-Frank, and he's been rolling back regulations in a big way since the  start of his presidency.  That should add further spice to this market.   What's the priority in terms of economic policy in the coming six or eight  months?</p><p>GIDLEY:  It will, but look, let's talk about those regulations and their  rollback.  The big way kind of doesn't begin to describe it.  Look, he said  that he would cut two regulations for every one that he put into place.  He  far exceeded that, and he's cutting 22 regulations for every one that gets  put into place.  Obviously, that spurs on consumer confidence but also  security and stabilization in business growth, and that's what this  President is all about, as you know.  And the rapid turnaround of this  economy is no coincidence.  </p><p>It's because we have someone in office who understands the economy, who's  going to push to make this tax cut permanent for individuals as he did with  the corporate tax rate cut, but there's a pattern emerging here with this  President, and that is he's taking on topics and issues that haven't been  addressed in the better part of 30 to 40 years.  He's coming in in a year's  time, he's accomplishing record-setting things, and recording setting time,  and he's growing this economy, something that the government quite frankly,  has been crippling under the last eight years.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  So, are you expecting movement on Dodd-Frank in the  coming few months?</p><p>GIDLEY:  We'll see.  I don't want to get ahead of what President is going  to say or do, but we obviously know that that's what the President wants to  be, he wants to eliminate all hindrances to economic well-being in this  country.  He wants to prop up middle America, as you saw with the tax cuts,  it didn't just effect the corporate tax rate that people have been talking  about for 30 or 40 years, but it also cut taxes for the middle-income  people in this country, and that's where he's going to continuing to go. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, I mean, we're getting a report this morning that the  President is looking to roll back the Volcker Rule, for example, and this  is a rule, obviously where proprietary trading firms do -- cannot do  proprietary trading and just trade for customers but not their own, so is  that something that's going to be changed over the near-term, the Volcker  Rule.</p><p>GIDLEY:  Again, I can't get ahead of what the President is going to say or  do.  He's going to talk also about trade today.  He's going to make some  announcements on that as well.  That should impact the economy, too,  because, look, for far too long, what we've been talking about in this  country, politicians as you know, for decades, go out on a campaign trail  and what they say is we want free and fair trade.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>GIDLEY:  Well, the free trade is always there.  It's the fair part that  politicians seem to ignore once they get in office.  And this President  comes in and says, no more.  This has been dogging our country for decades.   It's going to stop now and it's going to stop on my watch, and so, we'll  see what he announces later today.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  On trade, is the U.S. going to re-enter TPP.</p><p>GIDLEY:  Again, I can't get ahead of what the President is going to say or  do, Maria.  I appreciate you pushing me that direction but the President  has some ideas to how to fix this economy.  He's done a masterful job so  far and we expect that to continue.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Hogan, the President obviously has been spending a lot of time  on efforts to try to come up with solutions for gun safety, school safety,  really.  The President is hoping to jumpstart some real action on  background checks or other plans.  Tell me where that stands right now, and  what does need to be done, in terms of background checks? </p><p>GIDLEY:  Donald Trump is not just the President of the United States.  He's  also a father and he's also a grandfather.  And what he wants is what  everybody in this country wants, which is safety and security for our  children when they go to school, that's just the bottom line.  Legislation  can't just feel good, it actually has to do good.  And that's what the  President is trying to get to the bottom of now when he's talking to all  the relevant stakeholders.  The country was privy to a meeting he had with  grieving families, from the Parkland shooting, other relative stakeholders  from around the Washington, D.C. area, parents, teachers, students --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>GIDLEY:  -- just pouring out their heart, they were angry, they were upset.   They were upset --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  No, that was a -- that was a good idea we did the  listening session.</p><p>GIDLEY:  Right.  But they were also hopeful that something would get done.   So, the President then went met with local law enforcement, then he met  with governors, people who were on the frontlines of all these issues and  how they can be impacted at the local level because, as you know, state and  federal partnerships are key if we're going to actually accomplish  something here.  But when he meets with the Congressional leaders today  from individual congressional districts, bipartisan, bicameral, they've got  to come up with solutions that actually protect children.  We can't just  talk about it anymore.  The American people deserve better.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, is he -- is he prepared to put forth an executive order  bypassing Congress to raise the age limit for getting a gun?</p><p>GIDLEY:  Well, it depends on what happens after the talks, it depends on  what Congress decides to do and also with the local areas decide to do as  well.  The President sees that there's obviously a gaping hole in security.   There was a systematic failure here at every level of government, whether  it was the FBI, whether it was the county sheriff, and then the deputy  sitting outside the school that were trained and had a gun and still didn't  go inside to protect those kids.  Obviously, failures exist, the audit  continues, and once we get that information, the President will make  recommendations this week on what he feels should be done to protect  students in our schools. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What do you make of all these companies waiting into this  issue?  Dick's Sporting Goods this morning says that it's no longer going  to sell automatic-style weapons.  It's going to require consumers to be 21  years old to purchase any firearm, regardless of the law of the land,  Dick's Sporting Goods says.  What do you -- what do you make of the private  sector making these changes?  Is that legal?</p><p>GIDLEY:  Yes, I don't know if it's legal or not, I'm not an attorney, but  it doesn't seem to match up with federal law.  But I mean, look, we've got  states all over the country, deciding to thumb their nose at the federal  government and the laws on the books whether it's California and sanctuary  cities, for example.  But look, these businesses have made decisions based  on pressure from outside groups.  I guess they have the right to do that, I  guess groups have the right to protest, but the bottom line is we have, you  know, 6 million gun owners that are members of the NRA that are law-abiding  citizens.  This President supports the second amendment, supports the NRA  and their efforts to keep our country safe.  And we have a constitutional  right in this country to keep and bear arms.  And so, if a business decides  that they're going to kowtow to pressure from outside groups, I guess they  can do that, but then they're going to have to suffer the consequences  should other side come out and put pressure on them as well.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Hogan, let me ask you about that big announcement from the  President yesterday, announcing that his digital strategist, Brad Prascale  will run the Trump 2020 campaign.  Why did the president make this  announcement now, telling everybody he is in fact running for re-election?</p><p>GIDLEY:  I love you keep asking me questions I really can't talk about.   That's a campaign issue.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Why not?</p><p>GIDLEY:  Well, it's a campaign issue, I have to refer you over to the  campaign to have that discussion.  But look, the President is going to have  a myriad of successes to run on in the 2020 election.  As you know, the  Heritage Foundation just put out a survey basically saying that this  President has already accomplished 64 percent of his agenda, Ronald Reagan,  the standard bearer of our party for a long time and of government success  for the Republicans was only at 47 percent at this time.  So, as I  mentioned before, it's record-setting accomplishments and record-setting  time for Donald Trump.  And whoever the campaign manager is for this  President, they'll have a lot to push moving into the election cycle.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Hogan, great stuff, thanks so much for joining us  this morning.</p><p>GIDLEY:  Thanks so much, Maria.  Have a great day.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Hogan Gidley joining us there.  Thank you.  We'll be right  back.  Back in a minute.  Markets at the highs right now up 50 points on  the GDP number.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Lowe's under pressure this morning, reporting  earnings as well.  Nicole Petallides on the floor of the New York Stock  Exchange.  Nic, good morning to you.</p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FBN ANCHOR:  Good morning, Maria.  So, we are seeing  Lowe's under extreme pressure this morning.  We see the Dow Futures higher  but Lowe's will be to the downside and likely to be one of the biggest  losers here on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, down 70-1/4  percent right now, the quarterly numbers.  What happened to Lowe's when  Home Depot six quarters in a row beat?  Well, Lowe's missed.  They missed  on their quarterly profit, the growth margin, all a miss.  Same-store sales  growth going forward to guidance.  Well, that's going to slow, too.  They  said they've been spending a lot in order to fend off big competition, so  it's clear at this time that Home Depot is really king in the home  improvement retailing.</p><p>And then we take a look at Amazon.  Amazon, a new acquisition, and this is  Ring.  $1 billion.  Ring is home security.  Everybody has been seeing the  commercials or video doorbells, that is the idea, it adds to Blink which is  what they got last year.  And it takes on some of the other guys.  Well,  ADT is to the downside this morning.  Alphabet's home unit, a home -- smart  home security unit.  So, if this is just Amazon expanding beyond and now  that it'll also contribute to Amazon Key where they actually have a smart  lock, and you go in, you have your package or your fresh food drops up.   So, that's big acquisition, they're buying the start-up Ring for $1  billion, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Nic, thank you so much.  Technology titans facing a  boycott for ties to the National Rifles Association.  Joining me now, the  host of \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY,\" Stuart Varney weighing in.  Stu, good morning  to you.</p><p>STUART VARNEY, FBN ANCHOR:  Good morning, Maria.  This seems to be three  separate things going on here.  You have the news this morning that Dick's  Sporting Goods is not going to sell these assault-style rifles to anybody  under 21.  We got that piece of news.  I think that's their business, it's  their policy.  Do as you will, Dick's Sporting Goods.  Then there is the  Boycott NRA Movement, like against Delta, United Airlines, that kind of  thing.  I'm worded about that because it's the politicization of business.   When I buy a product or a service, I buy according to price and quality,  not according to the politics of the company selling me that product or  service.  </p><p>But the most pernicious attack on free speech, in my opinion, comes from  this attempt to silence the NRA on Amazon, Google, Roku, and Apple.  Those  organizations run videos of the NRA from the NRA, and there is now a  serious movement to ban them from all those outlets.  That is deliberately  stomping on free speech.  The left does not like guns, so shut up the NRA.   I think that's absolutely flat-out wrong.  There is no question.  This is  an ongoing story as businesses forced to react to the ongoing problem with  guns. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I'm surprised that so many businesses have reacted this  way, Dagen.  I mean, I am.  I -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And I want to get see people get mad that Planned Parenthood is  now reportedly involved in these -- helping these Parkland, Florida  students organize.</p><p>VARNEY:  Yes, you know -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  So how the wise Planned Parenthood involved in gun control laws?   Just asking.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>VARNEY:  I'd just like to know how we get rifles out of the hands of  demented 19-year-olds.  If you could do that, you solve a lot of problems.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, good point.</p><p>VARNEY:  But I don't have an answer.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Stu, we'll see you in 10 minutes.  Thank you.  \"VARNEY &amp;  COMPANY\" top of the hour right after MORNINGS WITH MARIA.  We'll be right  back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Another milestone for LeBron.  Jared Max with  sports headlines now.  Jared?</p><p>JARED MAX, FOX NEWS SPORTSCASTER:  Good morning, Maria.  First time in  LeBron's 15-year career, he has averaged a triple-double for every game in  one month.  Double digits, three statistical categories.  LeBron became the  oldest player in NBA history to accomplish this eclectic feet when he  helped the Cavalier beat the Nets last night, LeBron also the first NBA  player to total more than 30,000 points, 8,000 rebounds, 8,000 assists.   LeBron thinks the NBA can assist teenage athletes who have the talent to  become pro-basketball players but don't feel suited or interested in  playing NCAA ball but don't want to go overseas to play.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>LEBRON JAMES, AMERICAN BASKETBALL PLAYER:  NCAA is historic.

Multi-year deal includes collected use of 32 NFL team  trademarks to facilitate local exclusive team partnerships.  NFL  Commissioner Roger Goodell says, we're thrilled to have Pizza Hut as a  partner.</p><p>Let's take a look at Pizza Hut's parent Yum! Brands on the stock board.   Now, Pizza Hut assumes Papa John's role as the official pizza of the NFL.   Papa John's came under fire last season when the company founder John  Schnatter suggested sales were down because of the NFL's mishandling of  players kneeling for the anthem.  The two mutually decided to part ways  yesterday.  </p><p>As Major League Baseball rosters fill out with younger, less expensive  talent, some high-priced free agents are still looking for work.  And so,  the players association has filed a grievance against four baseball teams:  the Marlins, the Rays, the Pirates, and the A's.  All accused of failing to  appropriately spend revenue sharing money to improve their clubs.</p><p>Hey, do you see the mascots that were chosen for the 2020 Summer Olympics  in Tokyo?  Students from 16,769 elementary schools in Japan chose the  mascots and the winner was drawn by a graduate of Cabrillo College in  California, Ryo Taniguchi.  One student who voted for the design said it  looks futuristic but also represents Japan traditions.  Some of the  (INAUDIBLE) that didn't quite make the cut are these guys.  Plus, it could  work as Olympic mascots.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Cool.  What are you expecting from Tokyo 2020?</p><p>MAX:  Hopefully, a little bit more fun and less controversy than these  Olympics.  Where it's just strictly about the game and maybe two years from  now, we get to a different point where people can make comments about each  other and we keep the politics outside of sports.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Did you watch it?</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, yes.  You did, we did.</p><p>KISSEL:  I love the Olympics.  Absolutely.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.  OK.</p><p>KISSEL:  Watch it every year.

FT-100 down a third of a  percent, CAC Quarante in Paris down one half of one percent, and the DAX  Index in Germany down a third of a percent, forty points lower.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In Asia overnight, we're right across the board, take a look.  Worst  performer there, Japan.  Nikkei Average down almost one and a half percent.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The battle over gun control, as the students in Parkland, Florida return to  school today, President Trump is set to host a bipartisan meeting with  lawmakers as they work to end gun violence.  I'll speak with one of the  students from Marjory Stone Douglas High School about his return to school  later this hour.  </p><p>And the debate is having a major impact on the business world as well.  The  latest as several states including New York, Ohio, court -- Delta Airlines  following Georgia lawmaker's threat to end any tax benefits for Delta over  its decision to cut ties with the NRA.  </p><p>A health scare in the Virginia Military Base, the details as 11 people fall  ill after opening a letter containing an unknown substance.  We'll bring  you the latest.</p><p>And a deal at their doorstep, Amazon putting a ring on it, acquiring the  smart doorbell maker for $! Billion, what it means for your deliveries,  coming up this morning.</p><p>All those stories coming up this morning and joining me to talk all about  it, Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowelll.  Former Utah Congressman,  former House Oversight Committee Chairman and Fox News Contributor, Jason  CHaffetz.  And the \"Wall Street Journal's\" Editorial Board Member, Fox News  Contributor, Mary Kissel is here.  Great to see you.  </p><p>MARY KISSEL, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Good morning Maria, thanks for having  us.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, good morning to you.</p><p>JASON CHAFFETZ, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Good morning.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN ANCHOR:  When I saw the guests was yesterday, \"I can't  wait to hear what Mary and Jason have to say.  So that means I'm going to  stifle.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  No, we don't want that.  We don't want -- but it's true, we're  grateful that you're both here this morning.  What's on your mind?  What's  most important in your mind right now?</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  I'm still reeling over what the republicans have done to run up  government spending.  I see a lot of good economic news, the GDP but the  government component in the run up and spending, I think it's going to  hamper the economy, I really do.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  $300 billion in spending.</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  It's a ridiculous number, you can't justify it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Yes, we'll talk more about that.  Mary, how about you?</p><p>KISSEL:  Yes.  Well I think they're on a shirt high because as you said,  you've got the four quarter GDP number coming out and say goodbye to the  new normal of two percent that turns out that America can grow much faster  than that.</p><p>But I think unfortunately republicans are taking that message to as you say  give back on the sugar high of government spending, not a good idea.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No.  We've been talking about that a lot for sure because now  we're talking about $1 trillion deficits from here on out.</p><p>KISSEL:  Yes we are.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KISSEL:  And we'll talk about it as the morning rolls on too.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Again, watching those yields, those yields going up to close and  above 2.9 percent yesterday on that testimony from Jay Powell.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Tough day.  We expected what he said though, so I don't know  why the markets were surprised.  We knew he was going to talk about higher  interest rates and the return of inflation.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Maybe sometimes investors need a hammer over the head so to  speak and that was it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll see about that.  Three hundred points lower yesterday,  this morning a bit of a bounce.  </p><p>Joining the conversation this morning, the CEO of Bayer is with me, Werner  Baumann is here talking about lots of news this morning in the drug  industry.  White House Deputy Press Secretary Hogan Gidley is with us.   Former RNC Chair and Founding Partner of the DGR Group, Haley Barbour joins  us.  Kentucky Congressman Andy Barr is here.  And Dr. Mikhail Varshavski  AKA Dr. Mike also joining us this morning.  </p><p>You don't want to miss moments of it so do stay with us.  And we kick it  off here with the top story, markets taking a hit yesterday after a new  Federal Reserve chairman Jay Powell delivered an upbeat assessments of the  U.S. economy on Capitol Hill leading investors to expect higher interest  rates.  Of course, the biggest economic news on the DACA today is the  second estimate of fourth quarter GDP.</p><p>It's expected to come in at two and a half percent, that would be down 0.1  of a percent from the initial expectation.  Your reaction to what we heard  from Jay Powell yesterday Mary in terms of what he said, what that means  from where we are today.</p><p>KISSLER:  Well the Federal Reserve always underestimates GDP growth in the  economy and they always under estimate the impact of tax cuts Maria.   They're also always behind the curve when it comes to inflation  expectations.</p><p>Jay Powell was not picked because he was an aggressive Fed chairman, Jay  Powell was picked because he was somebody that the White House liked and  thought wouldn't rock the boat.  So I think what you're going to see out of  him is, again, a very reasonable and predictable rate rise.  Whether or not  that leads them behind the curve, who knows, the bigger challenge and Dagen  and I were talking about this off air is what they're going to do with this  mega balance sheet that the Federal Reserve has accumulated?</p><p>We've never seen that in the history of the Federal Reserve before, it's a  big experiment and the question is, can the Federal Reserve get rid of that  balance sheet without turning the market upside down.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  The idea of unwinding $4.5 trillion Dagen.  We've talked about  it before, $50 billion a month, at some point we'll get there.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Coupled with the idea that we may see now four interest rate  hikes spook in markets.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  The market yesterday began fact -- this has been  discussed widely about four interest rate hikes this year but Futures  contracts linked to the Central Bank's rate policies yesterday showed one  third of a probability that it's going to move four times this year.</p><p>But it's the great unknown of the Fed -- I think the balance sheet will  shrink about $400 billion this year, $420 billion with the final quarter at  $50 billion will be rolling off in mortgage and Treasury securities.  But  this has put even more pressure on markets and on the Federal Reserve  because of what the republicans have done.</p><p>I don't disagree with the tax reform, I don't believe that it's going to  cost north of a $1 trillion.  I think because of the faster growth, because  of the higher tax receipts you've already seen in January.  However,  republicans make this pressure on the Fed worst and on the bond market  because they increased spending by $300 billion over to your period.   You're ramping up the supply of Treasury debt at a time when one major  source of the demand over the last 10 years is going away and that's  problematic. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  When Paul Ryan joined me two weeks ago Jason, one thing  he kept saying is, \"You've got to give to get.\"  Well you were in that seat  before, what would you have done had you been faced with a situation of,  \"OK, we need to spend this money on the military.  We need new money on --  for military and recover what's been happened from sequestration but, I'm  being held hostage by doing all this other stuff spending elsewhere.\"</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  Well look, if you look at what Chuck Schumer got, he got  everything that he wanted.  What did the republicans get in that deal?   They didn't get anything.  There was a 13 percent increase in domestic  spending and Rand Paul was absolutely right when he said, \"When we had $1  dollar deficits and it was Obama in the White House, we were all up and  arms.\"  And suddenly, now it's President Trump and we're OK with it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  They didn't do anything to curve that and for Paul Ryan to say,  \"Well now we're going to turn our attention to entitlement reform.\"  Come  on, there's no way you're getting this 60 votes on entitlement reform.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Not this year.</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  No.  There's no way to do it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But some of the things that they put money to, Dagen, you  mentioned it, what, the abstinence spending.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  $150 billion -- excuse me, million dollars for abstinence  education (INAUDIBLE) with social conservatives but it was billions of  dollars a year for child care, for health --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Community centers.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  For community health centers.  And I'll point to this because  this is in the news today, I think it was $6 billion to fight the opioid  crisis --</p><p>KISSEL:  Yes, that's it.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- when they had poultry little evidence of how that money has  been spend, it's already been allocated and how this be spent.  Like the --  you need proof of outcomes when you start throwing billions of dollars at a  problem.</p><p>KISSEL:  Yes.  But, again, I wonder about the political environment here  because President Trump wants to do a deal and I feel like Paul Ryan's  biggest worry is that democrats are going to go to the president and say,  \"Just spend a little more.  You'll be more popular.  We can do a deal  together.\"</p><p>And so Paul Ryan just took over what's in front of him because he didn't  want something that was even worst.</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  But I -- when did it become the new normal and totally  acceptable that for every dollar rise in defense spending, you have to  raise domestic spending.  There was no justification to raise the domestic  spending, you could make a case on the military but, again, I don't think  we went out and said, \"Hey, we need a new carrier group, we have to have  missile defense.\"  We never had that discussion in this country.  That bill  came about three and a half days.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Well let's worry now and like I said to Paul Ryan, now  it's in your face in terms of markets reacting to higher interest rates,  what that means for the debt.</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  And they still have to fund the government on March 23rd.  So  remember, they funded part of the military but they still have to go back  and actually pass a funding pill later in March.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And to -- we'll talk about the \"Wall Street Journal\" Editorial  page, Mary Kissel, because, again, it's -- the fact republicans won't fix  the entitlements that we have where one in five Americans is on Medicaid,  Medicare, and Social Security.</p><p>But now you have the likes of Senators Mike Lee and Marco Rubio talking  about this new entitlement joining arms with Ivanka Trump on paid family  leave federally mandated.  So, again, to call yourself a conservative is a  joke.</p><p>KISSEL:  Yes.  And rating the entitlements by the way propose (INAUDIBLE)  entitlements to pay for that.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>KISSEL:  There's a free lunch entitlement according to those two senators  which was just ridiculous.  Look Dagen, I think it's very disheartening,  republicans had a chance to have a major entitlement reform last week with  healthcare but they simply couldn't explain what the program was.</p><p>They had gone out and actually, I don't know, had three bullet points and  said, \"Hey America, do you want to make entitlements to give into the  people who actually need them instead of able bodied adults?  I think  Americans would have gotten behind that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Because most people recognize this is where the growth and  spending and that these programs are going out of business.  They are --  they're going broke.</p><p>KISSLER:  Yes, they are -- it's entitlements.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We're going to take a break.  When we comeback,  students are returning to school in Florida.  This morning, we're going to  speak with one of the students, a survivor.</p><p>Then scary moments out of Virginia Military Base after the contents of  mysterious envelops causes several people to get sick, we got the details  on that investigation.  </p><p>Then a first on Fox Business interview, I'm one-on-one with Bayer CEO  Werner Baumann.  We will talk about the company's $8 billion for U.S.  investment.  Back in a moments right here.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Another police officer shot in the line of duty,  this time in Idaho.  Lauren Simonetti with the details and headlines now,  Lauren.</p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FBN REPORTER:  Good morning Maria.  The suspected gunman  was shot and killed in the shootout.  Police say the shooter had a felony  warrant for his arrest, began firing at officers when they approached him.</p><p>All this happened near the Idaho, Washington state line, east of Spokane.   The officer hit with the bullet went into surgery, the police chief says he  was up and talking with other officers.</p><p>Well, 11 people including several marines sickened yesterday after a  suspicious letter was opened at Marine Corps headquarters near the  Pentagon.  Three people were taken to the hospital listed in stable  condition.  The envelope which contained an unknown substance was mailed to  joint base Myer Henderson in Virginia.  It's been sent to the FBI's lab and  Quantico for testing.  The building was evacuated, it is not clear at this  point who sent that letter.</p><p>Well, evidence now emerging that North Korea is profiting from the civil  war in Syria.  \"Confidential United Nations\" report says that North Korea  shipped 50 tons of supplies to Syria for using building, what it suspected  to be a chemical weapons factory.  The U.S. has accused Syria of using  chemical weapons in rebel controlled areas including recently in a suburb  of Damascus.</p><p>Meanwhile, take a look at these new satellite photos.  They show Iran  establishing another base in Syria.  Intelligence sources telling Fox News  that the base outside of Syria's capital is complete with hangers used to  store missiles capable of hitting Israel.</p><p>And in business, Amazon is buying a ring in a deal reportedly valued at  over $1 billion.  Amazon is expanding its home security business.  Ring  makes Wi-Fi connected cameras and doorbells.  This coming after Amazon  launched its own security carmeras which worked with its -- boy, this isn't  Alexa.  Ring devices capture a video that can be screened on smart phones.   And I guess you can tell if someone's going to steal your packages when  they're at your doorstep.</p><p>Look at Amazon shares, they're moving up half a percent, 15.19 in the  premarket, this is the stock that's up in the past year almost 80 percent,  Maria.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, that's a good line that you can watch if anyone is trying  to steal your packages.  It's true, you're right.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  Get off my door step.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's an interesting acquisition.  I like this company.  I've  always liked the idea that you can just go on your phone and see who's at  your doorbell.  What do you think Dagen?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I think that they've done a great job of advertising where the  millennials are.  You will hear these ring advertisements on Podcasts  galore.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Really?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And I'm a voracious consumer of Podcast.  So they've done an  incredible job and they've been able to grow their business despite some  naysayers. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Amazon keeps on expanding.</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  I use the vivid system (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You do?  OK.</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  And I can watch right now, I can see what's going on and it  automatically takes clips.  Somebody who rings my doorbell, they walk up  and it buzzes me on my phone, so I know anytime.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I like that.</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  And my kids realized when you have a system like this, it's not  as much about keeping people from the outside getting in, as it is also to  keeping them inside from getting out.  And we have a teenager, that's a  good system. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That is great.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I don't -- I don't think I want to know what's going on in  Brooklyn in the middle of the night, actually.  So, I do not have one of  these systems.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, it looks good.  I think it's the whole technology around  safety and security and being able to look at all your doors that on your  phone is pretty interesting.  And it's interesting that Amazon is acquiring  it. </p><p>All right, we are going to take a break.  When we come back, students at  Stoneman Douglas high school returning to class today.  Exactly, two weeks  after 17 people were killed.  I will talk to one of the students on his  thoughts about going back and the expectations for school safety now.  </p><p>The investors are expecting growth of 2.5 percent when we get the second  quarter -- the second reading for the fourth quarter GDP later this  morning.  We will see how the markets react.  Futures right now, indicating  a gain at the start of trading.  These are the high of the morning right  here, up 50 points on the Dow Jones Industrial average.  We'll be right  back.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back, fourth-quarter earnings from Bayer just out this  morning.  The German drug maker and agriculture giant misexpectations on  revenue due in part to a head from U.S. tax reform.  The stock sell to a 15  month low on the news.  And joining us right now, for the first time on FOX  NEWS's interview is the CEO of Bayer, Werner Baumann.  Werner, it's good to  have you on the program this morning.  Thank you so much.</p><p>WERNER BAUMANN, CEO, BAYER:  Hi, Maria. Good morning. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let me kick it off with the quarter.  Can you tell us what  growth -- the growth in the quarter, what would you say was the standout  this last three months?</p><p>BAUMANN:  Well, we've seen -- as we've seen in the entire year.  A very  good performance in pharma, so sales in pharma advanced again by roughly  four percent.  If you look at our key growth product, so blood thinner,  Xarelto, Eylea, then some of our cancer products, all of them have done  well both in quarter four but for also the entire year.  So, our pharma  business had another record here.  Quite frankly, the other businesses,  things did not go down well in 2017.  </p><p>So consumer is a difficult business in particular in the U.S. and then in  crop we had significant oversupply in the market in Brazil that our crop  protection products as our competitors as well.  We had to cleanse the  situation in quarter two and have since made very good progress I have to  say in getting the situation under control and actually advancing again.   So we are quite optimistic for our crop business going into 2018. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, I want to talk about the consumer business.  You say that  it was -- it was a little under pressure in the U.S. That's interesting to  know, given that the economics in the U.S. have been improving.  But let me  start with you $66 billion deal to acquire Monsanto.  We are waiting on  approvals from European regulators and the U.S. The company's hoping this  deal will close this year.  But I guess, are you expecting the approval in  the second quarter?  From the E.U.?</p><p>BAUMANN:  Yes, Maria.  Based on where we are right now, we've seen very,  very good progress.  This by now, roughly half of the 30 approvals we need.   They are in very good discussions after say that the European Commission  making good progress there and also that the DOJ.  Even though with the  DOJ, we are a little bit behind the process where we are with the European  Commission.  But overall, as you have mentioned, that we are quite  confident, that we are going to close this on section in the second  quarter.  And that we will also obtain the approvals necessary to do so.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, as we wait for the E.U. approval sometime in the second  quarter, what are the plans in terms of divestitures, in terms of raising  money once you get that approval?  Are you expecting to do a secondary  offering of right to issue once you get that approval?</p><p>BAUMANN:  Yes, Maria.  First of all, looking at the divestitures we have  already announced actually in October -- mid-October last year, that a very  large part of our buyers, seat business and our non-selective herbicides  platform.  Delivered to link product lines are going to be divested to  BISF.  Of course, always contingent on the over transaction coming to a  closing.  And we continue to be in discussion so that, with some select  further areas that are in the interest of the regulators also to strengthen  overall competition, also innovation competition in our industry.  That  discussion is over all regardless whether you look at the Europeans or the  Department of Justice.  Very constructive, we have recently announced also  today in our call that we are now also going to divest of our vegetable  seeds business.  I cannot at this point in time say that this is what's it  going to be because these discussions are still on going.  </p><p>On the same question regarding the financing, this is going to be a mix of  equity and debt.  So that we have already mentioned that based on the very  good sales proceeds on the divestiture of our (INAUDIBLE) at stake, the --  these need less equity than we had expected, but there's still will be a  rise offering here. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I see, I see.  Now you and several other European business  leaders took part in a round table discussion with President Trump in Davos  last month.  I know the President said that he is a fan of the company, but  let me ask you this, in terms of your expectations in terms of investments  in the United States, tell us what that looks like and what do you think is  behind this weakness that you just mentioned in terms of the consumer in  the U.S?</p><p>BAUMANN:  Well, first of all, we have been in the U.S. for more than 150  years and we have great interest in also advancing on business but the  overall economy in the U.S. and we will do our fair share in contributing.   Regarding with my encounters with President Trump, I have to say that both  party were very well-informed and well briefed.  Got a good discussion  along the lines of what we have already communicated on hat this  combination is going to be about and of course he's a very loyal customer  of the aspirin, which is always nice to see.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, for sure.  And -- but did you say that the consumer  business is weak in the U.S. right now?</p><p>BAUMANN:  Yes, the consumer business overall is actually impact that the  cross actually also our competitors business by fairly dramatic and record  change in consumer behaviors.  The stronger advance of online buying with  that less (INAUDIBLE) if you look at the you know, stationary retail, DR,  abducting to live.  We need to do this faster.  We also need to step up our  innovation capabilities and that is what we are working on.  But clearly  2017 was not a good year for our consumer business.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, we will leave it there.  Werner, and it's good to  have you on the program.  Great to see you, thanks so much for joining us  this morning.</p><p>BAUMANN:  Thank you, thank you, Maria. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Werner Baumann there, CEO at Bayer.  Coming up, TSA bomb  detection goes from airports to underground.  The agency testing new  equipment for train stations that could detect a potential suicide bomber.   This coming after a failed attack in a New York subway last year.  </p><p>And then Apple and Amazon they are the undisputed leaders in the tech  industry in the market.  But who's up next?  You might be surprised by what  and where the next big tech titan comes from.  Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Wednesday morning, everybody, thanks so  much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Wednesday, February  28th, your top stories right now, 6:30 a.m. on the East Coast.  Stocks  looking to rebound this morning, take a look at Futures, indicating a gain  at the start of trading of about 40 points, NASDAQ, S&amp;P 500, also positive.   We are waiting on the second reading of the fourth quarter GDP.  </p><p>Economists are looking for growth of 2 1/2 percent in the GDP, for the  final month of 2017, this, after markets were rattled yesterday, following  testimony from Federal Reserve Chairman, Jake Powell.  His comments  suggesting that the Central Bank may raise interest rates more than the  three times that are expected.  As a result, markets plummeted.  Dow  Industrials, yesterday, down 300 points better than one percent, NASDAQ,  S&amp;P 500 also down one and a quarter percent.  </p><p>Global markets are taking a cue from the U.S. this morning and trading  lower, FT 100, down a quarter of a percent, CAC Quarante in Paris, down a  third of a percent, DAX Index in Germany down one quarter of a percent.   Similar story in Asia overnight, declines across the board, worst performer  was Hong Kong, down 1 1/2 percent on the Hang Seng.  </p><p>A new layer of security to report, the TSA is now testing new technology to  detect suicide vests, how it works, coming up.  President Trump, one step  closer to fulfilling another campaign promise.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Do not worry.  We are going  to build the wall, OK?  Don't worry.  Don't even think about it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  A judge ruling in favor of the administration, allowing  construction plans to begin for the border wall.  And the White House  changing its tune on trade, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, now  suggesting President Trump may negotiate a return to the Trans-Pacific  Partnership, the details, coming up.  Then, the world's largest plane, one  step closer to its first passenger flight, more on the latest milestone for  the jet that's backed by Paul Allen, all that coming up.  </p><p>But first, this top story this half an hour, students will return to  Marjory Stoneman Douglas High  School this morning, two weeks, after the shooting, 17 students and  teachers were killed on that Valentine's Day massacre.  Joining me right  now is a survivor of the shooting, Junior Kyle Kashuv, Kyle, thank you so  much for being with us this morning.</p><p>KYLE KASHUV, JUNIOR, MARJORY STONEMAN DOUGLAS HIGH SCHOOL:  Thank you for  having me, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  First, we all want to say our condolences.  Our hearts go out  to you and your families and all of your friends and colleagues there at  High School.  How do you feel about going back to school today?</p><p>KASHUV:  I mean, it's really sad coming back to school, but then, it's also  really exciting to meet my peers and to be able to connect once again at  school.  I am optimistic that -- I'm optimistic going back to school.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're optimistic about going back to school?  Have you spoken  to your friends about it?  I mean, do you think it's the right time now?   It's two weeks.</p><p>KASHUV:  I think it's the right time.  I mean, everyone is still saddened  by what happened but, we understand that.  We still have to return to  school and there's no other time better than now, to do so.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Of course, of course.  Now, the calls for Sheriff Scott  Israel's resignation are growing louder.  What's your take on this?  The  Broward County Sheriff has said, he will not step down.  Listen to what he  said.  I want to get your reaction.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SCOTT ISRAEL, SHERIFF, BROWARD COUNTY:  I can only take responsibility for  what I knew about.  I exercise my due diligence.  I've given amazing  leadership to this age --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Amazing leadership?</p><p>ISRALE:  I've worked -- yes.  And, of course, I won't resign.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Kyle?</p><p>KASHUV:  I this it's a completely -- I think it's completely, like,  understandable that we realize that how (INAUDIBLE) it is that the Broward  Sheriff's Department failed on so many different levels and they didn't act  properly.  And I think that it is a representation of his leadership.  He  has to be held accountable for the inaction of the Broward Sheriff's  Department.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Jason Chaffetz.</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  Kyle, hi, this is Jason Chaffetz.  God bless you.  I can't  imagine what it's like for you and your, you know, fellow students to go  back to school, but, you know, there are --</p><p>KASHUV:  Thank you.</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  In different schools, they have people that you, kind of, really  worried about and concerned about.  Do you think that video games and stuff  that you see in the media and the movies, do you think that affects some of  your classmates there?</p><p>KASHUV:  No, I really don't think that video games have a, somewhat, even  slightly an effect on children and the way they act, they really don't,  because we can clearly tell reality from video games, there's a clear  divide.</p><p>KISSEL:  Kyle, it's Mary Kissel here.  I just want to echo what Maria and  Jason said that our thoughts and prayers are with you and the other  students.  A lot of the talk has been about things like gun control and  school safety, that yet, it's clear that there were breakdowns on many  levels, particularly in the mental health system, very, very difficult for  someone like the shooter, to get the help that he needs.  I think he even  called and asked for help at one point.  Has that been part of the  discussion between you and your classmates?  Is that gaining any traction  down there?</p><p>KASHUV:  It is.  I figured we definitely understand that we have a lacking  in the department for emotional support at our schools.  And right now, we  clearly see a lot of movement and legislation that trying to enact that.   I'm -- right now, I'm working on an app developing, to allow moms to,  maybe, volunteer at schools for emotional support and since we're so  understaffed.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Kyle, it's Dagen McDowell, has this school stepped up and said  that they're going to provide counselling to you and your fellow students  if you want it, having been traumatized, obviously, going through such a  traumatic event that most of us can't even -- can't even comprehend?</p><p>KASHUV: Really, the entire community has stepped up, and there were support  counselling at the Portland YMCA, and it was really helpful to a lot of my  friends.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And Kyle, you've called yourself a conservative, right?  And as  a supporter -- </p><p>KASHUV:  Yes, Ma'am.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  of the second amendment?  Has this impact --</p><p>KASHUV:  Yes, Ma'am.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Has this incident impacted your views?</p><p>KASHUV:  It's only slightly.  I still believe in the second amendment and  its importance to our nation.  I really -- it's dissatisfying to see the  Never Again Movement, slightly switched from simply making sure that this  will never happen again to gun control, but at the end of the day, I still  think that the entire community and the Never Again Movement, is still  heavily pushing to make sure that school shootings will be a thing in the  past.  And I really -- I'm really happy to see the entire community come  together as a bipartisan issue to work for a better change. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, especially since there were so many signs and signals that  were there and were missed.  Do -- had you ever seen or heard about Nikolas  Cruz?  And obviously, he was told don't come back (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>KASHUV:  Up until this incident --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I'm sorry?</p><p>KASHUV:  Up until, like, the school shooting, I had never known of his  existence but my friends did.  I had some friends that were in class with  him, and they always told -- they told me now, that they always knew  something was off about him.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What did they say about him?  What did -- what did people know  about him?</p><p>KASHUV:  They said that he was -- he was an outcast.  He wasn't really  understood.  They considered him somewhat of a weirdo, if I could quote.   He didn't have a lot of friends, but no one ever thought that he would do  such a thing.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  So, the Governor, Rick Scott, has some proposals on the  table for the state, including arming teachers, administrators.  Listen to  this.  I want to get your reaction.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GOV. RICK SCOTT (R), FLORIDA:  My plan is to spend $500 million to make our  school safe, to invest dollars in mental illness to make sure this never  happens again.  We need to increase the collaboration between our local  sheriffs, our police departments, our schools, Department of Children and  Families and DJJ.  We have got to make sure we have an increased law  enforcement presence in all of our schools.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So Kyle, what do you think about those ideas?  I mean, a minute  ago, you said you would like to see mothers volunteer.  Would you want to  see teachers armed?</p><p>KASHUV:  I think, that simply proposing that, here -- I think it's really  complex issue.  And in certain counties, there's a response time of maybe,  like. 15 minutes for the police to reach the school.  And studies show that  the first shots in a school shooting, only in five minutes, so practically,  the school is unarmed for 15 minutes and unable to defend themselves, and  simply, like, giving teachers the opportunity to, like, defend their  students, is a good thing.  And all levels of the school system in that  county, have to allow the teacher, and the teacher himself or herself has  to voluntarily do the training to be able to carry a gun at school.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Kyle, where were you when you first learned there was an active  shooter in school?</p><p>KASHUV:  I was in a very close adjacent building.  And in the beginning, I  thought that it was -- it didn't sound like gun shots at all because they  were so muffled, but I later realized that because it's in the freshman  building, they sounded muffled.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And what happened?  What did you -- what were you told?  Can  you walk us through it?</p><p>KASHUV:  Yes, ma'am.  So, I was in my last period class, and there was a  fire drill, so I was gradually walking out, and then, I didn't want to  leave the classroom and then I heard (INAUDIBLE) announcement saying,  evacuate immediately.  We evacuated immediately into the main hallway, and  then we heard two pops.  I didn't think it was gunshots.  </p><p>People started panicking, so I want to run back into my teacher's  classroom, and he closed the door on me.  He closed the door on, like, a  few of my fellow students and he wouldn't let us in, which he followed a  procedure, he did.  He feels terrible for what he did but it's completely  understandable because he had no idea who the shooter was.  </p><p>So, then we quickly ran to another teacher's room and she piled us in  there.  We then -- we hid in the closet for two hours and then constantly,  we were getting feeds from our friends and our family were contacting us  and everyone was hysterically crying, and I was trying to calm everyone  down.  Then, it took a while for SWAT to come get us because we've such a  big campus.  They had to take a while to clear it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How do think things change at the school now?</p><p>KASHUV:  Can you repeat that?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How do you think things will change now, at the school?</p><p>KASHUV:  I think, now, a little -- like, as of right now, there's going to  be a bigger police presence on campus, but sadly, I don't think that  anything is going to really change in the next coming week.  I think  everything is going to stay the same.  I don't think that we're going to  have -- the only thing -- the only difference, we're going to have  increased security by police office.  I don't think that anything,  specifically, other than that, will change in the security at our school.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Kyle.  We appreciate you joining us this morning.   We all send love --</p><p>KASHUV:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  and support to you and all of your friends and colleagues at  the school.  Kyle, good luck going back today, thank you.</p><p>KASHUV:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Kyle Kashuv, joining us there.  Coming up, immigration  crackdown despite a heads up from the mayor, ICE officials has arrested  more than 150 illegal immigrants in a sweep in a California Sanctuary City.   We're going to talk about that and why she gave the heads up to the  criminals, and then, a major new milestone for the world's largest plane,  details, coming up, back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back, TSA, Transportation Security Administration,  testing technology, now, in New York City that detects suicide vests,  Lauren Simonetti with all the details, now, Lauren.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  Pretty unbelievable, Maria, those tests taking place this week  with Amtrak at New York's Penn Station, the move, coming after that failed  pipe bomb attempt in a subway passage way back in December.  That was just  a couple blocks from Penn station.  This vest detection technology uses  special cameras that can scan for explosive devices, but the TSA says the  equipment can see through clothing, no privacy concerns because the image  is animated.  </p><p>Well, a massive ICE sweep in Northern California, more than 150 illegal  immigrants taken into custody despite warnings from the mayor of Oakland.   The top ice officials said the mayor's warning lightly gave criminals a  chance to escape.  The agency is now asking the Department of Justice to  look into whether she violated any laws with that warning.</p><p>Meanwhile, big win for President Trump and his border wall.  A federal  judge ruling against an environmental challenge to the wall, saying  Congress and the President share responsibilities to protect the country.   Border wall construction plans can now move forward.</p><p>While there is a chance that the U.S. may rejoin the Transpacific  Partnership or the TPP.  Treasury Secretary, Steve Mnuchin, says  renegotiation is on the table and that he's been in talks with other  countries about what it would take for the us to recommit.  President Trump  as you know, withdrew from President Obama's signature trade agreement last  year but Secretary Steve Mnuchin adding rejoining is not a priority for the  administration at the moment.  </p><p>And a new way to launch satellite into outer space, now the Strata Launch - - the world's largest airplane which can reach a speed of 46 miles an hour  on the taxiway, that's a big deal.  It's has a wingspan of 385 feet.  It  can carry 100,000 pounds.  It's designed to bring rockets to the  stratosphere for a more affordable launch for a low orbit satellites.  The  Strata Launch could make its first test flight by next year.  And of  course, Maria, Microsoft Co-Founder, Paul Allen, is backing this.  This is  his company.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  All right.  Lauren, thank you so much.  I want to talk  about this testing at Penn Station.  What do you thinL?  </p><p>CHAFFETZ:  Coincidentally I was at Penn Station, and I saw them doing this  testing.  I think it's good technology.  Let's remember that the Pentagon  spent more than $20 billion trying to figure out how to identify,  improvised explosive devices.  And you know what, the single best way to do  it is, dogs.  We can have all the technology we want, we need more dogs,  because dogs can find these things, they're mobile, and they're the best  deterrent that we have.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We now have smart dogs or so, yes, I agree with that.  </p><p>KISSEL:  Should we be more concerned about the TSA?  And I was looking at  some of these tests that they do, where they try to get bombmaking  materials through the security at airports, and they fail the majority of  the time, the overwhelming majority of the time.  Is that an agency that  needs more congressional oversight?  </p><p>CHAFFETZ:  It does and they need to look at the priority.  Because you know  what, dogs, they don't have lobbyists, but the people that sell these  machines, by the hundreds of millions of dollars, they do have lobbyists.   And often times, they're deploying technology that doesn't work.  The  Pentagon doesn't send this technology overseas, they don't have this  technology at the White House.  When you walk in to go into the oval  office, you don't go through this machine, you walk by a dog.  That's why  they use them it's because they're the most effective things.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Very deterrent, but by the way, I know you know this but $0.60  of the TSA fee that we pay when we fly, $0.60 of the $5.60 goes to deficit  reduction.  There is a billion-and-a half-dollars-plus being diverted for  deficit reduction rather than it being spent on actual airport security  every year.  </p><p>KISSEL:  You wonder where all that money goes, you know, when you go  through JFK or LaGuardia, you see all these people standing around, are  they really looking out for our security?  Is that a crack force that's  going to find the next bomb?  </p><p>CHAFFETZ:  Security badges that airports biggest thing.  There are 13,000  people with a security badge at Dulles airport in Washington D.C.  One of  those people slipping by at the wrong time, and you got a real problem.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And a TSA agent smacked my dog in the face by an accident,  because he messing with it in August.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's incredible.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, so, that's what they're busy doing.  Hitting fluffy, little  15-pound animals.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That was Charlie.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, I'm not joking.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I'm sorry to hear that.  We'll take break.  When we come back,  the rise of the new Silicon Valley; how the Middle East is giving its  California tech mecca a run for its money and market share.  We're going to  take a look.  Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Now, the latest in Silicon Valley, Apple shares hitting all- time high yesterday.  Take a look, 178.50 is where the stock is now, up 30  percent this past year.  Netflix is still driving the so-called fang stocks  already up better than 45 percent this year.  Joining us right now to talk  more about tech and where the growth in the world is today is Chemi Peres,  Chairman of the Peres Center for Peace and Innovation, and Managing General  Partner of Pitango Venture Capital.  Chemi, good to see you.  Thanks so  much for joining us.  </p><p>CHEMI PERES, CHAIRMAN, PERES CENTER FOR PEACE AND INNOVATION AND MANAGING  GENERAL PARTNER OF PITANGO VENTURE CAPITAL:  Good to see you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Tell us what you're doing at Pitango and where you see growth  in terms of innovation in the world today.  You've been investing in a  number of areas in tech.  </p><p>PERES:  For the best 25 years, we've been investing in Israeli technology,  we're investing at growth stage, at early-stage, and incubation.  And I  think that the great thing that we're seeing; number one, probably, is  cybersecurity, where it is a great concern around the world.  Terrorism is  globalized, so we are taking care of that.  Secondly, there's tremendous  innovation in A.I., machine learning, and deep learning to connect devices  and machines to the Internet, to create new services.  Thirdly, most likely  is a precision medicine to help us get better and earlier.  </p><p>And probably, I would say, in addition to those kinds of innovations, we're  seeing also the attempt to decentralize the currency systems, to give it  more freedom through blockchain technologies.  And I think that what you've  seen right now in terms of the share prices, you see that the greatest  companies today in the world are technology companies pushing away, you  know, oil, and gas, and chemicals, and construction. So, we are moving to a  new world.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We sure are.</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  Artificial intelligence is a big promise.  There's a lot of good  that can be done, there's also a lot of bad that can be done with  artificial intelligence.  So, where do you see that going, and how do we  control it or does it need to be controlled?  </p><p>PERES:  So, first of all, you are very much right.  Technology without  moral values is very dangerous, so we have to develop more values.  One of  the trends that we're seeing also in the investment space, is that people  are trying to achieve double bottom line, make progress on technology, but  at the same time, make the world safer by using technology for the better.   And I think this is a great challenge that human beings are facing in the  next 10 to 20 years.  </p><p>KISSEL:  Chemi, should we be thinking about Israel is the second Silicon  Valley?  And for investors out there that are sick of the fang stocks here  in the United States, you know, what are the companies that they should be  looking at over there?  </p><p>PERES:  So, I think you shouldn't look at it as a second Silicon Valley,  you should look at it as a first innovation nation.  It's a nation that  both created not from the land but from the mind.  Everything that happen  in Israel was not build upon the land.  We cannot use the land for natural  resources for food or water.  Everything that we do, state foundation,  security, economy, and peace-building is only with our brain.  So, you  should think of Israel as an empire of the mind, as a model for nations  that would like to transition themselves from the old world where they rely  on the land, to the new world which is limitless based on the brain power.   That's the way you need to look at it.</p><p>KISSEL:  Companies?  Any companies?</p><p>PERES:  Companies, probably the biggest company now emerging is  Technologies Checkpoint, which is doing security, and other great company,  I would say, is the company that Intel-acquired Mobile Eye, which now is  turning to be a center for autonomous driving in Israel.  But you know, we  have 7,000 companies in Israel, and probably five percent of them are  emerging as new, great ideas.  And I think that in the next 10 years, we'll  see tremendous number of Israeli companies really changing the world.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Your father used to talk about this a lot.  The late great  Shimon Peres, which talks about Israel as this hub for innovation.  Why is  that?  Why has Israel been able to really compete with the best of the best  in terms of innovation and technology growth?  </p><p>PERES:  So, as I said there, Maria, basically, you cannot build anything,  because we have -- on the land, because our land is so small, it does not  provide any shelter, no food, no water.  So, we had to build everything on  our brain power.  So, number one is necessity, and the second thing I think  is the notion that Israel wants to make the world better, to change the  world for better.  My father would say, most likely, that our biggest  contribution for human beings is dissatisfaction; we're never satisfied  with everything.  So, we need to check everything with technology.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I like that.  Great.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  By the way, the president announced, obviously, his future  plans with the City of Jerusalem back in December of 2017 to move the  embassy to Jerusalem.  You're happy with this decision, obviously?  </p><p>PERES:  Obviously, I'm very happy.  Not everything that is done for Israel  is necessarily bad for other people.  That should've been done in 1947 when  Israel was established as a nation.  Celebrating our 70th anniversary.  I  think it's a great present to fix what was wrong.  It should have been,  from day one, our capital.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Chemi, it's good to see you.  </p><p>PERES:  Good to see you, too.  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Chemi Peres.  We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Wednesday morning, everybody.  Thanks so  much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Wednesday, February  28th.  </p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

Great to see you.  </p><p>MARY KISSEL, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Good morning Maria, thanks for having  us.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, good morning to you.</p><p>JASON CHAFFETZ, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Good morning.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN ANCHOR:  When I saw the guests was yesterday, \"I can't  wait to hear what Mary and Jason have to say.  So that means I'm going to  stifle.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  No, we don't want that.  We don't want -- but it's true, we're  grateful that you're both here this morning.  What's on your mind?  What's  most important in your mind right now?</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  I'm still reeling over what the republicans have done to run up  government spending.  I see a lot of good economic news, the GDP but the  government component in the run up and spending, I think it's going to  hamper the economy, I really do.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  $300 billion in spending.</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  It's a ridiculous number, you can't justify it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Yes, we'll talk more about that.  Mary, how about you?</p><p>KISSEL:  Yes.  Well I think they're on a shirt high because as you said,  you've got the four quarter GDP number coming out and say goodbye to the  new normal of two percent that turns out that America can grow much faster  than that.</p><p>But I think unfortunately republicans are taking that message to as you say  give back on the sugar high of government spending, not a good idea.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No.  We've been talking about that a lot for sure because now  we're talking about $1 trillion deficits from here on out.</p><p>KISSEL:  Yes we are.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KISSEL:  And we'll talk about it as the morning rolls on too.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Again, watching those yields, those yields going up to close and  above 2.9 percent yesterday on that testimony from Jay Powell.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Tough day.  We expected what he said though, so I don't know  why the markets were surprised.  We knew he was going to talk about higher  interest rates and the return of inflation.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Maybe sometimes investors need a hammer over the head so to  speak and that was it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll see about that.  Three hundred points lower yesterday,  this morning a bit of a bounce.  </p><p>Joining the conversation this morning, the CEO of Bayer is with me, Werner  Baumann is here talking about lots of news this morning in the drug  industry.  White House Deputy Press Secretary Hogan Gidley is with us.   Former RNC Chair and Founding Partner of the DGR Group, Haley Barbour joins  us.  Kentucky Congressman Andy Barr is here.  And Dr. Mikhail Varshavski  AKA Dr. Mike also joining us this morning.  </p><p>You don't want to miss moments of it so do stay with us.  And we kick it  off here with the top story, markets taking a hit yesterday after a new  Federal Reserve chairman Jay Powell delivered an upbeat assessments of the  U.S. economy on Capitol Hill leading investors to expect higher interest  rates.  Of course, the biggest economic news on the DACA today is the  second estimate of fourth quarter GDP.</p><p>It's expected to come in at two and a half percent, that would be down 0.1  of a percent from the initial expectation.  Your reaction to what we heard  from Jay Powell yesterday Mary in terms of what he said, what that means  from where we are today.</p><p>KISSLER:  Well the Federal Reserve always underestimates GDP growth in the  economy and they always under estimate the impact of tax cuts Maria.   They're also always behind the curve when it comes to inflation  expectations.</p><p>Jay Powell was not picked because he was an aggressive Fed chairman, Jay  Powell was picked because he was somebody that the White House liked and  thought wouldn't rock the boat.  So I think what you're going to see out of  him is, again, a very reasonable and predictable rate rise.  Whether or not  that leads them behind the curve, who knows, the bigger challenge and Dagen  and I were talking about this off air is what they're going to do with this  mega balance sheet that the Federal Reserve has accumulated?</p><p>We've never seen that in the history of the Federal Reserve before, it's a  big experiment and the question is, can the Federal Reserve get rid of that  balance sheet without turning the market upside down.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  The idea of unwinding $4.5 trillion Dagen.  We've talked about  it before, $50 billion a month, at some point we'll get there.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Coupled with the idea that we may see now four interest rate  hikes spook in markets.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  The market yesterday began fact -- this has been  discussed widely about four interest rate hikes this year but Futures  contracts linked to the Central Bank's rate policies yesterday showed one  third of a probability that it's going to move four times this year.</p><p>But it's the great unknown of the Fed -- I think the balance sheet will  shrink about $400 billion this year, $420 billion with the final quarter at  $50 billion will be rolling off in mortgage and Treasury securities.  But  this has put even more pressure on markets and on the Federal Reserve  because of what the republicans have done.</p><p>I don't disagree with the tax reform, I don't believe that it's going to  cost north of a $1 trillion.  I think because of the faster growth, because  of the higher tax receipts you've already seen in January.  However,  republicans make this pressure on the Fed worst and on the bond market  because they increased spending by $300 billion over to your period.   You're ramping up the supply of Treasury debt at a time when one major  source of the demand over the last 10 years is going away and that's  problematic. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  When Paul Ryan joined me two weeks ago Jason, one thing  he kept saying is, \"You've got to give to get.\"  Well you were in that seat  before, what would you have done had you been faced with a situation of,  \"OK, we need to spend this money on the military.  We need new money on --  for military and recover what's been happened from sequestration but, I'm  being held hostage by doing all this other stuff spending elsewhere.\"</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  Well look, if you look at what Chuck Schumer got, he got  everything that he wanted.  What did the republicans get in that deal?   They didn't get anything.  There was a 13 percent increase in domestic  spending and Rand Paul was absolutely right when he said, \"When we had $1  dollar deficits and it was Obama in the White House, we were all up and  arms.\"  And suddenly, now it's President Trump and we're OK with it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  They didn't do anything to curve that and for Paul Ryan to say,  \"Well now we're going to turn our attention to entitlement reform.\"  Come  on, there's no way you're getting this 60 votes on entitlement reform.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Not this year.</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  No.  There's no way to do it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But some of the things that they put money to, Dagen, you  mentioned it, what, the abstinence spending.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  $150 billion -- excuse me, million dollars for abstinence  education (INAUDIBLE) with social conservatives but it was billions of  dollars a year for child care, for health --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Community centers.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  For community health centers.  And I'll point to this because  this is in the news today, I think it was $6 billion to fight the opioid  crisis --</p><p>KISSEL:  Yes, that's it.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- when they had poultry little evidence of how that money has  been spend, it's already been allocated and how this be spent.  Like the --  you need proof of outcomes when you start throwing billions of dollars at a  problem.</p><p>KISSEL:  Yes.  But, again, I wonder about the political environment here  because President Trump wants to do a deal and I feel like Paul Ryan's  biggest worry is that democrats are going to go to the president and say,  \"Just spend a little more.  You'll be more popular.  We can do a deal  together.\"</p><p>And so Paul Ryan just took over what's in front of him because he didn't  want something that was even worst.</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  But I -- when did it become the new normal and totally  acceptable that for every dollar rise in defense spending, you have to  raise domestic spending.  There was no justification to raise the domestic  spending, you could make a case on the military but, again, I don't think  we went out and said, \"Hey, we need a new carrier group, we have to have  missile defense.\"  We never had that discussion in this country.  That bill  came about three and a half days.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Well let's worry now and like I said to Paul Ryan, now  it's in your face in terms of markets reacting to higher interest rates,  what that means for the debt.</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  And they still have to fund the government on March 23rd.  So  remember, they funded part of the military but they still have to go back  and actually pass a funding pill later in March.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And to -- we'll talk about the \"Wall Street Journal\" Editorial  page, Mary Kissel, because, again, it's -- the fact republicans won't fix  the entitlements that we have where one in five Americans is on Medicaid,  Medicare, and Social Security.</p><p>But now you have the likes of Senators Mike Lee and Marco Rubio talking  about this new entitlement joining arms with Ivanka Trump on paid family  leave federally mandated.  So, again, to call yourself a conservative is a  joke.</p><p>KISSEL:  Yes.  And rating the entitlements by the way propose (INAUDIBLE)  entitlements to pay for that.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>KISSEL:  There's a free lunch entitlement according to those two senators  which was just ridiculous.  Look Dagen, I think it's very disheartening,  republicans had a chance to have a major entitlement reform last week with  healthcare but they simply couldn't explain what the program was.</p><p>They had gone out and actually, I don't know, had three bullet points and  said, \"Hey America, do you want to make entitlements to give into the  people who actually need them instead of able bodied adults?  I think  Americans would have gotten behind that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Because most people recognize this is where the growth and  spending and that these programs are going out of business.  They are --  they're going broke.</p><p>KISSLER:  Yes, they are -- it's entitlements.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We're going to take a break.  When we comeback,  students are returning to school in Florida.  This morning, we're going to  speak with one of the students, a survivor.</p><p>Then scary moments out of Virginia Military Base after the contents of  mysterious envelops causes several people to get sick, we got the details  on that investigation.  </p><p>Then a first on Fox Business interview, I'm one-on-one with Bayer CEO  Werner Baumann.  We will talk about the company's $8 billion for U.S.  investment.  Back in a moments right here.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Another police officer shot in the line of duty,  this time in Idaho.  Lauren Simonetti with the details and headlines now,  Lauren.</p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FBN REPORTER:  Good morning Maria.  The suspected gunman  was shot and killed in the shootout.  Police say the shooter had a felony  warrant for his arrest, began firing at officers when they approached him.</p><p>All this happened near the Idaho, Washington state line, east of Spokane.   The officer hit with the bullet went into surgery, the police chief says he  was up and talking with other officers.</p><p>Well, 11 people including several marines sickened yesterday after a  suspicious letter was opened at Marine Corps headquarters near the  Pentagon.  Three people were taken to the hospital listed in stable  condition.  The envelope which contained an unknown substance was mailed to  joint base Myer Henderson in Virginia.  It's been sent to the FBI's lab and  Quantico for testing.  The building was evacuated, it is not clear at this  point who sent that letter.</p><p>Well, evidence now emerging that North Korea is profiting from the civil  war in Syria.  \"Confidential United Nations\" report says that North Korea  shipped 50 tons of supplies to Syria for using building, what it suspected  to be a chemical weapons factory.  The U.S. has accused Syria of using  chemical weapons in rebel controlled areas including recently in a suburb  of Damascus.</p><p>Meanwhile, take a look at these new satellite photos.  They show Iran  establishing another base in Syria.  Intelligence sources telling Fox News  that the base outside of Syria's capital is complete with hangers used to  store missiles capable of hitting Israel.</p><p>And in business, Amazon is buying a ring in a deal reportedly valued at  over $1 billion.  Amazon is expanding its home security business.  Ring  makes Wi-Fi connected cameras and doorbells.  This coming after Amazon  launched its own security carmeras which worked with its -- boy, this isn't  Alexa.  Ring devices capture a video that can be screened on smart phones.   And I guess you can tell if someone's going to steal your packages when  they're at your doorstep.</p><p>Look at Amazon shares, they're moving up half a percent, 15.19 in the  premarket, this is the stock that's up in the past year almost 80 percent,  Maria.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, that's a good line that you can watch if anyone is trying  to steal your packages.  It's true, you're right.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  Get off my door step.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's an interesting acquisition.  I like this company.  I've  always liked the idea that you can just go on your phone and see who's at  your doorbell.  What do you think Dagen?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I think that they've done a great job of advertising where the  millennials are.  You will hear these ring advertisements on Podcasts  galore.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Really?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And I'm a voracious consumer of Podcast.  So they've done an  incredible job and they've been able to grow their business despite some  naysayers. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Amazon keeps on expanding.</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  I use the vivid system (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You do?  OK.</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  And I can watch right now, I can see what's going on and it  automatically takes clips.  Somebody who rings my doorbell, they walk up  and it buzzes me on my phone, so I know anytime.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I like that.</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  And my kids realized when you have a system like this, it's not  as much about keeping people from the outside getting in, as it is also to  keeping them inside from getting out.  And we have a teenager, that's a  good system. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That is great.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I don't -- I don't think I want to know what's going on in  Brooklyn in the middle of the night, actually.  So, I do not have one of  these systems.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, it looks good.  I think it's the whole technology around  safety and security and being able to look at all your doors that on your  phone is pretty interesting.  And it's interesting that Amazon is acquiring  it. </p><p>All right, we are going to take a break.  When we come back, students at  Stoneman Douglas high school returning to class today.  Exactly, two weeks  after 17 people were killed.  I will talk to one of the students on his  thoughts about going back and the expectations for school safety now.  </p><p>The investors are expecting growth of 2.5 percent when we get the second  quarter -- the second reading for the fourth quarter GDP later this  morning.  We will see how the markets react.  Futures right now, indicating  a gain at the start of trading.  These are the high of the morning right  here, up 50 points on the Dow Jones Industrial average.  We'll be right  back.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back, fourth-quarter earnings from Bayer just out this  morning.  The German drug maker and agriculture giant misexpectations on  revenue due in part to a head from U.S. tax reform.  The stock sell to a 15  month low on the news.  And joining us right now, for the first time on FOX  NEWS's interview is the CEO of Bayer, Werner Baumann.  Werner, it's good to  have you on the program this morning.  Thank you so much.</p><p>WERNER BAUMANN, CEO, BAYER:  Hi, Maria. Good morning. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let me kick it off with the quarter.  Can you tell us what  growth -- the growth in the quarter, what would you say was the standout  this last three months?</p><p>BAUMANN:  Well, we've seen -- as we've seen in the entire year.  A very  good performance in pharma, so sales in pharma advanced again by roughly  four percent.  If you look at our key growth product, so blood thinner,  Xarelto, Eylea, then some of our cancer products, all of them have done  well both in quarter four but for also the entire year.  So, our pharma  business had another record here.  Quite frankly, the other businesses,  things did not go down well in 2017.  </p><p>So consumer is a difficult business in particular in the U.S. and then in  crop we had significant oversupply in the market in Brazil that our crop  protection products as our competitors as well.  We had to cleanse the  situation in quarter two and have since made very good progress I have to  say in getting the situation under control and actually advancing again.   So we are quite optimistic for our crop business going into 2018. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, I want to talk about the consumer business.  You say that  it was -- it was a little under pressure in the U.S. That's interesting to  know, given that the economics in the U.S. have been improving.  But let me  start with you $66 billion deal to acquire Monsanto.  We are waiting on  approvals from European regulators and the U.S. The company's hoping this  deal will close this year.  But I guess, are you expecting the approval in  the second quarter?  From the E.U.?</p><p>BAUMANN:  Yes, Maria.  Based on where we are right now, we've seen very,  very good progress.  This by now, roughly half of the 30 approvals we need.   They are in very good discussions after say that the European Commission  making good progress there and also that the DOJ.  Even though with the  DOJ, we are a little bit behind the process where we are with the European  Commission.  But overall, as you have mentioned, that we are quite  confident, that we are going to close this on section in the second  quarter.  And that we will also obtain the approvals necessary to do so.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, as we wait for the E.U. approval sometime in the second  quarter, what are the plans in terms of divestitures, in terms of raising  money once you get that approval?  Are you expecting to do a secondary  offering of right to issue once you get that approval?</p><p>BAUMANN:  Yes, Maria.  First of all, looking at the divestitures we have  already announced actually in October -- mid-October last year, that a very  large part of our buyers, seat business and our non-selective herbicides  platform.  Delivered to link product lines are going to be divested to  BISF.  Of course, always contingent on the over transaction coming to a  closing.  And we continue to be in discussion so that, with some select  further areas that are in the interest of the regulators also to strengthen  overall competition, also innovation competition in our industry.  That  discussion is over all regardless whether you look at the Europeans or the  Department of Justice.  Very constructive, we have recently announced also  today in our call that we are now also going to divest of our vegetable  seeds business.  I cannot at this point in time say that this is what's it  going to be because these discussions are still on going.  </p><p>On the same question regarding the financing, this is going to be a mix of  equity and debt.  So that we have already mentioned that based on the very  good sales proceeds on the divestiture of our (INAUDIBLE) at stake, the --  these need less equity than we had expected, but there's still will be a  rise offering here. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I see, I see.  Now you and several other European business  leaders took part in a round table discussion with President Trump in Davos  last month.  I know the President said that he is a fan of the company, but  let me ask you this, in terms of your expectations in terms of investments  in the United States, tell us what that looks like and what do you think is  behind this weakness that you just mentioned in terms of the consumer in  the U.S?</p><p>BAUMANN:  Well, first of all, we have been in the U.S. for more than 150  years and we have great interest in also advancing on business but the  overall economy in the U.S. and we will do our fair share in contributing.   Regarding with my encounters with President Trump, I have to say that both  party were very well-informed and well briefed.  Got a good discussion  along the lines of what we have already communicated on hat this  combination is going to be about and of course he's a very loyal customer  of the aspirin, which is always nice to see.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, for sure.  And -- but did you say that the consumer  business is weak in the U.S. right now?</p><p>BAUMANN:  Yes, the consumer business overall is actually impact that the  cross actually also our competitors business by fairly dramatic and record  change in consumer behaviors.  The stronger advance of online buying with  that less (INAUDIBLE) if you look at the you know, stationary retail, DR,  abducting to live.  We need to do this faster.  We also need to step up our  innovation capabilities and that is what we are working on.  But clearly  2017 was not a good year for our consumer business.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, we will leave it there.  Werner, and it's good to  have you on the program.  Great to see you, thanks so much for joining us  this morning.</p><p>BAUMANN:  Thank you, thank you, Maria. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Werner Baumann there, CEO at Bayer.  Coming up, TSA bomb  detection goes from airports to underground.  The agency testing new  equipment for train stations that could detect a potential suicide bomber.   This coming after a failed attack in a New York subway last year.  </p><p>And then Apple and Amazon they are the undisputed leaders in the tech  industry in the market.  But who's up next?  You might be surprised by what  and where the next big tech titan comes from.  Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Wednesday morning, everybody, thanks so  much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Wednesday, February  28th, your top stories right now, 6:30 a.m. on the East Coast.  Stocks  looking to rebound this morning, take a look at Futures, indicating a gain  at the start of trading of about 40 points, NASDAQ, S&amp;P 500, also positive.   We are waiting on the second reading of the fourth quarter GDP.  </p><p>Economists are looking for growth of 2 1/2 percent in the GDP, for the  final month of 2017, this, after markets were rattled yesterday, following  testimony from Federal Reserve Chairman, Jake Powell.  His comments  suggesting that the Central Bank may raise interest rates more than the  three times that are expected.  As a result, markets plummeted.  Dow  Industrials, yesterday, down 300 points better than one percent, NASDAQ,  S&amp;P 500 also down one and a quarter percent.  </p><p>Global markets are taking a cue from the U.S. this morning and trading  lower, FT 100, down a quarter of a percent, CAC Quarante in Paris, down a  third of a percent, DAX Index in Germany down one quarter of a percent.   Similar story in Asia overnight, declines across the board, worst performer  was Hong Kong, down 1 1/2 percent on the Hang Seng.  </p><p>A new layer of security to report, the TSA is now testing new technology to  detect suicide vests, how it works, coming up.  President Trump, one step  closer to fulfilling another campaign promise.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Do not worry.  We are going  to build the wall, OK?  Don't worry.  Don't even think about it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  A judge ruling in favor of the administration, allowing  construction plans to begin for the border wall.  And the White House  changing its tune on trade, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, now  suggesting President Trump may negotiate a return to the Trans-Pacific  Partnership, the details, coming up.  Then, the world's largest plane, one  step closer to its first passenger flight, more on the latest milestone for  the jet that's backed by Paul Allen, all that coming up.  </p><p>But first, this top story this half an hour, students will return to  Marjory Stoneman Douglas High  School this morning, two weeks, after the shooting, 17 students and  teachers were killed on that Valentine's Day massacre.  Joining me right  now is a survivor of the shooting, Junior Kyle Kashuv, Kyle, thank you so  much for being with us this morning.</p><p>KYLE KASHUV, JUNIOR, MARJORY STONEMAN DOUGLAS HIGH SCHOOL:  Thank you for  having me, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  First, we all want to say our condolences.  Our hearts go out  to you and your families and all of your friends and colleagues there at  High School.  How do you feel about going back to school today?</p><p>KASHUV:  I mean, it's really sad coming back to school, but then, it's also  really exciting to meet my peers and to be able to connect once again at  school.  I am optimistic that -- I'm optimistic going back to school.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're optimistic about going back to school?  Have you spoken  to your friends about it?  I mean, do you think it's the right time now?   It's two weeks.</p><p>KASHUV:  I think it's the right time.  I mean, everyone is still saddened  by what happened but, we understand that.  We still have to return to  school and there's no other time better than now, to do so.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Of course, of course.  Now, the calls for Sheriff Scott  Israel's resignation are growing louder.  What's your take on this?  The  Broward County Sheriff has said, he will not step down.  Listen to what he  said.  I want to get your reaction.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SCOTT ISRAEL, SHERIFF, BROWARD COUNTY:  I can only take responsibility for  what I knew about.  I exercise my due diligence.  I've given amazing  leadership to this age --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Amazing leadership?</p><p>ISRALE:  I've worked -- yes.  And, of course, I won't resign.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Kyle?</p><p>KASHUV:  I this it's a completely -- I think it's completely, like,  understandable that we realize that how (INAUDIBLE) it is that the Broward  Sheriff's Department failed on so many different levels and they didn't act  properly.  And I think that it is a representation of his leadership.  He  has to be held accountable for the inaction of the Broward Sheriff's  Department.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Jason Chaffetz.</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  Kyle, hi, this is Jason Chaffetz.  God bless you.  I can't  imagine what it's like for you and your, you know, fellow students to go  back to school, but, you know, there are --</p><p>KASHUV:  Thank you.</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  In different schools, they have people that you, kind of, really  worried about and concerned about.  Do you think that video games and stuff  that you see in the media and the movies, do you think that affects some of  your classmates there?</p><p>KASHUV:  No, I really don't think that video games have a, somewhat, even  slightly an effect on children and the way they act, they really don't,  because we can clearly tell reality from video games, there's a clear  divide.</p><p>KISSEL:  Kyle, it's Mary Kissel here.  I just want to echo what Maria and  Jason said that our thoughts and prayers are with you and the other  students.  A lot of the talk has been about things like gun control and  school safety, that yet, it's clear that there were breakdowns on many  levels, particularly in the mental health system, very, very difficult for  someone like the shooter, to get the help that he needs.  I think he even  called and asked for help at one point.  Has that been part of the  discussion between you and your classmates?  Is that gaining any traction  down there?</p><p>KASHUV:  It is.  I figured we definitely understand that we have a lacking  in the department for emotional support at our schools.  And right now, we  clearly see a lot of movement and legislation that trying to enact that.   I'm -- right now, I'm working on an app developing, to allow moms to,  maybe, volunteer at schools for emotional support and since we're so  understaffed.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Kyle, it's Dagen McDowell, has this school stepped up and said  that they're going to provide counselling to you and your fellow students  if you want it, having been traumatized, obviously, going through such a  traumatic event that most of us can't even -- can't even comprehend?</p><p>KASHUV: Really, the entire community has stepped up, and there were support  counselling at the Portland YMCA, and it was really helpful to a lot of my  friends.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And Kyle, you've called yourself a conservative, right?  And as  a supporter -- </p><p>KASHUV:  Yes, Ma'am.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  of the second amendment?  Has this impact --</p><p>KASHUV:  Yes, Ma'am.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Has this incident impacted your views?</p><p>KASHUV:  It's only slightly.  I still believe in the second amendment and  its importance to our nation.  I really -- it's dissatisfying to see the  Never Again Movement, slightly switched from simply making sure that this  will never happen again to gun control, but at the end of the day, I still  think that the entire community and the Never Again Movement, is still  heavily pushing to make sure that school shootings will be a thing in the  past.  And I really -- I'm really happy to see the entire community come  together as a bipartisan issue to work for a better change. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, especially since there were so many signs and signals that  were there and were missed.  Do -- had you ever seen or heard about Nikolas  Cruz?  And obviously, he was told don't come back (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>KASHUV:  Up until this incident --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I'm sorry?</p><p>KASHUV:  Up until, like, the school shooting, I had never known of his  existence but my friends did.  I had some friends that were in class with  him, and they always told -- they told me now, that they always knew  something was off about him.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What did they say about him?  What did -- what did people know  about him?</p><p>KASHUV:  They said that he was -- he was an outcast.  He wasn't really  understood.  They considered him somewhat of a weirdo, if I could quote.   He didn't have a lot of friends, but no one ever thought that he would do  such a thing.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  So, the Governor, Rick Scott, has some proposals on the  table for the state, including arming teachers, administrators.  Listen to  this.  I want to get your reaction.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GOV. RICK SCOTT (R), FLORIDA:  My plan is to spend $500 million to make our  school safe, to invest dollars in mental illness to make sure this never  happens again.  We need to increase the collaboration between our local  sheriffs, our police departments, our schools, Department of Children and  Families and DJJ.  We have got to make sure we have an increased law  enforcement presence in all of our schools.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So Kyle, what do you think about those ideas?  I mean, a minute  ago, you said you would like to see mothers volunteer.  Would you want to  see teachers armed?</p><p>KASHUV:  I think, that simply proposing that, here -- I think it's really  complex issue.  And in certain counties, there's a response time of maybe,  like. 15 minutes for the police to reach the school.  And studies show that  the first shots in a school shooting, only in five minutes, so practically,  the school is unarmed for 15 minutes and unable to defend themselves, and  simply, like, giving teachers the opportunity to, like, defend their  students, is a good thing.  And all levels of the school system in that  county, have to allow the teacher, and the teacher himself or herself has  to voluntarily do the training to be able to carry a gun at school.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Kyle, where were you when you first learned there was an active  shooter in school?</p><p>KASHUV:  I was in a very close adjacent building.  And in the beginning, I  thought that it was -- it didn't sound like gun shots at all because they  were so muffled, but I later realized that because it's in the freshman  building, they sounded muffled.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And what happened?  What did you -- what were you told?  Can  you walk us through it?</p><p>KASHUV:  Yes, ma'am.  So, I was in my last period class, and there was a  fire drill, so I was gradually walking out, and then, I didn't want to  leave the classroom and then I heard (INAUDIBLE) announcement saying,  evacuate immediately.  We evacuated immediately into the main hallway, and  then we heard two pops.  I didn't think it was gunshots.  </p><p>People started panicking, so I want to run back into my teacher's  classroom, and he closed the door on me.  He closed the door on, like, a  few of my fellow students and he wouldn't let us in, which he followed a  procedure, he did.  He feels terrible for what he did but it's completely  understandable because he had no idea who the shooter was.  </p><p>So, then we quickly ran to another teacher's room and she piled us in  there.  We then -- we hid in the closet for two hours and then constantly,  we were getting feeds from our friends and our family were contacting us  and everyone was hysterically crying, and I was trying to calm everyone  down.  Then, it took a while for SWAT to come get us because we've such a  big campus.  They had to take a while to clear it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How do think things change at the school now?</p><p>KASHUV:  Can you repeat that?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How do you think things will change now, at the school?</p><p>KASHUV:  I think, now, a little -- like, as of right now, there's going to  be a bigger police presence on campus, but sadly, I don't think that  anything is going to really change in the next coming week.  I think  everything is going to stay the same.  I don't think that we're going to  have -- the only thing -- the only difference, we're going to have  increased security by police office.  I don't think that anything,  specifically, other than that, will change in the security at our school.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Kyle.  We appreciate you joining us this morning.   We all send love --</p><p>KASHUV:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  and support to you and all of your friends and colleagues at  the school.  Kyle, good luck going back today, thank you.</p><p>KASHUV:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Kyle Kashuv, joining us there.  Coming up, immigration  crackdown despite a heads up from the mayor, ICE officials has arrested  more than 150 illegal immigrants in a sweep in a California Sanctuary City.   We're going to talk about that and why she gave the heads up to the  criminals, and then, a major new milestone for the world's largest plane,  details, coming up, back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back, TSA, Transportation Security Administration,  testing technology, now, in New York City that detects suicide vests,  Lauren Simonetti with all the details, now, Lauren.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  Pretty unbelievable, Maria, those tests taking place this week  with Amtrak at New York's Penn Station, the move, coming after that failed  pipe bomb attempt in a subway passage way back in December.  That was just  a couple blocks from Penn station.  This vest detection technology uses  special cameras that can scan for explosive devices, but the TSA says the  equipment can see through clothing, no privacy concerns because the image  is animated.  </p><p>Well, a massive ICE sweep in Northern California, more than 150 illegal  immigrants taken into custody despite warnings from the mayor of Oakland.   The top ice officials said the mayor's warning lightly gave criminals a  chance to escape.  The agency is now asking the Department of Justice to  look into whether she violated any laws with that warning.</p><p>Meanwhile, big win for President Trump and his border wall.  A federal  judge ruling against an environmental challenge to the wall, saying  Congress and the President share responsibilities to protect the country.   Border wall construction plans can now move forward.</p><p>While there is a chance that the U.S. may rejoin the Transpacific  Partnership or the TPP.  Treasury Secretary, Steve Mnuchin, says  renegotiation is on the table and that he's been in talks with other  countries about what it would take for the us to recommit.  President Trump  as you know, withdrew from President Obama's signature trade agreement last  year but Secretary Steve Mnuchin adding rejoining is not a priority for the  administration at the moment.  </p><p>And a new way to launch satellite into outer space, now the Strata Launch - - the world's largest airplane which can reach a speed of 46 miles an hour  on the taxiway, that's a big deal.  It's has a wingspan of 385 feet.  It  can carry 100,000 pounds.  It's designed to bring rockets to the  stratosphere for a more affordable launch for a low orbit satellites.  The  Strata Launch could make its first test flight by next year.  And of  course, Maria, Microsoft Co-Founder, Paul Allen, is backing this.  This is  his company.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  All right.  Lauren, thank you so much.  I want to talk  about this testing at Penn Station.  What do you thinL?  </p><p>CHAFFETZ:  Coincidentally I was at Penn Station, and I saw them doing this  testing.  I think it's good technology.  Let's remember that the Pentagon  spent more than $20 billion trying to figure out how to identify,  improvised explosive devices.  And you know what, the single best way to do  it is, dogs.  We can have all the technology we want, we need more dogs,  because dogs can find these things, they're mobile, and they're the best  deterrent that we have.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We now have smart dogs or so, yes, I agree with that.  </p><p>KISSEL:  Should we be more concerned about the TSA?  And I was looking at  some of these tests that they do, where they try to get bombmaking  materials through the security at airports, and they fail the majority of  the time, the overwhelming majority of the time.  Is that an agency that  needs more congressional oversight?  </p><p>CHAFFETZ:  It does and they need to look at the priority.  Because you know  what, dogs, they don't have lobbyists, but the people that sell these  machines, by the hundreds of millions of dollars, they do have lobbyists.   And often times, they're deploying technology that doesn't work.  The  Pentagon doesn't send this technology overseas, they don't have this  technology at the White House.  When you walk in to go into the oval  office, you don't go through this machine, you walk by a dog.  That's why  they use them it's because they're the most effective things.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Very deterrent, but by the way, I know you know this but $0.60  of the TSA fee that we pay when we fly, $0.60 of the $5.60 goes to deficit  reduction.  There is a billion-and-a half-dollars-plus being diverted for  deficit reduction rather than it being spent on actual airport security  every year.  </p><p>KISSEL:  You wonder where all that money goes, you know, when you go  through JFK or LaGuardia, you see all these people standing around, are  they really looking out for our security?  Is that a crack force that's  going to find the next bomb?  </p><p>CHAFFETZ:  Security badges that airports biggest thing.  There are 13,000  people with a security badge at Dulles airport in Washington D.C.  One of  those people slipping by at the wrong time, and you got a real problem.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And a TSA agent smacked my dog in the face by an accident,  because he messing with it in August.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's incredible.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, so, that's what they're busy doing.  Hitting fluffy, little  15-pound animals.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That was Charlie.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, I'm not joking.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I'm sorry to hear that.  We'll take break.  When we come back,  the rise of the new Silicon Valley; how the Middle East is giving its  California tech mecca a run for its money and market share.  We're going to  take a look.  Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Now, the latest in Silicon Valley, Apple shares hitting all- time high yesterday.  Take a look, 178.50 is where the stock is now, up 30  percent this past year.  Netflix is still driving the so-called fang stocks  already up better than 45 percent this year.  Joining us right now to talk  more about tech and where the growth in the world is today is Chemi Peres,  Chairman of the Peres Center for Peace and Innovation, and Managing General  Partner of Pitango Venture Capital.  Chemi, good to see you.  Thanks so  much for joining us.  </p><p>CHEMI PERES, CHAIRMAN, PERES CENTER FOR PEACE AND INNOVATION AND MANAGING  GENERAL PARTNER OF PITANGO VENTURE CAPITAL:  Good to see you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Tell us what you're doing at Pitango and where you see growth  in terms of innovation in the world today.  You've been investing in a  number of areas in tech.  </p><p>PERES:  For the best 25 years, we've been investing in Israeli technology,  we're investing at growth stage, at early-stage, and incubation.  And I  think that the great thing that we're seeing; number one, probably, is  cybersecurity, where it is a great concern around the world.  Terrorism is  globalized, so we are taking care of that.  Secondly, there's tremendous  innovation in A.I., machine learning, and deep learning to connect devices  and machines to the Internet, to create new services.  Thirdly, most likely  is a precision medicine to help us get better and earlier.  </p><p>And probably, I would say, in addition to those kinds of innovations, we're  seeing also the attempt to decentralize the currency systems, to give it  more freedom through blockchain technologies.  And I think that what you've  seen right now in terms of the share prices, you see that the greatest  companies today in the world are technology companies pushing away, you  know, oil, and gas, and chemicals, and construction. So, we are moving to a  new world.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We sure are.</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  Artificial intelligence is a big promise.  There's a lot of good  that can be done, there's also a lot of bad that can be done with  artificial intelligence.  So, where do you see that going, and how do we  control it or does it need to be controlled?  </p><p>PERES:  So, first of all, you are very much right.  Technology without  moral values is very dangerous, so we have to develop more values.  One of  the trends that we're seeing also in the investment space, is that people  are trying to achieve double bottom line, make progress on technology, but  at the same time, make the world safer by using technology for the better.   And I think this is a great challenge that human beings are facing in the  next 10 to 20 years.  </p><p>KISSEL:  Chemi, should we be thinking about Israel is the second Silicon  Valley?  And for investors out there that are sick of the fang stocks here  in the United States, you know, what are the companies that they should be  looking at over there?  </p><p>PERES:  So, I think you shouldn't look at it as a second Silicon Valley,  you should look at it as a first innovation nation.  It's a nation that  both created not from the land but from the mind.  Everything that happen  in Israel was not build upon the land.  We cannot use the land for natural  resources for food or water.  Everything that we do, state foundation,  security, economy, and peace-building is only with our brain.  So, you  should think of Israel as an empire of the mind, as a model for nations  that would like to transition themselves from the old world where they rely  on the land, to the new world which is limitless based on the brain power.   That's the way you need to look at it.</p><p>KISSEL:  Companies?  Any companies?</p><p>PERES:  Companies, probably the biggest company now emerging is  Technologies Checkpoint, which is doing security, and other great company,  I would say, is the company that Intel-acquired Mobile Eye, which now is  turning to be a center for autonomous driving in Israel.  But you know, we  have 7,000 companies in Israel, and probably five percent of them are  emerging as new, great ideas.  And I think that in the next 10 years, we'll  see tremendous number of Israeli companies really changing the world.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Your father used to talk about this a lot.  The late great  Shimon Peres, which talks about Israel as this hub for innovation.  Why is  that?  Why has Israel been able to really compete with the best of the best  in terms of innovation and technology growth?  </p><p>PERES:  So, as I said there, Maria, basically, you cannot build anything,  because we have -- on the land, because our land is so small, it does not  provide any shelter, no food, no water.  So, we had to build everything on  our brain power.  So, number one is necessity, and the second thing I think  is the notion that Israel wants to make the world better, to change the  world for better.  My father would say, most likely, that our biggest  contribution for human beings is dissatisfaction; we're never satisfied  with everything.  So, we need to check everything with technology.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I like that.  Great.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  By the way, the president announced, obviously, his future  plans with the City of Jerusalem back in December of 2017 to move the  embassy to Jerusalem.  You're happy with this decision, obviously?  </p><p>PERES:  Obviously, I'm very happy.  Not everything that is done for Israel  is necessarily bad for other people.  That should've been done in 1947 when  Israel was established as a nation.  Celebrating our 70th anniversary.  I  think it's a great present to fix what was wrong.  It should have been,  from day one, our capital.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Chemi, it's good to see you.  </p><p>PERES:  Good to see you, too.  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Chemi Peres.  We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Wednesday morning, everybody.  Thanks so  much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Wednesday, February  28th.  </p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

Nikkei Average down almost one and a half percent.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The battle over gun control, as the students in Parkland, Florida return to school today, President Trump is set to host a bipartisan meeting with lawmakers as they work to end gun violence. I'll speak with one of the students from Marjory Stone Douglas High School about his return to school later this hour.</p><p>And the debate is having a major impact on the business world as well.

Billion, what it means for your deliveries, coming up this morning.</p><p>All those stories coming up this morning and joining me to talk all about it, Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowelll. Former Utah Congressman, former House Oversight Committee Chairman and Fox News Contributor, Jason CHaffetz. And the \"Wall Street Journal's\" Editorial Board Member, Fox News Contributor, Mary Kissel is here. Great to see you.</p><p>MARY KISSEL, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Good morning Maria, thanks for having us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, good morning to you.</p><p>JASON CHAFFETZ, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Good morning.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN ANCHOR: When I saw the guests was yesterday, \"I can't wait to hear what Mary and Jason have to say. So that means I'm going to stifle.</p><p>BARTIROMO: No, we don't want that. We don't want -- but it's true, we're grateful that you're both here this morning. What's on your mind? What's most important in your mind right now?</p><p>CHAFFETZ: I'm still reeling over what the republicans have done to run up government spending. I see a lot of good economic news, the GDP but the government component in the run up and spending, I think it's going to hamper the economy, I really do.</p><p>BARTIROMO: $300 billion in spending.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: It's a ridiculous number, you can't justify it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Yes, we'll talk more about that. Mary, how about you?</p><p>KISSEL: Yes. Well I think they're on a shirt high because as you said, you've got the four quarter GDP number coming out and say goodbye to the new normal of two percent that turns out that America can grow much faster than that.</p><p>But I think unfortunately republicans are taking that message to as you say give back on the sugar high of government spending, not a good idea.</p><p>BARTIROMO: No. We've been talking about that a lot for sure because now we're talking about $1 trillion deficits from here on out.</p><p>KISSEL: Yes we are.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>KISSEL: And we'll talk about it as the morning rolls on too.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Again, watching those yields, those yields going up to close and above 2.9 percent yesterday on that testimony from Jay Powell.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Tough day. We expected what he said though, so I don't know why the markets were surprised. We knew he was going to talk about higher interest rates and the return of inflation.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Maybe sometimes investors need a hammer over the head so to speak and that was it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We'll see about that. Three hundred points lower yesterday, this morning a bit of a bounce.</p><p>Joining the conversation this morning, the CEO of Bayer is with me, Werner Baumann is here talking about lots of news this morning in the drug industry. White House Deputy Press Secretary Hogan Gidley is with us. Former RNC Chair and Founding Partner of the DGR Group, Haley Barbour joins us. Kentucky Congressman Andy Barr is here. And Dr. Mikhail Varshavski AKA Dr. Mike also joining us this morning.</p><p>You don't want to miss moments of it so do stay with us. And we kick it off here with the top story, markets taking a hit yesterday after a new Federal Reserve chairman Jay Powell delivered an upbeat assessments of the U.S. economy on Capitol Hill leading investors to expect higher interest rates. Of course, the biggest economic news on the DACA today is the second estimate of fourth quarter GDP.</p><p>It's expected to come in at two and a half percent, that would be down 0.1 of a percent from the initial expectation. Your reaction to what we heard from Jay Powell yesterday Mary in terms of what he said, what that means from where we are today.</p><p>KISSLER: Well the Federal Reserve always underestimates GDP growth in the economy and they always under estimate the impact of tax cuts Maria. They're also always behind the curve when it comes to inflation expectations.</p><p>Jay Powell was not picked because he was an aggressive Fed chairman, Jay Powell was picked because he was somebody that the White House liked and thought wouldn't rock the boat. So I think what you're going to see out of him is, again, a very reasonable and predictable rate rise. Whether or not that leads them behind the curve, who knows, the bigger challenge and Dagen and I were talking about this off air is what they're going to do with this mega balance sheet that the Federal Reserve has accumulated?</p><p>We've never seen that in the history of the Federal Reserve before, it's a big experiment and the question is, can the Federal Reserve get rid of that balance sheet without turning the market upside down.</p><p>BARTIROMO: The idea of unwinding $4.5 trillion Dagen. We've talked about it before, $50 billion a month, at some point we'll get there.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Coupled with the idea that we may see now four interest rate hikes spook in markets.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right. The market yesterday began fact -- this has been discussed widely about four interest rate hikes this year but Futures contracts linked to the Central Bank's rate policies yesterday showed one third of a probability that it's going to move four times this year.</p><p>But it's the great unknown of the Fed -- I think the balance sheet will shrink about $400 billion this year, $420 billion with the final quarter at $50 billion will be rolling off in mortgage and Treasury securities. But this has put even more pressure on markets and on the Federal Reserve because of what the republicans have done.</p><p>I don't disagree with the tax reform, I don't believe that it's going to cost north of a $1 trillion. I think because of the faster growth, because of the higher tax receipts you've already seen in January. However, republicans make this pressure on the Fed worst and on the bond market because they increased spending by $300 billion over to your period. You're ramping up the supply of Treasury debt at a time when one major source of the demand over the last 10 years is going away and that's problematic.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. When Paul Ryan joined me two weeks ago Jason, one thing he kept saying is, \"You've got to give to get.\" Well you were in that seat before, what would you have done had you been faced with a situation of, \"OK, we need to spend this money on the military. We need new money on -- for military and recover what's been happened from sequestration but, I'm being held hostage by doing all this other stuff spending elsewhere.\"</p><p>CHAFFETZ: Well look, if you look at what Chuck Schumer got, he got everything that he wanted. What did the republicans get in that deal? They didn't get anything. There was a 13 percent increase in domestic spending and Rand Paul was absolutely right when he said, \"When we had $1 dollar deficits and it was Obama in the White House, we were all up and arms.\" And suddenly, now it's President Trump and we're OK with it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: They didn't do anything to curve that and for Paul Ryan to say, \"Well now we're going to turn our attention to entitlement reform.\" Come on, there's no way you're getting this 60 votes on entitlement reform.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Not this year.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: No. There's no way to do it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: But some of the things that they put money to, Dagen, you mentioned it, what, the abstinence spending.</p><p>MCDOWELL: $150 billion -- excuse me, million dollars for abstinence education (INAUDIBLE) with social conservatives but it was billions of dollars a year for child care, for health --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Community centers.</p><p>MCDOWELL: For community health centers. And I'll point to this because this is in the news today, I think it was $6 billion to fight the opioid crisis --</p><p>KISSEL: Yes, that's it.</p><p>MCDOWELL: -- when they had poultry little evidence of how that money has been spend, it's already been allocated and how this be spent. Like the -- you need proof of outcomes when you start throwing billions of dollars at a problem.</p><p>KISSEL: Yes. But, again, I wonder about the political environment here because President Trump wants to do a deal and I feel like Paul Ryan's biggest worry is that democrats are going to go to the president and say, \"Just spend a little more. You'll be more popular. We can do a deal together.\"</p><p>And so Paul Ryan just took over what's in front of him because he didn't want something that was even worst.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: But I -- when did it become the new normal and totally acceptable that for every dollar rise in defense spending, you have to raise domestic spending. There was no justification to raise the domestic spending, you could make a case on the military but, again, I don't think we went out and said, \"Hey, we need a new carrier group, we have to have missile defense.\" We never had that discussion in this country. That bill came about three and a half days.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Well let's worry now and like I said to Paul Ryan, now it's in your face in terms of markets reacting to higher interest rates, what that means for the debt.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: And they still have to fund the government on March 23rd. So remember, they funded part of the military but they still have to go back and actually pass a funding pill later in March.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And to -- we'll talk about the \"Wall Street Journal\" Editorial page, Mary Kissel, because, again, it's -- the fact republicans won't fix the entitlements that we have where one in five Americans is on Medicaid, Medicare, and Social Security.</p><p>But now you have the likes of Senators Mike Lee and Marco Rubio talking about this new entitlement joining arms with Ivanka Trump on paid family leave federally mandated. So, again, to call yourself a conservative is a joke.</p><p>KISSEL: Yes. And rating the entitlements by the way propose (INAUDIBLE) entitlements to pay for that.</p><p>MCDOWELL: (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>KISSEL: There's a free lunch entitlement according to those two senators which was just ridiculous. Look Dagen, I think it's very disheartening, republicans had a chance to have a major entitlement reform last week with healthcare but they simply couldn't explain what the program was.</p><p>They had gone out and actually, I don't know, had three bullet points and said, \"Hey America, do you want to make entitlements to give into the people who actually need them instead of able bodied adults? I think Americans would have gotten behind that.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Because most people recognize this is where the growth and spending and that these programs are going out of business. They are -- they're going broke.</p><p>KISSLER: Yes, they are -- it's entitlements.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. We're going to take a break. When we comeback, students are returning to school in Florida. This morning, we're going to speak with one of the students, a survivor.</p><p>Then scary moments out of Virginia Military Base after the contents of mysterious envelops causes several people to get sick, we got the details on that investigation.</p><p>Then a first on Fox Business interview, I'm one-on-one with Bayer CEO Werner Baumann. We will talk about the company's $8 billion for U.S. investment. Back in a moments right here.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Another police officer shot in the line of duty, this time in Idaho. Lauren Simonetti with the details and headlines now, Lauren.</p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FBN REPORTER: Good morning Maria. The suspected gunman was shot and killed in the shootout. Police say the shooter had a felony warrant for his arrest, began firing at officers when they approached him.</p><p>All this happened near the Idaho, Washington state line, east of Spokane. The officer hit with the bullet went into surgery, the police chief says he was up and talking with other officers.</p><p>Well, 11 people including several marines sickened yesterday after a suspicious letter was opened at Marine Corps headquarters near the Pentagon. Three people were taken to the hospital listed in stable condition. The envelope which contained an unknown substance was mailed to joint base Myer Henderson in Virginia. It's been sent to the FBI's lab and Quantico for testing. The building was evacuated, it is not clear at this point who sent that letter.</p><p>Well, evidence now emerging that North Korea is profiting from the civil war in Syria. \"Confidential United Nations\" report says that North Korea shipped 50 tons of supplies to Syria for using building, what it suspected to be a chemical weapons factory. The U.S. has accused Syria of using chemical weapons in rebel controlled areas including recently in a suburb of Damascus.</p><p>Meanwhile, take a look at these new satellite photos. They show Iran establishing another base in Syria. Intelligence sources telling Fox News that the base outside of Syria's capital is complete with hangers used to store missiles capable of hitting Israel.</p><p>And in business, Amazon is buying a ring in a deal reportedly valued at over $1 billion. Amazon is expanding its home security business. Ring makes Wi-Fi connected cameras and doorbells. This coming after Amazon launched its own security carmeras which worked with its -- boy, this isn't Alexa. Ring devices capture a video that can be screened on smart phones. And I guess you can tell if someone's going to steal your packages when they're at your doorstep.</p><p>Look at Amazon shares, they're moving up half a percent, 15.19 in the premarket, this is the stock that's up in the past year almost 80 percent, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, that's a good line that you can watch if anyone is trying to steal your packages. It's true, you're right.</p><p>SIMONETTI: Get off my door step.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It's an interesting acquisition. I like this company. I've always liked the idea that you can just go on your phone and see who's at your doorbell. What do you think Dagen?</p><p>MCDOWELL: I think that they've done a great job of advertising where the millennials are. You will hear these ring advertisements on Podcasts galore.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Really?</p><p>MCDOWELL: And I'm a voracious consumer of Podcast. So they've done an incredible job and they've been able to grow their business despite some naysayers.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Amazon keeps on expanding.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: I use the vivid system (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>BARTIROMO: You do? OK.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: And I can watch right now, I can see what's going on and it automatically takes clips. Somebody who rings my doorbell, they walk up and it buzzes me on my phone, so I know anytime.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I like that.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: And my kids realized when you have a system like this, it's not as much about keeping people from the outside getting in, as it is also to keeping them inside from getting out. And we have a teenager, that's a good system.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That is great.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I don't -- I don't think I want to know what's going on in Brooklyn in the middle of the night, actually. So, I do not have one of these systems.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, it looks good. I think it's the whole technology around safety and security and being able to look at all your doors that on your phone is pretty interesting. And it's interesting that Amazon is acquiring it.</p><p>All right, we are going to take a break. When we come back, students at Stoneman Douglas high school returning to class today. Exactly, two weeks after 17 people were killed. I will talk to one of the students on his thoughts about going back and the expectations for school safety now.</p><p>The investors are expecting growth of 2.5 percent when we get the second quarter -- the second reading for the fourth quarter GDP later this morning. We will see how the markets react. Futures right now, indicating a gain at the start of trading. These are the high of the morning right here, up 50 points on the Dow Jones Industrial average. We'll be right back. Stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back, fourth-quarter earnings from Bayer just out this morning. The German drug maker and agriculture giant misexpectations on revenue due in part to a head from U.S. tax reform. The stock sell to a 15 month low on the news. And joining us right now, for the first time on FOX NEWS's interview is the CEO of Bayer, Werner Baumann. Werner, it's good to have you on the program this morning. Thank you so much.</p><p>WERNER BAUMANN, CEO, BAYER: Hi, Maria. Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Let me kick it off with the quarter. Can you tell us what growth -- the growth in the quarter, what would you say was the standout this last three months?</p><p>BAUMANN: Well, we've seen -- as we've seen in the entire year. A very good performance in pharma, so sales in pharma advanced again by roughly four percent. If you look at our key growth product, so blood thinner, Xarelto, Eylea, then some of our cancer products, all of them have done well both in quarter four but for also the entire year. So, our pharma business had another record here. Quite frankly, the other businesses, things did not go down well in 2017.</p><p>So consumer is a difficult business in particular in the U.S. and then in crop we had significant oversupply in the market in Brazil that our crop protection products as our competitors as well. We had to cleanse the situation in quarter two and have since made very good progress I have to say in getting the situation under control and actually advancing again. So we are quite optimistic for our crop business going into 2018.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, I want to talk about the consumer business. You say that it was -- it was a little under pressure in the U.S. That's interesting to know, given that the economics in the U.S. have been improving. But let me start with you $66 billion deal to acquire Monsanto. We are waiting on approvals from European regulators and the U.S. The company's hoping this deal will close this year. But I guess, are you expecting the approval in the second quarter? From the E.U.?</p><p>BAUMANN: Yes, Maria. Based on where we are right now, we've seen very, very good progress. This by now, roughly half of the 30 approvals we need. They are in very good discussions after say that the European Commission making good progress there and also that the DOJ. Even though with the DOJ, we are a little bit behind the process where we are with the European Commission. But overall, as you have mentioned, that we are quite confident, that we are going to close this on section in the second quarter. And that we will also obtain the approvals necessary to do so.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, as we wait for the E.U. approval sometime in the second quarter, what are the plans in terms of divestitures, in terms of raising money once you get that approval? Are you expecting to do a secondary offering of right to issue once you get that approval?</p><p>BAUMANN: Yes, Maria. First of all, looking at the divestitures we have already announced actually in October -- mid-October last year, that a very large part of our buyers, seat business and our non-selective herbicides platform. Delivered to link product lines are going to be divested to BISF. Of course, always contingent on the over transaction coming to a closing. And we continue to be in discussion so that, with some select further areas that are in the interest of the regulators also to strengthen overall competition, also innovation competition in our industry. That discussion is over all regardless whether you look at the Europeans or the Department of Justice. Very constructive, we have recently announced also today in our call that we are now also going to divest of our vegetable seeds business. I cannot at this point in time say that this is what's it going to be because these discussions are still on going.</p><p>On the same question regarding the financing, this is going to be a mix of equity and debt. So that we have already mentioned that based on the very good sales proceeds on the divestiture of our (INAUDIBLE) at stake, the -- these need less equity than we had expected, but there's still will be a rise offering here.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I see, I see. Now you and several other European business leaders took part in a round table discussion with President Trump in Davos last month. I know the President said that he is a fan of the company, but let me ask you this, in terms of your expectations in terms of investments in the United States, tell us what that looks like and what do you think is behind this weakness that you just mentioned in terms of the consumer in the U.S?</p><p>BAUMANN: Well, first of all, we have been in the U.S. for more than 150 years and we have great interest in also advancing on business but the overall economy in the U.S. and we will do our fair share in contributing. Regarding with my encounters with President Trump, I have to say that both party were very well-informed and well briefed. Got a good discussion along the lines of what we have already communicated on hat this combination is going to be about and of course he's a very loyal customer of the aspirin, which is always nice to see.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, for sure. And -- but did you say that the consumer business is weak in the U.S. right now?</p><p>BAUMANN: Yes, the consumer business overall is actually impact that the cross actually also our competitors business by fairly dramatic and record change in consumer behaviors. The stronger advance of online buying with that less (INAUDIBLE) if you look at the you know, stationary retail, DR, abducting to live. We need to do this faster. We also need to step up our innovation capabilities and that is what we are working on. But clearly 2017 was not a good year for our consumer business.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, we will leave it there. Werner, and it's good to have you on the program. Great to see you, thanks so much for joining us this morning.</p><p>BAUMANN: Thank you, thank you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Werner Baumann there, CEO at Bayer. Coming up, TSA bomb detection goes from airports to underground. The agency testing new equipment for train stations that could detect a potential suicide bomber. This coming after a failed attack in a New York subway last year.</p><p>And then Apple and Amazon they are the undisputed leaders in the tech industry in the market. But who's up next? You might be surprised by what and where the next big tech titan comes from. Back in a minute.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Wednesday morning, everybody, thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Wednesday, February 28th, your top stories right now, 6:30 a.m. on the East Coast. Stocks looking to rebound this morning, take a look at Futures, indicating a gain at the start of trading of about 40 points, NASDAQ, S&amp;P 500, also positive. We are waiting on the second reading of the fourth quarter GDP.</p><p>Economists are looking for growth of 2 1/2 percent in the GDP, for the final month of 2017, this, after markets were rattled yesterday, following testimony from Federal Reserve Chairman, Jake Powell. His comments suggesting that the Central Bank may raise interest rates more than the three times that are expected. As a result, markets plummeted. Dow Industrials, yesterday, down 300 points better than one percent, NASDAQ, S&amp;P 500 also down one and a quarter percent.</p><p>Global markets are taking a cue from the U.S. this morning and trading lower, FT 100, down a quarter of a percent, CAC Quarante in Paris, down a third of a percent, DAX Index in Germany down one quarter of a percent. Similar story in Asia overnight, declines across the board, worst performer was Hong Kong, down 1 1/2 percent on the Hang Seng.</p><p>A new layer of security to report, the TSA is now testing new technology to detect suicide vests, how it works, coming up. President Trump, one step closer to fulfilling another campaign promise.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Do not worry. We are going to build the wall, OK? Don't worry. Don't even think about it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: A judge ruling in favor of the administration, allowing construction plans to begin for the border wall. And the White House changing its tune on trade, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, now suggesting President Trump may negotiate a return to the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the details, coming up. Then, the world's largest plane, one step closer to its first passenger flight, more on the latest milestone for the jet that's backed by Paul Allen, all that coming up.</p><p>But first, this top story this half an hour, students will return to Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School this morning, two weeks, after the shooting, 17 students and teachers were killed on that Valentine's Day massacre. Joining me right now is a survivor of the shooting, Junior Kyle Kashuv, Kyle, thank you so much for being with us this morning.</p><p>KYLE KASHUV, JUNIOR, MARJORY STONEMAN DOUGLAS HIGH SCHOOL: Thank you for having me, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: First, we all want to say our condolences. Our hearts go out to you and your families and all of your friends and colleagues there at High School. How do you feel about going back to school today?</p><p>KASHUV: I mean, it's really sad coming back to school, but then, it's also really exciting to meet my peers and to be able to connect once again at school. I am optimistic that -- I'm optimistic going back to school.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You're optimistic about going back to school? Have you spoken to your friends about it? I mean, do you think it's the right time now? It's two weeks.</p><p>KASHUV: I think it's the right time. I mean, everyone is still saddened by what happened but, we understand that. We still have to return to school and there's no other time better than now, to do so.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Of course, of course. Now, the calls for Sheriff Scott Israel's resignation are growing louder. What's your take on this? The Broward County Sheriff has said, he will not step down. Listen to what he said. I want to get your reaction.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SCOTT ISRAEL, SHERIFF, BROWARD COUNTY: I can only take responsibility for what I knew about. I exercise my due diligence. I've given amazing leadership to this age --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Amazing leadership?</p><p>ISRALE: I've worked -- yes. And, of course, I won't resign.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Kyle?</p><p>KASHUV: I this it's a completely -- I think it's completely, like, understandable that we realize that how (INAUDIBLE) it is that the Broward Sheriff's Department failed on so many different levels and they didn't act properly. And I think that it is a representation of his leadership. He has to be held accountable for the inaction of the Broward Sheriff's Department.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Jason Chaffetz.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: Kyle, hi, this is Jason Chaffetz. God bless you. I can't imagine what it's like for you and your, you know, fellow students to go back to school, but, you know, there are --</p><p>KASHUV: Thank you.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: In different schools, they have people that you, kind of, really worried about and concerned about. Do you think that video games and stuff that you see in the media and the movies, do you think that affects some of your classmates there?</p><p>KASHUV: No, I really don't think that video games have a, somewhat, even slightly an effect on children and the way they act, they really don't, because we can clearly tell reality from video games, there's a clear divide.</p><p>KISSEL: Kyle, it's Mary Kissel here. I just want to echo what Maria and Jason said that our thoughts and prayers are with you and the other students. A lot of the talk has been about things like gun control and school safety, that yet, it's clear that there were breakdowns on many levels, particularly in the mental health system, very, very difficult for someone like the shooter, to get the help that he needs. I think he even called and asked for help at one point. Has that been part of the discussion between you and your classmates? Is that gaining any traction down there?</p><p>KASHUV: It is. I figured we definitely understand that we have a lacking in the department for emotional support at our schools. And right now, we clearly see a lot of movement and legislation that trying to enact that. I'm -- right now, I'm working on an app developing, to allow moms to, maybe, volunteer at schools for emotional support and since we're so understaffed.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Kyle, it's Dagen McDowell, has this school stepped up and said that they're going to provide counselling to you and your fellow students if you want it, having been traumatized, obviously, going through such a traumatic event that most of us can't even -- can't even comprehend?</p><p>KASHUV: Really, the entire community has stepped up, and there were support counselling at the Portland YMCA, and it was really helpful to a lot of my friends.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And Kyle, you've called yourself a conservative, right? And as a supporter --</p><p>KASHUV: Yes, Ma'am.</p><p>BARTIROMO: of the second amendment? Has this impact --</p><p>KASHUV: Yes, Ma'am.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Has this incident impacted your views?</p><p>KASHUV: It's only slightly. I still believe in the second amendment and its importance to our nation. I really -- it's dissatisfying to see the Never Again Movement, slightly switched from simply making sure that this will never happen again to gun control, but at the end of the day, I still think that the entire community and the Never Again Movement, is still heavily pushing to make sure that school shootings will be a thing in the past. And I really -- I'm really happy to see the entire community come together as a bipartisan issue to work for a better change.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, especially since there were so many signs and signals that were there and were missed. Do -- had you ever seen or heard about Nikolas Cruz? And obviously, he was told don't come back (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>KASHUV: Up until this incident --</p><p>BARTIROMO: I'm sorry?</p><p>KASHUV: Up until, like, the school shooting, I had never known of his existence but my friends did. I had some friends that were in class with him, and they always told -- they told me now, that they always knew something was off about him.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What did they say about him? What did -- what did people know about him?</p><p>KASHUV: They said that he was -- he was an outcast. He wasn't really understood. They considered him somewhat of a weirdo, if I could quote. He didn't have a lot of friends, but no one ever thought that he would do such a thing.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. So, the Governor, Rick Scott, has some proposals on the table for the state, including arming teachers, administrators. Listen to this. I want to get your reaction.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GOV. RICK SCOTT (R), FLORIDA: My plan is to spend $500 million to make our school safe, to invest dollars in mental illness to make sure this never happens again. We need to increase the collaboration between our local sheriffs, our police departments, our schools, Department of Children and Families and DJJ. We have got to make sure we have an increased law enforcement presence in all of our schools.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: So Kyle, what do you think about those ideas? I mean, a minute ago, you said you would like to see mothers volunteer. Would you want to see teachers armed?</p><p>KASHUV: I think, that simply proposing that, here -- I think it's really complex issue. And in certain counties, there's a response time of maybe, like. 15 minutes for the police to reach the school. And studies show that the first shots in a school shooting, only in five minutes, so practically, the school is unarmed for 15 minutes and unable to defend themselves, and simply, like, giving teachers the opportunity to, like, defend their students, is a good thing. And all levels of the school system in that county, have to allow the teacher, and the teacher himself or herself has to voluntarily do the training to be able to carry a gun at school.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Kyle, where were you when you first learned there was an active shooter in school?</p><p>KASHUV: I was in a very close adjacent building. And in the beginning, I thought that it was -- it didn't sound like gun shots at all because they were so muffled, but I later realized that because it's in the freshman building, they sounded muffled.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And what happened? What did you -- what were you told? Can you walk us through it?</p><p>KASHUV: Yes, ma'am. So, I was in my last period class, and there was a fire drill, so I was gradually walking out, and then, I didn't want to leave the classroom and then I heard (INAUDIBLE) announcement saying, evacuate immediately. We evacuated immediately into the main hallway, and then we heard two pops. I didn't think it was gunshots.</p><p>People started panicking, so I want to run back into my teacher's classroom, and he closed the door on me. He closed the door on, like, a few of my fellow students and he wouldn't let us in, which he followed a procedure, he did. He feels terrible for what he did but it's completely understandable because he had no idea who the shooter was.</p><p>So, then we quickly ran to another teacher's room and she piled us in there. We then -- we hid in the closet for two hours and then constantly, we were getting feeds from our friends and our family were contacting us and everyone was hysterically crying, and I was trying to calm everyone down. Then, it took a while for SWAT to come get us because we've such a big campus. They had to take a while to clear it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: How do think things change at the school now?</p><p>KASHUV: Can you repeat that?</p><p>BARTIROMO: How do you think things will change now, at the school?</p><p>KASHUV: I think, now, a little -- like, as of right now, there's going to be a bigger police presence on campus, but sadly, I don't think that anything is going to really change in the next coming week. I think everything is going to stay the same. I don't think that we're going to have -- the only thing -- the only difference, we're going to have increased security by police office. I don't think that anything, specifically, other than that, will change in the security at our school.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, Kyle. We appreciate you joining us this morning. We all send love --</p><p>KASHUV: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: and support to you and all of your friends and colleagues at the school. Kyle, good luck going back today, thank you.</p><p>KASHUV: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Kyle Kashuv, joining us there. Coming up, immigration crackdown despite a heads up from the mayor, ICE officials has arrested more than 150 illegal immigrants in a sweep in a California Sanctuary City. We're going to talk about that and why she gave the heads up to the criminals, and then, a major new milestone for the world's largest plane, details, coming up, back in a moment.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back, TSA, Transportation Security Administration, testing technology, now, in New York City that detects suicide vests, Lauren Simonetti with all the details, now, Lauren.</p><p>SIMONETTI: Pretty unbelievable, Maria, those tests taking place this week with Amtrak at New York's Penn Station, the move, coming after that failed pipe bomb attempt in a subway passage way back in December. That was just a couple blocks from Penn station. This vest detection technology uses special cameras that can scan for explosive devices, but the TSA says the equipment can see through clothing, no privacy concerns because the image is animated.</p><p>Well, a massive ICE sweep in Northern California, more than 150 illegal immigrants taken into custody despite warnings from the mayor of Oakland. The top ice officials said the mayor's warning lightly gave criminals a chance to escape. The agency is now asking the Department of Justice to look into whether she violated any laws with that warning.</p><p>Meanwhile, big win for President Trump and his border wall. A federal judge ruling against an environmental challenge to the wall, saying Congress and the President share responsibilities to protect the country. Border wall construction plans can now move forward.</p><p>While there is a chance that the U.S. may rejoin the Transpacific Partnership or the TPP. Treasury Secretary, Steve Mnuchin, says renegotiation is on the table and that he's been in talks with other countries about what it would take for the us to recommit. President Trump as you know, withdrew from President Obama's signature trade agreement last year but Secretary Steve Mnuchin adding rejoining is not a priority for the administration at the moment.</p><p>And a new way to launch satellite into outer space, now the Strata Launch - - the world's largest airplane which can reach a speed of 46 miles an hour on the taxiway, that's a big deal. It's has a wingspan of 385 feet. It can carry 100,000 pounds. It's designed to bring rockets to the stratosphere for a more affordable launch for a low orbit satellites. The Strata Launch could make its first test flight by next year. And of course, Maria, Microsoft Co-Founder, Paul Allen, is backing this. This is his company.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. All right. Lauren, thank you so much. I want to talk about this testing at Penn Station. What do you thinL?</p><p>CHAFFETZ: Coincidentally I was at Penn Station, and I saw them doing this testing. I think it's good technology. Let's remember that the Pentagon spent more than $20 billion trying to figure out how to identify, improvised explosive devices. And you know what, the single best way to do it is, dogs. We can have all the technology we want, we need more dogs, because dogs can find these things, they're mobile, and they're the best deterrent that we have.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We now have smart dogs or so, yes, I agree with that.</p><p>KISSEL: Should we be more concerned about the TSA? And I was looking at some of these tests that they do, where they try to get bombmaking materials through the security at airports, and they fail the majority of the time, the overwhelming majority of the time. Is that an agency that needs more congressional oversight?</p><p>CHAFFETZ: It does and they need to look at the priority. Because you know what, dogs, they don't have lobbyists, but the people that sell these machines, by the hundreds of millions of dollars, they do have lobbyists. And often times, they're deploying technology that doesn't work. The Pentagon doesn't send this technology overseas, they don't have this technology at the White House. When you walk in to go into the oval office, you don't go through this machine, you walk by a dog. That's why they use them it's because they're the most effective things.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Very deterrent, but by the way, I know you know this but $0.60 of the TSA fee that we pay when we fly, $0.60 of the $5.60 goes to deficit reduction. There is a billion-and-a half-dollars-plus being diverted for deficit reduction rather than it being spent on actual airport security every year.</p><p>KISSEL: You wonder where all that money goes, you know, when you go through JFK or LaGuardia, you see all these people standing around, are they really looking out for our security? Is that a crack force that's going to find the next bomb?</p><p>CHAFFETZ: Security badges that airports biggest thing. There are 13,000 people with a security badge at Dulles airport in Washington D.C. One of those people slipping by at the wrong time, and you got a real problem.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And a TSA agent smacked my dog in the face by an accident, because he messing with it in August.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's incredible.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes, so, that's what they're busy doing. Hitting fluffy, little 15-pound animals.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That was Charlie.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes, I'm not joking.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BARTIROMO: I'm sorry to hear that. We'll take break. When we come back, the rise of the new Silicon Valley; how the Middle East is giving its California tech mecca a run for its money and market share. We're going to take a look. Back in a minute.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Now, the latest in Silicon Valley, Apple shares hitting all- time high yesterday. Take a look, 178.50 is where the stock is now, up 30 percent this past year. Netflix is still driving the so-called fang stocks already up better than 45 percent this year. Joining us right now to talk more about tech and where the growth in the world is today is Chemi Peres, Chairman of the Peres Center for Peace and Innovation, and Managing General Partner of Pitango Venture Capital. Chemi, good to see you. Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>CHEMI PERES, CHAIRMAN, PERES CENTER FOR PEACE AND INNOVATION AND MANAGING GENERAL PARTNER OF PITANGO VENTURE CAPITAL: Good to see you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Tell us what you're doing at Pitango and where you see growth in terms of innovation in the world today. You've been investing in a number of areas in tech.</p><p>PERES: For the best 25 years, we've been investing in Israeli technology, we're investing at growth stage, at early-stage, and incubation. And I think that the great thing that we're seeing; number one, probably, is cybersecurity, where it is a great concern around the world. Terrorism is globalized, so we are taking care of that. Secondly, there's tremendous innovation in A.I., machine learning, and deep learning to connect devices and machines to the Internet, to create new services. Thirdly, most likely is a precision medicine to help us get better and earlier.</p><p>And probably, I would say, in addition to those kinds of innovations, we're seeing also the attempt to decentralize the currency systems, to give it more freedom through blockchain technologies. And I think that what you've seen right now in terms of the share prices, you see that the greatest companies today in the world are technology companies pushing away, you know, oil, and gas, and chemicals, and construction. So, we are moving to a new world.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We sure are.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: Artificial intelligence is a big promise. There's a lot of good that can be done, there's also a lot of bad that can be done with artificial intelligence. So, where do you see that going, and how do we control it or does it need to be controlled?</p><p>PERES: So, first of all, you are very much right. Technology without moral values is very dangerous, so we have to develop more values. One of the trends that we're seeing also in the investment space, is that people are trying to achieve double bottom line, make progress on technology, but at the same time, make the world safer by using technology for the better. And I think this is a great challenge that human beings are facing in the next 10 to 20 years.</p><p>KISSEL: Chemi, should we be thinking about Israel is the second Silicon Valley? And for investors out there that are sick of the fang stocks here in the United States, you know, what are the companies that they should be looking at over there?</p><p>PERES: So, I think you shouldn't look at it as a second Silicon Valley, you should look at it as a first innovation nation. It's a nation that both created not from the land but from the mind. Everything that happen in Israel was not build upon the land. We cannot use the land for natural resources for food or water. Everything that we do, state foundation, security, economy, and peace-building is only with our brain. So, you should think of Israel as an empire of the mind, as a model for nations that would like to transition themselves from the old world where they rely on the land, to the new world which is limitless based on the brain power. That's the way you need to look at it.</p><p>KISSEL: Companies? Any companies?</p><p>PERES: Companies, probably the biggest company now emerging is Technologies Checkpoint, which is doing security, and other great company, I would say, is the company that Intel-acquired Mobile Eye, which now is turning to be a center for autonomous driving in Israel. But you know, we have 7,000 companies in Israel, and probably five percent of them are emerging as new, great ideas. And I think that in the next 10 years, we'll see tremendous number of Israeli companies really changing the world.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Your father used to talk about this a lot. The late great Shimon Peres, which talks about Israel as this hub for innovation. Why is that? Why has Israel been able to really compete with the best of the best in terms of innovation and technology growth?</p><p>PERES: So, as I said there, Maria, basically, you cannot build anything, because we have -- on the land, because our land is so small, it does not provide any shelter, no food, no water. So, we had to build everything on our brain power. So, number one is necessity, and the second thing I think is the notion that Israel wants to make the world better, to change the world for better. My father would say, most likely, that our biggest contribution for human beings is dissatisfaction; we're never satisfied with everything. So, we need to check everything with technology.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I like that. Great.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BARTIROMO: By the way, the president announced, obviously, his future plans with the City of Jerusalem back in December of 2017 to move the embassy to Jerusalem. You're happy with this decision, obviously?</p><p>PERES: Obviously, I'm very happy. Not everything that is done for Israel is necessarily bad for other people. That should've been done in 1947 when Israel was established as a nation. Celebrating our 70th anniversary. I think it's a great present to fix what was wrong. It should have been, from day one, our capital.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Chemi, it's good to see you.</p><p>PERES: Good to see you, too. Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Chemi Peres. We'll be right back.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Wednesday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Wednesday, February 28th.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

Good Thursday morning everybody. Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Thursday -- March 1.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Your top stories right now at 7:00 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The winning streak was snapped, the Dow ending February on a sour note falling nearly 400 points yesterday. It was the worst month since January 2016 for both the Dow and the S&amp;P 500 which snapped 10-month winning streaks for both indices. That was the longest streak, by the way, since 1959. So should investors beware of the ides of March?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Futures showing the markets will open lower this morning. This is the low of the morning so far. We're looking at a decline of 131 points on the Dow Industrials, that's one-half of 1 percent, down 12 points on the S&amp;P and down 28 on the Nasdaq.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Investors are watching key remarks today from Federal Reserve chairman J. Powell once again as he testifies today before the Senate Banking Committee this morning.</p><p>In Europe, right across the board, we're looking at declines there as well with the FT 100, the CAC 40 and the DAX index down between 1 percent and one and two-thirds percent.</p><p>In Asia overnight mixed performances. South Korea was closed for a holiday but the worst performer was Japan, Nikkei average down 1.5 percent.</p><p>Getting tough on guns -- President Trump telling lawmakers yesterday they need to come together on gun control regardless of outside pressure.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: This is not a popular thing to say in terms of the NRA, but I'm saying it anyway. I'm going to have to say it.</p><p>You can't buy -- think of it. You can buy a handgun. You can't buy one, you have to wait until you're 21, but you can buy the kind of weapon used in the school shooting at 18. I think it's something you have to think about. But lot of people don't even want to bring it up because they're afraid to bring it up.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: The debate comes as companies take matters into their own hands. Wal-Mart, for example, taking a lead from Dick's Sporting Goods. Wal-Mart says it will stop selling guns to anyone under the age of 21. More on the major changes retailers are making, coming up.</p><p>And a shootout caught on tape. Look at this. The shocking scene as over 60 bullets are fired in just 15 seconds in a gunfight between police and a suspect.</p><p>Then YouTube bias -- the technology giant says moderators mistakenly pulled right wing channels from the site. What a surprise.</p><p>Martin Shkreli begs for mercy, saying he was a fool. His plea to the judge as he faces up to 10 years in prison.</p><p>All those stories coming up this Thursday morning. And joining me to break it all down: Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell, Fox Business Network's Connell McShane and the \"Wall Street Journal's\" assistant editorial page editor James Freeman. Great to see everybody.</p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, ASSISTANT EDITORIAL PAGE EDITOR, \"WALL STREET JOURNAL\": Good to be here. Thanks.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Good morning.</p><p>CONNELL MCSHANE, FBN HOST: Nobody will argue with Shkreli that he's a fool, I guess.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You're not going to go against that.</p><p>MCSHANE: It's an important story --</p><p>BARTIROMO: You're not going to take the other side on that -- James?</p><p>FREEMAN: I was trying to think of an opposite argument but --</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN HOST: this is something one of our viewers raised yesterday. But I'm waiting to a see a constitutional challenge to a Wal- Mart or a Dick's that if you're going to deny the purchase of a rifle or shotgun to someone under the age of 21 when legally it's still the national law that the age is 18 at the federal level for these weapons.</p><p>By the way, this was virtue signaling and some attempted good PR yesterday from Wal-Mart and particularly Dick's. Dick's stopped selling these assault style rifles six years ago. Wal-Mart stopped selling them back in 2015.</p><p>MCSHANE: But still sold them in one of their affiliates -- right.</p><p>MCDOWELL: It was like 30 some odd stores that Dick's sold them in but broadly speaking, the chain nationally hasn't sold them in six years. So - -</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wal-Mart may get pressure from customers or you know, anti-gun people saying look, Dick's Sporting Goods just did that, what are you going to do? I mean a lot of these companies are getting pressure from their customers, also.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And by the way -- Dick's we should say sold a shotgun to the Parkland, Florida killer Nikolas Cruz back in November. It was not used in the shooting at the high school but nevertheless, this is nothing but public relations.</p><p>They can act like it's something about morality but it's not. It's virtue signaling.</p><p>FREEMAN: I think there are a lot of customers and they talk about the NRA like it's some special interest representing the gun industry. It has power because there are millions and millions of Americans who treasure their Second Amendment rights. You get rid of the NRA -- that would not change. There would be another vehicle to express that feeling that is broadly held in the United States.</p><p>But speaking of public relations, Martin Shkreli does seem to be someone who could use improved public relations. Maybe he could be Hope Hicks' first client.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wow.</p><p>MCSHANE: Very good.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: We're talking about Hope Hicks coming up.</p><p>Joining the conversation this morning: the counselor to the President Kellyanne Conway is with us this morning; country music icon, military vet and award-winning TV host Craig Morgan with us as well. Lots to talk about on both of those cases.</p><p>You don't want to miss a moment of it so do stay with us.</p><p>We kick it off this hour though with this. President Trump expected to take action this afternoon by rolling out a package aimed at making schools safer. The President took to Twitter earlier this morning, writing this. \"Many ideas, some good, some not so good, emerged from our bipartisan meeting on school safety yesterday at the White House. Background checks, a big part of the conversation; gun-free zones, a proven target of killers. After many years a bill should emerge. Respect the Second Amendment.\"</p><p>This comes after he publicly sparred with Republicans yesterday over concealed carry and NRA influence. Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: We can do that with an executive order. I'm going to write the bump stock, essentially write it out. So you won't have to worry about bump stocks. Shortly that will be gone. We can focus on other things.</p><p>Joe and Pat, in your bill, what do you think about the 18 to 21?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We need to change that.</p><p>TRUMP: Ok. Are you going to leave that? A lot of people don't even want to bring it up because they're afraid to bring it up.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We didn't address it, Mr. President. But I think --</p><p>TRUMP: You know why? Because you're afraid of the NRA.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Let's bring in RNC national spokesperson Kayleigh McEnany. Kayleigh -- good to see you. Thanks very much for joining us this morning.</p><p>So you just heard the President there.</p><p>KAYLEIGH MCENANY, RNC NATIONAL SPOKESPERSON: Thanks -- Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Are Republicans too afraid to act because of the NRA? Are they afraid of the NRA? Is that what it is?</p><p>MCENANY: Well, look, I think the NRA's obviously a powerful lobbying group and the President was pointing that out and it's not just Republicans. There are moderate Democrats too.</p><p>And you know, he was pointing out that we need to have one special interest and that's the American people. That's the square focus of this. That's President Trump's square focus and he's saying that no lobbying group should keep us away from meaningful compromise when it comes to guns.</p><p>MCSHANE: When a Republican president though looks at a Republican senator and says you're afraid to act because you're afraid of the NRA, how does that go over. How is that going over with Republicans that you've spoken with since those comments?</p><p>MCENANY: Well, since then the senators came out -- Senator Toomy and said I don't think President Trump was meaning that directly towards me. He was saying it more generally that the NRA has a lot of influence over a lot of elected officials. So no Republicans are too upset about it.</p><p>I think right now we're just trying to find solutions for those kids to make sure that this never ever happens again in this country.</p><p>FREEMAN: Kayleigh -- I'm wondering, is there any effort here in the administration to fix what went wrong at the FBI in this case? It seems to me when credible reports come in with a specific name and a specific warning about a specific action that is going to be taken, you would hope they would respond.</p><p>MCENANY: Oh, absolutely. There will be multiple, multiple investigations into that. President Trump has said it's inexcusable that the ball was dropped there. Likewise, the local police department.</p><p>We need to have meaningful warning signs that we look into and that we pursue vigorously. But what President Trump has said, we need to make sure that we can actually take these weapons away from individuals who are mentally ill.</p><p>That's so important. Because there can be a million warning signs but unless we have the means and the statutory tools to make change, then those warning signs will really fall on deaf ears.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But Kayleigh -- it's Dagen McDowell -- he said take the firearms first, then go to court. Take the gun first, due process second. That's a violation of the Fifth Amendment. So what did he mean by that?</p><p>Because it seemed he was getting in a back and forth with Vice President Pence who was talking about these gun violence restraining orders which it gives families, law enforcement, prosecutors a way to get weapons out of the hands of people who are potentially a threat to themselves or someone else but there is due process. You have to go to court.</p><p>And President Trump said take the guns, due process second. Did he misspeak?</p><p>MCENANY: No, Dagen. I think this was -- look, this was a discussion. Most of the time the media isn't let in on these conversations. We were let in on it to see this discussion and these ideas bouncing around.</p><p>Today we'll get the official proposals. Everything that's done will be constitutional. It will be above board. But I think President Trump is expressing frustration that we knew this individual wanted to be a school shooter. He said it himself.</p><p>The police had gone there. And yet, he still has these weapons and still wreaks havoc on society and ends multiple lives. So I think it was just a free-flowing discussion. Today we will get the official proposals.</p><p>But I'm glad the media was let in on that. I'm glad the American people saw that serious discussion happen.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Did you get a lot of comments from Republicans, the GOP? What did they say about that comment?</p><p>MCENANY: Well look, we're happy about what we saw yesterday because finally we have a president that's putting politics aside --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>MCENANY: -- and just having a pragmatic discussion. That's what we need is a pragmatic discussion. And what you saw yesterday was the ultimate deal maker, the ultimate pragmatist in President Trump bringing the two sides together. So our party was thrilled about that.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I just need to add something, they didn't see that as a pragmatic discussion. They saw it as someone that was chucking the constitution and was talking about confiscating people's weapons without even a court order. That's what a lot of people heard. And people were outraged. People who were Trump supporters were very upset by that.</p><p>MCENANY: This was just a discussion though. What we saw yesterday --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, the cameras were rolling.</p><p>MCENANY: This was not laying out the legislative -- sure it was not laying out the official legislative solutions. But President Trump is frustrated. Most Americans are frustrated. When we look at polls to the tune of 70 percent to 80 percent are supporting most of the policies that were discussed yesterday. We'll get the official policies out today. But I think that was important to see and we've got to get weapons out of the hands of those who want to commit atrocities like what we saw in Parkland, Florida. It's inexcusable.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, that's a different conversation, getting guns out of the mentally ill. I mean what Dagen is talking about is take the guns first and then court later. I mean, due process second. So we're talking about two different things.</p><p>MCENANY: It's the same thing, because President Trump is not talking about confiscating weapons from Americans. He's a supporter of the Second Amendment. He's a supporter of the NRA. He's talking about individuals like Nikolas Cruz -- I hate to even use the kid's name. He's a murderer. That's what we're talking about.</p><p>He's the biggest supporter of the Second Amendment there is but he's also a supporter of making sure these shootings don't happen.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Let me switch gears and ask you about the White House shakeup, latest news here.</p><p>The President's communications director Hope Hicks announced yesterday she plans to leave within the next few weeks. President Trump reacted to the resignation in a statement, writing this in part, \"Hope is outstanding and has done great work for the last three years. I will miss having her by my side. But when she approached me about pursuing other opportunities I totally understood.\"</p><p>Kayleigh -- what's your reaction to this? Is this because of that testimony the other day you think where she said sometimes she has to say white lies to protect the President?</p><p>MCENANY: No, it's not because Hope had told many people before that testimony that she was leaving. So several people knew. It had nothing to do with the testimony. She was looking at other opportunities for a very long time. She's a valued member of this administration.</p><p>But Maria -- three years working nonstop, you know, 18-hour days in many cases, that's a long time. So it's perfectly reasonable that she would want to move forward. It really had nothing to do with the testimony.</p><p>BARTIROMO: The timing is -- I mean she's a communications expert, right? I mean to come out the day after the testimony and say I'm stepping down to pursue other opportunities, sounds a little sketchy there.</p><p>MCENANY: Well, the timing is what it is --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: I'm wondering if the Democrats -- I'm wondering if the Democrats set her up. I mean they kept asking apparently in the testimony, did you ever lie for the President. Have you ever told white lies for the President. And then she acquiesced and said yes, like things like, you know, he's in a meeting when he's really not in a meeting. And then immediately that quote of \"I tell white lies\" was leaked.</p><p>So once again we've got the leakers out in force on the left. So was that part of it, do you think?</p><p>MCENANY: Maria, that's exactly right. I do think the Democrats set her up. You know, she -- Hope's goal was complete honesty in this testimony. She took great pains to ensure she was providing accurate answers. And so accurate to say, you know, yes, maybe one time I said he was in a meeting when he actually wasn't and the Democrats ran with it. I think that's spot-on.</p><p>Hope is a valued member of this administration and we thank her for her service at the Republican Party.</p><p>FREEMAN: Yes. Just to add a little context there, often I think as we talk to public relations people, representing politicians, the little white lie is standard for instance, when they say yes, my boss very much enjoys talking to you.</p><p>MCENANY: That's right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's a good point -- James. You're right.</p><p>MCENANY: Yes. And I'm sure he doesn't enjoy talking to much of the mainstream media who is on an effort to get him.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Kayleigh -- what's with this war of words between Attorney General Jeff Sessions and the President? Of course, the President tweeted out yesterday, questioning Sessions asking the inspector general to investigate potentially massive FISA abuses. Sessions fought back saying in part that he will continue to do this work in a fair and impartial manner according to the law and constitution as long as he is attorney general.</p><p>Why doesn't the President just go directly to Sessions and confront him rather than calling him out on Twitter?</p><p>MCENANY: I'm sure he has. But the President's frustrated, you know. He appointed an attorney general and on many of these investigations he's having to recuse himself or step down. And the Justice Department isn't functioning as President Trump would like it to function.</p><p>You know, these FISA abuses are serious. They're real. We have a Department of Justice with prosecutorial power and President Trump wants them to do their job and look into it. So that's why. He's out there and he wants to say it publicly that he wants the DOJ to step up and put pressure on them.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. We will leave it there. Kayleigh -- good to see you. Thanks so much.</p><p>MCENANY: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Kayleigh McEnany joining us there.</p><p>We've got this breaking news. The President just tweeted this and we want to get this out. He says \"Our steel and aluminum industries and many others have been decimated by decades of unfair trade and bad policy with countries from around the world. We must not let our country, companies, and workers be taken advantage of any longer. We want free, fair and smart trade.\" That's from the President.</p><p>James Freeman -- I know you have comments on that. We'll get back to that after this short break. Back in a minute, everybody.</p><p>Stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>Now this, Broadcom making an appeal to Qualcomm shareholders to support the proposed merger.</p><p>Lauren Simonetti with all the details now -- Lauren.</p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Well Broadcom, Maria, is continuing to pursue a proposed merger with rival Qualcomm. Broadcom now urging Qualcomm shareholders to vote for all six Broadcom nominees at the upcoming shareholder meeting which is next week.</p><p>Broadcom recently lowered its hostile takeover bid for Qualcomm after Qualcomm raised it's own bid for NXP Semiconductor. There was a best and final offer of $121 billion -- that was on Monday.</p><p>Take a look at Broadcom shares, down a third of 1 percent in the premarket. Qualcomm shares in the pre-market are down just fractionally.</p><p>So we'll continue to watch this story for you which could be the biggest tech deal we've ever seen.</p><p>Check this out. Stunning video from the San Francisco Police Department, officials showing us the body camera video. Seven officers firing at least 65 times -- 65 times within 15 seconds at a suspect that's holed up in an RV on a residential street. The suspect was ordered to come out several times but he fired two shots instead. Listen.</p><p>Scary stuff. The suspect was linked to a homicide as well as a carjacking. Amazingly in that situation nobody was hurt.</p><p>Best Buy is moving to cut costs as more of us shop online. The company closing its 250 mobile phone stores in the U.S. by June. Best Buy says it will continue to sell cell phones online and in these big stores.</p><p>They also just announced quarterly earnings. Revenue of $15.3 billion better than expected. And look at this -- shares rallying 5.5 percent in the premarket.</p><p>Well, this is a fun story. The Utah legislature taking a page from schoolhouse rock. Lawmakers explaining the lawmaking process, how a bill becomes law with some help from the Fresh Prince of Bel-Air.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: In a legislator's mind an idea is raised.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: In the law book is where they spend most of their days.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Drafting out, maxing out, hardly relaxing -- all cool.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And all introducing bills inside of house chambers.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SIMONETTI: Who says politics wasn't cool. That video seen tens of thousands of times since it was tweeted out yesterday. So there you have it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I love that. That is so great. Thanks -- Lauren.</p><p>Coming up, another case of big tech bias -- YouTube caught removing conservative channels from the Web site. Why the company claims it was all a mistake by its moderation team.</p><p>And then the essence of Einstein, how Levi's claims it bottled the scent of the genius -- next.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>Breaking news this morning. E.U. tech crackdown -- the European Union has issued new guidelines for technology companies saying that they must remove terror and illegal content within one hour after it's flagged by authorities.</p><p>Joining us right now to talk tech is Kairos founder and CEO Ankur Jain. Ankur -- good to see you.</p><p>ANKUR JAIN, FOUNDER, KAIROS: Thanks. Good to see you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>We were just talking in the commercial break about a bigger technology regulatory hand. Are you expecting the rules and regulations to get stiffer for tech?</p><p>JAIN: Yes. I mean look, it's a tough spot right now, right. Because technology companies in many ways have more power and influence on our lives than even governments. And yet we don't have the same kind of accountability structure that governments, you know, conceptually do.</p><p>And so I think one of the things you're going to see now over the next couple months or the next year at least is either governments are going to regulate tech or tech has to regulate itself.</p><p>Unfortunately, I don't think we've seen that level of responsibility yet from the tech companies.</p><p>MCSHANE: How would a company -- say you're a tech CEO and we've dealt with this here in the U.S. too, it's not just Europe where we've had hearings in Washington about it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, remember Microsoft.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right, right. Yes, to go back that far. But now, just in the present day, as we're looking at these things, if you're seeing it come at your company, to your point about regulating yourself, how do you step up and get out ahead of (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>JAIN: There's obviously a proactive and reactive side.</p><p>MCSHANE: Right.</p><p>JAIN: I think the biggest challenge right now is when you look at how much the tech companies shape the content and information that we all consume as citizens, obviously that has a tremendous effect on our political environment, our social environment, et cetera. The challenge is, there's no easy solution to just say here's the rules and we go because there's so much gray area.</p><p>But I think having even a third party group that's outside of the tech business with a set of rules, like any media company, like Fox or any group has a set of clear guidelines.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Like the business council in business.</p><p>JAIN: That's right. The problem is, it's a group of entrepreneurs trying to figure out what the right thing is for everybody else and frankly it's not fair to the founders to know all the answers -- right.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right.</p><p>JAIN: But it's also not fair to the society to expect no regulation or no support on that side..</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But I just feel like that they continue to -- these technology companies, particularly these social media companies, continue to over- step. And at first it's oh, we rolled out the Facebook Live feature. We didn't know how people would abuse it with live suicides or violent crimes.</p><p>But this past week people on Facebook started getting this message about facial recognition. I don't know if you saw it.</p><p>JAIN: I did.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Hi, we're working on making Facebook better, we're adding more ways to use facial recognition. You can find photos you're tagged in but haven't been tagged. And it said, you can turn it on at any time. They said it was off, which applies to features we may add later.</p><p>So they were acting like it was an opt-in. Mine was an opt-out. It's a huge -- I had to go in there and it was already on, and again, I just feel like that they act like they're noble and doing no evil. But they're being reckless and they know what they're doing.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. And then there's this whole pushback on any conservative ideas. You know, why is Peter Thiel leaving San Francisco and moving his whole business to L.A. because he says that there's constant pushback and inability and unwillingness to hear any other diversity of ideas.</p><p>Look at YouTube, moderators employed by YouTube to spot fake news and misleading and extreme videos. They say it was a mistake but they removed numerous conservative content channels. What's going on with tech?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>JAIN: Yes. Look -- It's not just conservative views. I think one of the challenges right now is that it's become such an echo chamber of all ideas. And so I think what you're going to start to see is some of the best tech minds moving out of just Silicon Valley. I think you're seeing New York already boom.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You came to New York.</p><p>JAIN: I moved to New York. You're seeing Peter Thiel and others moving to L.A. I think the more we start to see the proliferation of technology companies be outside of the one geographic area, it will change, right you have different perspectives, different views.</p><p>We've talked about this last month. When people in the Valley start to think that the biggest problem in the world, I think we talked about that $4,000 treadmill last time I was here, there's a disconnect with some of the reality challenges there. But you still want the best and brightest minds to have the freedom to push the limits of innovation. So it's finding that right balance.</p><p>FREEMAN: Ok. But I'm not questioning whether social media companies have discriminated against conservative views. Do you see that or do you think this is an honest mistake? A drafting error on the algorithm?</p><p>JAIN: Look, you have individual bad actors in the system. That's the challenge, right. I think as a company no executive would condone that kind of behavior or allow that in advance, right. But like the Twitter if you guys remember when the one rogue Twitter employee shut down President Trump's account --</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>JAIN: The challenge for this right now is that when it comes to major decisions you need to operate fast and at scale to give people the autonomy to do that but then you end up with these bad actors.</p><p>And so I think as we start to see the regulation and the penalties for the bad acting, it will force the companies to find kind of fail-safes for these kind of issues.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It's a good analysis. Ok. Tell us about your new business -- the future of renting.</p><p>JAIN: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Rhino -- you launched it yesterday. It's the newest launch from Kairos. You found a solution for security deposits that you say were debilitating for so many apartment renters.</p><p>JAIN: If you remember at Kairos, we're trying now to find new innovation to help everyday folks. I think that's one of the areas that unfortunately not enough technology companies are focused on.</p><p>And when you look at the cost of renting today, people are spending upwards of 60 percent of their income on rent. And so our goal was, there's two parts, how do we reduce the upfront burden for people moving into a new place and how do we reduce the recurring monthly costs.</p><p>And we started with the former. So with Rhino, which launched yesterday, starting in New York 23,000 renters are going to be able to get back thousands of dollars from their landlords that was locked away for as long as they rented.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Because it was a security deposit.</p><p>JAIN: That's right. You put up -- I mean there's $40 billion that renters have locked away that they don't ever really get back because it goes from one apartment to the other. And then meanwhile, 50 percent of Americans can't even afford a $400 emergency expense.</p><p>So starting now, people will be able to file a claim, get back the deposit, it's a small $10 monthly insurance deposit to protect them and their landlord. And we think giving people back thousands of dollars, you've got your tax rebate and you have Rhino -- right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's great.</p><p>FREEMAN: But if people are paying 60 percent of their income to rent and they don't have the savings so they need to finance the deposit -- isn't that an argument that we need to pay less for housing?</p><p>JAIN: Well so if you remember at Kairos we're trying now to find new innovation to help everyday folks.</p><p>I think that's one of the areas that unfortunately not enough technology companies are focused on and when you look at the cost of renting today, people are spending upward of 60 percent of their income on rent.</p><p>And so, our goal was, there's two parts, how do we reduce the upfront burden for people moving into a new place and then having to reduce recurring monthly cost and we're starting with the former.</p><p>So, with Rhino which launched yesterday, starting in New York 23,000 renters are going to be able to get back thousands of dollars from their landlords that was locked away for as long as they rented -</p><p>BARTIROMO: Because it was a security deposit?</p><p>JAIN: - that's right, you put up - I there's $40 billion that renters have locked away that they don't ever really get back because it goes from one apartment to the other.</p><p>And then in the meanwhile 50 percent of Americans can't even afford a four- hundred-dollar emergency expense.</p><p>So, starting now people will be able to file a claim, get back their deposit, it's a small $10 a month insurance policy that protects them and their landlord, and we think giving people back thousands of dollars, you've got your tax rebate and you have Rhino.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's great.</p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, ASSISTANT EDITORIAL PAGE EDITOR, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL: But if people are paying 60 percent of their income to rent -</p><p>JAIN: Yes.</p><p>FREEMAN: - and they don't have the savings so they need to finance the deposit -</p><p>JAIN: Yes.</p><p>FREEMAN: - isn't that an argument that they need to pay less for housing?</p><p>JAIN: Well it's - first of all there's - there's choices (INAUDIBLE) -</p><p>FREEMAN: I know it's -</p><p>JAIN: - (INAUDIBLE) -</p><p>FREEMAN: - not for fun but-</p><p>JAIN: - I mean, but it's also you don't want to finance the deposit.</p><p>I don't think people should be taking on more debt right now, that's part of the problem, right.</p><p>Is we don't think people should have that financial burden in the first place so with Rhino there is no debt, there is no loan, you're basically buying a small, affordable, insurance policy because most renters aren't bad actors, right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>JAIN: And there's no reason for landlords to be locking up $40 billion of people's money.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's a great idea!</p><p>Another great idea from you Ankur.</p><p>Thanks for -</p><p>JAIN: (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>BARTIROMO: - thanks for bringing it to us.</p><p>JAIN: Thanks, so much guys.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Ankur Jain, we'll be watching; check out Rhino.</p><p>Coming up a change of heart on gun control, President Trump says it's time for lawmakers to come together on the issue.

He tweets and says a lot, you want to look at the results.</p><p>So, I guess so, I wonder from Grover, how do you think this ends up?</p><p>Is it just focused on keeping the mentally ill from guns, what comes of all this?</p><p>NORQUIST: Right. That's a very interesting question because having people who have mental health challenges that makes them a danger to themselves and others, that should've been in NICS (ph).</p><p>And it was the Democrats who kept it out, back in the 1990s, the National Rifle Association and Republicans thought it was a good idea but the other guys thought it was stigmatizing people to tell this young man in Florida, you - we think there's a problem with you.</p><p>You don't want to hurt his feelings, that's the Democrat problem. For decades we've lived with their mistake both the National Rifle Association and Republicans have always been willing to change that and the Democrats are trying to tell you to look someplace else.</p><p>Let's fix that problem and let's -</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>NORQUIST: - not have gun free zones that make students a target because parents and administrators don't have the ability to `carry concealed' in schools, to make them safer.</p><p>We want safer schools, the left just wants gun control; that's why the conversation is so odd.</p><p>We're talking about how to make school safe -</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>NORQUIST: - and they just want to steal people's guns and they've been at it for decades so we kind of -</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>NORQUIST: - know where they're going.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And that's a conversation right now, gun control, even though we know how many times the -</p><p>NORQUIST: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: - signals and the signs were there, particularly about Nikolas Cruz -</p><p>NORQUIST: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: - and there was a massive failure on the part of the FBI and the local police.</p><p>NORQUIST: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We can't have you on without talking about tax reform and growth, Grover.</p><p>So, I've got to ask you -</p><p>NORQUIST: That's what I assumed that we were talking -</p><p>BARTIROMO: Sorry -</p><p>NORQUIST: - about here.</p><p>BARTIROMO: - about that Grover. You know, we have to get into the -</p><p>NORQUIST: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: - issue of the day.</p><p>Let me ask you about your thoughts on growth.</p><p>Companies are reportedly buying back their stock at a quicker pace following the cut in corporate taxes.</p><p>\"The Journal\" says -</p><p>NORQUIST: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: - that share buybacks from US businesses has exceeded $300 billion in the past three months.</p><p>What do you think about that?</p><p>And also, look at this, Atlanta Fed going from 5.4 percent growth, now they are at 2 1/2 percent growth, that they're expecting.</p><p>We also saw our GDP number that came down from the third quarter, now we're talking about growth of 2 1/2 percent.</p><p>Has your expectation changed of economic growth of four percent in `18 and where we are right now?</p><p>NORQUIST: No. I think we're looking very - moving forward very well.</p><p>The really good news is that companies are doing stock buybacks.</p><p>Why does that matter?</p><p>That means the companies are looking at bringing billions of dollars back from overseas and they say, `what's the best way I could spend a billion dollars, buying another company, starting a new line of business, or is our business is so good that we want to invest in us.'</p><p>Now that money doesn't disappear, they buy those stocks from somebody and the new investor reinvests that money to his or her highest and best value.</p><p>So, the money doesn't disappear in a buyback it moves between investors and it's a company saying, `we think we're the best game in town.'</p><p>I want to be invested in a firm whose management thinks the best thing you can do with a billion dollars is invest it in yourself because they think the future looks so good.</p><p>FREEMAN: We should note in that Journal story on - from the new side of our paper, it did note that a lot of CEOs along with planning buybacks also talking about more capital investment Grover, which is -</p><p>NORQUIST: Yes.</p><p>FREEMAN: - really that's going to be the test of this tax reform right.</p><p>It's higher investment because we're - we're rewarding more investment in the United States.</p><p>NORQUIST: We're bringing more capital in from overseas and more from the United States per worker, that gives you productivity increases, that gives your higher wages.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right site sounds like you're still positive on this tax plan Grover?</p><p>NORQUIST: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Good to -</p><p>NORQUIST: Absolutely.</p><p>BARTIROMO: - see you sir.

Good Thursday morning everybody.   Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Thursday -- March 1.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Your top stories right now at 7:00 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The winning streak was snapped, the Dow ending February on a sour note  falling nearly 400 points yesterday.  It was the worst month since January  2016 for both the Dow and the S&amp;P 500 which snapped 10-month winning  streaks for both indices.  That was the longest streak, by the way, since  1959.  So should investors beware of the ides of March?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Futures showing the markets will open lower this morning.  This is the low  of the morning so far.  We're looking at a decline of 131 points on the Dow  Industrials, that's one-half of 1 percent, down 12 points on the S&amp;P and  down 28 on the Nasdaq.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Investors are watching key remarks today from Federal Reserve chairman J.  Powell once again as he testifies today before the Senate Banking Committee  this morning.</p><p>In Europe, right across the board, we're looking at declines there as well  with the FT 100, the CAC 40 and the DAX index down between 1 percent and  one and two-thirds percent.</p><p>In Asia overnight mixed performances.  South Korea was closed for a holiday  but the worst performer was Japan, Nikkei average down 1.5 percent.</p><p>Getting tough on guns -- President Trump telling lawmakers yesterday they  need to come together on gun control regardless of outside pressure.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  This is not a popular thing  to say in terms of the NRA, but I'm saying it anyway.  I'm going to have to  say it.</p><p>You can't buy -- think of it.  You can buy a handgun.  You can't buy one,  you have to wait until you're 21, but you can buy the kind of weapon used  in the school shooting at 18.  I think it's something you have to think  about.  But lot of people don't even want to bring it up because they're  afraid to bring it up.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The debate comes as companies take matters into their own  hands.  Wal-Mart, for example, taking a lead from Dick's Sporting Goods.   Wal-Mart says it will stop selling guns to anyone under the age of 21.   More on the major changes retailers are making, coming up.</p><p>And a shootout caught on tape.  Look at this.  The shocking scene as over  60 bullets are fired in just 15 seconds in a gunfight between police and a  suspect.</p><p>Then YouTube bias -- the technology giant says moderators mistakenly pulled  right wing channels from the site.  What a surprise. </p><p>Martin Shkreli begs for mercy, saying he was a fool.  His plea to the judge  as he faces up to 10 years in prison.</p><p>All those stories coming up this Thursday morning.  And joining me to break  it all down: Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell, Fox Business Network's  Connell McShane and the \"Wall Street Journal's\" assistant editorial page  editor James Freeman.  Great to see everybody.  </p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, ASSISTANT EDITORIAL PAGE EDITOR, \"WALL STREET JOURNAL\":   Good to be here.  Thanks.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good morning.  </p><p>CONNELL MCSHANE, FBN HOST:  Nobody will argue with Shkreli that he's a  fool, I guess.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're not going to go against that.</p><p>MCSHANE:  It's an important story -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're not going to take the other side on that -- James?  </p><p>FREEMAN:  I was trying to think of an opposite argument but -- </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN HOST:  this is something one of our viewers raised  yesterday.  But I'm waiting to a see a constitutional challenge to a Wal- Mart or a Dick's that if you're going to deny the purchase of a rifle or  shotgun to someone under the age of 21 when legally it's still the national  law that the age is 18 at the federal level for these weapons.</p><p>By the way, this was virtue signaling and some attempted good PR yesterday  from Wal-Mart and particularly Dick's.  Dick's stopped selling these  assault style rifles six years ago.  Wal-Mart stopped selling them back in  2015.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  But still sold them in one of their affiliates -- right.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  It was like 30 some odd stores that Dick's sold them in but  broadly speaking, the chain nationally hasn't sold them in six years.  So - - </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wal-Mart may get pressure from customers or you know, anti-gun  people saying look, Dick's Sporting Goods just did that, what are you going  to do?  I mean a lot of these companies are getting pressure from their  customers, also.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And by the way -- Dick's we should say sold a shotgun to the  Parkland, Florida killer Nikolas Cruz back in November.  It was not used in  the shooting at the high school but nevertheless, this is nothing but  public relations. </p><p>They can act like it's something about morality but it's not.  It's virtue  signaling.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  I think there are a lot of customers and they talk about the NRA  like it's some special interest representing the gun industry.  It has  power because there are millions and millions of Americans who treasure  their Second Amendment rights.  You get rid of the NRA -- that would not  change.  There would be another vehicle to express that feeling that is  broadly held in the United States.</p><p>But speaking of public relations, Martin Shkreli does seem to be someone  who could use improved public relations.  Maybe he could be Hope Hicks'  first client.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p>MCSHANE:  Very good.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We're talking about Hope Hicks coming up.</p><p>Joining the conversation this morning: the counselor to the President  Kellyanne Conway is with us this morning; country music icon, military vet  and award-winning TV host Craig Morgan with us as well.  Lots to talk about  on both of those cases.</p><p>You don't want to miss a moment of it so do stay with us.</p><p>We kick it off this hour though with this.  President Trump expected to  take action this afternoon by rolling out a package aimed at making schools  safer.  The President took to Twitter earlier this morning, writing this.   \"Many ideas, some good, some not so good, emerged from our bipartisan  meeting on school safety yesterday at the White House.  Background checks,  a big part of the conversation; gun-free zones, a proven target of killers.   After many years a bill should emerge.  Respect the Second Amendment.\"</p><p>This comes after he publicly sparred with Republicans yesterday over  concealed carry and NRA influence.  Watch.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  We can do that with an executive order.  I'm going to write the  bump stock, essentially write it out.  So you won't have to worry about  bump stocks.  Shortly that will be gone.  We can focus on other things.</p><p>Joe and Pat, in your bill, what do you think about the 18 to 21?  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We need to change that.  </p><p>TRUMP:  Ok.  Are you going to leave that?  A lot of people don't even want  to bring it up because they're afraid to bring it up.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We didn't address it, Mr. President.  But I think -- </p><p>TRUMP:  You know why?  Because you're afraid of the NRA.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let's bring in RNC national spokesperson Kayleigh McEnany.   Kayleigh -- good to see you.  Thanks very much for joining us this morning.</p><p>So you just heard the President there.</p><p>KAYLEIGH MCENANY, RNC NATIONAL SPOKESPERSON:  Thanks -- Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Are Republicans too afraid to act because of the NRA?  Are they  afraid of the NRA?  Is that what it is?  </p><p>MCENANY:  Well, look, I think the NRA's obviously a powerful lobbying group  and the President was pointing that out and it's not just Republicans.   There are moderate Democrats too.</p><p>And you know, he was pointing out that we need to have one special interest  and that's the American people.  That's the square focus of this.  That's  President Trump's square focus and he's saying that no lobbying group  should keep us away from meaningful compromise when it comes to guns.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  When a Republican president though looks at a Republican senator  and says you're afraid to act because you're afraid of the NRA, how does  that go over.  How is that going over with Republicans that you've spoken  with since those comments?  </p><p>MCENANY:  Well, since then the senators came out -- Senator Toomy and said  I don't think President Trump was meaning that directly towards me.  He was  saying it more generally that the NRA has a lot of influence over a lot of  elected officials.  So no Republicans are too upset about it.</p><p>I think right now we're just trying to find solutions for those kids to  make sure that this never ever happens again in this country.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Kayleigh -- I'm wondering, is there any effort here in the  administration to fix what went wrong at the FBI in this case?  It seems to  me when credible reports come in with a specific name and a specific  warning about a specific action that is going to be taken, you would hope  they would respond.  </p><p>MCENANY:  Oh, absolutely.  There will be multiple, multiple investigations  into that.  President Trump has said it's inexcusable that the ball was  dropped there.  Likewise, the local police department.</p><p>We need to have meaningful warning signs that we look into and that we  pursue vigorously.  But what President Trump has said, we need to make sure  that we can actually take these weapons away from individuals who are  mentally ill.</p><p>That's so important.  Because there can be a million warning signs but  unless we have the means and the statutory tools to make change, then those  warning signs will really fall on deaf ears.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But Kayleigh -- it's Dagen McDowell -- he said take the firearms  first, then go to court.  Take the gun first, due process second.  That's a  violation of the Fifth Amendment.  So what did he mean by that?</p><p>Because it seemed he was getting in a back and forth with Vice President  Pence who was talking about these gun violence restraining orders which it  gives families, law enforcement, prosecutors a way to get weapons out of  the hands of people who are potentially a threat to themselves or someone  else but there is due process.  You have to go to court.</p><p>And President Trump said take the guns, due process second.  Did he  misspeak?  </p><p>MCENANY:  No, Dagen.  I think this was -- look, this was a discussion.   Most of the time the media isn't let in on these conversations.  We were  let in on it to see this discussion and these ideas bouncing around.</p><p>Today we'll get the official proposals.  Everything that's done will be  constitutional.  It will be above board.  But I think President Trump is  expressing frustration that we knew this individual wanted to be a school  shooter.  He said it himself.</p><p>The police had gone there.  And yet, he still has these weapons and still  wreaks havoc on society and ends multiple lives.  So I think it was just a  free-flowing discussion.  Today we will get the official proposals.</p><p>But I'm glad the media was let in on that.  I'm glad the American people  saw that serious discussion happen.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Did you get a lot of comments from Republicans, the GOP?  What  did they say about that comment?  </p><p>MCENANY:  Well look, we're happy about what we saw yesterday because  finally we have a president that's putting politics aside -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCENANY:  -- and just having a pragmatic discussion.  That's what we need  is a pragmatic discussion.  And what you saw yesterday was the ultimate  deal maker, the ultimate pragmatist in President Trump bringing the two  sides together.  So our party was thrilled about that.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I just need to add something, they didn't see that as a  pragmatic discussion.  They saw it as someone that was chucking the  constitution and was talking about confiscating people's weapons without  even a court order.  That's what a lot of people heard.  And people were  outraged.  People who were Trump supporters were very upset by that.  </p><p>MCENANY:  This was just a discussion though.  What we saw yesterday -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, the cameras were rolling.  </p><p>MCENANY:  This was not laying out the legislative -- sure it was not laying  out the official legislative solutions.  But President Trump is frustrated.   Most Americans are frustrated.  When we look at polls to the tune of 70  percent to 80 percent are supporting most of the policies that were  discussed yesterday.  We'll get the official policies out today.  But I  think that was important to see and we've got to get weapons out of the  hands of those who want to commit atrocities like what we saw in Parkland,  Florida.  It's inexcusable.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, that's a different conversation, getting guns out of the  mentally ill.  I mean what Dagen is talking about is take the guns first  and then court later.  I mean, due process second.  So we're talking about  two different things.  </p><p>MCENANY:  It's the same thing, because President Trump is not talking about  confiscating weapons from Americans.  He's a supporter of the Second  Amendment.  He's a supporter of the NRA.  He's talking about individuals  like Nikolas Cruz -- I hate to even use the kid's name.  He's a murderer.   That's what we're talking about.</p><p>He's the biggest supporter of the Second Amendment there is but he's also a  supporter of making sure these shootings don't happen.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let me switch gears and ask you about the White House shakeup,  latest news here.</p><p>The President's communications director Hope Hicks announced yesterday she  plans to leave within the next few weeks.  President Trump reacted to the  resignation in a statement, writing this in part, \"Hope is outstanding and  has done great work for the last three years.  I will miss having her by my  side.  But when she approached me about pursuing other opportunities I  totally understood.\"</p><p>Kayleigh -- what's your reaction to this?  Is this because of that  testimony the other day you think where she said sometimes she has to say  white lies to protect the President?  </p><p>MCENANY:  No, it's not because Hope had told many people before that  testimony that she was leaving.  So several people knew.  It had nothing to  do with the testimony.  She was looking at other opportunities for a very  long time.  She's a valued member of this administration.</p><p>But Maria -- three years working nonstop, you know, 18-hour days in many  cases, that's a long time.  So it's perfectly reasonable that she would  want to move forward.  It really had nothing to do with the testimony.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  The timing is -- I mean she's a communications expert, right?   I mean to come out the day after the testimony and say I'm stepping down to  pursue other opportunities, sounds a little sketchy there.</p><p>MCENANY:  Well, the timing is what it is -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I'm wondering if the Democrats -- I'm wondering if the  Democrats set her up.  I mean they kept asking apparently in the testimony,  did you ever lie for the President.  Have you ever told white lies for the  President.  And then she acquiesced and said yes, like things like, you  know, he's in a meeting when he's really not in a meeting.  And then  immediately that quote of \"I tell white lies\" was leaked.</p><p>So once again we've got the leakers out in force on the left.  So was that  part of it, do you think?  </p><p>MCENANY:  Maria, that's exactly right.  I do think the Democrats set her  up.  You know, she -- Hope's goal was complete honesty in this testimony.   She took great pains to ensure she was providing accurate answers.  And so  accurate to say, you know, yes, maybe one time I said he was in a meeting  when he actually wasn't and the Democrats ran with it.  I think that's  spot-on.</p><p>Hope is a valued member of this administration and we thank her for her  service at the Republican Party.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  Just to add a little context there, often I think as we  talk to public relations people, representing politicians, the little white  lie is standard for instance, when they say yes, my boss very much enjoys  talking to you.  </p><p>MCENANY:  That's right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's a good point -- James.  You're right.</p><p>MCENANY:  Yes.  And I'm sure he doesn't enjoy talking to much of the  mainstream media who is on an effort to get him.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Kayleigh -- what's with this war of words between Attorney  General Jeff Sessions and the President?  Of course, the President tweeted  out yesterday, questioning Sessions asking the inspector general to  investigate potentially massive FISA abuses.  Sessions fought back saying  in part that he will continue to do this work in a fair and impartial  manner according to the law and constitution as long as he is attorney  general.</p><p>Why doesn't the President just go directly to Sessions and confront him  rather than calling him out on Twitter?  </p><p>MCENANY:  I'm sure he has.  But the President's frustrated, you know.  He  appointed an attorney general and on many of these investigations he's  having to recuse himself or step down.  And the Justice Department isn't  functioning as President Trump would like it to function.</p><p>You know, these FISA abuses are serious.  They're real.  We have a  Department of Justice with prosecutorial power and President Trump wants  them to do their job and look into it.  So that's why.  He's out there and  he wants to say it publicly that he wants the DOJ to step up and put  pressure on them.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We will leave it there.  Kayleigh -- good to see  you.  Thanks so much.  </p><p>MCENANY:  Thank you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Kayleigh McEnany joining us there. </p><p>We've got this breaking news.  The President just tweeted this and we want  to get this out.  He says \"Our steel and aluminum industries and many  others have been decimated by decades of unfair trade and bad policy with  countries from around the world.  We must not let our country, companies,  and workers be taken advantage of any longer.  We want free, fair and smart  trade.\"  That's from the President.</p><p>James Freeman -- I know you have comments on that.  We'll get back to that  after this short break.  Back in a minute, everybody.</p><p>Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>Now this, Broadcom making an appeal to Qualcomm shareholders to support the  proposed merger.</p><p>Lauren Simonetti with all the details now -- Lauren.  </p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Well Broadcom, Maria, is continuing  to pursue a proposed merger with rival Qualcomm.  Broadcom now urging  Qualcomm shareholders to vote for all six Broadcom nominees at the upcoming  shareholder meeting which is next week.</p><p>Broadcom recently lowered its hostile takeover bid for Qualcomm after  Qualcomm raised it's own bid for NXP Semiconductor.  There was a best and  final offer of $121 billion -- that was on Monday.</p><p>Take a look at Broadcom shares, down a third of 1 percent in the premarket.

Why the company claims it was all  a mistake by its moderation team.</p><p>And then the essence of Einstein, how Levi's claims it bottled the scent of  the genius -- next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>Breaking news this morning.  E.U. tech crackdown -- the European Union has  issued new guidelines for technology companies saying that they must remove  terror and illegal content within one hour after it's flagged by  authorities.</p><p>Joining us right now to talk tech is Kairos founder and CEO Ankur Jain.   Ankur -- good to see you.</p><p>ANKUR JAIN, FOUNDER, KAIROS:  Thanks.  Good to see you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>We were just talking in the commercial break about a bigger technology  regulatory hand.  Are you expecting the rules and regulations to get  stiffer for tech?  </p><p>JAIN:  Yes.  I mean look, it's a tough spot right now, right.  Because  technology companies in many ways have more power and influence on our  lives than even governments.  And yet we don't have the same kind of  accountability structure that governments, you know, conceptually do.</p><p>And so I think one of the things you're going to see now over the next  couple months or the next year at least is either governments are going to  regulate tech or tech has to regulate itself.</p><p>Unfortunately, I don't think we've seen that level of responsibility yet  from the tech companies.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  How would a company -- say you're a tech CEO and we've dealt with  this here in the U.S. too, it's not just Europe where we've had hearings in  Washington about it.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, remember Microsoft.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right, right.  Yes, to go back that far.  But now, just in the  present day, as we're looking at these things, if you're seeing it come at  your company, to your point about regulating yourself, how do you step up  and get out ahead of (INAUDIBLE)  </p><p>JAIN:  There's obviously a proactive and reactive side.</p><p>MCSHANE:  Right.</p><p>JAIN:  I think the biggest challenge right now is when you look at how much  the tech companies shape the content and information that we all consume as  citizens, obviously that has a tremendous effect on our political  environment, our social environment, et cetera.  The challenge is, there's  no easy solution to just say here's the rules and we go because there's so  much gray area. </p><p>But I think having even a third party group that's outside of the tech  business with a set of rules, like any media company, like Fox or any group  has a set of clear guidelines.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Like the business council in business.  </p><p>JAIN:  That's right.  The problem is, it's a group of entrepreneurs trying  to figure out what the right thing is for everybody else and frankly it's  not fair to the founders to know all the answers -- right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.</p><p>JAIN:  But it's also not fair to the society to expect no regulation or no  support on that side..  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But I just feel like that they continue to -- these technology  companies, particularly these social media companies, continue to over- step.  And at first it's oh, we rolled out the Facebook Live feature.  We  didn't know how people would abuse it with live suicides or violent crimes.</p><p>But this past week people on Facebook started getting this message about  facial recognition.  I don't know if you saw it.  </p><p>JAIN:  I did.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Hi, we're working on making Facebook better, we're adding more  ways to use facial recognition.  You can find photos you're tagged in but  haven't been tagged.  And it said, you can turn it on at any time.  They  said it was off, which applies to features we may add later.</p><p>So they were acting like it was an opt-in.  Mine was an opt-out.  It's a  huge -- I had to go in there and it was already on, and again, I just feel  like that they act like they're noble and doing no evil.  But they're being  reckless and they know what they're doing.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And then there's this whole pushback on any conservative  ideas.  You know, why is Peter Thiel leaving San Francisco and moving his  whole business to L.A.  because he says that there's constant pushback and  inability and unwillingness to hear any other diversity of ideas.</p><p>Look at YouTube, moderators employed by YouTube to spot fake news and  misleading and extreme videos.  They say it was a mistake but they removed  numerous conservative content channels.  What's going on with tech?  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>JAIN:  Yes.  Look -- It's not just conservative views.  I think one of the  challenges right now is that it's become such an echo chamber of all ideas.   And so I think what you're going to start to see is some of the best tech  minds moving out of just Silicon Valley.  I think you're seeing New York  already boom.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You came to New York.  </p><p>JAIN:  I moved to New York.  You're seeing Peter Thiel and others moving to  L.A.  I think the more we start to see the proliferation of technology  companies be outside of the one geographic area, it will change, right you  have different perspectives, different views.</p><p>We've talked about this last month.  When people in the Valley start to  think that the biggest problem in the world, I think we talked about that  $4,000 treadmill last time I was here, there's a disconnect with some of  the reality challenges there.  But you still want the best and brightest  minds to have the freedom to push the limits of innovation.  So it's  finding that right balance.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Ok.  But I'm not questioning whether social media companies have  discriminated against conservative views.  Do you see that or do you think  this is an honest mistake?  A drafting error on the algorithm?</p><p>JAIN:  Look, you have individual bad actors in the system.  That's the  challenge, right.  I think as a company no executive would condone that  kind of behavior or allow that in advance, right.  But like the Twitter if  you guys remember when the one rogue Twitter employee shut down President  Trump's account -- </p><p>MCSHANE:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>JAIN:  The challenge for this right now is that when it comes to major  decisions you need to operate fast and at scale to give people the autonomy  to do that but then you end up with these bad actors.</p><p>And so I think as we start to see the regulation and the penalties for the  bad acting, it will force the companies to find kind of fail-safes for  these kind of issues.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's a good analysis.  Ok.  Tell us about your new business --  the future of renting.</p><p>JAIN:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Rhino -- you launched it yesterday.  It's the newest launch  from Kairos.  You found a solution for security deposits that you say were  debilitating for so many apartment renters.  </p><p>JAIN:  If you remember at Kairos, we're trying now to find new innovation  to help everyday folks.  I think that's one of the areas that unfortunately  not enough technology companies are focused on.</p><p>And when you look at the cost of renting today, people are spending upwards  of 60 percent of their income on rent.  And so our goal was, there's two  parts, how do we reduce the upfront burden for people moving into a new  place and how do we reduce the recurring monthly costs.</p><p>And we started with the former.  So with Rhino, which launched yesterday,  starting in New York 23,000 renters are going to be able to get back  thousands of dollars from their landlords that was locked away for as long  as they rented.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Because it was a security deposit.  </p><p>JAIN:  That's right.  You put up -- I mean there's $40 billion that renters  have locked away that they don't ever really get back because it goes from  one apartment to the other.  And then meanwhile, 50 percent of Americans  can't even afford a $400 emergency expense.</p><p>So starting now, people will be able to file a claim, get back the deposit,  it's a small $10 monthly insurance deposit to protect them and their  landlord.  And we think giving people back thousands of dollars, you've got  your tax rebate and you have Rhino -- right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's great.</p><p>FREEMAN:  But if people are paying 60 percent of their income to rent and  they don't have the savings so they need to finance the deposit -- isn't  that an argument that we need to pay less for housing?</p><p>JAIN:  Well so if you remember at Kairos we're trying now to find new  innovation to help everyday folks.</p><p>I think that's one of the areas that unfortunately not enough technology  companies are focused on and when you look at the cost of renting today,  people are spending upward of 60 percent of their income on rent.</p><p>And so, our goal was, there's two parts, how do we reduce the upfront  burden for people moving into a new place and then having to reduce  recurring monthly cost and we're starting with the former.</p><p>So, with Rhino which launched yesterday, starting in New York 23,000  renters are going to be able to get back thousands of dollars from their  landlords that was locked away for as long as they rented -</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Because it was a security deposit?</p><p>JAIN:  - that's right, you put up - I there's $40 billion that renters have  locked away that they don't ever really get back because it goes from one  apartment to the other.</p><p>And then in the meanwhile 50 percent of Americans can't even afford a four- hundred-dollar emergency expense.</p><p>So, starting now people will be able to file a claim, get back their  deposit, it's a small $10 a month insurance policy that protects them and  their landlord, and we think giving people back thousands of dollars,  you've got your tax rebate and you have Rhino.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's great.</p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, ASSISTANT EDITORIAL PAGE EDITOR, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL:   But if people are paying 60 percent of their income to rent -</p><p>JAIN:  Yes.</p><p>FREEMAN:  - and they don't have the savings so they need to finance the  deposit -</p><p>JAIN:  Yes.</p><p>FREEMAN:  - isn't that an argument that they need to pay less for housing?</p><p>JAIN:  Well it's - first of all there's - there's choices (INAUDIBLE) -</p><p>FREEMAN:  I know it's -</p><p>JAIN:  - (INAUDIBLE) -</p><p>FREEMAN:  - not for fun but-</p><p>JAIN:  - I mean, but it's also you don't want to finance the deposit.</p><p>I don't think people should be taking on more debt right now, that's part  of the problem, right.</p><p>Is we don't think people should have that financial burden in the first  place so with Rhino there is no debt, there is no loan, you're basically  buying a small, affordable, insurance policy because most renters aren't  bad actors, right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>JAIN:  And there's no reason for landlords to be locking up $40 billion of  people's money.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's a great idea!</p><p>Another great idea from you Ankur.</p><p>Thanks for -</p><p>JAIN:  (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>BARTIROMO:  - thanks for bringing it to us.</p><p>JAIN:  Thanks, so much guys.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Ankur Jain, we'll be watching; check out Rhino.</p><p>Coming up a change of heart on gun control, President Trump says it's time  for lawmakers to come together on the issue.

I want to look at this with a fresh eye.'</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But as a -</p><p>NORQUIST:  Yes, yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  - but as a member of the NRA, I want to add - I want to push  back on what we heard from the president because anybody who has listened  to liberals over the years, Grover, they don't want to just take away semi- automatic sporting rifles.</p><p>They want -</p><p>NORQUIST:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  - to take away semi-automatic handguns in this country, handguns  commit - they are involved in most of your firearms death in this country -</p><p>NORQUIST:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  - that's why people who are proponents of the Second Amendment  and who honor it, that's why they're concerned by this.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Isn't it 80 percent Dagen?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's - the vast majority of firearm deaths in this country are  actually by suicide -</p><p>NORQUIST:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  - and it's less than a thousand homicides are committed or  firearm homicides are committed by long guns.</p><p>MCSHANE:  Let me just make one quick point in this, is that we've seen this  before.</p><p>I mean what we're seeing - but I don't know about taxes but definitely on  immigration, that we've seen all of this before, the president makes a  point like this and you know, what's interesting, it's an interesting  discussion to have but I don't know how much it matters -</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCSHANE:  - in a - in a forum like this -</p><p>NORQUIST:  Yes.</p><p>MCSHANE:  - because the - you know, whatever legislation is put forward,  again, that -</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCSHANE:  - exactly what happened on immigration.</p><p>It was really the president who stood in the way at the end of the day on  the bipartisan compromise kind of reversing himself with the comments that  he made in that meeting.</p><p>And he could easily reverse himself on -</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And -</p><p>MCSHANE:  - the comments he made yesterday.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  - and it was Kevin McCarthy who said,\" Wait Mr. President\" -</p><p>MCSHANE:  Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  - yes, in that -</p><p>MCSHANE:  (INAUDIBLE) -</p><p>BARTIROMO:  - immigration -</p><p>MCSHANE:  - (INAUDIBLE) -</p><p>BARTIROMO:  - I remember the meeting - </p><p>MCSHANE:  - it could be like - </p><p>BARTIROMO:  - exactly.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  - a replay.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You want to say something on this?</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  He tweets and says a lot, you want to look at the results.</p><p>So, I guess so, I wonder from Grover, how do you think this ends up?</p><p>Is it just focused on keeping the mentally ill from guns, what comes of all  this?</p><p>NORQUIST:  Right.  That's a very interesting question because having people  who have mental health challenges that makes them a danger to themselves  and others, that should've been in NICS (ph).</p><p>And it was the Democrats who kept it out, back in the 1990s, the National  Rifle Association and Republicans thought it was a good idea but the other  guys thought it was stigmatizing people to tell this young man in Florida,  you - we think there's a problem with you.</p><p>You don't want to hurt his feelings, that's the Democrat problem. For  decades we've lived with their mistake both the National Rifle Association  and Republicans have always been willing to change that and the Democrats  are trying to tell you to look someplace else.</p><p>Let's fix that problem and let's -</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>NORQUIST:  - not have gun free zones that make students a target because  parents and administrators don't have the ability to 'carry concealed' in  schools, to make them safer.</p><p>We want safer schools, the left just wants gun control; that's why the  conversation is so odd.</p><p>We're talking about how to make school safe -</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>NORQUIST:  - and they just want to steal people's guns and they've been at  it for decades so we kind of -</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>NORQUIST:  - know where they're going.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And that's a conversation right now, gun control, even though  we know how many times the -</p><p>NORQUIST:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  - signals and the signs were there, particularly about Nikolas  Cruz -</p><p>NORQUIST:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  - and there was a massive failure on the part of the FBI and  the local police.</p><p>NORQUIST:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We can't have you on without talking about tax reform and  growth, Grover.</p><p>So, I've got to ask you -</p><p>NORQUIST:  That's what I assumed that we were talking -</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Sorry -</p><p>NORQUIST:  - about here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  - about that Grover.  You know, we have to get into the -</p><p>NORQUIST:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  - issue of the day.</p><p>Let me ask you about your thoughts on growth.</p><p>Companies are reportedly buying back their stock at a quicker pace  following the cut in corporate taxes.</p><p>\"The Journal\" says -</p><p>NORQUIST:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  - that share buybacks from US businesses has exceeded $300  billion in the past three months.</p><p>What do you think about that?</p><p>And also, look at this, Atlanta Fed going from 5.4 percent growth, now they  are at 2 1/2 percent growth, that they're expecting.</p><p>We also saw our GDP number that came down from the third quarter, now we're  talking about growth of 2 1/2 percent.</p><p>Has your expectation changed of economic growth of four percent in '18 and  where we are right now?</p><p>NORQUIST:  No.  I think we're looking very - moving forward very well.</p><p>The really good news is that companies are doing stock buybacks.</p><p>Why does that matter?</p><p>That means the companies are looking at bringing billions of dollars back  from overseas and they say, 'what's the best way I could spend a billion  dollars, buying another company, starting a new line of business, or is our  business is so good that we want to invest in us.'</p><p>Now that money doesn't disappear, they buy those stocks from somebody and  the new investor reinvests that money to his or her highest and best value.</p><p>So, the money doesn't disappear in a buyback it moves between investors and  it's a company saying, 'we think we're the best game in town.'</p><p>I want to be invested in a firm whose management thinks the best thing you  can do with a billion dollars is invest it in yourself because they think  the future looks so good.</p><p>FREEMAN:  We should note in that Journal story on - from the new side of  our paper, it did note that a lot of CEOs along with planning buybacks also  talking about more capital investment Grover, which is -</p><p>NORQUIST:  Yes.</p><p>FREEMAN:  - really that's going to be the test of this tax reform right.</p><p>It's higher investment because we're - we're rewarding more investment in  the United States.</p><p>NORQUIST:  We're bringing more capital in from overseas and more from the  United States per worker, that gives you productivity increases, that gives  your higher wages.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right site sounds like you're still positive on this tax  plan Grover?</p><p>NORQUIST:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good to -</p><p>NORQUIST:  Absolutely.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  - see you sir.

I'm Hala Gorani live  tonight from Paris.  France is dealing with yet another terrorist attack on  its soil.  Three people are dead after a series of attacks in Southern  France on this Friday.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It culminated in a four-hour standoff at a supermarket before police shot  the gunman dead.  He is named as a 26-year-old Redouane Lakdim.  Here is  what we know.  On Friday morning, the attacker hijacked a car killing one  person inside the car and injuring another.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And then not far from that, he shot a group of police officers, who are out  jogging in the town of (INAUDIBLE).  The car tried to run officers down.   One person was wounded and then the gunman drove to a supermarket  (INAUDIBLE).  He entered the market shouting, \"Allahu Akbar.\"</p><p>This is all, by the way, information I'm bringing to you for the public  prosecutor.  He killed two people inside.  He took several people hostage.   A police officer agreed to give himself over to the gunman in exchange for  the release of hostages and that officer entered the supermarket and then  shot the gunman.</p><p>French President Emmanuel Macron returned to Paris from Brussels earlier  than expected.  He condemned the attack and he praised authorities on the  scene.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>EMMANUEL MACRON, FRENCH PRESIDENT (through translator):  Our country has  been struck today by an Islamist terrorist attack.  The courage of one  particular senior police officer who voluntarily took the place of other  hostages and who was very seriously wounded.  He saved lives and he does  honor to his force and his country.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GORANI:  Jim Bittermann is here with me in Paris following the very latest.   So, it was a three-part attack and it culminated in this very long standoff  in the supermarket where t gunman took hostages.</p><p>JIM BITTERMANN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Exactly.  The  first person, one of the first people on the scene was this Lieutenant  Colonel Arnault (ph) Bertrand, who is the lieutenant colonel who was the  head of (INAUDIBLE) and he was on the scene, and saw the situation  unrolling.</p><p>And the gunman at that point had one hostage left.  There were 50 or so  people in the store when this all began.  They managed to escape.  He was  holding on to one woman hostage and Lieutenant Colonel Arnault (ph)  Bertrand, negotiated an exchange for her with the gunman and he then became  the hostage.</p><p>And the gunman trotted him out from the store and said he was killing them  and threatened his life and said he's also going to blow up the store  (INAUDIBLE), of course, and then took him back inside and shot him.</p><p>At that point, Bertrand had left his cell phone on so that his comrades and  the SWAT team could know what was really go on outside would know what was  going on, and as soon as they heard the shot, they kept that line open.</p><p>They understood exactly where things were progressing in terms of talking  to the gunman.   Any case, when they heard the fired, the SWAT Team went  in.  Two officers were injured when the SWAT team went in and his  lieutenant colonel is now fighting for his life because he was shot several  times.</p><p>GORANI:  So, he swapped himself in for hostages in that supermarket?</p><p>BITTERMANN:  Yes.</p><p>GORANI:  And do we know -- the shooter himself, screaming Allahu Akbar and  doing this for Syria, said he was doing this in the name of ISIS.  What  more do we know about this particular suspect?</p><p>BITTERMANN:  It is unclear.  And the police said they had him on their  radar because he was a petty criminal.  He's been involved with drugs and  other sort of things that they had -- down as a (INAUDIBLE) a surveillance  order back in 2014 or '15, I believe, yet the prosecutor told us there was  nothing in his behavior that indicated he was aiming towards  radicalization.  So, they had no reason to suspend -- </p><p>GORANI:  He was \"fishy\" as they say in France, which means they were some  suspicions surrounding them.</p><p>BITTERMANN:  (Inaudible) of the (INAUDIBLE) surveillance and the ideas that  you keep these people under surveillance because they may be up to no good.</p><p>GORANI:  All right.  Jim Bittermann, thanks very and we'll stay in close  touch for the very latest.</p><p>Our analyst, Paul Cruickshank is joining me now live.  Paul, this script is  one we've written before and we've heard before, petty criminal, in his  20s, spent some time jail, had some sort of low-level felony convictions  and was known to perhaps sell drugs, according reports.</p><p>[16:05:08] What does this tell us about where ISIS is in its effort to  continue to mount attacks in western countries?</p><p>PAUL CRUICKSHANK, CNN TERRORISM ANALYST:  Hala, it's trying to get people  with this kind of profile to mount attacks in Europe and in ISIS' favor,  there are tens of individuals inside Europe who have been flagged seen as  potential threats inside the European Union and the 20,000 with about ten  of those thousand seen as potential active threats.</p><p>So, it's still a very significant moving forward despite the fact that ISIS  has been territorially defeated in Syria and Iraq.  They are still trying  to encourage these kinds of attacks through their propaganda.</p><p>And he's very clearly saying that he was doing this on behalf of ISIS.  It  would appear this was an attempt to gain a lot of publicity by taking  hostages, but it's the heroic actions of this French lieutenant colonel  which really kind of there wasn't a massacre here.</p><p>And that's a huge bravery, one of the most brave actions in this 17-year  fight against terrorism and without what he did today, we could have seen  many, many more being killed this individual, it would appear wanted to  kill as many people as possible.</p><p>GORANI:  Where -- so typically you have radicalization that occurs inside  prisons and online, and quickly, according to analysts and experts who  track ISIS conversations.  There were celebrations on messaging platforms  like Telegram that this was actually succeeding ahead, that some ISIS- inspired type attack had unfolded, quote/unquote, \"successfully\" as far as  they were concerned.</p><p>CRUICKSHANK:  Yes.  I mean, there was a lot of excitement as you might  expect on social media from ISIS supporters.  There's been a lull in  attacks in Europe since that Barcelona attack in August.  They haven't been  able to get a big one through so there is a big desire for revenge.</p><p>But what we saw played out today was an act of heroism from a French  Security Services officer and inspiring thing about today, and that is  something that will inspire a lot more people to place themselves at the  service of confronting terrorism -- Hala.</p><p>GORANI:  Right.  (Inaudible) is his name, confirmed to us, to CNN, by a  spokesperson at the Interior Ministry for those wondering how we got that  name confirmed lieutenant colonel who swap himself in in exchange for  hostages at that supermarket near Toulouse.  Thanks very much, Paul  Cruickshank.</p><p>Asiem El-Difraoui is here with me in Paris.  Good to see you.  So, let's  talk a little bit, you know, oftentimes we focus on these petty losers who  are 25 to 30 years old who have, like, drug dealing convictions and things  like that.</p><p>But I do agree with Paul that on this one, let's spend some time  celebrating this particular individual who went in and said give me the  hostages, I'll go in.  He is seriously wounded today.</p><p>ASIEM EL-DIFRAOUI, FRENCH TERROR EXPERT:  Here is wounded hero or the petty  loser?</p><p>GORANI:  No, on the seriously wounded hero.</p><p>EL-DIFRAOUI:  I mean, he's a really hero.  France is very proud about him  and it's real dedication of an officer to save innocent civilians.</p><p>GORANI:  And the reason I'm calling him a petty criminal losers is because  on so many levels, that's the profile, isn't it?</p><p>EL-DIFRAOUI:  But I'm not happy about the term petty loser.  Not a loser  maybe of his own making.  There's a lot of socioeconomic exclusion towards  minorities in France all over Europe -- </p><p>GORANI:  We're not going to go down that path, are we?  When we're going to  say, I'm agreeing with you, there are a lot of exclusions and socio- economic discrimination and all sorts of thing, but this type of action  cannot be explained by that, can it?</p><p>EL-DIFRAOUI:  No, it can't, you know, but part of the explanation is  definitely socioeconomic discrimination.  But then I agree, you know, those  people have very difficult psychological profiles.  They want to become  heroes just because they want to be in the limelight.  In the sense,  they're small people who just want to be star by doing these horrific  crimes.</p><p>GORANI:  Yes.  What does it tell us about the state of ISIS?  Because it's  lost so much territory in Syria and Iraq, there was a lot of celebration  from their cheerleaders on the messages apps like Telegram, but what does  it tell us about where they are now in terms of their ability to strike?</p><p>[16:10:07] EL-DIFRAOUI:  Not much, in reality, you know?</p><p>GORANI:  Why?  They haven't been able to mount -- </p><p>EL-DIFRAOUI:  These kinds of attacks have been happening while ISIS was,  you know, you 2015 they were calling on these types of attacks and ISIS was  totally unable to mount large-scale attacks and they're weakened and don't  be surprised if there is a cell, you know?</p><p>ISIS has infiltrated European countries and there were recent ISIS arrests  in Germany for people who were coming a couple of years ago as refugees, so  let's not be sure.  This fight will go on for a long time.</p><p>GORANI:  I think anyone who says there won't be a big-scale attack is --  cannot -- how can you know this?</p><p>EL-DIFRAOUI:  That's what I'm thinking.</p><p>GORANI:  It could happen.  But that being said -- </p><p>EL-DIFRAOUI:  What about al Qaeda in Yemen?  What about (INAUDIBLE) group?   What about outer groups.</p><p>GORANI:  All that being said, when you see on TV and computer screens these  other groups?  What about other groups?  Said, when you see on tv and on  your computer screen and these huddled ISIS captives that have been  captured either by the Kurds or the effort or whatever, and this is not a  good advertisement for ISIS group.  They're not these heroic in minds of  the extremist heroic warriors.</p><p>EL-DIFRAOUI:  No, it's very good for us, you know?  Bin Laden was killed  and the caliphate was nearly destroyed, but there are so many other groups  so we shouldn't stop to be vigilant and we really should work in Europe as  well as in the United States on long-term prevention.</p><p>And it does not only mean explaining to youngsters how dangerous and how  totalitarian this ideology is.  France is committing more and more efforts  in doing that, but there's real geopolitical variables and the civil war in  Syria, and the Turks attacking some Kurdish towns and maybe another window  for ISIS, what about Egypt?  Not just a global problem that we need to  attack at the root causes.</p><p>GORANI:  Well said.  Definitely the causes and the reasons for the  existence of these groups is still very present in that part of the world.   Well, in any case, hopefully   have better preventative measures in western  countries.  Asiem EL-DIFRAOUI, as always, thanks so much.  Good seeing you  again.</p><p>We are going to take a quick break and we will be right back with my  colleague, Hanna Vaughan Jones in London with the rest of the day's news.   Stay with us.</p><p>HANNAH VAUGHAN JONES, CNN HOST:  Hala, thanks very much indeed.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>JONES:  Welcome back.  We'll go back to Hala Gorani in Paris a little bit  later, but for now other news we're following for you tonight.  An economic  tit for tat is currently underway between the world's two super powers.</p><p>First, U.S. President Donald Trump slapped tariffs on steel and aluminum  imported from China.  Then on Thursday, he tightened the screw with new  taxes on other goods brought in from China worth up to $60 billion.</p><p>[16:15:09] As a result, the global markets nosedived.  The Dow closed more  than 700 points lower on Thursday and then this Friday, so far modestly  proposing tariffs worth about $3 billion in response to the original round  of Trump tariffs.</p><p>More is likely to come and that is making investors nervous, indeed.  This  is how the Dow closed today, down 424.  That's lower again today and while  Mr. Trump is acting increasingly hawkishly on China, he's also just  appointed new security adviser, his third since his administration began.</p><p>John Bolton is the man and he is replacing H.R. McMaster in what is yet  another high-profile shake-up of the White House in just the last few days.   Bolton is a controversial pick given his views on Iraq and indeed his views  on North Korea.</p><p>So, let's discuss all of this with CNN's White House reporter, Stephen  Collinson live in Washington for us.  Stephen, John Bolton has been around  for some time under various administrations and perhaps his most senior  role as the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, but might we see a  different John Bolton under this president and under this administration  and the Bolton we've seen of old?</p><p>STEPHEN COLLINSON, CNN POLITICS SENIOR REPORTER:  I don't think there's any  reason to think that the John Bolton that we're going to see in the White  House is going to change at least in terms of his policy views and his very  hard line, as you said, on North Korea and his against the Iran deal and  he's talked about the necessity to bomb Iran to end the program.</p><p>He was a very prominent voice in the run-up to the war in Iraq supporting  that action and I don't think it's likely that he will change his views  when he gets to the moments when he has the most power in his entire  career.</p><p>You know, John Bolton is someone who is a very controversial figure in  Washington.  When he was nominated by President George W. Bush to be the  U.N. ambassador, couldn't get a permanent appointment for that job because  the Senate wouldn't confirm him largely because he was seen as somebody who  was very hard on subordinates.</p><p>And there was great resistance to him in the diplomatic corps, he's a very  hard-charging character, but he's also somebody who knows how to use the  levers of power in Washington so he's going to be a formidable opponent for  his adversaries in the administration and he's a very interesting pick.</p><p>The one thing that I would say is that what he must learn is that nobody in  this administration is allowed to become more prominent and dominant than  the president himself and if he doesn't learn that lesson, I don't think  he'd be there for that long.</p><p>GORANI:  And the president himself speaking earlier on, talking about this  spending bill which he has now signed into law.  You could argue that  perhaps it was a useful distraction from some of the other rumors scandals  in the White House, and he signed it, but wasn't all that pleased about it.   Take a listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA:  I say to  Congress, I will never sign another bill like this again.  I'm not going to  do it again.  Nobody read it.  It's only hours old.  Some people don't even  know what it is -- $1.3 trillion.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JONES:  So, you can hear there, Stephen, he signed it, but he will never do  it again and it's apparent he didn't read it.</p><p>COLLINSON:  Right.  I mean, Donald Trump said he would to drain the swamp.   This is a prime example of a swamp product coming out of Congress.  You  know, it's a bill that's bloated.  The way you get stuff passed in  Congress, everyone gets their pet project, and no one really knows what  they're voting for because that's the way you need to get the votes.</p><p>Donald Trump was happy to Trump it the things he does want to including  increased military spending and more money for fighting the opioid  epidemic, but to get that money, you have to compromise and concede on  other things.</p><p>What he didn't get in the bill was funding for his border wall which was at  the center of his political project, if you like, since he started and  that's one reason he's angry, but if he says he's not going to sign that  bill again, if you want to get anything signed in Washington because of the  way, you know, power is distributed, you have to give and take.</p><p>JONES:  Stephen Collinson, thank you very much.  Appreciate your analysis  on this.  I want to bring some breaking news and this resolves around  activity in the U.K. at the moment.  You will, of course, remember  Cambridge Analytica, the data firm accused of having used Facebook data in  order to help Donald Trump, perhaps help the campaigns around the world,  various campaigns to get elected.</p><p>[16:20:12] The U.K. authorities, the Information Commission has been trying  to get into Cambridge Analytica's U.K. office for the last week or so to  get to the bottom of this and take documents and they just today managed to  get a court order to do that.</p><p>We understand at the moment that 18 officers from the U.K. Information  Commission or currently searching those offices here in London.  We'll  bring you more on that as we get any further detail.</p><p>But let's get back to what we were talking about before and the shake-ups  in the White House in particular.  My next guest has met John Bolton, the  soon to be national security adviser and he's met him personally and he has  wide expertise on the Asian region.</p><p>Of course, that's interesting because of what we've been talking about with  trade wars and the like and the (INAUDIBLE) between the U.S. and China,  which is brewing.  Jamie Metzl is a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council  think tank and joins me from New York.  Jamie, great to see you.</p><p>Trump says earlier, rather that the relations with China are still great  and that everything is still on track, but given John Bolton's appointment,  given the trade wars that are looming, what's your current assessment of  not just U.S.-China relations, but U.S.-Asia relations?</p><p>JAMIE METZL, SENIOR FELLOW, ATLANTIC COUNCIL:  This could be, and this is a  very significant turning point in America's relationship, not just with  China, but with Asia.  Since the end of the Second World War, the United  States has been really the foundation of peace, security and stability in  the Asia-Pacific region.</p><p>And that depended on America being a responsible player in that region and  in the world, and so, America certainly made sacrifices, but also  contributed through security, through open markets and through all these  kinds of things that the United States provided to the world and we  benefited enormously.</p><p>Donald Trump and his administration are looking to redo that deal and for  America to behave like in many ways any other country, just with narrow,  nationalist activities and behaviors and so now certainly, they talk of  trade, we are not just with China.</p><p>China has behaved not well at all and there are reasons for the united  states to get tougher on China, but to get tough on China, the United  States needs to do what it's done for so many years, which is to build  coalitions around positive values and that's what this administration isn't  doing.</p><p>JONES:  It isn't doing at the moment and if we talked specifically about  the tariffs in particular, it was some $50 billion, wide-ranging tariffs  that the U.S. has put on China specifically, but China's response is being  quite measured.  Are you expecting more to come?</p><p>METZL:  China is waiting to see what the United States is really doing.   The U.S. tariffs won't be applied immediately.  There's going to be about a  month of a negotiation process potentially, so China wants to wait and see.</p><p>Nobody certainly, China doesn't want to have a trade war with the United  States, but at the same time China has gotten away with a lot of bad  behaviors, blocking access for American international companies and forcing  technology transfer and stealing intellectual property rights or stealing  intellectual property and keeping America's big tech companies out of the  Chinese markets.</p><p>So, China has known that the United States at some point will need to get  tougher on China, but China also recognizes that President Trump is  weakening America so significantly through his erratic behavior by the  tumult within the administration and there are all these threats that have  been made that haven't been carried out.</p><p>So, they want to see whether this is real or not, and whether Trump has the  political ability and just the capacity within an administration that's in  complete chaos to deliver on these tough words.</p><p>JONES:  You talk about the chaos within the administration at the moment  and the shake-ups going on, I am wondering what you think China might be  making of John Bolton coming into the new role as national security  adviser, given the fact that he has been very outspoken in the past at  least about say, North Korea, a proponent of military intervention as  opposed to any kind of dialogue and presumably China might be feeling quite  sidelined by what's going on between the U.S. and North Korea right now.</p><p>METZL:  I don't know if they're feeling sidelined because China still has  the cards in many ways for North Korea because China's trade and aid and  energy resources keep North Korea alive.  So, whether this meeting happens  between North Korea, Kim Jong-un and President Trump happens or not, it's  very clear that North Korea will not be giving up its nukes any time soon.</p><p>That the Trump administration has no meaningful strategy so it's not that  there's going to be some kind of deal or could be some kind of deal that  sidelines China.</p><p>[16:25:05] But what I do think is that people all across the region are  extremely concerned that the so-called moderates, the relative moderates  and the so-called adults in the room from the Trump administration are all  being sidelined, and a series of ideologues are taking their place.</p><p>The John Bolton who I know is a very smart, very thoughtful person, but he  has been on the aggressive use of military action in Iran, for Iraq, and  North Korea, and this is going to be a very, very difficult situation  because the president already has erratic impulses.</p><p>Already his administration is under threat because of all of these scandals  and he is, in the middle of the night, when decisions are made in the old  days at least you can say there were some people who are trying to moderate  their impulses.  Now every day, we are losing what limited protection we  have.  This is a very, very dangerous situation.</p><p>JONES:  Yes, exactly.  A lot of people saying that the president has just  surrounded himself by yes men.  Even Kellyanne Conway is saying get with  the program or get out to staff members within the administration.</p><p>Jamie, that's what we got time for.  Jamie Metzl, we appreciate it.  Thanks  very much, indeed.</p><p>Still to come on the program tonight, after a terror attack in Southern  France leaves three people dead, we're asking does France have a specific  problem?  Hala Gorani is back live in Paris next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>GORANI:  We are live in Paris covering our top story this evening.  Three  people have been killed in a series of attacks in Southern France on this  Friday.  It all ended in a four-hour standoff at a supermarket before lice  shot the gunman dead.</p><p>He was named as 26-year-old Redouane Lakdim.  He was known to authorities  and an ISIS affiliated group has claimed he was, quote, \"a soldier of their  organization.  The attack meant President Emmanuel Macron returned to  France from Brussels where he was meeting other European Union leaders.  He  has called the incident a, quote, \"Islamist terrorist attack\" and says,  authorities are looking into the ISIS claim of responsibility.</p><p>All right.  We are going to connect with our Melissa Bell who is on the  scene, but joining me now to talk more about this is the former head of the  French Special Force, Frederic Gallois, and he joins me via Skype from  Marseille.</p><p>What was your immediate thought when you learned of the details of this  attack, this man who carjacked a driver and then attacked special riot  police and then drove to a supermarket and took ordinary civilians hostage. </p><p>[16:30:00] What went through your mind?</p><p>FREDERIC GALLOIS, FORMER HEAD OF FRENCH SPECIAL FORCES:  My first thought  was to understand that it would be a very difficult situation because the  terrorist claimed as a jihadist.  And you know we had a huge experience now  in France to deal with such situation.  We're one particular region as such  people, like they accept a suicidal operation, they expect to be killed in  their operation.  They don't want to stay alive.  So for the Special Forces  it's a very difficult situation because to save the people, the hostages on  face the people -- guys which are waiting for them, waiting to suit them  and who wanted to kill all the people so it's really difficult situation to  act on.</p><p>GORANI:  And there was a heroic police officer, Arnaud Beltrame who was a  lieutenant colonel who swapped places with the hostage and ended up  basically, in the end, alone with the gunman even though initially there  were 50 people in that supermarket.</p><p>GALLOIS:  It's an incredible situation because this officer decided himself  to swap with a group of hostages and he entered inside the supermarket and  he stopped to speak with the terrorist.  It's a very incredible situation,  because in the face of such people, he knew that it was like a suicidal  decision.  He went directly to the terrorist, because should have seen that  the terrorist will not keep him alive, but decided to enter and to swap  with other hostage.  He certainly saved the life of many people.  It was  the end of the operation.</p><p>GORANI:  Thank you so much, Frederic Gallois, the former head of the French  Special Forces speaking to us live this evening from Marseille.</p><p>Jim Bittermann is still here with me.  And this standoff in the supermarket  went on for many, many hours.</p><p>JIM BITTERMANN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Three hours, I  think.  And it reminded me very much -- do you remember Amedy Coulibaly?   After the Charlie Hebdo attacks in 2015 and he had shot a police officer on  the south side of Paris, a police woman who was -- who died and then held  hostages in the Kosher supermarket and the same kind of modus operandi.  He  came into the supermarket, shot at this guy and immediately shot a couple  of the people, of the customers of the store as this guy did today, I guess  to show -- make a big show of the fact that he was in charge, and he  certainly was for a little while.</p><p>GORANI:  And I'm sure authorities are going to be looking very closely at  this guy's background because he was known to authorities.  He'd been  incarcerated for a short period of time for petty crimes, but he was also  (INAUDIBLE) what we call in France (INAUDIBLE) which means that he was  suspected of having sympathies with extremist organization.</p><p>BITTERMANN:  The prosecutor Thomas tonight, no suspicion that he was  becoming radicalized or would passed to an act, as they say in France,  they're going to action.  So there was no indication that they had, but  they had him under surveillance.  And, you know, there'll be a lot of  questions, like for instance, where did he get this gun or guns?  There may  have been more than one, but in any case, where did that comes from?  And  who was helping him out amongst his family members and associates and  others, if there was anybody and they have taken one person into custody  tonight.  One of his close associates and I'm sure that's what the question  is going to be about.</p><p>GORANI:  But we don't know much otherwise, other than that about his  family, his background.  We know he was 26 years old of Moroccan origin.</p><p>BITTERMANN:  And the Moroccans said that he was born there and they had him  there in 2011, I think it was.  He had been there for a return trip and not  any notice that normally would have taken.  They just went back to their  files to see when he might have come in.  So there was nothing that they  were alerted to that indicated he was radicalized.</p><p>GORANI:  And also he -- the target is a supermarket in a small town.  It's  not a big high-value, quote, quote, \"Target.\"</p><p>BITTERMANN:  I know you know this area.  I know you know this area.   Provence is like this sleepy little town, it's 5,000 people and a sleepy  little supermarket that people are going in a Friday shopping on.  And it  must have been just an unbelievable turn of events.  And I guess it says  something about the awareness of people that the people have the wits to  get out of the supermarket that most of the hostages, most of the people in  supermarket fled before they could become hostages.</p><p>[16:35:23] GORANI:  Well, it must have been terrifying for them and three  did lose their lives today.</p><p>Jim Bittermann, thanks very much, and I understand Melissa Bell is with us  on the phone, is that correct?  From near the scene?</p><p>No.  I think we have -- she is with us, actually, on camera.  Melissa, tell  us where you are and what you're seeing around you.</p><p>MELISSA BELL, CNN PARIS CORRESPONDENT:  Well, we're inside Carcassonne, and  just in front of the apartment building where the suspect, the man has been  identified as the attacker today lived.  This has been a subject of a  number of raids by police over the course of the evening, Hala.  And even  now, they're positioned all around the apartment building.  They say we  can't get any closer because the youth that lived here have gathered  outside (INAUDIBLE) we are quite close to the police, but just behind me  this apartment building where he lived.  </p><p>It's understood also and we understood this is from Francois Molins, who  was the French prosecutor who spoke earlier that a young woman had been  taken into custody, as well, his girlfriend, the person that he shared his  life with and this is where those raids took place, just hours, of course,  after those attacks, those series of attacks, three attacks, the triple  attack, of course, that took place, began here in Carcassonne, moved on  just outside with events ending here over the course of the evening.  And  as I say, still a huge police presence around this apartment building as  authorities tries to piece together precisely the background of the  assailant.</p><p>GORANI:  Because there are other people in custody now, and I guess the big  question for authorities, Melissa, is did he act alone?  Was he radicalized  alone on his computer?  Or was there more of a cell, more of a network  behind this?</p><p>BELL:  Exactly.  Understood and it's much clearer now that he was  officially what the French called (INAUDIBLE) now, that doesn't mean that  he was a subject of active surveillance, but it does mean that he was on  the sort of police computers as someone who might be radicalized and  therefore, if he stopped, was stopped by police say for speeding on a  highway, this would immediately be alerted to them if he was stopped trying  to cross the border this, too, would be to alerted to authorities.  But of  course, it doesn't mean that there is active surveillance of these people  all of the time.  And after all, Hala, there are some many thousands of  them in France have this (INAUDIBLE) system that is the subject of this  indication to authorities this following of them even if the surveillance  is not all of the time active.</p><p>We understand that he became (INAUDIBLE) in 2014 for a while that was taken  away and then brought back.  But on the whole, he was known in terms of  what had got him into trouble for petty crime, for being a small time drug  dealer and he'd done time in jail and there was nothing to lead  authorities.  We heard it both from the interior minister here on, Hala,  and from Francois Molins, the French prosecutor tonight, there was nothing  to lead intelligence agencies, security forces to believe that he was about  to act.</p><p>GORANI:  All right.  Melissa Bell there near the scene.  Thanks very much  for joining us with the latest.  And Hannah has the rest of the day's news.   Hannah.</p><p>JONES:  Hala, thanks very much indeed.</p><p>All right.  Still to come on the program from London.  A new dynamic.   That's how the UK Prime Minister, Theresa May is describing Brexit talks  after the EU agrees to a transition deal.</p><p>And who needs soap operas with this kind of real-life drama.  Former  playboy playmate give some stunning details about her alleged affair with  Donald Trump.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[16:40:06] JONES:  Welcome back to HALA GORANI TONIGHT with me Hannah  Vaughan Jones live in London for you.</p><p>Now, Donald Trump is usually quick to fight back when confronted with the  damaging allegations.  But so far, silence from the U.S. president after  CNN's explosive interview with the former playboy playmate.  Karen McDougal  says not only did she have sexual relations with Mr. Trump, but says they  actually had a 10-month long affair starting back in 2006 during which he  constantly professed his love for her.  McDougal explained to CNN's,  Anderson Cooper why she cried after their first sexual encounter.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KAREN MCDOUGAL, FORMER PLAYBOY PLAYMATE:  Well, after we had been intimate,  he tried to pay me and I actually did not take that.</p><p>ANDERSON COOPER, CNN ANCHOR:  Did he actually try to hand you money?</p><p>MCDOUGAL:  He did.  He did.  And I said -- I mean, I just had this look of  -- I don't even know how to describe the look on my face -- must have been  so sad because I had never been offered money like that before, number one.   But number two, I thought, does he think that I'm in this for money or why  I'm here tonight?  Or is this a normal thing?  I didn't know.  But I looked  at him and I said that's not me.  I'm not that kind of girl, and he said,  \"Oh,\" and he said \"You're really special.\"  And I was like, \"Thank you.\"   So I left, actually got in the car.  Keith taking me home and I started  crying.  I was really sad.  It really hurt me.  But I went back.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JONES:  Well, that is weren't enough, the attorney for another woman who  had an alleged affair with Mr. Trump is now taunting and baiting the  president.  You guessed it, on Twitter.  Athena Jones is following all  these developments, joins us now with more.  Athena, there's a mounting  course of female accusers doing the media rounds at the moment.  Donald  Trump is the man we know doesn't usually keep still and let things slide  without saying his peace on this.  How on earth is the president going to  keep quiet?</p><p>ATHENA JONES, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Well, that's a good question,  Hannah, it's so interesting to see him be so quite.  It is remarkable.   This is uncharacteristic.  When it comes to the women who have accused  Trump of sexual harassment, or sexual assault, he has been aggressive in  denying those allegations.  There was a point in time when he would deny  the allegations daily whether on Twitter or in speeches or both.  But he  has a very different approach to these women who we're talking about having  had consensual relationships with him.  He's been far less aggressive.  He  has said nothing.  He has not tweeted, he has not commented and it really  is remarkable and it is very likely that people are advising him not to  tweet or comment about this, but I've also talked to other women and not  the women who said that they've had consensual relationships with the  president, but some of the woman who have accused him of sexual misconduct  and they say that he likes being associated with these beautiful women in  the headlines.  He likes the idea that he's being linked to these women  even if it was an affair that started a few months after his own son,  Barron, his most recent son, was born.  But it is quite unique to see him  not responding here.  Hannah?</p><p>JONES:  I'm not sure how happy he'll be about Stormy Daniels continuing to  play out the allegations in front of the world's press.  Stormy Daniels, of  course, definitely a porn star, her lawyer has also been playing into to  this whole rouse, as well.  Pretty much playing Donald Trump, you can say  at his own game.  This is the latest tweet that we heard from Stephanie  Clifford's lawyer.  He says, if a picture is worth a thousand words, how  many words is this worth?  And you can see there a disk, as well.</p><p>I mean, it is pretty much trying to play the president at his own game and  a game that he's probably not going to want to be a part of.</p><p>[16:45:53] JONES:  Well, it's quite a tease, isn't it?  Quite a cliffhanger  for that \"60 MINUTES\" interview, that Stormy Daniels -- she's sitting down  with Anderson Cooper.  That interview is to air on Sunday night, and so  Michael Avenatti, Stormy Daniels' lawyer, like you say, he's sort of using  these kind of reality TV or teasing and kind of cliffhangers using Trump's  own methods to kind of poke at him.  What's unclear is, was that a CD?  Is  that a DVD?  What is on it?</p><p>A colleague of mine MJ Lee, asked Avenatti today if that could be maybe a  tape of this polygraph test that Stormy Daniels subjected herself to  several years ago.  He said that that's not what's on that disk, it has  nothing to do with that.  But we don't know what it is.  Maybe we'll find  out on Sunday and yes, he has said over and over again that they are not  going away.  They are not going to be intimidated.  And he closes his tweet  with the word basta which means enough in Spanish.  Hannah.</p><p>JONES:  Just briefly, Athena.  Have the family, the Trump family said  anything about any of these allegations given the fact at particular Karen  McDougal, they met her over the years.</p><p>JONES:  Right.  Well, no.  There's been no response from the president to  that interview.  That White House has denied that this relationship ever  happened.  But as far as the interview last night, there hasn't been any  sort of new response and the first lady also has not responded to any of  this, whether we're talking about consensual relationships or woman who  have accused her husband of sexual harassment or other kind of misconducts,  so silence coming from White House.</p><p>JONES:  Attempting to keep a dignified silence if that's possible in all of  this.  Athena Jones, we appreciate it.  Thank you.</p><p>JONES:  Thanks.</p><p>JONES:  Now to other news.  European Union is rallying behind Britain as it  points the finger of blame at Moscow for the poisoning of a former Russian  spy on British soil.  The EU is recalling its ambassador to Russia for  consultations over the nerve agent attack in Salisbury earlier on this  month.  EU leaders say they agree with Britain that it's highly likely that  Russia is responsible saying, \"There is no plausible alternative  explanation.</p><p>British Prime Minister Theresa May, meanwhile says there's a new dynamic in  the Brexit negotiations after EU leaders formally adopted a proposed  withdrawal legal agreements with the UK.  It covers issues including  citizens' rights and the so-called divorce bill that Britain will have to  pay to the block when it leaves and it paves the way for months of  intensive trade talks to begin, but there are still some sticking points to  resolve.  Most notably, of course, issue of the Northern Ireland border.</p><p>Some sparkling winemakers though are getting ready for Brexit by bottling  their bubbles in the most British of measures, the old pint.  Pints of wine  disappeared from UK shelves when they were banned by European regulations  back in the 1970s.  Anna Stewart visits one English winemaker to find out  why people are pining for their pints.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ANNA STEWART, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Rolling hills and the sea breeze, this  valley in the south of England has the perfect conditions for a vineyard.   Sarah and mark Driver founded the Rathfinny State eight years ago.  It's  well established in still wine and now it's moving into sparkling.  Unlike  its rival, French champagne, the couple would like to serve it from a very  British-sized bottle, the pint.</p><p>SARAH DRIVER, CO-FOUNDER, RATHFINNY WINE ESTATE:  Has always been my  favorite drink and to be absolutely honest, that's only got two and a half  glasses in it.  That's got six glasses in it.  And in the evening, if I  want to drink, I feel a bit extravagant if there's just two of us at home,  to open a full bottle.  But the pint bottles are perfect with four glasses.</p><p>STEWART:  Pints and champagne were extremely popular pre-1973 when Britain  joined the European Bloc, then EU regulation came bubbling up, dictating  that sparkling wine could only be sold in 375 or 750 milliliters, any  amount of hat.  But not the pint, 568 millimeters.  Winston Churchill was  often spotted with a glass of champagne and is widely reported to have been  a big proponent with a pint-sized bottle.  Saying, an imperial pint is an  ideal size for a man like me.  It's enough for two at lunch and one at  dinner.  Some may think it's the perfect size, but until the UK actually  leaves the EU, the pint size bottles are lying in wait.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We bottled about 800 of the pint sized bottle in 2015.   We haven't bottled anymore because we can't legally sell it.  However,  we're planning to do some next year and that will be ready for the release  in 2021 when hopefully the laws will change in the UK and then we can start  selling it.</p><p>STEWART:  So whether it's to celebrate or commiserate the end of the UK's  EU membership, Brits may be able to pop and open a pint of sparkling wine.</p><p>Anna Stewart, CNN, East Suffolk, UK.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>[16:50:58] JONES:  A pint of wine.  Certainly something to celebrate there.   Stay with us here on CNN.  Plenty more after this break.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>JONES:  Welcome back.  Now, when you think of India, you may think of  Bollywood.  But in the capital in New Delhi, an independent music scene is  emerging.  In today's \"DESTINATION INDIA,\" we delve into the city's night  life with a local rapper who's taking the Indian hip-hop scene by storm.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PRABH DEEP, NEW DELHI MUSICAL ARTIST:  India is not just all Bollywood,  it's more than that.  We are just moving towards different direction now.</p><p>And we really cares about quality music because we don't expect  (INAUDIBLE).  We have an industry though.  </p><p>As a performer, I used to go to the clubs and they used to tell me that you  can't perform in any racial languages, just English.  Now, it's changed.</p><p>Hip-hop is making noise in India, generally.  It's not just about making  rap songs anymore.  We are making music.  Like if you dive deep into it,  then you listen to our projects, you will find compositions, you find  arrangements like other musicians, big musicians do.  And we launched that  by ourselves.  And we're making (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>I think (INAUDIBLE) back in the day this was a really beautiful place, very  quiet.  Now, it's like a hub for so many people to party.  In the daytime,  it's more artistic.  But at night, it's total party scene.  It's a  different place altogether.</p><p>Those people are listening to some other music, they're open to new music,  basically.  There is almost to explore to why this runs on you know?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  What I really love about the Delhi music culture is  that it's getting everything in a very small location.  If you go back a  decade or so, you would generally see traveling to different parts of world  to engage into different kinds of music.</p><p>Now what is happening is with awesome mixed, all the DJs coming in playing  here.  We get every part of the world here in this small geographical hub.</p><p>It is bringing in more musicians here.  So it's just like amazing.   Landscape is going wider day by day.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JONES:  That the next few weeks.  CNN is telling the stories of young  scientists, entrepreneurs and inventors in a new special series.  Their  inspiring innovations will surely make a difference in improving our  environments, health and communities.  Dr. Sanjay Gupta introduces us to  one of tomorrow's heroes.  He's using organic waste to make renewable  energy.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>[16:55:13] SANJAY GUPTA, CNN SENIOR MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT:  This planet  earth is the only one we've got.  Yet every day, we pump massive amounts of  pollution into the atmosphere.  Tomorrow's hero, Leroy Mwasaru is working  to convert waste into renewable fuel, to help save our trees and our  planet.</p><p>LEROY MWASARU, INNOVATOR:  In high school, I used to walk around with a  notebook.  I used to note down the different problems that I saw each and  every day.  But then this problem came up and there was no way I was going  to ignore it.  I chose to address this one because it affected many people.</p><p>My name is Leroy Mwasaru.  I'm 20 years old.  And I'm from Kenya. My  invention is Greenpact.  Greenpact is a conscious social enterprise that's  offering green renewable solutions which is biogas energy. Greenpact begun  as a high school project where we utilized human waste and organic waste  and we used that to generate biogas and fertilizer to cook light meals in  the kitchen for the school.</p><p>The human waste bioreactor works using the principle of anaerobic  respiration.  A human waste doesn't have a significant level of energy, so  we supplement this with organic waste.  You put something in a container  and restrict air from it.  You get energy, and that energy is the CH4,  which is methane, and that methane is what is useful as biogas.  So that  CH4 once it goes through a filtering process, you remove the hydrogen  sulfide, we're able to get pure biogas energy.</p><p>Using these biogas systems, we'll actually find that they actually have no  waste because what comes in as a feed will eventually come out as biogas  and the sludge which comes out of the system is very clean organic  fertilizer.  We envision this solution to Kenyans who are not able to  purchase nonrenewable sources of energy.</p><p>The more we continue harming the environment with non-renewable sources of  energy, the more we continue depleting the environment.  My vision for this  invention is that it's something that will be replicated and be able to  grow, not only in size but also in impact.</p><p>There's still a lot that has to be done especially on the African continent  in terms of utilizing the number of resources that we have at hand.  And I  think I'd be best placed to be able to solve these problems that we face as  a continent.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JONES:  That's all we've got time for.  Thanks so much for watching.

I'm Hala Gorani live tonight from Paris. France is dealing with yet another terrorist attack on its soil. Three people are dead after a series of attacks in Southern France on this Friday.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It culminated in a four-hour standoff at a supermarket before police shot the gunman dead. He is named as a 26-year-old Redouane Lakdim. Here is what we know. On Friday morning, the attacker hijacked a car killing one person inside the car and injuring another.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And then not far from that, he shot a group of police officers, who are out jogging in the town of (INAUDIBLE). The car tried to run officers down. One person was wounded and then the gunman drove to a supermarket (INAUDIBLE). He entered the market shouting, \"Allahu Akbar.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This is all, by the way, information I'm bringing to you for the public prosecutor. He killed two people inside. He took several people hostage. A police officer agreed to give himself over to the gunman in exchange for the release of hostages and that officer entered the supermarket and then shot the gunman.</p><p>French President Emmanuel Macron returned to Paris from Brussels earlier than expected. He condemned the attack and he praised authorities on the scene.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>EMMANUEL MACRON, FRENCH PRESIDENT (through translator): Our country has been struck today by an Islamist terrorist attack. The courage of one particular senior police officer who voluntarily took the place of other hostages and who was very seriously wounded. He saved lives and he does honor to his force and his country.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GORANI: Jim Bittermann is here with me in Paris following the very latest. So, it was a three-part attack and it culminated in this very long standoff in the supermarket where t gunman took hostages.</p><p>JIM BITTERMANN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Exactly. The first person, one of the first people on the scene was this Lieutenant Colonel Arnault (ph) Bertrand, who is the lieutenant colonel who was the head of (INAUDIBLE) and he was on the scene, and saw the situation unrolling.</p><p>And the gunman at that point had one hostage left. There were 50 or so people in the store when this all began. They managed to escape. He was holding on to one woman hostage and Lieutenant Colonel Arnault (ph) Bertrand, negotiated an exchange for her with the gunman and he then became the hostage.</p><p>And the gunman trotted him out from the store and said he was killing them and threatened his life and said he's also going to blow up the store (INAUDIBLE), of course, and then took him back inside and shot him.</p><p>At that point, Bertrand had left his cell phone on so that his comrades and the SWAT team could know what was really go on outside would know what was going on, and as soon as they heard the shot, they kept that line open.</p><p>They understood exactly where things were progressing in terms of talking to the gunman. Any case, when they heard the fired, the SWAT Team went in. Two officers were injured when the SWAT team went in and his lieutenant colonel is now fighting for his life because he was shot several times.</p><p>GORANI: So, he swapped himself in for hostages in that supermarket?</p><p>BITTERMANN: Yes.</p><p>GORANI: And do we know -- the shooter himself, screaming Allahu Akbar and doing this for Syria, said he was doing this in the name of ISIS. What more do we know about this particular suspect?</p><p>BITTERMANN: It is unclear. And the police said they had him on their radar because he was a petty criminal. He's been involved with drugs and other sort of things that they had -- down as a (INAUDIBLE) a surveillance order back in 2014 or '15, I believe, yet the prosecutor told us there was nothing in his behavior that indicated he was aiming towards radicalization. So, they had no reason to suspend --</p><p>GORANI: He was \"fishy\" as they say in France, which means they were some suspicions surrounding them.</p><p>BITTERMANN: (Inaudible) of the (INAUDIBLE) surveillance and the ideas that you keep these people under surveillance because they may be up to no good.</p><p>GORANI: All right. Jim Bittermann, thanks very and we'll stay in close touch for the very latest.</p><p>Our analyst, Paul Cruickshank is joining me now live. Paul, this script is one we've written before and we've heard before, petty criminal, in his 20s, spent some time jail, had some sort of low-level felony convictions and was known to perhaps sell drugs, according reports.</p><p>[16:05:08] What does this tell us about where ISIS is in its effort to continue to mount attacks in western countries?</p><p>PAUL CRUICKSHANK, CNN TERRORISM ANALYST: Hala, it's trying to get people with this kind of profile to mount attacks in Europe and in ISIS' favor, there are tens of individuals inside Europe who have been flagged seen as potential threats inside the European Union and the 20,000 with about ten of those thousand seen as potential active threats.</p><p>So, it's still a very significant moving forward despite the fact that ISIS has been territorially defeated in Syria and Iraq. They are still trying to encourage these kinds of attacks through their propaganda.</p><p>And he's very clearly saying that he was doing this on behalf of ISIS. It would appear this was an attempt to gain a lot of publicity by taking hostages, but it's the heroic actions of this French lieutenant colonel which really kind of there wasn't a massacre here.</p><p>And that's a huge bravery, one of the most brave actions in this 17-year fight against terrorism and without what he did today, we could have seen many, many more being killed this individual, it would appear wanted to kill as many people as possible.</p><p>GORANI: Where -- so typically you have radicalization that occurs inside prisons and online, and quickly, according to analysts and experts who track ISIS conversations. There were celebrations on messaging platforms like Telegram that this was actually succeeding ahead, that some ISIS- inspired type attack had unfolded, quote/unquote, \"successfully\" as far as they were concerned.</p><p>CRUICKSHANK: Yes. I mean, there was a lot of excitement as you might expect on social media from ISIS supporters. There's been a lull in attacks in Europe since that Barcelona attack in August. They haven't been able to get a big one through so there is a big desire for revenge.</p><p>But what we saw played out today was an act of heroism from a French Security Services officer and inspiring thing about today, and that is something that will inspire a lot more people to place themselves at the service of confronting terrorism -- Hala.</p><p>GORANI: Right. (Inaudible) is his name, confirmed to us, to CNN, by a spokesperson at the Interior Ministry for those wondering how we got that name confirmed lieutenant colonel who swap himself in in exchange for hostages at that supermarket near Toulouse. Thanks very much, Paul Cruickshank.</p><p>Asiem El-Difraoui is here with me in Paris. Good to see you. So, let's talk a little bit, you know, oftentimes we focus on these petty losers who are 25 to 30 years old who have, like, drug dealing convictions and things like that.</p><p>But I do agree with Paul that on this one, let's spend some time celebrating this particular individual who went in and said give me the hostages, I'll go in. He is seriously wounded today.</p><p>ASIEM EL-DIFRAOUI, FRENCH TERROR EXPERT: Here is wounded hero or the petty loser?</p><p>GORANI: No, on the seriously wounded hero.</p><p>EL-DIFRAOUI: I mean, he's a really hero. France is very proud about him and it's real dedication of an officer to save innocent civilians.</p><p>GORANI: And the reason I'm calling him a petty criminal losers is because on so many levels, that's the profile, isn't it?</p><p>EL-DIFRAOUI: But I'm not happy about the term petty loser. Not a loser maybe of his own making. There's a lot of socioeconomic exclusion towards minorities in France all over Europe --</p><p>GORANI: We're not going to go down that path, are we? When we're going to say, I'm agreeing with you, there are a lot of exclusions and socio- economic discrimination and all sorts of thing, but this type of action cannot be explained by that, can it?</p><p>EL-DIFRAOUI: No, it can't, you know, but part of the explanation is definitely socioeconomic discrimination. But then I agree, you know, those people have very difficult psychological profiles. They want to become heroes just because they want to be in the limelight. In the sense, they're small people who just want to be star by doing these horrific crimes.</p><p>GORANI: Yes. What does it tell us about the state of ISIS? Because it's lost so much territory in Syria and Iraq, there was a lot of celebration from their cheerleaders on the messages apps like Telegram, but what does it tell us about where they are now in terms of their ability to strike?</p><p>[16:10:07] EL-DIFRAOUI: Not much, in reality, you know?</p><p>GORANI: Why? They haven't been able to mount --</p><p>EL-DIFRAOUI: These kinds of attacks have been happening while ISIS was, you know, you 2015 they were calling on these types of attacks and ISIS was totally unable to mount large-scale attacks and they're weakened and don't be surprised if there is a cell, you know?</p><p>ISIS has infiltrated European countries and there were recent ISIS arrests in Germany for people who were coming a couple of years ago as refugees, so let's not be sure. This fight will go on for a long time.</p><p>GORANI: I think anyone who says there won't be a big-scale attack is -- cannot -- how can you know this?</p><p>EL-DIFRAOUI: That's what I'm thinking.</p><p>GORANI: It could happen. But that being said --</p><p>EL-DIFRAOUI: What about al Qaeda in Yemen? What about (INAUDIBLE) group? What about outer groups.</p><p>GORANI: All that being said, when you see on TV and computer screens these other groups? What about other groups? Said, when you see on tv and on your computer screen and these huddled ISIS captives that have been captured either by the Kurds or the effort or whatever, and this is not a good advertisement for ISIS group. They're not these heroic in minds of the extremist heroic warriors.</p><p>EL-DIFRAOUI: No, it's very good for us, you know? Bin Laden was killed and the caliphate was nearly destroyed, but there are so many other groups so we shouldn't stop to be vigilant and we really should work in Europe as well as in the United States on long-term prevention.</p><p>And it does not only mean explaining to youngsters how dangerous and how totalitarian this ideology is. France is committing more and more efforts in doing that, but there's real geopolitical variables and the civil war in Syria, and the Turks attacking some Kurdish towns and maybe another window for ISIS, what about Egypt? Not just a global problem that we need to attack at the root causes.</p><p>GORANI: Well said. Definitely the causes and the reasons for the existence of these groups is still very present in that part of the world. Well, in any case, hopefully have better preventative measures in western countries. Asiem EL-DIFRAOUI, as always, thanks so much. Good seeing you again.</p><p>We are going to take a quick break and we will be right back with my colleague, Hanna Vaughan Jones in London with the rest of the day's news. Stay with us.</p><p>HANNAH VAUGHAN JONES, CNN HOST: Hala, thanks very much indeed.</p><p>JONES: Welcome back. We'll go back to Hala Gorani in Paris a little bit later, but for now other news we're following for you tonight. An economic tit for tat is currently underway between the world's two super powers.</p><p>First, U.S. President Donald Trump slapped tariffs on steel and aluminum imported from China. Then on Thursday, he tightened the screw with new taxes on other goods brought in from China worth up to $60 billion.</p><p>[16:15:09] As a result, the global markets nosedived. The Dow closed more than 700 points lower on Thursday and then this Friday, so far modestly proposing tariffs worth about $3 billion in response to the original round of Trump tariffs.</p><p>More is likely to come and that is making investors nervous, indeed. This is how the Dow closed today, down 424. That's lower again today and while Mr. Trump is acting increasingly hawkishly on China, he's also just appointed new security adviser, his third since his administration began.</p><p>John Bolton is the man and he is replacing H.R. McMaster in what is yet another high-profile shake-up of the White House in just the last few days. Bolton is a controversial pick given his views on Iraq and indeed his views on North Korea.</p><p>So, let's discuss all of this with CNN's White House reporter, Stephen Collinson live in Washington for us. Stephen, John Bolton has been around for some time under various administrations and perhaps his most senior role as the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, but might we see a different John Bolton under this president and under this administration and the Bolton we've seen of old?</p><p>STEPHEN COLLINSON, CNN POLITICS SENIOR REPORTER: I don't think there's any reason to think that the John Bolton that we're going to see in the White House is going to change at least in terms of his policy views and his very hard line, as you said, on North Korea and his against the Iran deal and he's talked about the necessity to bomb Iran to end the program.</p><p>He was a very prominent voice in the run-up to the war in Iraq supporting that action and I don't think it's likely that he will change his views when he gets to the moments when he has the most power in his entire career.</p><p>You know, John Bolton is someone who is a very controversial figure in Washington. When he was nominated by President George W. Bush to be the U.N. ambassador, couldn't get a permanent appointment for that job because the Senate wouldn't confirm him largely because he was seen as somebody who was very hard on subordinates.</p><p>And there was great resistance to him in the diplomatic corps, he's a very hard-charging character, but he's also somebody who knows how to use the levers of power in Washington so he's going to be a formidable opponent for his adversaries in the administration and he's a very interesting pick.</p><p>The one thing that I would say is that what he must learn is that nobody in this administration is allowed to become more prominent and dominant than the president himself and if he doesn't learn that lesson, I don't think he'd be there for that long.</p><p>GORANI: And the president himself speaking earlier on, talking about this spending bill which he has now signed into law. You could argue that perhaps it was a useful distraction from some of the other rumors scandals in the White House, and he signed it, but wasn't all that pleased about it. Take a listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: I say to Congress, I will never sign another bill like this again. I'm not going to do it again. Nobody read it. It's only hours old. Some people don't even know what it is -- $1.3 trillion.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JONES: So, you can hear there, Stephen, he signed it, but he will never do it again and it's apparent he didn't read it.</p><p>COLLINSON: Right. I mean, Donald Trump said he would to drain the swamp. This is a prime example of a swamp product coming out of Congress. You know, it's a bill that's bloated. The way you get stuff passed in Congress, everyone gets their pet project, and no one really knows what they're voting for because that's the way you need to get the votes.</p><p>Donald Trump was happy to Trump it the things he does want to including increased military spending and more money for fighting the opioid epidemic, but to get that money, you have to compromise and concede on other things.</p><p>What he didn't get in the bill was funding for his border wall which was at the center of his political project, if you like, since he started and that's one reason he's angry, but if he says he's not going to sign that bill again, if you want to get anything signed in Washington because of the way, you know, power is distributed, you have to give and take.</p><p>JONES: Stephen Collinson, thank you very much. Appreciate your analysis on this. I want to bring some breaking news and this resolves around activity in the U.K. at the moment. You will, of course, remember Cambridge Analytica, the data firm accused of having used Facebook data in order to help Donald Trump, perhaps help the campaigns around the world, various campaigns to get elected.</p><p>[16:20:12] The U.K. authorities, the Information Commission has been trying to get into Cambridge Analytica's U.K. office for the last week or so to get to the bottom of this and take documents and they just today managed to get a court order to do that.</p><p>We understand at the moment that 18 officers from the U.K. Information Commission or currently searching those offices here in London. We'll bring you more on that as we get any further detail.</p><p>But let's get back to what we were talking about before and the shake-ups in the White House in particular. My next guest has met John Bolton, the soon to be national security adviser and he's met him personally and he has wide expertise on the Asian region.</p><p>Of course, that's interesting because of what we've been talking about with trade wars and the like and the (INAUDIBLE) between the U.S. and China, which is brewing. Jamie Metzl is a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council think tank and joins me from New York. Jamie, great to see you.</p><p>Trump says earlier, rather that the relations with China are still great and that everything is still on track, but given John Bolton's appointment, given the trade wars that are looming, what's your current assessment of not just U.S.-China relations, but U.S.-Asia relations?</p><p>JAMIE METZL, SENIOR FELLOW, ATLANTIC COUNCIL: This could be, and this is a very significant turning point in America's relationship, not just with China, but with Asia. Since the end of the Second World War, the United States has been really the foundation of peace, security and stability in the Asia-Pacific region.</p><p>And that depended on America being a responsible player in that region and in the world, and so, America certainly made sacrifices, but also contributed through security, through open markets and through all these kinds of things that the United States provided to the world and we benefited enormously.</p><p>Donald Trump and his administration are looking to redo that deal and for America to behave like in many ways any other country, just with narrow, nationalist activities and behaviors and so now certainly, they talk of trade, we are not just with China.</p><p>China has behaved not well at all and there are reasons for the united states to get tougher on China, but to get tough on China, the United States needs to do what it's done for so many years, which is to build coalitions around positive values and that's what this administration isn't doing.</p><p>JONES: It isn't doing at the moment and if we talked specifically about the tariffs in particular, it was some $50 billion, wide-ranging tariffs that the U.S. has put on China specifically, but China's response is being quite measured. Are you expecting more to come?</p><p>METZL: China is waiting to see what the United States is really doing. The U.S. tariffs won't be applied immediately. There's going to be about a month of a negotiation process potentially, so China wants to wait and see.</p><p>Nobody certainly, China doesn't want to have a trade war with the United States, but at the same time China has gotten away with a lot of bad behaviors, blocking access for American international companies and forcing technology transfer and stealing intellectual property rights or stealing intellectual property and keeping America's big tech companies out of the Chinese markets.</p><p>So, China has known that the United States at some point will need to get tougher on China, but China also recognizes that President Trump is weakening America so significantly through his erratic behavior by the tumult within the administration and there are all these threats that have been made that haven't been carried out.</p><p>So, they want to see whether this is real or not, and whether Trump has the political ability and just the capacity within an administration that's in complete chaos to deliver on these tough words.</p><p>JONES: You talk about the chaos within the administration at the moment and the shake-ups going on, I am wondering what you think China might be making of John Bolton coming into the new role as national security adviser, given the fact that he has been very outspoken in the past at least about say, North Korea, a proponent of military intervention as opposed to any kind of dialogue and presumably China might be feeling quite sidelined by what's going on between the U.S. and North Korea right now.</p><p>METZL: I don't know if they're feeling sidelined because China still has the cards in many ways for North Korea because China's trade and aid and energy resources keep North Korea alive. So, whether this meeting happens between North Korea, Kim Jong-un and President Trump happens or not, it's very clear that North Korea will not be giving up its nukes any time soon.</p><p>That the Trump administration has no meaningful strategy so it's not that there's going to be some kind of deal or could be some kind of deal that sidelines China.</p><p>[16:25:05] But what I do think is that people all across the region are extremely concerned that the so-called moderates, the relative moderates and the so-called adults in the room from the Trump administration are all being sidelined, and a series of ideologues are taking their place.</p><p>The John Bolton who I know is a very smart, very thoughtful person, but he has been on the aggressive use of military action in Iran, for Iraq, and North Korea, and this is going to be a very, very difficult situation because the president already has erratic impulses.</p><p>Already his administration is under threat because of all of these scandals and he is, in the middle of the night, when decisions are made in the old days at least you can say there were some people who are trying to moderate their impulses. Now every day, we are losing what limited protection we have. This is a very, very dangerous situation.</p><p>JONES: Yes, exactly. A lot of people saying that the president has just surrounded himself by yes men. Even Kellyanne Conway is saying get with the program or get out to staff members within the administration.</p><p>Jamie, that's what we got time for. Jamie Metzl, we appreciate it. Thanks very much, indeed.</p><p>Still to come on the program tonight, after a terror attack in Southern France leaves three people dead, we're asking does France have a specific problem? Hala Gorani is back live in Paris next.</p><p>GORANI: We are live in Paris covering our top story this evening. Three people have been killed in a series of attacks in Southern France on this Friday. It all ended in a four-hour standoff at a supermarket before lice shot the gunman dead.</p><p>He was named as 26-year-old Redouane Lakdim. He was known to authorities and an ISIS affiliated group has claimed he was, quote, \"a soldier of their organization. The attack meant President Emmanuel Macron returned to France from Brussels where he was meeting other European Union leaders. He has called the incident a, quote, \"Islamist terrorist attack\" and says, authorities are looking into the ISIS claim of responsibility.</p><p>All right. We are going to connect with our Melissa Bell who is on the scene, but joining me now to talk more about this is the former head of the French Special Force, Frederic Gallois, and he joins me via Skype from Marseille.</p><p>What was your immediate thought when you learned of the details of this attack, this man who carjacked a driver and then attacked special riot police and then drove to a supermarket and took ordinary civilians hostage.</p><p>[16:30:00] What went through your mind?</p><p>FREDERIC GALLOIS, FORMER HEAD OF FRENCH SPECIAL FORCES: My first thought was to understand that it would be a very difficult situation because the terrorist claimed as a jihadist. And you know we had a huge experience now in France to deal with such situation. We're one particular region as such people, like they accept a suicidal operation, they expect to be killed in their operation. They don't want to stay alive. So for the Special Forces it's a very difficult situation because to save the people, the hostages on face the people -- guys which are waiting for them, waiting to suit them and who wanted to kill all the people so it's really difficult situation to act on.</p><p>GORANI: And there was a heroic police officer, Arnaud Beltrame who was a lieutenant colonel who swapped places with the hostage and ended up basically, in the end, alone with the gunman even though initially there were 50 people in that supermarket.</p><p>GALLOIS: It's an incredible situation because this officer decided himself to swap with a group of hostages and he entered inside the supermarket and he stopped to speak with the terrorist. It's a very incredible situation, because in the face of such people, he knew that it was like a suicidal decision. He went directly to the terrorist, because should have seen that the terrorist will not keep him alive, but decided to enter and to swap with other hostage. He certainly saved the life of many people. It was the end of the operation.</p><p>GORANI: Thank you so much, Frederic Gallois, the former head of the French Special Forces speaking to us live this evening from Marseille.</p><p>Jim Bittermann is still here with me. And this standoff in the supermarket went on for many, many hours.</p><p>JIM BITTERMANN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Three hours, I think. And it reminded me very much -- do you remember Amedy Coulibaly? After the Charlie Hebdo attacks in 2015 and he had shot a police officer on the south side of Paris, a police woman who was -- who died and then held hostages in the Kosher supermarket and the same kind of modus operandi. He came into the supermarket, shot at this guy and immediately shot a couple of the people, of the customers of the store as this guy did today, I guess to show -- make a big show of the fact that he was in charge, and he certainly was for a little while.</p><p>GORANI: And I'm sure authorities are going to be looking very closely at this guy's background because he was known to authorities. He'd been incarcerated for a short period of time for petty crimes, but he was also (INAUDIBLE) what we call in France (INAUDIBLE) which means that he was suspected of having sympathies with extremist organization.</p><p>BITTERMANN: The prosecutor Thomas tonight, no suspicion that he was becoming radicalized or would passed to an act, as they say in France, they're going to action. So there was no indication that they had, but they had him under surveillance. And, you know, there'll be a lot of questions, like for instance, where did he get this gun or guns? There may have been more than one, but in any case, where did that comes from? And who was helping him out amongst his family members and associates and others, if there was anybody and they have taken one person into custody tonight. One of his close associates and I'm sure that's what the question is going to be about.</p><p>GORANI: But we don't know much otherwise, other than that about his family, his background. We know he was 26 years old of Moroccan origin.</p><p>BITTERMANN: And the Moroccans said that he was born there and they had him there in 2011, I think it was. He had been there for a return trip and not any notice that normally would have taken. They just went back to their files to see when he might have come in. So there was nothing that they were alerted to that indicated he was radicalized.</p><p>GORANI: And also he -- the target is a supermarket in a small town. It's not a big high-value, quote, quote, \"Target.\"</p><p>BITTERMANN: I know you know this area. I know you know this area. Provence is like this sleepy little town, it's 5,000 people and a sleepy little supermarket that people are going in a Friday shopping on. And it must have been just an unbelievable turn of events. And I guess it says something about the awareness of people that the people have the wits to get out of the supermarket that most of the hostages, most of the people in supermarket fled before they could become hostages.</p><p>[16:35:23] GORANI: Well, it must have been terrifying for them and three did lose their lives today.</p><p>Jim Bittermann, thanks very much, and I understand Melissa Bell is with us on the phone, is that correct? From near the scene?</p><p>No. I think we have -- she is with us, actually, on camera. Melissa, tell us where you are and what you're seeing around you.</p><p>MELISSA BELL, CNN PARIS CORRESPONDENT: Well, we're inside Carcassonne, and just in front of the apartment building where the suspect, the man has been identified as the attacker today lived. This has been a subject of a number of raids by police over the course of the evening, Hala. And even now, they're positioned all around the apartment building. They say we can't get any closer because the youth that lived here have gathered outside (INAUDIBLE) we are quite close to the police, but just behind me this apartment building where he lived.</p><p>It's understood also and we understood this is from Francois Molins, who was the French prosecutor who spoke earlier that a young woman had been taken into custody, as well, his girlfriend, the person that he shared his life with and this is where those raids took place, just hours, of course, after those attacks, those series of attacks, three attacks, the triple attack, of course, that took place, began here in Carcassonne, moved on just outside with events ending here over the course of the evening. And as I say, still a huge police presence around this apartment building as authorities tries to piece together precisely the background of the assailant.</p><p>GORANI: Because there are other people in custody now, and I guess the big question for authorities, Melissa, is did he act alone? Was he radicalized alone on his computer? Or was there more of a cell, more of a network behind this?</p><p>BELL: Exactly. Understood and it's much clearer now that he was officially what the French called (INAUDIBLE) now, that doesn't mean that he was a subject of active surveillance, but it does mean that he was on the sort of police computers as someone who might be radicalized and therefore, if he stopped, was stopped by police say for speeding on a highway, this would immediately be alerted to them if he was stopped trying to cross the border this, too, would be to alerted to authorities. But of course, it doesn't mean that there is active surveillance of these people all of the time. And after all, Hala, there are some many thousands of them in France have this (INAUDIBLE) system that is the subject of this indication to authorities this following of them even if the surveillance is not all of the time active.</p><p>We understand that he became (INAUDIBLE) in 2014 for a while that was taken away and then brought back. But on the whole, he was known in terms of what had got him into trouble for petty crime, for being a small time drug dealer and he'd done time in jail and there was nothing to lead authorities. We heard it both from the interior minister here on, Hala, and from Francois Molins, the French prosecutor tonight, there was nothing to lead intelligence agencies, security forces to believe that he was about to act.</p><p>GORANI: All right. Melissa Bell there near the scene. Thanks very much for joining us with the latest. And Hannah has the rest of the day's news. Hannah.</p><p>JONES: Hala, thanks very much indeed.</p><p>All right. Still to come on the program from London. A new dynamic. That's how the UK Prime Minister, Theresa May is describing Brexit talks after the EU agrees to a transition deal.</p><p>And who needs soap operas with this kind of real-life drama. Former playboy playmate give some stunning details about her alleged affair with Donald Trump.</p><p>[16:40:06] JONES: Welcome back to HALA GORANI TONIGHT with me Hannah Vaughan Jones live in London for you.</p><p>Now, Donald Trump is usually quick to fight back when confronted with the damaging allegations. But so far, silence from the U.S. president after CNN's explosive interview with the former playboy playmate. Karen McDougal says not only did she have sexual relations with Mr. Trump, but says they actually had a 10-month long affair starting back in 2006 during which he constantly professed his love for her. McDougal explained to CNN's, Anderson Cooper why she cried after their first sexual encounter.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KAREN MCDOUGAL, FORMER PLAYBOY PLAYMATE: Well, after we had been intimate, he tried to pay me and I actually did not take that.</p><p>ANDERSON COOPER, CNN ANCHOR: Did he actually try to hand you money?</p><p>MCDOUGAL: He did. He did. And I said -- I mean, I just had this look of -- I don't even know how to describe the look on my face -- must have been so sad because I had never been offered money like that before, number one. But number two, I thought, does he think that I'm in this for money or why I'm here tonight? Or is this a normal thing? I didn't know. But I looked at him and I said that's not me. I'm not that kind of girl, and he said, \"Oh,\" and he said \"You're really special.\" And I was like, \"Thank you.\" So I left, actually got in the car. Keith taking me home and I started crying. I was really sad. It really hurt me. But I went back.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JONES: Well, that is weren't enough, the attorney for another woman who had an alleged affair with Mr. Trump is now taunting and baiting the president. You guessed it, on Twitter. Athena Jones is following all these developments, joins us now with more. Athena, there's a mounting course of female accusers doing the media rounds at the moment. Donald Trump is the man we know doesn't usually keep still and let things slide without saying his peace on this. How on earth is the president going to keep quiet?</p><p>ATHENA JONES, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, that's a good question, Hannah, it's so interesting to see him be so quite. It is remarkable. This is uncharacteristic. When it comes to the women who have accused Trump of sexual harassment, or sexual assault, he has been aggressive in denying those allegations. There was a point in time when he would deny the allegations daily whether on Twitter or in speeches or both. But he has a very different approach to these women who we're talking about having had consensual relationships with him. He's been far less aggressive. He has said nothing. He has not tweeted, he has not commented and it really is remarkable and it is very likely that people are advising him not to tweet or comment about this, but I've also talked to other women and not the women who said that they've had consensual relationships with the president, but some of the woman who have accused him of sexual misconduct and they say that he likes being associated with these beautiful women in the headlines. He likes the idea that he's being linked to these women even if it was an affair that started a few months after his own son, Barron, his most recent son, was born. But it is quite unique to see him not responding here. Hannah?</p><p>JONES: I'm not sure how happy he'll be about Stormy Daniels continuing to play out the allegations in front of the world's press. Stormy Daniels, of course, definitely a porn star, her lawyer has also been playing into to this whole rouse, as well. Pretty much playing Donald Trump, you can say at his own game. This is the latest tweet that we heard from Stephanie Clifford's lawyer. He says, if a picture is worth a thousand words, how many words is this worth? And you can see there a disk, as well.</p><p>I mean, it is pretty much trying to play the president at his own game and a game that he's probably not going to want to be a part of.</p><p>[16:45:53] JONES: Well, it's quite a tease, isn't it? Quite a cliffhanger for that \"60 MINUTES\" interview, that Stormy Daniels -- she's sitting down with Anderson Cooper. That interview is to air on Sunday night, and so Michael Avenatti, Stormy Daniels' lawyer, like you say, he's sort of using these kind of reality TV or teasing and kind of cliffhangers using Trump's own methods to kind of poke at him. What's unclear is, was that a CD? Is that a DVD? What is on it?</p><p>A colleague of mine MJ Lee, asked Avenatti today if that could be maybe a tape of this polygraph test that Stormy Daniels subjected herself to several years ago. He said that that's not what's on that disk, it has nothing to do with that. But we don't know what it is. Maybe we'll find out on Sunday and yes, he has said over and over again that they are not going away. They are not going to be intimidated. And he closes his tweet with the word basta which means enough in Spanish. Hannah.</p><p>JONES: Just briefly, Athena. Have the family, the Trump family said anything about any of these allegations given the fact at particular Karen McDougal, they met her over the years.</p><p>JONES: Right. Well, no. There's been no response from the president to that interview. That White House has denied that this relationship ever happened. But as far as the interview last night, there hasn't been any sort of new response and the first lady also has not responded to any of this, whether we're talking about consensual relationships or woman who have accused her husband of sexual harassment or other kind of misconducts, so silence coming from White House.</p><p>JONES: Attempting to keep a dignified silence if that's possible in all of this. Athena Jones, we appreciate it. Thank you.</p><p>JONES: Thanks.</p><p>JONES: Now to other news. European Union is rallying behind Britain as it points the finger of blame at Moscow for the poisoning of a former Russian spy on British soil. The EU is recalling its ambassador to Russia for consultations over the nerve agent attack in Salisbury earlier on this month. EU leaders say they agree with Britain that it's highly likely that Russia is responsible saying, \"There is no plausible alternative explanation.</p><p>British Prime Minister Theresa May, meanwhile says there's a new dynamic in the Brexit negotiations after EU leaders formally adopted a proposed withdrawal legal agreements with the UK. It covers issues including citizens' rights and the so-called divorce bill that Britain will have to pay to the block when it leaves and it paves the way for months of intensive trade talks to begin, but there are still some sticking points to resolve. Most notably, of course, issue of the Northern Ireland border.</p><p>Some sparkling winemakers though are getting ready for Brexit by bottling their bubbles in the most British of measures, the old pint. Pints of wine disappeared from UK shelves when they were banned by European regulations back in the 1970s. Anna Stewart visits one English winemaker to find out why people are pining for their pints.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ANNA STEWART, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Rolling hills and the sea breeze, this valley in the south of England has the perfect conditions for a vineyard. Sarah and mark Driver founded the Rathfinny State eight years ago. It's well established in still wine and now it's moving into sparkling. Unlike its rival, French champagne, the couple would like to serve it from a very British-sized bottle, the pint.</p><p>SARAH DRIVER, CO-FOUNDER, RATHFINNY WINE ESTATE: Has always been my favorite drink and to be absolutely honest, that's only got two and a half glasses in it. That's got six glasses in it. And in the evening, if I want to drink, I feel a bit extravagant if there's just two of us at home, to open a full bottle. But the pint bottles are perfect with four glasses.</p><p>STEWART: Pints and champagne were extremely popular pre-1973 when Britain joined the European Bloc, then EU regulation came bubbling up, dictating that sparkling wine could only be sold in 375 or 750 milliliters, any amount of hat. But not the pint, 568 millimeters. Winston Churchill was often spotted with a glass of champagne and is widely reported to have been a big proponent with a pint-sized bottle. Saying, an imperial pint is an ideal size for a man like me. It's enough for two at lunch and one at dinner. Some may think it's the perfect size, but until the UK actually leaves the EU, the pint size bottles are lying in wait.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We bottled about 800 of the pint sized bottle in 2015. We haven't bottled anymore because we can't legally sell it. However, we're planning to do some next year and that will be ready for the release in 2021 when hopefully the laws will change in the UK and then we can start selling it.</p><p>STEWART: So whether it's to celebrate or commiserate the end of the UK's EU membership, Brits may be able to pop and open a pint of sparkling wine.</p><p>Anna Stewart, CNN, East Suffolk, UK.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>[16:50:58] JONES: A pint of wine. Certainly something to celebrate there. Stay with us here on CNN. Plenty more after this break.</p><p>JONES: Welcome back. Now, when you think of India, you may think of Bollywood. But in the capital in New Delhi, an independent music scene is emerging. In today's \"DESTINATION INDIA,\" we delve into the city's night life with a local rapper who's taking the Indian hip-hop scene by storm.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PRABH DEEP, NEW DELHI MUSICAL ARTIST: India is not just all Bollywood, it's more than that. We are just moving towards different direction now.</p><p>And we really cares about quality music because we don't expect (INAUDIBLE). We have an industry though.</p><p>As a performer, I used to go to the clubs and they used to tell me that you can't perform in any racial languages, just English. Now, it's changed.</p><p>Hip-hop is making noise in India, generally. It's not just about making rap songs anymore. We are making music. Like if you dive deep into it, then you listen to our projects, you will find compositions, you find arrangements like other musicians, big musicians do. And we launched that by ourselves. And we're making (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>I think (INAUDIBLE) back in the day this was a really beautiful place, very quiet. Now, it's like a hub for so many people to party. In the daytime, it's more artistic. But at night, it's total party scene. It's a different place altogether.</p><p>Those people are listening to some other music, they're open to new music, basically. There is almost to explore to why this runs on you know?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What I really love about the Delhi music culture is that it's getting everything in a very small location. If you go back a decade or so, you would generally see traveling to different parts of world to engage into different kinds of music.</p><p>Now what is happening is with awesome mixed, all the DJs coming in playing here. We get every part of the world here in this small geographical hub.</p><p>It is bringing in more musicians here. So it's just like amazing. Landscape is going wider day by day.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JONES: That the next few weeks. CNN is telling the stories of young scientists, entrepreneurs and inventors in a new special series. Their inspiring innovations will surely make a difference in improving our environments, health and communities. Dr. Sanjay Gupta introduces us to one of tomorrow's heroes. He's using organic waste to make renewable energy.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>[16:55:13] SANJAY GUPTA, CNN SENIOR MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: This planet earth is the only one we've got. Yet every day, we pump massive amounts of pollution into the atmosphere. Tomorrow's hero, Leroy Mwasaru is working to convert waste into renewable fuel, to help save our trees and our planet.</p><p>LEROY MWASARU, INNOVATOR: In high school, I used to walk around with a notebook. I used to note down the different problems that I saw each and every day. But then this problem came up and there was no way I was going to ignore it. I chose to address this one because it affected many people.</p><p>My name is Leroy Mwasaru. I'm 20 years old. And I'm from Kenya. My invention is Greenpact. Greenpact is a conscious social enterprise that's offering green renewable solutions which is biogas energy. Greenpact begun as a high school project where we utilized human waste and organic waste and we used that to generate biogas and fertilizer to cook light meals in the kitchen for the school.</p><p>The human waste bioreactor works using the principle of anaerobic respiration. A human waste doesn't have a significant level of energy, so we supplement this with organic waste. You put something in a container and restrict air from it. You get energy, and that energy is the CH4, which is methane, and that methane is what is useful as biogas. So that CH4 once it goes through a filtering process, you remove the hydrogen sulfide, we're able to get pure biogas energy.</p><p>Using these biogas systems, we'll actually find that they actually have no waste because what comes in as a feed will eventually come out as biogas and the sludge which comes out of the system is very clean organic fertilizer. We envision this solution to Kenyans who are not able to purchase nonrenewable sources of energy.</p><p>The more we continue harming the environment with non-renewable sources of energy, the more we continue depleting the environment. My vision for this invention is that it's something that will be replicated and be able to grow, not only in size but also in impact.</p><p>There's still a lot that has to be done especially on the African continent in terms of utilizing the number of resources that we have at hand. And I think I'd be best placed to be able to solve these problems that we face as a continent.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JONES: That's all we've got time for. Thanks so much for watching.

I'm Hala Gorani live  tonight from Paris.  France is dealing with yet another terrorist attack on  its soil.  Three people are dead after a series of attacks in Southern  France on this Friday.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> It culminated in a four-hour standoff at a supermarket before police shot  the gunman dead.  He is named as a 26-year-old Redouane Lakdim.  Here is  what we know.  On Friday morning, the attacker hijacked a car killing one  person inside the car and injuring another.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> And then not far from that, he shot a group of police officers, who are out  jogging in the town of (INAUDIBLE).  The car tried to run officers down.   One person was wounded and then the gunman drove to a supermarket  (INAUDIBLE).  He entered the market shouting, \"Allahu Akbar.\"</p><p> This is all, by the way, information I'm bringing to you for the public  prosecutor.  He killed two people inside.  He took several people hostage.   A police officer agreed to give himself over to the gunman in exchange for  the release of hostages and that officer entered the supermarket and then  shot the gunman.</p><p> French President Emmanuel Macron returned to Paris from Brussels earlier  than expected.  He condemned the attack and he praised authorities on the  scene.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> EMMANUEL MACRON, FRENCH PRESIDENT (through translator):  Our country has  been struck today by an Islamist terrorist attack.  The courage of one  particular senior police officer who voluntarily took the place of other  hostages and who was very seriously wounded.  He saved lives and he does  honor to his force and his country.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> GORANI:  Jim Bittermann is here with me in Paris following the very latest.   So, it was a three-part attack and it culminated in this very long standoff  in the supermarket where t gunman took hostages.</p><p> JIM BITTERMANN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Exactly.  The  first person, one of the first people on the scene was this Lieutenant  Colonel Arnault (ph) Bertrand, who is the lieutenant colonel who was the  head of (INAUDIBLE) and he was on the scene, and saw the situation  unrolling.</p><p> And the gunman at that point had one hostage left.  There were 50 or so  people in the store when this all began.  They managed to escape.  He was  holding on to one woman hostage and Lieutenant Colonel Arnault (ph)  Bertrand, negotiated an exchange for her with the gunman and he then became  the hostage.</p><p> And the gunman trotted him out from the store and said he was killing them  and threatened his life and said he's also going to blow up the store  (INAUDIBLE), of course, and then took him back inside and shot him.</p><p> At that point, Bertrand had left his cell phone on so that his comrades and  the SWAT team could know what was really go on outside would know what was  going on, and as soon as they heard the shot, they kept that line open.</p><p> They understood exactly where things were progressing in terms of talking  to the gunman.   Any case, when they heard the fired, the SWAT Team went  in.  Two officers were injured when the SWAT team went in and his  lieutenant colonel is now fighting for his life because he was shot several  times.</p><p> GORANI:  So, he swapped himself in for hostages in that supermarket?</p><p> BITTERMANN:  Yes.</p><p> GORANI:  And do we know -- the shooter himself, screaming Allahu Akbar and  doing this for Syria, said he was doing this in the name of ISIS.  What  more do we know about this particular suspect?</p><p> BITTERMANN:  It is unclear.  And the police said they had him on their  radar because he was a petty criminal.  He's been involved with drugs and  other sort of things that they had -- down as a (INAUDIBLE) a surveillance  order back in 2014 or '15, I believe, yet the prosecutor told us there was  nothing in his behavior that indicated he was aiming towards  radicalization.  So, they had no reason to suspend -- </p><p> GORANI:  He was \"fishy\" as they say in France, which means they were some  suspicions surrounding them.</p><p> BITTERMANN:  (Inaudible) of the (INAUDIBLE) surveillance and the ideas that  you keep these people under surveillance because they may be up to no good.</p><p> GORANI:  All right.  Jim Bittermann, thanks very and we'll stay in close  touch for the very latest.</p><p> Our analyst, Paul Cruickshank is joining me now live.  Paul, this script is  one we've written before and we've heard before, petty criminal, in his  20s, spent some time jail, had some sort of low-level felony convictions  and was known to perhaps sell drugs, according reports.</p><p> [16:05:08] What does this tell us about where ISIS is in its effort to  continue to mount attacks in western countries?</p><p> PAUL CRUICKSHANK, CNN TERRORISM ANALYST:  Hala, it's trying to get people  with this kind of profile to mount attacks in Europe and in ISIS' favor,  there are tens of individuals inside Europe who have been flagged seen as  potential threats inside the European Union and the 20,000 with about ten  of those thousand seen as potential active threats.</p><p> So, it's still a very significant moving forward despite the fact that ISIS  has been territorially defeated in Syria and Iraq.  They are still trying  to encourage these kinds of attacks through their propaganda.</p><p> And he's very clearly saying that he was doing this on behalf of ISIS.  It  would appear this was an attempt to gain a lot of publicity by taking  hostages, but it's the heroic actions of this French lieutenant colonel  which really kind of there wasn't a massacre here.</p><p> And that's a huge bravery, one of the most brave actions in this 17-year  fight against terrorism and without what he did today, we could have seen  many, many more being killed this individual, it would appear wanted to  kill as many people as possible.</p><p> GORANI:  Where -- so typically you have radicalization that occurs inside  prisons and online, and quickly, according to analysts and experts who  track ISIS conversations.  There were celebrations on messaging platforms  like Telegram that this was actually succeeding ahead, that some ISIS- inspired type attack had unfolded, quote/unquote, \"successfully\" as far as  they were concerned.</p><p> CRUICKSHANK:  Yes.  I mean, there was a lot of excitement as you might  expect on social media from ISIS supporters.  There's been a lull in  attacks in Europe since that Barcelona attack in August.  They haven't been  able to get a big one through so there is a big desire for revenge.</p><p> But what we saw played out today was an act of heroism from a French  Security Services officer and inspiring thing about today, and that is  something that will inspire a lot more people to place themselves at the  service of confronting terrorism -- Hala.</p><p> GORANI:  Right.  (Inaudible) is his name, confirmed to us, to CNN, by a  spokesperson at the Interior Ministry for those wondering how we got that  name confirmed lieutenant colonel who swap himself in in exchange for  hostages at that supermarket near Toulouse.  Thanks very much, Paul  Cruickshank.</p><p> Asiem El-Difraoui is here with me in Paris.  Good to see you.  So, let's  talk a little bit, you know, oftentimes we focus on these petty losers who  are 25 to 30 years old who have, like, drug dealing convictions and things  like that.</p><p> But I do agree with Paul that on this one, let's spend some time  celebrating this particular individual who went in and said give me the  hostages, I'll go in.  He is seriously wounded today.</p><p> ASIEM EL-DIFRAOUI, FRENCH TERROR EXPERT:  Here is wounded hero or the petty  loser?</p><p> GORANI:  No, on the seriously wounded hero.</p><p> EL-DIFRAOUI:  I mean, he's a really hero.  France is very proud about him  and it's real dedication of an officer to save innocent civilians.</p><p> GORANI:  And the reason I'm calling him a petty criminal losers is because  on so many levels, that's the profile, isn't it?</p><p> EL-DIFRAOUI:  But I'm not happy about the term petty loser.  Not a loser  maybe of his own making.  There's a lot of socioeconomic exclusion towards  minorities in France all over Europe -- </p><p> GORANI:  We're not going to go down that path, are we?  When we're going to  say, I'm agreeing with you, there are a lot of exclusions and socio- economic discrimination and all sorts of thing, but this type of action  cannot be explained by that, can it?</p><p> EL-DIFRAOUI:  No, it can't, you know, but part of the explanation is  definitely socioeconomic discrimination.  But then I agree, you know, those  people have very difficult psychological profiles.  They want to become  heroes just because they want to be in the limelight.  In the sense,  they're small people who just want to be star by doing these horrific  crimes.</p><p> GORANI:  Yes.  What does it tell us about the state of ISIS?  Because it's  lost so much territory in Syria and Iraq, there was a lot of celebration  from their cheerleaders on the messages apps like Telegram, but what does  it tell us about where they are now in terms of their ability to strike?</p><p> [16:10:07] EL-DIFRAOUI:  Not much, in reality, you know?</p><p> GORANI:  Why?  They haven't been able to mount -- </p><p> EL-DIFRAOUI:  These kinds of attacks have been happening while ISIS was,  you know, you 2015 they were calling on these types of attacks and ISIS was  totally unable to mount large-scale attacks and they're weakened and don't  be surprised if there is a cell, you know?</p><p> ISIS has infiltrated European countries and there were recent ISIS arrests  in Germany for people who were coming a couple of years ago as refugees, so  let's not be sure.  This fight will go on for a long time.</p><p> GORANI:  I think anyone who says there won't be a big-scale attack is --  cannot -- how can you know this?</p><p> EL-DIFRAOUI:  That's what I'm thinking.</p><p> GORANI:  It could happen.  But that being said -- </p><p> EL-DIFRAOUI:  What about al Qaeda in Yemen?  What about (INAUDIBLE) group?   What about outer groups.</p><p> GORANI:  All that being said, when you see on TV and computer screens these  other groups?  What about other groups?  Said, when you see on tv and on  your computer screen and these huddled ISIS captives that have been  captured either by the Kurds or the effort or whatever, and this is not a  good advertisement for ISIS group.  They're not these heroic in minds of  the extremist heroic warriors.</p><p> EL-DIFRAOUI:  No, it's very good for us, you know?  Bin Laden was killed  and the caliphate was nearly destroyed, but there are so many other groups  so we shouldn't stop to be vigilant and we really should work in Europe as  well as in the United States on long-term prevention.</p><p> And it does not only mean explaining to youngsters how dangerous and how  totalitarian this ideology is.  France is committing more and more efforts  in doing that, but there's real geopolitical variables and the civil war in  Syria, and the Turks attacking some Kurdish towns and maybe another window  for ISIS, what about Egypt?  Not just a global problem that we need to  attack at the root causes.</p><p> GORANI:  Well said.  Definitely the causes and the reasons for the  existence of these groups is still very present in that part of the world.   Well, in any case, hopefully   have better preventative measures in western  countries.  Asiem EL-DIFRAOUI, as always, thanks so much.  Good seeing you  again.</p><p> We are going to take a quick break and we will be right back with my  colleague, Hanna Vaughan Jones in London with the rest of the day's news.   Stay with us.</p><p> HANNAH VAUGHAN JONES, CNN HOST:  Hala, thanks very much indeed.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> JONES:  Welcome back.  We'll go back to Hala Gorani in Paris a little bit  later, but for now other news we're following for you tonight.  An economic  tit for tat is currently underway between the world's two super powers.</p><p> First, U.S. President Donald Trump slapped tariffs on steel and aluminum  imported from China.  Then on Thursday, he tightened the screw with new  taxes on other goods brought in from China worth up to $60 billion.</p><p> [16:15:09] As a result, the global markets nosedived.  The Dow closed more  than 700 points lower on Thursday and then this Friday, so far modestly  proposing tariffs worth about $3 billion in response to the original round  of Trump tariffs.</p><p> More is likely to come and that is making investors nervous, indeed.  This  is how the Dow closed today, down 424.  That's lower again today and while  Mr. Trump is acting increasingly hawkishly on China, he's also just  appointed new security adviser, his third since his administration began.</p><p> John Bolton is the man and he is replacing H.R. McMaster in what is yet  another high-profile shake-up of the White House in just the last few days.   Bolton is a controversial pick given his views on Iraq and indeed his views  on North Korea.</p><p> So, let's discuss all of this with CNN's White House reporter, Stephen  Collinson live in Washington for us.  Stephen, John Bolton has been around  for some time under various administrations and perhaps his most senior  role as the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, but might we see a  different John Bolton under this president and under this administration  and the Bolton we've seen of old?</p><p> STEPHEN COLLINSON, CNN POLITICS SENIOR REPORTER:  I don't think there's any  reason to think that the John Bolton that we're going to see in the White  House is going to change at least in terms of his policy views and his very  hard line, as you said, on North Korea and his against the Iran deal and  he's talked about the necessity to bomb Iran to end the program.</p><p> He was a very prominent voice in the run-up to the war in Iraq supporting  that action and I don't think it's likely that he will change his views  when he gets to the moments when he has the most power in his entire  career.</p><p> You know, John Bolton is someone who is a very controversial figure in  Washington.  When he was nominated by President George W. Bush to be the  U.N. ambassador, couldn't get a permanent appointment for that job because  the Senate wouldn't confirm him largely because he was seen as somebody who  was very hard on subordinates.</p><p> And there was great resistance to him in the diplomatic corps, he's a very  hard-charging character, but he's also somebody who knows how to use the  levers of power in Washington so he's going to be a formidable opponent for  his adversaries in the administration and he's a very interesting pick.</p><p> The one thing that I would say is that what he must learn is that nobody in  this administration is allowed to become more prominent and dominant than  the president himself and if he doesn't learn that lesson, I don't think  he'd be there for that long.</p><p> GORANI:  And the president himself speaking earlier on, talking about this  spending bill which he has now signed into law.  You could argue that  perhaps it was a useful distraction from some of the other rumors scandals  in the White House, and he signed it, but wasn't all that pleased about it.   Take a listen to this.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA:  I say to  Congress, I will never sign another bill like this again.  I'm not going to  do it again.  Nobody read it.  It's only hours old.  Some people don't even  know what it is -- $1.3 trillion.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> JONES:  So, you can hear there, Stephen, he signed it, but he will never do  it again and it's apparent he didn't read it.</p><p> COLLINSON:  Right.  I mean, Donald Trump said he would to drain the swamp.   This is a prime example of a swamp product coming out of Congress.  You  know, it's a bill that's bloated.  The way you get stuff passed in  Congress, everyone gets their pet project, and no one really knows what  they're voting for because that's the way you need to get the votes.</p><p> Donald Trump was happy to Trump it the things he does want to including  increased military spending and more money for fighting the opioid  epidemic, but to get that money, you have to compromise and concede on  other things.</p><p> What he didn't get in the bill was funding for his border wall which was at  the center of his political project, if you like, since he started and  that's one reason he's angry, but if he says he's not going to sign that  bill again, if you want to get anything signed in Washington because of the  way, you know, power is distributed, you have to give and take.</p><p> JONES:  Stephen Collinson, thank you very much.  Appreciate your analysis  on this.  I want to bring some breaking news and this resolves around  activity in the U.K. at the moment.  You will, of course, remember  Cambridge Analytica, the data firm accused of having used Facebook data in  order to help Donald Trump, perhaps help the campaigns around the world,  various campaigns to get elected.</p><p> [16:20:12] The U.K. authorities, the Information Commission has been trying  to get into Cambridge Analytica's U.K. office for the last week or so to  get to the bottom of this and take documents and they just today managed to  get a court order to do that.</p><p> We understand at the moment that 18 officers from the U.K. Information  Commission or currently searching those offices here in London.  We'll  bring you more on that as we get any further detail.</p><p> But let's get back to what we were talking about before and the shake-ups  in the White House in particular.  My next guest has met John Bolton, the  soon to be national security adviser and he's met him personally and he has  wide expertise on the Asian region.</p><p> Of course, that's interesting because of what we've been talking about with  trade wars and the like and the (INAUDIBLE) between the U.S. and China,  which is brewing.  Jamie Metzl is a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council  think tank and joins me from New York.  Jamie, great to see you.</p><p> Trump says earlier, rather that the relations with China are still great  and that everything is still on track, but given John Bolton's appointment,  given the trade wars that are looming, what's your current assessment of  not just U.S.-China relations, but U.S.-Asia relations?</p><p> JAMIE METZL, SENIOR FELLOW, ATLANTIC COUNCIL:  This could be, and this is a  very significant turning point in America's relationship, not just with  China, but with Asia.  Since the end of the Second World War, the United  States has been really the foundation of peace, security and stability in  the Asia-Pacific region.</p><p> And that depended on America being a responsible player in that region and  in the world, and so, America certainly made sacrifices, but also  contributed through security, through open markets and through all these  kinds of things that the United States provided to the world and we  benefited enormously.</p><p> Donald Trump and his administration are looking to redo that deal and for  America to behave like in many ways any other country, just with narrow,  nationalist activities and behaviors and so now certainly, they talk of  trade, we are not just with China.</p><p> China has behaved not well at all and there are reasons for the united  states to get tougher on China, but to get tough on China, the United  States needs to do what it's done for so many years, which is to build  coalitions around positive values and that's what this administration isn't  doing.</p><p> JONES:  It isn't doing at the moment and if we talked specifically about  the tariffs in particular, it was some $50 billion, wide-ranging tariffs  that the U.S. has put on China specifically, but China's response is being  quite measured.  Are you expecting more to come?</p><p> METZL:  China is waiting to see what the United States is really doing.   The U.S. tariffs won't be applied immediately.  There's going to be about a  month of a negotiation process potentially, so China wants to wait and see.</p><p> Nobody certainly, China doesn't want to have a trade war with the United  States, but at the same time China has gotten away with a lot of bad  behaviors, blocking access for American international companies and forcing  technology transfer and stealing intellectual property rights or stealing  intellectual property and keeping America's big tech companies out of the  Chinese markets.</p><p> So, China has known that the United States at some point will need to get  tougher on China, but China also recognizes that President Trump is  weakening America so significantly through his erratic behavior by the  tumult within the administration and there are all these threats that have  been made that haven't been carried out.</p><p> So, they want to see whether this is real or not, and whether Trump has the  political ability and just the capacity within an administration that's in  complete chaos to deliver on these tough words.</p><p> JONES:  You talk about the chaos within the administration at the moment  and the shake-ups going on, I am wondering what you think China might be  making of John Bolton coming into the new role as national security  adviser, given the fact that he has been very outspoken in the past at  least about say, North Korea, a proponent of military intervention as  opposed to any kind of dialogue and presumably China might be feeling quite  sidelined by what's going on between the U.S. and North Korea right now.</p><p> METZL:  I don't know if they're feeling sidelined because China still has  the cards in many ways for North Korea because China's trade and aid and  energy resources keep North Korea alive.  So, whether this meeting happens  between North Korea, Kim Jong-un and President Trump happens or not, it's  very clear that North Korea will not be giving up its nukes any time soon.</p><p> That the Trump administration has no meaningful strategy so it's not that  there's going to be some kind of deal or could be some kind of deal that  sidelines China.</p><p> [16:25:05] But what I do think is that people all across the region are  extremely concerned that the so-called moderates, the relative moderates  and the so-called adults in the room from the Trump administration are all  being sidelined, and a series of ideologues are taking their place.</p><p> The John Bolton who I know is a very smart, very thoughtful person, but he  has been on the aggressive use of military action in Iran, for Iraq, and  North Korea, and this is going to be a very, very difficult situation  because the president already has erratic impulses.</p><p> Already his administration is under threat because of all of these scandals  and he is, in the middle of the night, when decisions are made in the old  days at least you can say there were some people who are trying to moderate  their impulses.  Now every day, we are losing what limited protection we  have.  This is a very, very dangerous situation.</p><p> JONES:  Yes, exactly.  A lot of people saying that the president has just  surrounded himself by yes men.  Even Kellyanne Conway is saying get with  the program or get out to staff members within the administration.</p><p> Jamie, that's what we got time for.  Jamie Metzl, we appreciate it.  Thanks  very much, indeed.</p><p> Still to come on the program tonight, after a terror attack in Southern  France leaves three people dead, we're asking does France have a specific  problem?  Hala Gorani is back live in Paris next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> GORANI:  We are live in Paris covering our top story this evening.  Three  people have been killed in a series of attacks in Southern France on this  Friday.  It all ended in a four-hour standoff at a supermarket before lice  shot the gunman dead.</p><p> He was named as 26-year-old Redouane Lakdim.  He was known to authorities  and an ISIS affiliated group has claimed he was, quote, \"a soldier of their  organization.  The attack meant President Emmanuel Macron returned to  France from Brussels where he was meeting other European Union leaders.  He  has called the incident a, quote, \"Islamist terrorist attack\" and says,  authorities are looking into the ISIS claim of responsibility.</p><p> All right.  We are going to connect with our Melissa Bell who is on the  scene, but joining me now to talk more about this is the former head of the  French Special Force, Frederic Gallois, and he joins me via Skype from  Marseille.</p><p> What was your immediate thought when you learned of the details of this  attack, this man who carjacked a driver and then attacked special riot  police and then drove to a supermarket and took ordinary civilians hostage. </p><p> [16:30:00] What went through your mind?</p><p> FREDERIC GALLOIS, FORMER HEAD OF FRENCH SPECIAL FORCES:  My first thought  was to understand that it would be a very difficult situation because the  terrorist claimed as a jihadist.  And you know we had a huge experience now  in France to deal with such situation.  We're one particular region as such  people, like they accept a suicidal operation, they expect to be killed in  their operation.  They don't want to stay alive.  So for the Special Forces  it's a very difficult situation because to save the people, the hostages on  face the people -- guys which are waiting for them, waiting to suit them  and who wanted to kill all the people so it's really difficult situation to  act on.</p><p> GORANI:  And there was a heroic police officer, Arnaud Beltrame who was a  lieutenant colonel who swapped places with the hostage and ended up  basically, in the end, alone with the gunman even though initially there  were 50 people in that supermarket.</p><p> GALLOIS:  It's an incredible situation because this officer decided himself  to swap with a group of hostages and he entered inside the supermarket and  he stopped to speak with the terrorist.  It's a very incredible situation,  because in the face of such people, he knew that it was like a suicidal  decision.  He went directly to the terrorist, because should have seen that  the terrorist will not keep him alive, but decided to enter and to swap  with other hostage.  He certainly saved the life of many people.  It was  the end of the operation.</p><p> GORANI:  Thank you so much, Frederic Gallois, the former head of the French  Special Forces speaking to us live this evening from Marseille.</p><p> Jim Bittermann is still here with me.  And this standoff in the supermarket  went on for many, many hours.</p><p> JIM BITTERMANN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Three hours, I  think.  And it reminded me very much -- do you remember Amedy Coulibaly?   After the Charlie Hebdo attacks in 2015 and he had shot a police officer on  the south side of Paris, a police woman who was -- who died and then held  hostages in the Kosher supermarket and the same kind of modus operandi.  He  came into the supermarket, shot at this guy and immediately shot a couple  of the people, of the customers of the store as this guy did today, I guess  to show -- make a big show of the fact that he was in charge, and he  certainly was for a little while.</p><p> GORANI:  And I'm sure authorities are going to be looking very closely at  this guy's background because he was known to authorities.  He'd been  incarcerated for a short period of time for petty crimes, but he was also  (INAUDIBLE) what we call in France (INAUDIBLE) which means that he was  suspected of having sympathies with extremist organization.</p><p> BITTERMANN:  The prosecutor Thomas tonight, no suspicion that he was  becoming radicalized or would passed to an act, as they say in France,  they're going to action.  So there was no indication that they had, but  they had him under surveillance.  And, you know, there'll be a lot of  questions, like for instance, where did he get this gun or guns?  There may  have been more than one, but in any case, where did that comes from?  And  who was helping him out amongst his family members and associates and  others, if there was anybody and they have taken one person into custody  tonight.  One of his close associates and I'm sure that's what the question  is going to be about.</p><p> GORANI:  But we don't know much otherwise, other than that about his  family, his background.  We know he was 26 years old of Moroccan origin.</p><p> BITTERMANN:  And the Moroccans said that he was born there and they had him  there in 2011, I think it was.  He had been there for a return trip and not  any notice that normally would have taken.  They just went back to their  files to see when he might have come in.  So there was nothing that they  were alerted to that indicated he was radicalized.</p><p> GORANI:  And also he -- the target is a supermarket in a small town.  It's  not a big high-value, quote, quote, \"Target.\"</p><p> BITTERMANN:  I know you know this area.  I know you know this area.   Provence is like this sleepy little town, it's 5,000 people and a sleepy  little supermarket that people are going in a Friday shopping on.  And it  must have been just an unbelievable turn of events.  And I guess it says  something about the awareness of people that the people have the wits to  get out of the supermarket that most of the hostages, most of the people in  supermarket fled before they could become hostages.</p><p> [16:35:23] GORANI:  Well, it must have been terrifying for them and three  did lose their lives today.</p><p> Jim Bittermann, thanks very much, and I understand Melissa Bell is with us  on the phone, is that correct?  From near the scene?</p><p> No.  I think we have -- she is with us, actually, on camera.  Melissa, tell  us where you are and what you're seeing around you.</p><p> MELISSA BELL, CNN PARIS CORRESPONDENT:  Well, we're inside Carcassonne, and  just in front of the apartment building where the suspect, the man has been  identified as the attacker today lived.  This has been a subject of a  number of raids by police over the course of the evening, Hala.  And even  now, they're positioned all around the apartment building.  They say we  can't get any closer because the youth that lived here have gathered  outside (INAUDIBLE) we are quite close to the police, but just behind me  this apartment building where he lived.  </p><p> It's understood also and we understood this is from Francois Molins, who  was the French prosecutor who spoke earlier that a young woman had been  taken into custody, as well, his girlfriend, the person that he shared his  life with and this is where those raids took place, just hours, of course,  after those attacks, those series of attacks, three attacks, the triple  attack, of course, that took place, began here in Carcassonne, moved on  just outside with events ending here over the course of the evening.  And  as I say, still a huge police presence around this apartment building as  authorities tries to piece together precisely the background of the  assailant.</p><p> GORANI:  Because there are other people in custody now, and I guess the big  question for authorities, Melissa, is did he act alone?  Was he radicalized  alone on his computer?  Or was there more of a cell, more of a network  behind this?</p><p> BELL:  Exactly.  Understood and it's much clearer now that he was  officially what the French called (INAUDIBLE) now, that doesn't mean that  he was a subject of active surveillance, but it does mean that he was on  the sort of police computers as someone who might be radicalized and  therefore, if he stopped, was stopped by police say for speeding on a  highway, this would immediately be alerted to them if he was stopped trying  to cross the border this, too, would be to alerted to authorities.  But of  course, it doesn't mean that there is active surveillance of these people  all of the time.  And after all, Hala, there are some many thousands of  them in France have this (INAUDIBLE) system that is the subject of this  indication to authorities this following of them even if the surveillance  is not all of the time active.</p><p> We understand that he became (INAUDIBLE) in 2014 for a while that was taken  away and then brought back.  But on the whole, he was known in terms of  what had got him into trouble for petty crime, for being a small time drug  dealer and he'd done time in jail and there was nothing to lead  authorities.  We heard it both from the interior minister here on, Hala,  and from Francois Molins, the French prosecutor tonight, there was nothing  to lead intelligence agencies, security forces to believe that he was about  to act.</p><p> GORANI:  All right.  Melissa Bell there near the scene.  Thanks very much  for joining us with the latest.  And Hannah has the rest of the day's news.   Hannah.</p><p> JONES:  Hala, thanks very much indeed.</p><p> All right.  Still to come on the program from London.  A new dynamic.   That's how the UK Prime Minister, Theresa May is describing Brexit talks  after the EU agrees to a transition deal.</p><p> And who needs soap operas with this kind of real-life drama.  Former  playboy playmate give some stunning details about her alleged affair with  Donald Trump.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> [16:40:06] JONES:  Welcome back to HALA GORANI TONIGHT with me Hannah  Vaughan Jones live in London for you.</p><p> Now, Donald Trump is usually quick to fight back when confronted with the  damaging allegations.  But so far, silence from the U.S. president after  CNN's explosive interview with the former playboy playmate.  Karen McDougal  says not only did she have sexual relations with Mr. Trump, but says they  actually had a 10-month long affair starting back in 2006 during which he  constantly professed his love for her.  McDougal explained to CNN's,  Anderson Cooper why she cried after their first sexual encounter.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> KAREN MCDOUGAL, FORMER PLAYBOY PLAYMATE:  Well, after we had been intimate,  he tried to pay me and I actually did not take that.</p><p> ANDERSON COOPER, CNN ANCHOR:  Did he actually try to hand you money?</p><p> MCDOUGAL:  He did.  He did.  And I said -- I mean, I just had this look of  -- I don't even know how to describe the look on my face -- must have been  so sad because I had never been offered money like that before, number one.   But number two, I thought, does he think that I'm in this for money or why  I'm here tonight?  Or is this a normal thing?  I didn't know.  But I looked  at him and I said that's not me.  I'm not that kind of girl, and he said,  \"Oh,\" and he said \"You're really special.\"  And I was like, \"Thank you.\"   So I left, actually got in the car.  Keith taking me home and I started  crying.  I was really sad.  It really hurt me.  But I went back.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> JONES:  Well, that is weren't enough, the attorney for another woman who  had an alleged affair with Mr. Trump is now taunting and baiting the  president.  You guessed it, on Twitter.  Athena Jones is following all  these developments, joins us now with more.  Athena, there's a mounting  course of female accusers doing the media rounds at the moment.  Donald  Trump is the man we know doesn't usually keep still and let things slide  without saying his peace on this.  How on earth is the president going to  keep quiet?</p><p> ATHENA JONES, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Well, that's a good question,  Hannah, it's so interesting to see him be so quite.  It is remarkable.   This is uncharacteristic.  When it comes to the women who have accused  Trump of sexual harassment, or sexual assault, he has been aggressive in  denying those allegations.  There was a point in time when he would deny  the allegations daily whether on Twitter or in speeches or both.  But he  has a very different approach to these women who we're talking about having  had consensual relationships with him.  He's been far less aggressive.  He  has said nothing.  He has not tweeted, he has not commented and it really  is remarkable and it is very likely that people are advising him not to  tweet or comment about this, but I've also talked to other women and not  the women who said that they've had consensual relationships with the  president, but some of the woman who have accused him of sexual misconduct  and they say that he likes being associated with these beautiful women in  the headlines.  He likes the idea that he's being linked to these women  even if it was an affair that started a few months after his own son,  Barron, his most recent son, was born.  But it is quite unique to see him  not responding here.  Hannah?</p><p> JONES:  I'm not sure how happy he'll be about Stormy Daniels continuing to  play out the allegations in front of the world's press.  Stormy Daniels, of  course, definitely a porn star, her lawyer has also been playing into to  this whole rouse, as well.  Pretty much playing Donald Trump, you can say  at his own game.  This is the latest tweet that we heard from Stephanie  Clifford's lawyer.  He says, if a picture is worth a thousand words, how  many words is this worth?  And you can see there a disk, as well.</p><p> I mean, it is pretty much trying to play the president at his own game and  a game that he's probably not going to want to be a part of.</p><p> [16:45:53] JONES:  Well, it's quite a tease, isn't it?  Quite a cliffhanger  for that \"60 MINUTES\" interview, that Stormy Daniels -- she's sitting down  with Anderson Cooper.  That interview is to air on Sunday night, and so  Michael Avenatti, Stormy Daniels' lawyer, like you say, he's sort of using  these kind of reality TV or teasing and kind of cliffhangers using Trump's  own methods to kind of poke at him.  What's unclear is, was that a CD?  Is  that a DVD?  What is on it?</p><p> A colleague of mine MJ Lee, asked Avenatti today if that could be maybe a  tape of this polygraph test that Stormy Daniels subjected herself to  several years ago.  He said that that's not what's on that disk, it has  nothing to do with that.  But we don't know what it is.  Maybe we'll find  out on Sunday and yes, he has said over and over again that they are not  going away.  They are not going to be intimidated.  And he closes his tweet  with the word basta which means enough in Spanish.  Hannah.</p><p> JONES:  Just briefly, Athena.  Have the family, the Trump family said  anything about any of these allegations given the fact at particular Karen  McDougal, they met her over the years.</p><p> JONES:  Right.  Well, no.  There's been no response from the president to  that interview.  That White House has denied that this relationship ever  happened.  But as far as the interview last night, there hasn't been any  sort of new response and the first lady also has not responded to any of  this, whether we're talking about consensual relationships or woman who  have accused her husband of sexual harassment or other kind of misconducts,  so silence coming from White House.</p><p> JONES:  Attempting to keep a dignified silence if that's possible in all of  this.  Athena Jones, we appreciate it.  Thank you.</p><p> JONES:  Thanks.</p><p> JONES:  Now to other news.  European Union is rallying behind Britain as it  points the finger of blame at Moscow for the poisoning of a former Russian  spy on British soil.  The EU is recalling its ambassador to Russia for  consultations over the nerve agent attack in Salisbury earlier on this  month.  EU leaders say they agree with Britain that it's highly likely that  Russia is responsible saying, \"There is no plausible alternative  explanation.</p><p> British Prime Minister Theresa May, meanwhile says there's a new dynamic in  the Brexit negotiations after EU leaders formally adopted a proposed  withdrawal legal agreements with the UK.  It covers issues including  citizens' rights and the so-called divorce bill that Britain will have to  pay to the block when it leaves and it paves the way for months of  intensive trade talks to begin, but there are still some sticking points to  resolve.  Most notably, of course, issue of the Northern Ireland border.</p><p> Some sparkling winemakers though are getting ready for Brexit by bottling  their bubbles in the most British of measures, the old pint.  Pints of wine  disappeared from UK shelves when they were banned by European regulations  back in the 1970s.  Anna Stewart visits one English winemaker to find out  why people are pining for their pints.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> ANNA STEWART, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Rolling hills and the sea breeze, this  valley in the south of England has the perfect conditions for a vineyard.   Sarah and mark Driver founded the Rathfinny State eight years ago.  It's  well established in still wine and now it's moving into sparkling.  Unlike  its rival, French champagne, the couple would like to serve it from a very  British-sized bottle, the pint.</p><p> SARAH DRIVER, CO-FOUNDER, RATHFINNY WINE ESTATE:  Has always been my  favorite drink and to be absolutely honest, that's only got two and a half  glasses in it.  That's got six glasses in it.  And in the evening, if I  want to drink, I feel a bit extravagant if there's just two of us at home,  to open a full bottle.  But the pint bottles are perfect with four glasses.</p><p> STEWART:  Pints and champagne were extremely popular pre-1973 when Britain  joined the European Bloc, then EU regulation came bubbling up, dictating  that sparkling wine could only be sold in 375 or 750 milliliters, any  amount of hat.  But not the pint, 568 millimeters.  Winston Churchill was  often spotted with a glass of champagne and is widely reported to have been  a big proponent with a pint-sized bottle.  Saying, an imperial pint is an  ideal size for a man like me.  It's enough for two at lunch and one at  dinner.  Some may think it's the perfect size, but until the UK actually  leaves the EU, the pint size bottles are lying in wait.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We bottled about 800 of the pint sized bottle in 2015.   We haven't bottled anymore because we can't legally sell it.  However,  we're planning to do some next year and that will be ready for the release  in 2021 when hopefully the laws will change in the UK and then we can start  selling it.</p><p> STEWART:  So whether it's to celebrate or commiserate the end of the UK's  EU membership, Brits may be able to pop and open a pint of sparkling wine.</p><p> Anna Stewart, CNN, East Suffolk, UK.</p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> [16:50:58] JONES:  A pint of wine.  Certainly something to celebrate there.   Stay with us here on CNN.  Plenty more after this break.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> JONES:  Welcome back.  Now, when you think of India, you may think of  Bollywood.  But in the capital in New Delhi, an independent music scene is  emerging.  In today's \"DESTINATION INDIA,\" we delve into the city's night  life with a local rapper who's taking the Indian hip-hop scene by storm.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> PRABH DEEP, NEW DELHI MUSICAL ARTIST:  India is not just all Bollywood,  it's more than that.  We are just moving towards different direction now.</p><p> And we really cares about quality music because we don't expect  (INAUDIBLE).  We have an industry though.  </p><p> As a performer, I used to go to the clubs and they used to tell me that you  can't perform in any racial languages, just English.  Now, it's changed.</p><p> Hip-hop is making noise in India, generally.  It's not just about making  rap songs anymore.  We are making music.  Like if you dive deep into it,  then you listen to our projects, you will find compositions, you find  arrangements like other musicians, big musicians do.  And we launched that  by ourselves.  And we're making (INAUDIBLE)</p><p> I think (INAUDIBLE) back in the day this was a really beautiful place, very  quiet.  Now, it's like a hub for so many people to party.  In the daytime,  it's more artistic.  But at night, it's total party scene.  It's a  different place altogether.</p><p> Those people are listening to some other music, they're open to new music,  basically.  There is almost to explore to why this runs on you know?</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  What I really love about the Delhi music culture is  that it's getting everything in a very small location.  If you go back a  decade or so, you would generally see traveling to different parts of world  to engage into different kinds of music.</p><p> Now what is happening is with awesome mixed, all the DJs coming in playing  here.  We get every part of the world here in this small geographical hub.</p><p> It is bringing in more musicians here.  So it's just like amazing.   Landscape is going wider day by day.</p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> JONES:  That the next few weeks.  CNN is telling the stories of young  scientists, entrepreneurs and inventors in a new special series.  Their  inspiring innovations will surely make a difference in improving our  environments, health and communities.  Dr. Sanjay Gupta introduces us to  one of tomorrow's heroes.  He's using organic waste to make renewable  energy.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> [16:55:13] SANJAY GUPTA, CNN SENIOR MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT:  This planet  earth is the only one we've got.  Yet every day, we pump massive amounts of  pollution into the atmosphere.  Tomorrow's hero, Leroy Mwasaru is working  to convert waste into renewable fuel, to help save our trees and our  planet.</p><p> LEROY MWASARU, INNOVATOR:  In high school, I used to walk around with a  notebook.  I used to note down the different problems that I saw each and  every day.  But then this problem came up and there was no way I was going  to ignore it.  I chose to address this one because it affected many people.</p><p> My name is Leroy Mwasaru.  I'm 20 years old.  And I'm from Kenya. My  invention is Greenpact.  Greenpact is a conscious social enterprise that's  offering green renewable solutions which is biogas energy. Greenpact begun  as a high school project where we utilized human waste and organic waste  and we used that to generate biogas and fertilizer to cook light meals in  the kitchen for the school.</p><p> The human waste bioreactor works using the principle of anaerobic  respiration.  A human waste doesn't have a significant level of energy, so  we supplement this with organic waste.  You put something in a container  and restrict air from it.  You get energy, and that energy is the CH4,  which is methane, and that methane is what is useful as biogas.  So that  CH4 once it goes through a filtering process, you remove the hydrogen  sulfide, we're able to get pure biogas energy.</p><p> Using these biogas systems, we'll actually find that they actually have no  waste because what comes in as a feed will eventually come out as biogas  and the sludge which comes out of the system is very clean organic  fertilizer.  We envision this solution to Kenyans who are not able to  purchase nonrenewable sources of energy.</p><p> The more we continue harming the environment with non-renewable sources of  energy, the more we continue depleting the environment.  My vision for this  invention is that it's something that will be replicated and be able to  grow, not only in size but also in impact.</p><p> There's still a lot that has to be done especially on the African continent  in terms of utilizing the number of resources that we have at hand.

Citizenship and Immigration has taken aim at applications for jobs with entry-level wages, and also at applications for jobs it says dont match applicants degree types, Compete America said.</p><p>The group also pushed back against what it said were denials by Citizenship and Immigration based on the idea that H-1Bs should be used only for jobs requiring a bachelors degree or higher. Such a degree should not always be necessary for granting an H-1B, the group said.</p><p>Compete America wants USCIS and the Department of Homeland Security to\u00a0review current H-1B adjudications and practices, and provide any needed clarification internally or with the regulated community.</p><p>Citizenship and Immigration said it was committed to helping ensure U.S. immigration laws safeguard an immigration system designed to protect U.S. workers wages and working conditions.</p><p>The administration has been relentlessly pursuing merit-based policy and regulatory immigration reforms, including a thorough review of employment-based visa programs so they benefit the American people to the greatest extent possible in fulfillment of the President's Buy American, Hire American Executive Order, agency\u00a0spokesman Michael Bars said in a statement, adding that the agency will continue adjudicating all petitions, applications and requests fairly, efficiently, and effectively on a case-by-case basis to determine if they meet all standards required under applicable law, policies, and regulations.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.eastbaytimes.com/2018/11/07/indian-outsourcer-tata-sued-in-oakland-over-alleged-bias-against-non-south-asians/\">Indian outsourcer Tata sued in Oakland over alleged bias against non-South Asians     </url></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.eastbaytimes.com/2018/11/03/h-1b-visa-fraud-feds-indict-sunnyvale-man-for-bringing-in-600-workers-illegally/\">        H-1B visa fraud: Feds indict Sunnyvale man for bringing in 600 workers illegally     </url></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.eastbaytimes.com/2018/10/31/h-1b-fraud-claim-at-dolby-leads-to-complaint-to-state-department-homeland-security-lawsuit/\">        H-1B fraud claim at Dolby leads to complaint to State Department, Homeland Security: lawsuit     </url></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.eastbaytimes.com/2018/10/24/h-1b-immigrants-founded-more-than-half-of-u-s-tech-unicorns-study-says/\">        H-1B: Immigrants founded more than half of U.S. tech unicorns, study says     </url></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.eastbaytimes.com/2018/10/24/h-1b-lottery-change-would-help-google-facebook-apple-and-hurt-outsourcers/\">        H-1B lottery change would help Google, Facebook, Apple and hurt outsourcers     </url></p><p>The reported effects of the Trump administrations clampdown on the H-1B come as the administration moves forward with its stated plans to change the way the H-1B lottery is run in order to favor workers with higher education levels, and to strip work authorization from spouses of H-1B holders on track for green cards.</p><p>Its unclear when the lottery change may occur, but the federal government has said it will announce the spouses work ban this month. A comment period on the proposed employment prohibition is expected to follow the announcement before it would go into effect, but federal rules can be imposed without a comment period.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNTRCT-5796214</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNTRCT2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TNC-0YG1-JCX4-62P7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">313958</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-11-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"664\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 MediaNews Group, Inc. and ANG Newspapers All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The East Bay Times (California)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"11\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>November 5, 2018 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0001ZX8</classCode><className>ACCENTURE PLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0005UOA</classCode><className>DELOITTE LLP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0002KLJ</classCode><className>HP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>US DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

You\u2019ve heard it from Big Business lackeys in both political parties. And you\u2019ve heard it from journalists, pundits and think-tankers ad nauseam:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The H-1B foreign guest worker program, they claim, requires American employers to first show that they searched for and tried to recruit American workers before tapping an ever-growing, government-rigged pipeline of cheap foreign workers.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> The foot soldiers of the open-borders brigade are lying, deluded, ignorant or bought-off.</p><p> On Tuesday, the Senate Judiciary Committee brought top independent academics and informed whistleblowers to Washington to expose the truth. Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, hosted Howard University associate professor of public policy Ron Hira, Rutgers University professor Hal Salzman, Infosys whistleblower Jay Palmer and former computer programmer-turned-lawyer John Miano, who brought much-needed reality checks on the systemic betrayal of American workers to the Beltway table.</p><p> Miano\u2019s testimony was particularly important because he explained how the little known \u201cOPT\u201d (Optical Training Program) for foreign students is being used to circumvent H-1B and supply large corporations with cheap foreign labor. President Barack Obama has expanded this regulatory program by unfettered administrative fiat. As Miano noted: \u201cOPT has no labor protections of any kind. Aliens on OPT do not even have to be paid at all. While DHS requires aliens to work in an area related to their major area of study, DHS has no ability to ensure that this happens. Under OPT, over 125,000 foreign workers a year are simply turned loose in America with no supervision or restrictions.\u201d</p><p> Also on hand at the hearing: a few Big Tech shills toeing the Zuckerberg/Gates/Chamber of Commerce line that there\u2019s a catastrophic American tech worker shortage, even as thousands upon thousands of American workers are being laid off in favor of underpaid, easily exploited H-1Bs. (Just use H-1B-promoter Google\u2019s search engine and type in \u201cSouthern California Edison\u201d and \u201clayoffs.\u201d According to multiple reports, American employees not only lost their jobs, but had to train their H-1B replacements to get their severance.)</p><p> Grassley put it plainly: \u201cMost people believe that employers are supposed to recruit Americans before they petition for an H-1B worker. Yet, under the law, most employers are not required to prove to the Department of Labor that they tried to find an American to fill the job first.</p><p> \u201cAnd, if there is an equally or even better qualified U.S. worker available, the company does not have to offer him or her the job. Over the years, the program has become a government-assisted way for employers to bring in cheaper foreign labor, and now it appears these foreign workers take over \u2014 rather than complement \u2014 the U.S. workforce,\u201d he said.</p><p> Hira affirmed: \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely not true\u201d that employers seeking H-1Bs must put American workers first, either by \u201claw or regulations.\u201d</p><p> Conservative journalist W. James Antle gets to the heart of the matter: \u201cIf the government has discretion in how it exercises its legitimate authority over who comes and who goes, a prerequisite for national sovereignty, then shouldn\u2019t it exercise such discretion in a way that minimizes the impoverishment of Americans?\u201d</p><p> For a brief window, Grassley and, yes, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., a small group of H-1B-employing banks and other financial institutions that accepted federal bailout money from the Troubled Asset Relief Program did have to demonstrate that they had taken \u201cgood-faith steps to recruit U.S. workers\u201d and offer them wages \u201cat least as high\u201d as those offered to H-1B workers. In addition, the targeted employers had to show that they \u201cmust not have laid off, and will not lay off, any U.S. worker in a job essentially equivalent to the H-1B position in the area of intended employment of the H-1B worker\u201d within a narrow time frame.</p><p> But this American worker-first provision, vociferously opposed by Big Business and Big Government, expired in 2011. The refusal of the majority of politicians and the White House to embrace these protections for all U.S. workers tells you everything you need to know about H-1B\u2019s big, fat lies.</p><p> Michelle Malkin (<email normalizedValue=\"mailto:malkinblog@gmail.com\">malkinblog@gmail.com</email>) is the author of  \u201cCulture of Corruption: Obama and his Team of Tax Cheats, Crooks and Cronies.\u201d Her columns are distributed by Creators Syndicate.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKNV-3039749</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F1E1147E54C7789 NWBKNV2015</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5FMV-RFP1-F0NV-F4F7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">401961</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-02-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"736\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2015 Greenspun Media Group (Niche Media Holdings, LLC)<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

Anna Eshoo, D-Palo Alto, and Zoe Lofgren, D-San Jose, would prevent the administration from\u00a0revoking an Obama-era rule giving work authorization to certain spouses of H-1B visa holders.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Since 2015, more than 100,000 immigrant spouses have been <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mercurynews.com/2018/09/14/h-1b-spouses-bay-area-tech-workers-fear-theyll-have-to-leave/\">authorized to work</url> in any field as long as their husbands or wives have an H-1B visa for skilled workers and are on track to get permanent residency. That lets them earn a living and develop their careers while their families wait in the long backlog for green cards.\u00a0Most H-1B workers and their spouses are immigrants from India, and the wait for a green card for Indian citizens can stretch on for decades.</p><p>But the Department of Homeland Security has said since President Trump took office that it was considering revoking the spouses work authorization. Last month, the department <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mercurynews.com/2018/10/18/h-1b-spouses-work-ban-rule-coming-next-month-feds-say/\">put out a notice</url> that a new rule will be released soon preventing immigrants on H-4 visas for dependent spouses from working.</p><p>Its an especially big worry for immigrant families who couldnt afford to live in the Bay Area on only a single income. Most of the spouses who benefit from the rule are women, and many are themselves high-skilled tech workers.</p><p>Eshoo called the bill a matter of both economic fairness\u00a0and family unity.</p><p>\"Eliminating this benefit would create a painful choice for\u00a0many immigrants to either split up their families or return to their home countries and use their\u00a0talents to compete against American businesses,\" she said in a statement.</p><p>Thats the dilemma faced by Silicon Valley residents like\u00a0Priya Yadav, a product manager at Comcast and an immigrant from India whose husband is here on an H-1B visa. It's like living in limbo, Yadav said in an interview Friday. Every day I'm worried that I could wake up the next morning and not be able to go to work.\"</p><p>The administration is expected to revoke the rule by the end of the year, and its unlikely the bill could pass by then in the Republican-controlled Congress. But it might have a better chance once the new Democratic-majority House takes office in January  potentially as part of a larger immigration reform package.</p><p>Michael Bars, a spokesman for\u00a0U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, said the agency has been relentlessly pursuing merit-based policy and regulatory immigration reforms, including a thorough review of employment-based visa programs so they benefit the American people to the greatest extent possible.</p><p>USCIS will continue adjudicating all petitions, applications and requests fairly, efficiently, and effectively on a case-by-case basis to determine if they meet all standards required under applicable law, policies, and regulations,\" Bars added.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.eastbaytimes.com/2018/11/23/h-1b-whistleblower-adds-evidence-in-visa-scam-suit-against-apple-outsourcer/\">        H-1B: Whistleblower adds evidence in alleged Apple 'visa-scam' lawsuit     </url></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.eastbaytimes.com/2018/11/13/h-1b-alternative-opt-for-foreign-students-and-grads-hits-record-as-enrollment-falls/\">        H-1B alternative OPT for foreign students and grads hits record, as enrollment falls     </url></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.eastbaytimes.com/2018/11/07/indian-outsourcer-tata-sued-in-oakland-over-alleged-bias-against-non-south-asians/\">        Indian outsourcer Tata sued in Oakland over alleged bias against non-South Asians     </url></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.eastbaytimes.com/2018/11/05/h-1b-big-tech-pushes-back-against-dramatic-increase-in-visa-denials/\">        H-1B: Big Tech pushes back against 'dramatic increase' in visa denials     </url></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.eastbaytimes.com/2018/11/03/h-1b-visa-fraud-feds-indict-sunnyvale-man-for-bringing-in-600-workers-illegally/\">        H-1B visa fraud: Feds indict Sunnyvale man for bringing in 600 workers illegally     </url></p><p>Lofgren and Eshoo have both called for reforms to the H-1B program, which critics say allows outsourcing companies to bring in lower-paid immigrant workers to fill jobs held by American citizens.

Following the review, Homeland Security will publish a draft rule in the federal register, triggering a public comment period.</p><p>Public comment periods for new federal rules typically last 30 to 60 days, but can extend to 180 days or more. Under <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.federalregister.gov/uploads/2011/01/the_rulemaking_process.pdf\">certain circumstances</url>, rules can be finalized without a comment period, but Citizenship\u00a0and Immigration director L.

The text is not yet available so details of how the administration is redefining specialty occupations are not clear. The agency's abstract says only that it will revise the definition \"to increase focus on obtaining the best and the brightest foreign nationals via the H-1B program, and revise the definition of employment and employer-employee relationship to better protect U.S. workers and wages.\"</p><p>The new rule would also add requirements designed to make sure employers pay \"appropriate wages\" to H-1B workers, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/eAgendaViewRule?pubId=202004&amp;RIN=1615-AC13\">according to</url> the abstract.</p><p>High-profile immigration law firm Fragomen said in a blog post Friday that the White House budget office has up to 90 days to review the proposed regulation, \"but could take less time given the rule's importance to the Trump administration.\" The rule would then be published in the Federal Register, \"and is expected to take effect immediately or shortly after publication,\" <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fragomen.com/insights/alerts/dhs-rule-toughen-h-1b-program-criteria-now-under-federal-review-fast-track\">Fragomen said</url>. \"The regulation is expected to be challenged in court.\"</p><p>Another prominent immigration law firm, Berry Appleman &amp; Leiden, said Friday in an emailed advisory that the government had indicated earlier there would be a public comment period before the rule was finalized, as is typical with federal rule-making. \"The government is now expected to argue that compliance with the comment period obligations would be 'impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest,'\" the firm said.</p><p>\"The government may also argue that good cause exists to make the regulation effective upon publication and without the standard 30-day delayed effective date.\" Berry Appleman &amp; Leiden also predicted that the rule, if finalized, would end up in court.</p><p>The H-1B, used heavily by the Silicon Valley technology industry, whose major firms push for an increase to the annual 85,000 cap on new visas, has become a target for the Trump administration, which has dramatically increased denials for outsourcing, consulting and staffing companies. Critics allege that those companies, along with big tech firms directly employing H-1B workers and using contracted H-1B labor, use the visa to drive down wages, supplant U.S. workers and facilitate outsourcing. Current regulations allow companies to pay H-1B workers less than the prevailing wage. The tech giants argue that the visa is an essential tool for securing the world's top talent. The staffing, consulting and outsourcing companies say they're providing needed skilled foreign labor.</p><p>Andrew Greenfield, a partner at Fragomen, said Friday in an emailed advisory that he expects the H-1B rule change to focus on placement of foreign workers at third-party sites, an employment model dominated by the staffing, consulting and outsourcing companies that have been a target for the Trump administration.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.eastbaytimes.com/2020/09/04/students-at-moragas-campolindo-high-make-online-music-video/\"> Students at Moraga's Campolindo High make online music video </url> \"We also expect it to address H-1B wages and a new method of allocation of H-1B cap numbers to give priority to the highest-paid beneficiaries,\" Greenfield said.</p><p>In various versions of the proposed rule's abstract, posted twice a year, Homeland Security has said the changes are expected to reduce H-1B fraud and abuse, ensure the visa is only given out for appropriately specialized jobs, and that it \"supplements the U.S. workforce and strengthens U.S. worker protections.\" The new rule would also enhance effective management and monitoring of the program, the agency has said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNTRCT-7356839</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNTRCT2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60S4-1NW1-F0C5-X08K-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">313958</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"668\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 MediaNews Group, Inc. and ANG Newspapers All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The East Bay Times (California)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 4, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC000AFEH</classCode><className>BERRY APPLEMAN &amp;

Critics allege that those companies, along with big tech firms employing contracted H-1B labor, use the visa to drive down wages, supplant U.S. workers and facilitate outsourcing.</p><p> Current regulations allow companies to pay H-1B workers less than the prevailing wage. The tech giants argue that the visa is an essential tool for securing the world\u2019s top talent. The staffing, consulting and outsourcing companies say they\u2019re providing needed skilled foreign labor.</p><p> Andrew Greenfield, a partner at Fragomen, said Friday in an emailed advisory that he expects the H-1B rule change to focus on placement of foreign workers at third-party sites, an employment model dominated by the staffing, consulting and outsourcing companies that have been a target for the Trump administration.</p><p> \u201cWe also expect it to address H-1B wages and a new method of allocation of H-1B cap numbers to give priority to the highest-paid beneficiaries,\u201d Greenfield said.</p><p> In various versions of the proposed rule\u2019s abstract, posted twice a year, Homeland Security has said the changes are expected to reduce H-1B fraud and abuse, ensure the visa is only given out for appropriately specialized jobs, and that it \u201csupplements the U.S. workforce and strengthens U.S. worker protections.\u201d The new rule would also enhance effective management and monitoring of the program, the agency has said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SWTREC-6325217</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SWTREC2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60SV-KW11-DXVP-V4K6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">388070</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"653\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Stephens Media Group, LLC<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

Silicon Valley companies are the heaviest users of the H-1B visa, bringing in workers largely from India.</p><p>The visas are currently decided through a lottery system and capped at 65,000 per year, with an added 20,000 for those with master's degrees or higher.</p><p>The number of petitions filed in fiscal 2016 reached almost 400,000. About 75 percent of those were from India and almost 70 percent were for 25- to 34-year olds.</p><p>Americans are unable to vie for the positions offered through H-1B visas-a point some lawmakers are trying to resolve through legislation.</p><p>The director of USCIS, Francis Cissna, said he can \"totally understand\" how an employer can be frustrated by identifying a potential employee on a university campus, but being unable to get an H-1B visa for them because the program is oversubscribed.</p><p>\"The cap is not sufficiently high to guarantee that person getting a work visa. I can completely understand how frustrating that would be to the employer,\" Cissna said during a discussion with the Center for Immigration Studies in Washington on Aug. 15.</p><p>He said it's up to Congress to address that.</p><p>\"I can't change the criteria for getting an H-1B, I can't change the cap. ... It is what it is,\" Cissna said.</p><p>But, he warned, any reforms need to be mindful of the possible adverse effects on American workers.</p><p>\"A simple fix, for example, [could be] just banning the ability of employers to fire American workers and replace them with H-1B's,\" he said. \"We all know it's happened. I am talking about ... intentional replacement of American workers with foreign workers. Things like that need to be taken into account.\"</p><p>Better Vetting</p><p>Last year, in his Buy American, Hire American initiative, President Donald Trump called on federal departments to propose reforms to curb H-1B abuses and ensure visas are awarded to the most skilled or highest-paid applicants.</p><p>\"Right now, H-1B visas are awarded in a totally random lottery, and that's wrong,\" Trump said on April 18, 2017, in Wisconsin as he unveiled the initiative. \"Instead, they should be given to the most skilled and highestpaid applicants, and they should never, ever be used to replace Americans.\"</p><p>Cissna said, so far, only \"relatively small\" changes have been imposed on the H-1B process and other work visas.</p><p>\"For example, asking adjudicators to look more carefully at whether the wages that are being proffered to the worker correspond to the skill level of the job,\" he said.</p><p>\"That is a completely rational thing to do, and if it requires more evidence to substantiate the connection between the proffered wage and the skill level, so be it.\"</p><p>The agency is also working on rescinding the regulation issued by the Obama administration in 2015 that allows spouses of H-1B visas to also get work authorization.</p><p>Cissna said Congress only identified two categories of people who should receive spousal work permits when it set up the H-4 category- spouses of intra-company transferees and to the spouses of E investor visa and treaty investor visa workers.</p><p>\"They said that those two categories of people. ... They didn't talk about H-1B's,\" he said.</p><p>\"The idea that we are intentionally, mischievously, impishly, malevolently trying to build an invisible wall on purpose because we don't want foreign workers to come, is false.\"</p><p>Big Tech Pushes Back</p><p>About a week after Cissna's interview, CEOs of the Business Roundtable penned a letter to Kirstjen Nielsen, secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, under which USCIS operates.</p><p>The letter expressed the CEOs' \"serious concern about changes in immigration policy that are causing considerable anxiety for many thousands of our employees, while threatening to disrupt company operations.\"</p><p>It was signed by 59 of America's most prominent CEOs, from companies such as Apple, Morgan Stanley, American Airlines, Verizon, and JPMorgan Chase. The Business Roundtable CEOs lead companies with more than 16 million employees and more than $7 trillion in annual revenues, according to its website.</p><p>The CEOs complained about \"inconsistent immigration decisions,\" uncertainty about information required for visa renewals, and the upcoming change that would revoke the H-4 spouse eligibility to work.</p><p>The CEOs also complained about USCIS's recent announcement that a visa holder will be automatically placed in removal proceedings if his or her application to change or extend status is denied and he or she doesn't have another underlying lawful status.</p><p>\"Together, the USCIS actions significantly increase the likelihood that a long-term employee- who has followed the rules and who has been authorized by the U.S. government multiple times to work in the United States-will lose his or her status,\" the letter states.</p><p>Cissna said fraud and abuse is an \"eternal problem\" with administering the immigration system, but the agency is set up to simply follow the laws Congress sets. He said the increase in interviews required for work permits is already helping reduce fraudulent claims.</p><p>Using the example of someone first entering the United States on a tourist visa, Cissna outlined a possible scenario that indicates how flawed the current system can be.</p><p>\"It's kind of remarkable that you could have somebody come to the country ... as a tourist. Then they change to a student visa. Then they study for four years. Then they get a master's degree. So, there's six years. Then they get an H-1B, that's another three years. Then they get an extension. There's another three,\" he said.</p><p>The person could then also receive an Optional Practical Training work permit, allowing for up to three additional years of work.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ENW-2101268720</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">1576348ENW</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5T8W-DRR1-JC85-J0KK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11341</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-09-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"994\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Epoch Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Epoch Times</publicationName><issueNumber>No. 261</issueNumber><aggregationName>Ethnic NewsWatch</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"08\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>August 28, 2018</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Others</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Aggregate News Sources</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>News</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><className>US CITIZENSHIP &amp;

If you're going to decry 'fake news,' then you best not be sharing it. If you're going to talk about the importance of digital literacy or information literacy or media literacy or what have you, then you best practice it. Did you share this Raw Story story[1] - 'Education officials expect 'ineffective' <person><nameText>Betsy DeVos </nameText></person>to step down as her agenda collapses: report' - or this Salon story[2] - 'Expert: Expect DeVos to resign from Trump administration'? Why?</p><p> Did you read the Politico profile[3] of <person><nameText>Betsy DeVos </nameText></person>that these (and many other[4]) pieces of clickbait were based on? Did you see evidence in that well-reported story that a resignation was imminent? Or did you just want a story to confirm your gut feelings that she should hit the road? Because, see, that's part of the whole problem. It's not just that these stories get written. It's that folks share them so quickly and uncritically. Anyway, as Matt Barnum writes[5], 'No, there's no reason to think DeVos is planning to resign, contrary to viral news stories.'The American Oversight notes[6] that 'DeVos Calendars Show Frequent Days Off.'

Two educators, at least, had questions for Edsurge.One tech industry CEO's vision of revolutionizing schools withers, and another is there to take its place. This week, it's WeWork, which recently acquired the troubled[127] coding bootcamp Flatiron School. Bloomberg reports[128] that 'WeWork Is Launching a Grade School for Budding Entrepreneurs.' 'In my book, there's no reason why children in elementary schools can't be launching their own businesses,' [says founder] Rebekah Neumann. Except maybe child labor laws. IP concerns. Ethics. A commercial-free childhood. Never one to shy away from promoting the techno-dystopia, Fast Company weighs in[129]: 'WeWork Founder Hopes Her New School Will Help 5-Year-Olds Pursue Their Life's Purpose.' (This seems closely related to Ivanka Trump's notion[130] that 5 year olds need to learn to code so they can get a job. Good thing no one in the current administration actually advocates child labor.

The device is called 'Bouncy Bands.' It's been featured on Dr. Oz so it must work.'Tech is making ed more inclusive, accessible to students with special needs,' says Education Dive[138]. I'm not quire sure this is true, as I'm working on my year-in-review series[139] and see a lot of stories about how tech exacerbates inequalities and excludes those with disabilities.As I'm working on that series, I can see how certain 'trends' in ed-tech are being carefully cultivated by ed-tech companies and the ed-tech press. One of those 'trends' is surely 'character development' (a.k.a. 'grit' a.k.a. 'mindsets' a.k.a. 'social and emotional learning.') The CEO of Schoolrunner writes in Education Week's Market Brief[140], for example, that 'Science of Character Development Initiative to Help Students Achieve Goals.'

All this feeds the review I write each December on the stories we are told[1] about the future of education. (National) Education Politics Compare and contrast the Department of Education's government shutdown plans[2] - Secretary John King's versus Secretary Betsy DeVos's. Among the changes: removing en dashes and replacing them with em dashes and deleting Oxford commas. Monstrous, really.Via Chalkbeat[3]: 'DeVos criticizes Bush-Obama policies, saying it's time to overhaul conventional schooling.' </p><p>Here are the 'Prepared Remarks by U.S. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos to the American Enterprise Institute,' from the Press Office[4]. Here's Edsurge's take on the AEI event[5].'The U.S. Department of Education is looking for nonprofit organizations to help support its #GoOpen campaign to nurture state and district take-up of 'open' educational resources,' says EdWeek's Market Brief[6].From the Department of Education Press Office[7]: 'Secretary DeVos Announces Approval of 11 ESSA Plans.'Via The Huffington Post[8]: 'Ministers Turned Down 5 'Appointable' People To Give Toby Young A Job.' I believe this is what one calls 'meritocracy,' - is that right, Toby's dad[9]?From Liberia, 'Government to crackdown on unlicensed schools,' New Vision reports[10]. This includes Bridge International academies, which the country has said cannot operate in the country.Via Politico[11]: 'How China Infiltrated U.S. Classrooms.' (State and Local) Education Politics Via the Charleston Gazette-Mail[12]: 'Free community college bill would require staying in WV 2 years.' WV is West Virginia, of course.Via WLRN[13]: 'National Charter School Chain Favored by House Speaker Heads For Miami, Amid Performance Concerns.' The chain: KIPP. The concerns: the only other KIPP school in Florida, in Jacksonville, is one of the lowest performing schools in the state. The House Speaker, Richard Corcoran, wants to run for governor and is a fan of charter chains, apparently.Via NPR[14]: 'Students Across D.C. Graduated Despite Chronic Absences, An Investigation Finds.'From the Governor of Iowa's press office: 'Gov. Reynolds, Lt. Gov. Gregg announce new research on state's regulatory framework.' I'm including this here because the research comes from the Koch-funded Mercatus Center at George Mason University, and I want to keep an eye on how 'dark money' includes research and policy. Immigration and Education Via Chalkbeat[15]: 'As Washington decides their fate, 'Dreamers' preparing for college are stuck in limbo.'There's DACA-related PR in the venture philanthropy section below. Education in the Courts Via EdWeek's Market Brief[16]: 'State Attorneys General Sue to Block FCC's Repeal of Net Neutrality.'Via the Hartford Courant[17]: 'The state Supreme Court has overturned a Superior Court judge's controversial ruling that would have upended the state's educational-funding scheme and mandated a vast overhaul of teacher evaluations, educational standards and special-education services.' That's the Connecticut state Supreme Court.Via The New York Times[18]: 'Horror for 13 California Siblings Hidden by Veneer of a Private Home School.' An op-ed in The LA Times[19]: 'The Turpin child abuse story fits a widespread and disturbing homeschooling pattern.'Via Techcrunch[20]: 'The nanny of former Uber engineer Anthony Levandowski has filed an excruciatingly detailed lawsuit.' (Remember, this guy the founder of a church of AI[21]. But I'm including it here because I still hear people talking about 'Uber for Education,' goddammit.) 'Free College' There's some 'free college' news in the state education political section above. The Business of Financial Aid There's an article in the venture philanthropy section below about how private student loans are being pitched as 'impact investing.' The 'New' For-Profit Higher Ed Via The New York Times[22]: 'Black Colleges Swept Up in For-Profit Crackdown Find Relief From DeVos.' Online Education (and the Once and Future 'MOOC') 'Online and the Color Line' - Chris Newfield on students of color and online education in California[23].'Indiana Virtual School has the lowest graduation rate of any public school in the state,' says Chalkbeat[24].Doane University has joined[25] edX.There's more MOOC news in the job training section below. And more online education news in the 'Betteridge's Law of Headlines' section and in the research and data section below. Meanwhile on Campus Sara Goldrick-Rab on food insecurity on college campuses[26]: 'It's Hard to Study if You're Hungry.'Edsurge explains[27] 'How a Master's Program From the '80s Quietly Keeps Up With Coding Bootcamps.' The program, an MA in Interdisciplinary Computer Science, is at Mills College. Apparently it's 'from the 80s' because it was founded in the 1980s. So you could, I suppose write a headline about Harvard teaching computer science that goes 'How a College from the 17th Century Quietly Keeps up with Coding Bootcamps.' But that would be silly, wouldn't it. (Of course, Harvard doesn't keep quiet about anything, does it.)Via Inside Higher Ed[28]: 'Richard Spencer, the inflammatory white supremacist who has unsettled college campuses with his appearances, will speak at Michigan State University in March.''Budgets Suffer After A Drop In International Student Enrollment,' says NPR[29]. College budgets, that is.Via Inside Higher Ed[30]: 'UT Austin says it will not accept funding from a foundation after concerns were raised about its connections to the Chinese Communist Party.'Via The Chronicle of Higher Education[31]: 'Johns Hopkins Just Got the Largest Donation Ever Given to a Philosophy Department.''How Colleges Foretold the #MeToo Movement,' according to The Atlantic[32].More on University College London and its eugenics conferences via DC's Improbable Science[33]. Accreditations and Certifications and Competencies Via the BBC[34]: ''Staggering' trade in fake degrees revealed.' 'Staggering' equals 3000. Testing 'PISA for personality testing - the OECD and the psychometric science of social-emotional skills' by Ben Williamson[35].'Personality Tests Are Failing American Workers,' says Cathy O'Neil in a Bloomberg op-ed[36].A new project from the Learning Policy Institute and EducationCounsel[37]: 'Reimagining College Access: Performance Assessments From K-12 Through Higher Education.'More news about a data breach at a testing company in the infosec section below. Go, School Sports Team! This is digusting on many levels. (And compare all this to what happened at Penn State with the Sandusky abuse case.) Via the Detroit News: 'What MSU knew: 14 were warned of Nassar abuse.' Dr. Larry Nassar is the ex-USA Gymnastics team physician who has been accused of sexually assaulting over 140 women[38]. He was a faculty member at Michigan State. The Business of Job Training Via Techcrunch[39]: 'Google and Coursera launch program to train more IT support specialists.' This Week in Betteridge's Law of Headlines 'Will Online Ever Conquer Higher Ed?' asks Edsurge[40].'Relationships Are Central to the Student Experience. Can Colleges Engineer Them?' asks The Chronicle of Higher Education[41].(Reminder: according to Betteridge's Law of Headlines[42], 'Any headline that ends in a question mark can be answered by the word no.') Upgrades and Downgrades Edsurge covers Clever's new product 'Clever Goals,'[43] which takes the data that the company gleans about student usage of technology and sells it back to schools. Very clever indeed.'Why big tech thinks voice control will conquer the world' by Navneet Alang[44].'Irish startup SoapBox Labs is building speech recognition tech for kids,' says Techcrunch[45].'Who Is Pulling The Muppet Strings?' asks Alison McDowell[46].Via The Outline[47]: 'Pyramid schemes target Snapchat teens.'More on teen social media usage, this time from Buzzfeed[48]: ''Tweetdecking' Is Taking Over Twitter. Here's Everything You Need To Know.'The Atlantic on[49] what it's like being a parent of a social media star.'Google is jeopardizing African-American literature sites,' says The Outline[50].From the press release[51]: 'Knewton Launches Alta, Fully Integrated Adaptive Learning Courseware for Higher Education, Putting Achievement in Reach for Everyone.' There is no mention here about mind-reading robo tutors in the sky[52], but there are some questionable claims about what the software can do. Via Techcrunch[53]: 'Education quiz app Kahoot says it's now used by 50% of all US K-12 students, 70M users overall.'

But thankfully, hacker\u00a0George 'Geohot' Hotz is ready to supply some, as evidenced in his talk about self-driving cars at Techcrunch Disrupt last week. As CEO of Comma.ai, Hotz is probably the last person you'd expect to enter the self-driving car market in competition with rivals like <person><nameText>Elon Musk's </nameText></person>Tesla (with whom he has a running war of words), Google, Cruise, and others. If anything, he's going to make that battle of giants\u00a0more amusing. </p><p>But he has scored a measure of credibility, as his startup is being backed by <person><nameText>Marc Andreessen's </nameText></person>venture capital firm, Andreessen Horowitz. And he's now preparing to ship the Comma One self-driving car kit, which works with a couple of radar-equipped cars on the market today. 'I don't belong in Silicon Valley, but I watched the television show, and it made starting a startup look like fun,' he said in his talk. 'So here I am today and of course we have a self-driving car.' [embedded content] Hotz became famous at the age of 17 when he was the first person to hack the iPhone so that it could be unlocked from AT...nd used with other carriers. When he was 20, he hacked the security system of the Sony PlayStation 3 video game console. For that accomplishment, Sony greeted him with a lawsuit. Hotz came back into the news last December\u00a0[1]as he unveiled a self-driving car built with off-the-shelf parts and his own custom software. A\u00a0Bloomberg writer, Ashlee Vance, confirmed that the car drove itself on the I-280 freeway in the Bay Area. He was originally going to do some work under contract with Musk at Tesla, but Hotz and Musk got into a dispute over terms. Hotz has since calmed down with respect to Tesla, but he is hammering at former Tesla supplier Mobileye. 'I would have been an absolute idiot to say yes,' Hotz said. 'I hold no ill will toward <person><nameText>Elon Musk, </nameText></person>and I regret any trouble I caused him in his relationship with Mobileye, which like I said is a failing company.' Tesla wasn't happy with Hotz's interview with Bloomberg, and it\u00a0issued a statement[2] to correct some of the impressions from the interview. But this sort of controversy is\u00a0par for the course for Geohot[3]. (We've asked Tesla for additional comment, and will update the story if we receive it). Mobileye declined comment. When he was 17, Hotz was the first person to hack the iPhone so that it could be unlocked from AT...nd used with other carriers.\u00a0And when he was 20, he hacked the security system of the Sony PlayStation 3 video game console. For his accomplishment, Sony greeted him with a lawsuit. He settled that, but not before he posted this hilarious rap video about the lawsuit. [embedded content] But Hotz is quite serious about solving the machine learning problem in taking sensor data from the environment and turning it into actions that a self-driving car can take to drive safely. He made a phone app, Chffr, in the Google Play store that works with a dashboard camera and is like a 'Fitbit for your car,' Hotz said. You record your drives and it feeds the information back to Comma.ai, and it thereby helps train the self-driving car. Comma.ai has received over 306,000 miles of data\u00a0and 7,908 hours of footage from 739 Chffr users. Comma.ai also has a Dash app for the iOS app store. 'That is being used to make our self-driving car better,' Hotz said. Hotz's company received\u00a0$3.1 million from Andreessen Horowitz, and it has used some of that money to create the Comma One, which is a small piece of hardware that replaces your rear-view mirror. Above: George 'Geohot' Hotz is head of Comma.ai. Image Credit: Dean Takahashi'You get in the car, press\u00a0the button, and it will drive you all the way from Mountain View to San Francisco,' Hotz said. 'By the end of the year you will be able to buy one of these' for $999. It's going to be a limited release, with a target on beta testing for Acura or Honda cars with lane-keeping assist. Those cars have front-facing radars. The Comma One has a front-facing camera as well. Drivers who use the Comma app can earn 'comma points' for each minute they drive with the app activated. Those who have the most comma points will reap benefits, such as participating in the beta for the Comma One. When Hotz issued his challenge to Tesla to compete with his autopilot in a bake-off, Tesla responded with a statement. 'We think it is extremely unlikely that a single person or even a small company that lacks extensive engineering validation capability will be able to produce an autonomous driving system that can be deployed to production vehicles. It may work as a limited demo on a known stretch of road \u2014 Tesla had such a system two years ago \u2014 but then requires enormous resources to debug over millions of miles of widely differing roads.' Above: Darrell Etherington of Techcrunch talks with George 'Geohot' Hotz. Image Credit: Dean TakahashiTesla added, 'This is the true problem of autonomy: getting a machine learning system to be 99% correct is relatively easy, but getting it to be 99.9999% correct, which is where it ultimately needs to be, is vastly more difficult. One can see this with the annual machine vision competitions, where the computer will properly identify something as a dog more than 99% of the time, but might occasionally call it a potted plant. Making such mistakes at 70 mph would be highly problematic.' And it said, 'We should also clarify that Tesla's autopilot system was designed and developed in-house. Were this simply a matter of repackaging a vendor's technology, as claimed in the article, we would not be unique in offering this groundbreaking experience in production vehicles. If other car companies could meet or exceed the Tesla product by buying an off-the-shelf solution, they would do so.\u00a0Tesla Autopilot includes radar, ultrasonics, GPS/nav, cameras and real-time connectivity to Tesla servers for fleet learning. Going forward, we will continue to use the most advanced component technologies, such as MobilEye's vision chip, in our vehicles. Their part is the best in the world at what it does and that is why we use it.' Above: George 'Geohot' Hotz says his Comma One is getting good video data from users. Image Credit: Dean TakahashiBut since that time, Tesla has had its own troubles. A driver in Florida died in a crash while using Tesla's autopilot feature[4] on May 7. It is also being scrutinized[5] for another Tesla crash in China. Mobileye parted ways with Tesla, saying that the car company had backed off[6] on a pledge that drivers had to keep their hands on the wheel when autopilot was engaged. But let's get back to the trash talk. Hotz said that Google is probably never going to ship its great technology. Otto 'was hungry but then they' got millions of dollars from Uber. He referred to self-driving car chip maker Mobileye as a 'joker' for lobbying government regulators to force self-driving car makers to use its chip. He also dismissed Zoox, Drive.ai, and Cruise. He referred to the latter as a 'sellout' for selling itself to GM[7]\u00a0for more than $1 billion. Above: The Comma One fits in a rear-view mirror slot. Image Credit: Dean Takahashi'Despite my public disagreement with <person><nameText>Elon Musk, </nameText></person>I have so much respect for that company because they actually shipped a self-driving car,' Hotz said. 'The most advanced self-driving car you can buy today is the Tesla Model S with autopilot.' He added, 'After the accident, Mobileye got scared. They want no part of innovation.' Hotz said his Comma One has the advantage of having real video data as a feedback loop for its research. Hotz said his own self-driving car kit won't let you totally relax and take your hands off the wheel. But he said the deep-learning algorithm in the car kit is as good as Tesla's autopilot. He referred to Tesla's autopilot as a 'very early on student driver.' Hotz noted, '40,000 people die a year from not paying attention on roads.' He noted that cruise control, which has a level of autonomy, is used with driver intervention. 'I don't believe self-driving cars is black and white thing. It's all on a spectrum of these driver assistance systems that get more and more advanced.' Hotz said his approach is more open than Tesla's. 'If they're the iOS of self-driving cars, we want to be the Android.'Get more stories like this on Twitter[8] ...cebook[9] [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/features/2015-george-hotz-self-driving-car/\">http://www.bloomberg.com/features/2015-george-hotz-self-driving-car/</url> [ 2]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.teslamotors.com/support/correction-article-first-person-hack-iphone-built-self-driving-car\">https://www.teslamotors.com/support/correction-article-first-person-hack-iphone-built-self-driving-car</url> [ 3]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://venturebeat.com/2015/12/17/some-hackers-just-wont-go-away-to-the-annoyance-of-big-tech-companies/\">http://venturebeat.com/2015/12/17/some-hackers-just-wont-go-away-to-the-annoyance-of-big-tech-companies/</url> [ 4]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-07-26/florida-driver-in-fatal-tesla-crash-using-autopilot-was-speeding\">http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-07-26/florida-driver-in-fatal-tesla-crash-using-autopilot-was-speeding</url> [ 5]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://fortune.com/2016/09/15/tesla-autopilot-crash-china/\">http://fortune.com/2016/09/15/tesla-autopilot-crash-china/</url> [ 6]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://venturebeat.com/2016/09/17/autopilot-radar-maker-mobileye-says-it-warned-tesla-against-enabling-hands-free-driving/\">http://venturebeat.com/2016/09/17/autopilot-radar-maker-mobileye-says-it-warned-tesla-against-enabling-hands-free-driving/</url> [ 7]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://venturebeat.com/2016/03/11/general-motors-acquires-autonomous-car-startup-cruise-automation-reportedly-for-1b/\">http://venturebeat.com/2016/03/11/general-motors-acquires-autonomous-car-startup-cruise-automation-reportedly-for-1b/</url> [ 8]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://bit.ly/1TqsQqK\">http://bit.ly/1TqsQqK</url> [ 9]: http://on.fb.me/1UQADh8 </p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-VNTR1079881474304769517251767500048</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">VNTR-6695</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5KRN-9J91-JCMN-Y50R-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1548\"/><timeReceived>5:06 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2016 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>VentureBeat</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"09\" year=\"2016\"><dateText>September 19, 2016 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

John coauthored Citizen Lab's report[3] last week on BellTroX and Indian hackers for hire, and Chris reported[4] for Reuters on the same organization's activities - and criminal exposure - in the United States.The most remarkable aspect of the story is how thoroughly normalized the hacking of legal and lobbying opponents seems to have become, at least in parts of the US legal and investigative ecosystem. I suggest that instead of a long extradition battle, the US should give the head of BellTroX a ticket to the US and a guaranteed income for the next few years as a witness against his customers.In the news roundup, Nick Weaver[5] tells the remarkable story of how Facebook funded an exploit aimed at taking down a particularly vile online abuser of young girls\u2014one who was rendered nearly invulnerable by his use of TAILS, the secure, thumb drive-based communication system (Vice[6], Gizmodo[7]). This is a great story because it really doesn't conform to any of the stilted narratives into which most internet security stories are usually jammed.Nick also notes Big Tech's pledge[8] to do more to stop child abuse online. </p><p>I suggest that only Dr. Evil[9]would be impressed by the amounts of money being invested in the campaign.Well, another week, another Zoom bomb. Now the company is taking heat because it terminated several Tiananmen Square commemorative Zoom sessions after China complained (NYT[10], Zoom[11]). David Kris[12] and I don't think Zoom had much choice about cutting off the Chinese customers. Terminating the US account holder who organized a session, however, was a bad move - and one that's since been corrected by the company.Nate Jones[13] and I square off again for Round 545 on content moderation, spurred this time by reports[14] that Sen. Josh Hawley is drafting legislation inspired by the Trump Administration's Section 230 Executive Order. Meanwhile several Republican senators are pushing the FCC[15] to act on the order. Nate and I find rare bipartisan common ground on the proposal that Congress require social media companies to take down foreign government online propagands - and maybe work with the US government to stop it at the source.David reports on a (deservedly) obscure EU cloud independence project[16]. It seems to have been embraced by Microsoft, which I accuse of going full AT&amp;#38;T - embracing government regulation as a competitive differentiator. As if to prove my point, Microsoft announces[17] that it's getting out of the business of doing facial recognition for the police - until it can persuade Congress to regulate its competitors.Why are spies targeting vaccine research? Nate has the answer; he draws on the excellent Risky Biz newsletter analysis[18] of what drives COVID-19 cyberespionage.Nick flags the potential significance of ARM wrestling, as the UK chip designer ARM fights[19] its JV partner for control of its Chinese joint venture. In a story that made the cut because of Twitter and Linkedin feedback, Nick assigns a \"moderate\" threat label to the latest Universal Plug n Pwn exploit. (It's only moderate because there are so many pwned IOT devices already in a position to DDOS targets of opportunity.)In quick hits, I note that Israel has halted its controversial use of intelligence capabilities to monitor the spread of the coronavirus, but the government reserves the right to revive monitoring if a second wave shows up (JPost[20], Yahoo[21]). Poor Brewster Kahle is looking like an internet hippie who fell asleep at Woodstock and woke up at Altamont. The Internet Archive is ending its program of offering free, unrestricted copies of e-books, but the publishers who sued over that program may decide to keep suing until they've broken his entire \"digital library\" model, and maybe the Internet Archive as well (NYT[22], Ars Technica[23]). That would be a shame. Finally, even if you have a thousand talents, honesty may not be one of them. Charles Lieber, the Harvard University professor arrested for lying about his lucrative China thousand-talents contracts, has now been indicted[24] on false statement charges.Download the 320th Episode (mp3).[25]You can subscribe to The Cyberlaw Podcast using iTunes[26], Google Play[27], Spotify[28], Pocket Casts[29], or our RSS feed.[30] As always, The Cyberlaw Podcast is open to feedback.

Science class The principal calls this a mindful school.Johane Ligond is effusively warm but with the kind of emotional solidity you'd expect from someone who wakes each morning to manage more than 1,000 kids at the only public middle school in the village of Freeport in Long Island, New York. She is also an aromatherapist and life coach who hangs a sign reading \"I AM AN OPTIMIST\" in her windowless office.At John W. Dodd Middle School, some of the students' primary struggles are common to many young teenagers: depression, anxiety, self-harm and the looming shadow of sudden violence.So every morning during homeroom, a student or staff member leads the entire building through eight minutes of breathing meditation over the PA system. In detention, students are \"invited,\" Ligond said, to do mindfulness exercises, \"so it's not just a space for punishment, it's a space for reflection.\" A \"social-emotional learning curriculum\" has been introduced, teaching them conflict and relationship management.At 11 AM, four periods into a drizzly Wednesday in June, Ligond watches seventh graders shuffle in for science class and take their seats between model skeletons and posters of plant-cell structures. </p><p>Some stare blankly into the middle distance.Their assignment is to meditate. Half the students slump their foreheads into the crook of their arm, resting on top of tables or thick ring binders. They are the control group.The other half strap on purple, cardboard VR headsets and clip pulse monitors to their fingers. The teacher, Vanessa Vidalon, turns down the lights, and the class hushes, save for some snapping of elastic headbands over white earbuds and the clacks of phones dropped on desks.The VR students find themselves in a virtual meadow, tracing the flight path of a butterfly. They match their breath to the rise and fall of its wings, guided by a gentle voice. A dreamy synthesizer plays in the background. For five minutes, this is all they do in silence. \"Remember, you can always come back here in your mind,\" the voice says as the scene ends.Vidalon asks, \"How many of you feel calmer from when you first walked in?\" About half the class raises their hands, including most of the VR group. \"How many of you didn't get enough sleep?\" The remaining hands go up.The VR animation is simplistic[1]. But the isolation factor that's long been seen as a headwind for widespread virtual reality adoption is perhaps what makes this experience work. The kids can't look around the room, giggle or get distracted. They don't feel watched or judged by one another. The transportive graphics also have a greater allure for young teens than an audio track alone. Like any guided meditation, it doesn't do the work for you though. \"This is not 'Oh, I don't know how to be calm, I'm going to put this headset on,'\" said Dumeetha Luthra, an ex-BBC correspondent from North London who developed (and voiced) the experience, called Take-Pause. \"For me this is training wheels. ... This is a little hack to get you there.\" \"For me this is training wheels. ... This is a little hack to get you there.\" The students record their stress level and heart rate before and after each meditation. After three days, students in the VR group show about a further 10 percent decrease in heart rate and stress than the control group. Keep in mind these are 12- to 13-year-olds, so their experiment might not withstand peer review in the Lancet. Some students arrived pumped from third-period gym; another noted that \"I really enjoyed sleeping during class.\" But the effects of meditation are usually felt gradually -- this was quantified evidence for the class. Johane Ligond There are all sorts of higher-level aspirations for practicing mindful meditation -- recognizing your conditioning, creating space around your emotions -- but for students experiencing the stressors, emotions and impulses of adolescence, this basic, measurable relief helps.The same could be said for adults. Mindfulness has boomed in popularity in recent years. The meditation-industrial complex is worth more than $1 billion in the US, with 18 million Americans practicing[2]. Research into meditation soared over the past decade, associating the practice with improved focus, reduced stress and less emotional reactivity, legitimizing mindfulness' entry into NFL teams, the US Marines and corporate-benefits schemes. It figures: This is an age when busyness borders on fetish, news cycles sound practically dystopian and merely being present in the moment is a commodity.With this new market comes a proliferation of ways to perform a time-honored practice where the equipment costs are technically zero. You can use apps like Headspace to meditate from home. You can visit drop-in meditation domes ($26 for 35 minutes); co-working spaces with handmade, iPad-controlled gongs like the Assemblage in Manhattan; or high-end retreat centers like Esalen in the Bay Area. You can meditate with the corporate elite at TED-style summits like Wisdom 2.0 or with their grittier, inked brethren at Dharma Punx[3].This is not Buddhism per se. The religion had a cultural rise in the US in the 1950s, part of the Beat generation and mid-century reaction to a consumerist American dream. Mindfulness-based stress reduction, or MBSR, was developed in the 1970s at the University of Massachusetts, giving credence to the idea of meditation as medical practice. Today, mainstream mindfulness is more self-help than spirituality, physiological rather than moral. It's part of traditional Buddhism but divorced from the rest of its practices, then secularized, gentrified, Westernized and crunched through the capitalist apparatus. And wherever mindfulness goes, technology has seemed to be stalking behind, with apps, gadgets and full-blown curricula.Ligond has been the principal at J.W. Dodd for the past five years and has meditated \"religiously\" for four. \"My dream is for every student to feel loved in a school,\" Ligond said. \"People think I'm weird, and I'm OK with that.\" This June was her first time bringing tech-assisted meditation into the classroom.As the school bell rings, Vidalon asks the students if they enjoyed the meditation.\"Yeeees,\" they groan, obligatorily and in unison.Vidalon reminds them their final exams are tomorrow. There's a collective sigh, and the stress levels in the room whoosh back up palpably.Technology may have catalyzed the students' meditation practice, but it's not like it can force them into that state. At least not this technology. 2. Meditation's dirty secret The basic idea of mindfulness -- meaning modern, Western-hybrid mindfulness -- is to pay attention to what's happening around you dispassionately.Though there are many meditative traditions, this one derives much from vipassana, or \"insight,\" meditation. You start with nothing more than focusing on your breath, paying attention to bodily sensations and observing fleeting thoughts and emotions. You recognize that your highs are unquenchable, your lows ephemeral.When it works, it's a respite from the thoughts that bombard consciousness, if only for a hot second. It's a permission -- even if circumscribed by a 15-minute smartphone timer -- to not obsess over anything.With practice, a path becomes grooved in the mind, leading to a nook free from the tyranny of conscious thought. There are no text notifications, to-do lists, deadlines, regrets, desires, considerations of what to eat for lunch. Your attention is not split between future plans and past analysis but rather focused on witnessing what's in front of you.Eventually, anyway. Because the dirty secret of meditation is how unpleasant it is most of the time.The caricature of the modern meditator may be a blissed-out millennial wearing neutral tones in magic-hour light, but any practice that scratches beneath that granola surface is more like sitting cross-legged in a stew of your own emotional filth, full of childhood traumas, papered-over insecurities and subconscious resentments bubbling to the surface. Part of seeing things as they really are is seeing the unfiltered negative too. The change is incremental, and at the beginning it's hard to even tell if you're doing it right.This is where Silicon Valley comes in. Today, barely a month goes by without a new gadget in the wellness gold rush that pledges to make attaining your peace of mind smoother.The most basic, and mature, are of course the guided-meditation apps. The dulcet tones of British monk-turned-CEO Andy Puddicombe have led Headspace to a $320 million valuation and a self-reported 30 million users[4] while Calm, which Apple deemed app of the year in 2017, is close behind at $250 million in value and 26 million users[5]. There's an app for kids[6] and an app for fans of Russell Simmons[7]. Effective as they may be, however, most of these are just well-designed digital houses for audio tracks.There are also VR experiences that beam you into a meditation center[8] or abstract world[9]. Biofeedback devices measure heart rate variability, breathing rates and skin temperature, giving you real-time measures of whether you're reaching a meditative state. There's a certain paradox at work when technology sets quantified goals on a process that's about being present, immersing you in hallucinatory worlds instead of forcing you to live with the banal now.But it certainly sounds like the solution for our era, when free time is an ancient concept and taking five requires an active choice.We like to point the finger at Big Tech for our permanent distraction, and that backlash is tentatively being reified through regulation and an ethical-design movement. But on a day-to-day personal level, unplugging from the digital world seems unfeasible, and people are turning to gadgets to get out of the hole. The day after the 2016 presidential election, Headspace says, the use of its emergency-meditation feature spiked 44 percent.For Mikey Siegel, a figurehead for the \"transformative technology\" movement who founded the now-5,000 member San Francisco Consciousness Hacking community, the allure of fleeing technology is understandable but misguided. \"If you'd only ever been exposed to fast food, then you would think of food as something which is sort of inherently unhealthy to the body,\" he said. \"I believe we're in an era where most of what we've seen is the equivalent of technological fast food.\" \"I believe we're in an era where most of what we've seen is the equivalent of technological fast food.\" The philosophy embedded in much modern technology is efficiency and optimization; Siegel proposes that this is not inevitable and that these values can be divorced from our products. We don't necessarily have a tech addiction, only a productivity one. \"The tech industry has a profoundly limited sense of what technology can be,\" he said. \"The best technologies are basically going to be the ones that most elegantly confront us with the parts of us we don't want to look at.\"Yet the closer you get to the front line of technology-assisted meditation, the more ironies abound.Cutting-edge devices not only hold your hand as you practice but also try to shunt you toward enlightenment more quickly. It's a paradoxical clash of a Buddhist acceptance of life's inherent instability and a tech culture of peak performance. Mindfulness preaches learning to live with pathologies; Silicon Valley, for the most part, wishes to zap them away. Where a traditional vipassana retreat can be run solely on donations, access to brain-hacking gadgets can run you into the thousands.Everyone wants a cut of the McMindfulness trend, but are the cultures of tech and mindfulness even compatible? And as these questionable bedfellows grow closer and closer, who's going to change whom? 3. The fast track Do not go to Sedona, Arizona, if you harbor skepticism toward any of the following: sweat lodges, Reiki healing, the chakra-balancing effects of crystals, energy vortexes, psychic consultations, vision quests or a tourist information center with a \"metaphysical/spiritual\" section. Here, New Age culture is as ubiquitous as the tourists en route to the Grand Canyon and the iconic regional red rocks.If those do pique your interest, however, so might the Biocybernaut Institute, which has been in the game of harnessing neurotechnology to supercharge enlightenment since long before it was Silicon Valley's favorite self-care routine.The claim is audacious: Check in for seven days, leave with a brain that looks like it's been practicing Zen meditation for 21 to 40 years. James Hardt \"It is not an analogue. It's not similar to, it is exactly like 21 to 40 years of Zen: exactly the same pattern,\" James Hardt told me before I visited the center, the emphasis denoting his shouting. Hardt founded the institute in 1983, and it now has centers in Sedona, Canada and Germany and counts professional optimist, multimillionaire and life coach Tony Robbins among its endorsers. \"Nobody has been able to show these exact same results except Biocybernaut,\" Hardt said.Think of it like an accelerated meditation retreat, souped-up on technology. Also, it costs $15,000 for the basic program and $25,000 for the premium program that Hardt leads personally.Neurofeedback purports to work through basic Pavlovian conditioning. The brain is hooked up to an electroencephalogram (EEG) via electrodes on the scalp that detect electrical activity. In order to incentivize that brain into firing in a specific way, the participant may, for example, listen to music. When the \"correct\" brain waves are detected, the music plays; when the brain is firing incorrectly it stops instantly. Soon, the brain, yearning for the reward of continuous music, subconsciously figures out how to make the real-time feedback loop continue. By giving participants visual and audio cues for their neural patterns, proponents of the technique claim to make subtle physiology conscious and therefore manipulable.Hardt, with his mop of curls and tendency to wax eccentrically off topic (say, on the wonders of \"remote viewing\" where one can be trained to close their eyes and travel in their mind's eye to a bunker in Moscow), cannot help but remind me of Gene Wilder's Willy Wonka. He has worked in this field for the past 40 years, developing his seven-day program in 1971, he said, adding that at the institute he sees participants' IQ increase 12 points, creativity increase 50 percent (in his own studies[10]) and emotional quotient[11] increase 16 points.The \"brain training\" takes place in chambers for two hours at a time. Here, participants try to cajole their minds into producing alpha waves, associated with calm and creativity. Numbers and colors on a screen show whether their amplitude is going up or down.Participants then enter the \"debrief room,\" a collection of couches and amethyst-colored fairy lights beneath a blue, tinsel-lined canopy. There are tissue boxes within reach of every seat.Here, they go through a 14-step \"forgiveness process,\" pinpointing traumas and resentments, though Hardt is keen not to call it psychotherapy or counseling. Instead, it's a way to \"systematically process negative emotion,\" said Aaron Brindger, the institute's director of marketing. \"When an astronaut comes back from space, they debrief with the command center,\" he said. \"It's kind of the same thing.\"I meet Georg Rosenblum in between her neurofeedback sessions. She's a 49-year-old foster mother from California whose father passed away a week before her arrival. Rosenblum has dabbled in meditation before, but it's never stuck. In the neurofeedback chamber, though, \"there's something about being hooked up and listening to the tones that makes my brain feel clear,\" she tells me, multicolored wires sprouting from her scalp like exposed nerve endings.EEG works through electrodes that measure the brain's electrical signals from neurons firing beneath the scalp. It has been used safely for decades to diagnose disorders like Alzheimer's disease and narcolepsy. By correlating brain wave patterns with certain activities, researchers have also developed \"mind controlled\" prosthetic limbs, communication devices for people with locked-in syndrome and, on the more speculative side, three-person thought sharing. The portability, noninvasiveness and low cost of EEG in recent years have also led to consumer devices that work with fewer electrodes and without gummy conductive paste. Hence the rise of sleek brain-scanning wearables for sleep monitoring, emotion sensing and, of course, mindfulness.Neurofeedback has been studied since the 1960s, including for disorders like ADHD, PTSD, epilepsy and substance abuse, but the science is still patchy at best.There is even less research for neurofeedback's use in meditation. While academics -- such as those at the University of Massachusetts Medical School and University of Wisconsin-Madison -- have a decent idea what a meditating brain looks like under EEG or fMRI, it's a leap to associate that with a psychological state. The presence of alpha waves in a monk doesn't mean those waves are causing them to be monk-like. And it doesn't mean one can reverse-engineer that state, essentially shoehorning one brain into the mold of another.\"[To] suggest that neurofeedback can be helpful to people meditating is really grossly overstating the case,\" said Richard Davidson, the founder of the Center for Healthy Minds at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and a leading neuroscientist in the study of meditation. \"The brain is ridiculously complex. Our measures, even though they've come a long way, are absurdly limited and very coarse, and it's nothing short of hubris to think that we have the right measures at this point in time that we should be providing feedback on.\" \"It's nothing short of hubris to think that we have the right measures at this point in time that we should be providing feedback on.\" There are hundreds of meditative states, many of which don't affect alpha waves at all, Davidson said. \"I'm a fan of going ahead with the research... but to market it to consumers I think is irresponsible.\"Even Siegel, who has completed the program, had his reservations. \"People that do it consistently have a positive experience and a transformative experience,\" he said. \"With regard to particular claims around how many years of Zen practice or whatever, I would say no, absolutely not. It's not the same as 40 years.\"Still, neurofeedback has become a major site of exploration for meditating technologists -- from Biocybernaut to the at-home device Muse (slogan: \"meditation made easy\"), which costs $249 for the newest model. Six weeks after we met, Rosenblum emailed: She had \"major epiphanies\" on her seventh day and was \"really just enjoying life as a less reactive person.\"More than three months later, she told me, \"I'm not sure I would know what 21 to 40 years of meditation is, but I know before I arrived I couldn't even quiet my mind for two to three minutes. ... I am a happier, more content, less triggered person than before, and for that I will be forever grateful.\"The thing is, people are biased toward what works for them -- or the thing they think works for them. If it gets them there -- and the app makers, wearable designers and retreat gurus surely know this -- then the question of how may be moot. For instance, a review of placebo surgeries[12] -- i.e., fake surgeries -- showed that patients felt improvements 74 percent of the time. An MIT study from 2008[13] showed that participants were 24 percent more likely to feel that fake codeine relieved pain when they thought it cost $2.50 rather than 10 cents. Telling people their $10 Cabernet Sauvignon is worth $90 makes them neurologically experience greater pleasure[14]. (Now imagine the subconscious incentive to feel results when you've spent five figures in the Sonoran Desert.) Ultimately, all the credentialed lab coats and replicable lab studies can count for little in our mind's scales compared to our personal n of one.To see why transformative technology is booming, therefore, requires looking beyond the proven science. It also helps to understand what brought these two apparently incompatible worlds of tech and Buddhism together in the first place. Video: Broader perspectives4. States versus traits Chade-Meng Tan started life at Google as an engineer and employee No. 107 but soon became best known as the company's in-house guru.In 2007, he launched Search Inside Yourself, a seven-week meditation course that has now expanded into an independent institute that teaches mindfulness to organizations like Ford and American Express.The initial key to getting wildly overworked Googlers on board, he said, was stuffing the practice into the Trojan horse of productivity and self-interest. He sold it as \"the science of emotion.\"\"They wear stress on their sleeves. They're so proud of being stressed,\" said Tan of his former co-workers. \"We help them become successful, with goodness being the necessary and unavoidable side effect.\"Meditation by now is fully ripened in Silicon Valley's culture. Steve Jobs, Jack Dorsey, Sergey Brin -- all have talked about their practices.On a basic level, working 60-to-80-hour weeks requires some kind of release, and mindfulness is a data-validated, nonintrusive method of lowering your blood pressure. \"I think sometimes [through] pop culture representations of Silicon Valley, people forget that they're not just douchebags; they're really hard-working douchebags,\" said Jay Michaelson, columnist, author of Evolving Dharma: Meditation, Buddhism, and the Next Generation of Enlightenment and meditation teacher.At the same time, the Bay Area's hippy lineage and culture of innovation mean unconventional solutions don't freak anyone out. \"This is a segment of the business world that's interested in disruption,\" said Michaelson. \"They're not afraid of looking weird, because that's how you succeed.\" It's also a solutionary culture: Every challenge can be fixed, and that extends to the challenges of being human. It's taking a risk on something unproven for an extra advantage. \"Rather than presenting the whole toolbox to the audience, people are just glorifying screwdrivers and hammers.\" Tan, a jovial and humble guy, joked that \"people want to be successful, and they don't mind world peace.\" But the world peace part may no longer be an inevitable part of the package. Where stress reduction was once a byproduct of being a compassionate person, today it's the goal in itself. Psychologists like to talk about states versus traits: The former are temporary, the latter lasting. A lot of today's mindfulness tech is sold as inducing desirable states -- but so can DMT or porn.\"It's still some permutation of traditional disciplines that are observation of breath, observation of sensations, observation of emotions and so on. ... It is still deriving from the traditional toolbox, so to speak,\" said Tenzin Priyadarshi, the director of the Dalai Lama Center for Ethics and Transformative Values at MIT, who is also a monk. \"But rather than presenting the whole toolbox to the audience, people are just glorifying screwdrivers and hammers.\"The traditional Buddhist would ask if these tools are making you kinder, more engaged in society, said Priyadarshi. The idea of mindfulness was that the attitude would permeate your daily life and become a path to higher virtues. But we're a long way from Buddhism now: Priyadarshi has been asked to train military snipers.Joi Ito, the director of MIT's Media Lab who teaches a conspicuously low-tech class[15] about mindfulness with Priyadarshi, put it this way: \"The more Silicon Valley CEOs that do vipassana, the better Silicon Valley will be. But it has also become like [progressive schooling method] Montessori: When you have a bunch of uptight parents, it isn't Montessori anymore.\"Mindfulness was supposed to be about accepting that bliss will always be elusive. Like most religions, Buddhism recognizes that life is inherently hard and everything is transient.\"Some of my big concerns are that these technologies are actually going to inflame people's tendency to try to escape that groundless pit of existential uncertainty by chasing states, by giving them more tools to chase states, and to become addicted to a certain states,\" said Vincent Horn, the co-founder of the Meditate.io[16] platform and Buddhist Geeks podcast. \"To essentially avoid this recognition of the nature of states, which is that they change and they can't be held on to.\" 5. The business of consciousness The secularization of spirituality. The adoration from the technology world. The agitation of the modern attention economy. The valorization of the screwdriver over the entire toolbox. The logical end point of all this can be found in a McMansion down a leafy cul-de-sac in the suburbs of Seattle.If Sedona's Biocybernaut Institute laid the groundwork for the accelerated meditation program, 40 Years of Zen has refined it into the retreat of the future.Refined or replicated. The cost is the same, $15,000, but this program is five days, not seven. It doesn't contend to give you 21 to 40 years of meditation experience but the full 40: It's right there in the name.40 Years of Zen has its own Willy Wonka, too, but with a modern twist.Dave Asprey is best known for popularizing Bulletproof Coffee, which is basically coffee with butter in it. (Or if you're an acolyte, Bulletproof-brand coffee beans, Bulletproof-brand grass-fed ghee and Bulletproof-brand brain octane oil.) It's part of the Bulletproof Diet, which is basically the Paleo diet with proprietary branding and supplements. Dave Asprey A former VP at Trend Micro, Asprey has said he's spent more than $300,000 on biohacking himself, and his book Head Strong has appeared on TheNew York Times best-seller list under \"science.\" In it, he talks about how he \"upgraded his brain\" with \"a totally modern, bio-hacked version\" of meditation. He lists techniques like Neurofeedback Augmented Reset\u2122 and Retroframing\u2122 that will help you \"achieve your life goals.\"His pitch? \"You have a choice: you can wait a generation before this information hits the mainstream or you can benefit now.\" (Based on the neuroscience experts interviewed, \"before this information hits the mainstream\" sounds like a euphemism for \"before empirically proven.\")We met at South by Southwest in Austin, Texas, where, wearing black five-finger-style shoes, he essentially told the crowd how every problem in your life has a hidden cause, whether that's mitochondrial dysfunction or \"junk light.\" Everything, in Asprey's worldview, is up for optimization.I asked Asprey about 40 Years of Zen. For all of his vigorous self-promotion, he seldom promotes the center loudly. We arranged for me to visit. Then another attendee asked him about a similar program he'd heard of, led by someone named Jim (though he couldn't quite recall the name Biocybernaut), which Asprey feigned only a vague familiarity with.The story goes like this:Around 2010, Asprey, impressed with the Biocybernaut Institute, arranged with Hardt to become an affiliate. Asprey subsequently sent $2 million worth of clients to Biocybernaut, according to Hardt, in return for credit for Asprey and his staff to go through the training. Asprey took to calling the program 40 Years of Zen. Then, in 2016, Asprey started his own center, keeping the name.\"He wants to take what I have and use it against me,\" Hardt told me. He also derided Asprey's labelling of 40 Years of Zen as upmarketing. \"It's really 21 to 40 years,\" Hardt said. \"He wants to take what I have and use it against me.\" Through a spokesman, Asprey contends that he introduced new supplements and \"mitochondrial enhancement technologies\" to Biocybernaut's program, among other tweaks. \"However, feedback from higher-end clients was mixed, and [Asprey] was unsuccessful at convincing Biocybernaut to evolve the program,\" said the spokesman. \"Whereas the old partnership focused exclusively on alpha brain states, the 40 Years of Zen program now includes newer research on gamma brain waves and states of synchrony [between the left and right sides of the brain].\"He added, \"Dave does not receive compensation for his ownership of 40 Years of Zen, but he believes that the good it does for clients has a greater impact on the world, and it allows him access to the latest brain enhancements.\"I asked Chris Keane, the CTO of 40 Years of Zen, who essentially runs the center day to day, about the former affiliation with Biocybernaut. Without breaking his equanimous character, he told me, \"We don't feel anything about them, but I have a funny feeling that they do not like us at all.\"The basic premise is very similar, but the implementation is wildly different,\" Keane said. \"Our actual implementation of neurofeedback is well in advance of anything else that exists in the world.\" Chris Keane Keane was the one who invited me to not only visit their retreat but experience the full course. An Australian who's lived in the US for most of his adult life, Keane comes from a computer science background, having spent a decade at Sun Microsystems. Yet he connected with Asprey outside the tech world: He's married to Asprey's sister. His speech is calm and modest in the way that Asprey's is not, and he tells me that Asprey is \"completely hands off\" at the center.The day before my course was due to start, Keane told me, \"I personally can attest that I've had the most amazing experiences of my life\" -- and here he karate chopped the air for emphasis -- \"by far while doing neurofeedback.\"40 Years of Zen takes four people on average through the course each week, he said, about half of whom are usually senior executives. He explained the program to me with this analogy: Say you look at your smartphone and scroll through your apps. There are bound to be several gathering dust whose purposes you've forgotten. In real life, when we experience intense emotions, they also install apps in our brains that try to pair new events with past highs and lows, either engaging or shielding us. \"Those apps just sit there constantly spinning, draining the battery, using up processing power, using up memory,\" he said. \"And what we do in this program is help you go through the apps that are installed in your brain and uninstall the ones that are not useful to you.\"I also spoke with Asprey on the phone, who warned this is \"hardcore personal development work\" but, he claimed, better than regular meditation or ayahuasca.\"This isn't my money-making thing,\" he said of the Monday-to-Friday program, which costs about a quarter of the median American household annual income. (Engadget did not pay for the 40 Years of Zen course.) \"This is my helping-people thing.\" 6. My 40 Years of Zen Of course, the first thing I'm offered on arrival is a Bulletproof Coffee served in a mug made to look like a chemistry-class beaker.There are subtle ads for Asprey's products around the house: Bulletproof snacks, vibrating plates that activate your lymphatic something. The 40 Years of Zen branding is around, too, the zero on \"40\" resembling a power symbol.Dan Harris, the ABC news anchor and meditation apologist, called his book about the practice 10% Happier, but the staff here is at least up by 15, which is just aggressively cheery enough for me to feel disconcerted. It's hard to tell how performative the earnestness is, and whether they're the most or least well-adjusted people I've met lately. Maybe this is just how people treat you when you're pretending to be in an elevated tax bracket.Me and my two cadres sit in the living room and are introduced to the staff who call themselves sherpas for the journey. I stare out of a window for 20 minutes while getting a baseline EEG done and have my optimal breathing rate (5.5 breaths per minute) measured using a heart rate variability monitor.Soon, we get to the core of the program: the neurofeedback. In a converted garage there are five smooth, white pods resembling oversize pebbles, each with a reclining chair and a plush blanket inside. At Biocybernaut, the chambers are more like closets with desk chairs and Ikea furniture, but the function is pretty much the same.Conductive EEG paste is smeared on our scalps, electrodes are attached, and we enter the pods. We put on headphones and listen to the sound of rain and try to make the sound louder. The feedback is responsive: The moment I open my eyes to jot down notes, it dims to a quiet, and the more I focus -- though I'm not sure on what -- the heavier the patter.A presentation follows, emphasizing how the exercise was all aimed at generating alpha brain waves. \"We're Going to Get You There Faster\" appears on the slides as we discuss meditation. By day three, it's dawned on me that I've been ambushed into something resembling group therapy. There's Bulletproof-friendly lunch from the private chef, a smorgasbord of supplements (\"Let's get our supps going!\" says the facilitator) and more time in the pods.Then they walk us through their \"reset process.\" In a nutshell, we're to scrape through all of our life's traumatic events, try to viscerally relive them in the pod, activate our alpha waves on demand and replace negative emotions with gratitude, forgiveness and acceptance.Afterward, a plasticky banister leads upstairs to the debrief room, where there are four chairs facing inward, four tissue boxes and no canopy. Over Pukka tea, a naturopathic doctor asks what we thought about in the pod and follows up with a lot of \"why\" questions. By day three, it's dawned on me that I've been ambushed into something resembling group therapy.There's also acupuncture, brain training using pulsed-electromagnetic-field therapy and another form of neurofeedback using a 21-channel EEG cap.In some of our twice-daily, 90-minute pod sessions I fall asleep or can't focus. Other times I end up in conversation with myself about memories I haven't considered in years. It's not unlike the thoughts that bubble to the surface during intense meditation anyway, but here the reconstruction is intentional and systematic. I get better at finding the spot where the sounds get stronger.On day five, I see my final brain scans. The amount of time my brain is in \"synchrony\" between left and right hemispheres has gone up about 15 percent, apparently. I can see how my alpha brain wave production spikes during a certain neurofeedback session, but it doesn't seem on average much higher. I am assured that it always goes up within a week.I was told at the outset that participants feel more \"space between your thoughts and emotions\" by the end of the week, and I do. But how much that's to do with the neurofeedback and faux therapy I've gone through versus the simple act of disconnecting from nearly everyone but my smiling sherpas and Airbnb hosts for five days while eating fresh cauliflower bread is impossible to tell. If I had truly expected to emerge feeling like I'd mastered four decades of meditation, I'd have been disappointed.I sit on the outside deck with a fellow participant.In the year and a half since selling his gaming company, Lincoln Brown has tried a different self-improvement scheme every month. He's boiled down his growth to seven key areas.\"There are probably 40 things I've tried, of which 25 I've seen value in,\" he says. Those include Wim Hof breathing, DNA testing, food-sensitivity tests and 14 different supplements. He wears an HRV monitor on his wrist, does CrossFit (and founded an affiliate) and sticks to a pegan (Paleo and vegan) diet. When it comes to biohacking, he told me later, \"I've probably covered 95 percent of what's available.\"He has done neurofeedback before and says he can't recommend 40 Years of Zen. \"I thought there was a 25 percent chance it was going to be really worthwhile, but if it was, it's so valuable. I thought that it's certainly worth the 75 percent risk. It's not,\" he says. \"I'm very driven by things that I can measure, and I haven't been able to discern or ascertain exactly the measurable impact of being here yet.\"Two months later, though, he told me he'd unexpectedly realized its benefits. By way of example, Brown said that the night he flew out of Seattle he must have answered 50 emails on the flight, at \"80-90 percent capability,\" all while watching Black Panther on the airplane's monitor. \"It really caught my eye that I was able to [find the] mental capacity to do both,\" he said. 7. To have it all We can't all be monks. Modern capitalistic life seldom allows the kind of tranquil pace, focused appreciation of every moment and letting go that this existence might entail. The fundamental challenge with mindfulness is integrating it into the world we live in, with its rent or mortgages at home and key performance indicators at work. With all the freshly polished meditation techniques on offer, it's still not clear what the new middle way might be.Perhaps the new culture around mindfulness, driven by transformative tech, is really the dream of not having to pick. Choosing between processes and end goals, the mindful technologist might select both. A unicorn startup, 18-hour days and peace of mind too.Through this lens, they're not connecting with a religion; they're trying to hack it. They're upgrading the operating system of our consciousness. That may not sit well with Buddhist purists, but the ethos isn't run-of-the-mill contemporary iconoclasm; it's irreverence for stasis, the idea that everything is there to be transcended. It sounds profoundly masturbatory -- arrogant if not completely unpalatable. After all, the optimistic futurist's ethos is all about non-scarcity. If AI can be unfathomably intelligent, if radical life extension can make us live forever, maybe some believe that our capacity for humanity can be infinitely augmented too.It sounds profoundly masturbatory -- arrogant if not completely unpalatable. But it also points to a dilemma that, for me, is at the heart of modern mindfulness.The need to set goals and fixate and optimize is not just part of living in a global economy of scarce resources and competition. For better or worse, these needs animate life. The very possibility of stakes -- of failure, of change, of ambiguity -- is the engine of scientific breakthroughs, political revolution, unimaginable sporting feats or classic love stories. The fact that the stakes are ephemeral makes them even more valuable.Only by holding onto things does life have meaning. But to hold is also to eventually lose. For all its flagrant yuckiness and elitist price tags, whether in earnest or vulgar ways, this is what modern mindfulness is grasping at: whether we possibly stand a chance at reconciling both. Perhaps to make life cohere, the trick is to be as good at holding tight as letting go. And if our modern, modular, open-source version of mindfulness is deeply paradoxical -- well, life is too.CreditsFeatures editor: Aaron SouppourisCopy editor: Megan GillerImages: Chris Ip (all,

Security has traditionally been controlled by a small group of established firms that maintain a vice-like grip on the major IT sales channels. And understandably, big ticket customers like the military and large enterprise can be hard to sell into for startups.\u00a0The technology in fields such as encryption and intrusion detection is complex and arcane, and often requires expensive certifications.</p><p><br/> But even in the face of such challenges security remains a hot field and offers opportunities for startups. So-called endpoint security[1] for consumers was a $4.9 billion market in 2012, according to IDC, and enterprise security software and hardware is roughly $31.4 billion worldwide. In the past two years there have been over $12 billion in security acquisitions, with many of the notable exits in 2011 and 2012 having hit north of $800 million.<br/> It's also a disruptive field. Security is constantly\u00a0evolving to confront the mercurial world of hackers and cybercriminals. With the proliferation of professional financial cybercrime and high-profile state-sponsored hacking, modern adversaries for information security are incredibly sophisticated. The rise of this generation of hackers creates a demand for new and better security technologies, and two fields in particular are currently big areas of interest for Sand Hill VCs.<br/>Cloud and next-gen infrastructure security<br/>Cloud and infrastructure security refers to the hardware and software associated with protecting modern IT infrastructures. As more businesses move workloads to the cloud, critical financial and personal data becomes exposed to the public internet. Securing data in flight to the cloud and at rest off-site is mission critical.<br/> VCs will be heavily investing in hardware and software in this field because it shares complementary demand with the success for cloud computing; as companies demand the flexibility and cost-savings of the cloud, they will also require next-generation security built to secure the infrastructure of public and hybrid-cloud environments.<br/> This is a hard area for startups to play. Proving compliance with draconian and mercurial regulations like PCI-DSS or the Common Criteria is a difficult and frequently expensive endeavor. As a result of high barriers to entry, systems incumbents such as NetApp and Oracle have an advantage.<br/> But several new startups in this space have navigated these issues through the engagement of established\u00a0veterans and a focused but superior feature set. These include encryption-focused Ciphercloud[2] and the back-end infrastructure-focused CloudPassage[3]. (Note: I have no financial or professional relationship with these or any of the other companies mentioned in this article.) Both Ciphercloud and Cloudpassage augment the security of an existing IT infrastructure and uniquely target bringing compliance-grade security to hybrid cloud environments.\u00a0Compliance is a serious and expensive issue for the enterprise, and these industry veteran-led startups are attractive to VCs because they provide an economic but well-monetized alternative to purely consulting-based solutions.<br/>Intrusion detection and prevention systems<br/>Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) and Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) refer to software and hardware solutions that detect and halt attacks or attackers as they attempt to compromise a system in real time. The rocket science-esque fields of IDS and IPS aren't new, but with the advent of this generation of sophisticated attackers and widespread interest in big data analysis, IDS and IPS are quickly becoming a hot topic for VCs.<br/><br/>A great example of IDS/IPS success can be seen in Silvertail Systems.[4] Acquired late last year by EMC, Silvertail used complex algorithms to detect attacks from the outside and even internal attacks launched by compromised accounts. VCs liked that Silvertail's tech was managed by a team of industry veterans and that from the beginning they closed deals with large enterprises.<br/> Late-stage starlet FireEye[5] seems poised for success by employing the same formula. Their late 2012 hire of ex-McAfee CEO Dave DeWalt and success in traditional security verticals like US DoD, US federal, and large financial have well prepared the company for their imminent IPO.<br/> SF-based CloudFlare[6] can also be considered an IDS/IPS company. CloudFlare intercepts and sifts traffic to a site through an analysis engine to improve performance and protect websites from modern attacks like Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). CloudFlare protects a significant measure of the internet and remains on the watch list for nearly every VC on Sand Hill.<br/> CloudFlare's frictionless sales model is also an interesting point for VCs. Bucking the traditional IT model of inside/outside sales teams, infrastructure companies like CloudFlare and New Relic allow customers to directly purchase through their sites. This decreases sales cycle time and increases margins - both key diligence metrics for VCs. In a busy space like IPS/IDS (or IT in general), employing positive differences like a unique sales architecture help startups to distinguish themselves in the eyes of investors.<br/>Finding an edge<br/>As a security startup you can do a few things to improve your chances of closing your round. Make sure your team is led by veterans who know how to build and sell into your verticals (or actively recruit them). Also, align your company with sectors that have complementary demand with big tech trends.<br/> And, as in any industry, attack big problems that people are willing to pay lots of money to solve.<br/> Andrew 'Andy' Manoske is an Associate at GGV Capital, a Sand Hill and Shanghai-based venture capital firm.
