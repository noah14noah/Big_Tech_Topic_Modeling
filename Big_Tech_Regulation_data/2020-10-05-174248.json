The signs were visible for quite some time, yet the recent slowdown in the market still blindsided a lot of people, rapidly changing the financial status of thousands within the course of a few months. Amidst this chaos, an all-digital platform tries to bring simplicity and security to clients who are in desperate need of both. We are talking about Lendbox, a peer-to-peer crowdfunding platform that promises to directly connect lenders and borrowers, without any institutional interference. We found out more about this platform by speaking with Bhuvan Rastogi, co-founder &amp; COO of the company, who we caught up with at a recent TedX event at Ansal University. He explained, how his post-MBA stint in the Mumbai investment banking market led him to recognise the massive need for smaller sized loans. It was a conversation with a flatmate that led to the germination of an idea, which turned into a startup that has in the past 4 years spread to over 95 per cent cities and towns in the country.</p><p>When asked about the reason for the popularity of this platform, Bhuvan said, \"India is a highly financed nation and there is a massive need for smaller size loans, yet a lot of people don't have access to finance. With our platform, we are addressing a market need and creating some sort of impact for people who were looking for finance for either a small business or medical treatment or getting a relative married.\" While it was obvious why the people that want loans are interested in the product, there was still a curiosity about what made the lenders trust the platform. Bhuvan explained, \"We have a very strict borrower verification process. The bank will only look at your financials, but we also do a proper character assessment. This helps us avoid risk cases, and offer a higher rate of return than traditional investments. We can give around 15-20 per cent net rate of return, which is great for lenders.\"</p><p>In traditional financial institutions, this type of in-depth verification takes weeks, if not months. But the people at Lendbox bypass all that by making it all 100 per cent online. \"You can fill the form, link your social media, upload your bank statements and salary slips, and even submit your KYC documents among other things. We digitally verify the documents, and there is no paperwork involved, so even the funding process is digital. We only do physical verification if there is any doubt in the borrower's profile.\"</p><p>Creating this type of system requires a lot of work and planning, since the company has to adhere to all the RBI regulations regarding databases, physical access to servers and everything else. The company also employs 256-bit SSL encryption for everything, since there is an ever-present risk of hacking and identity theft in any financial interaction done online. Bhuvan gives us an idea of the levels of security measures in place to make sure all data is safe, all the time. \"We make sure the data is always secure. Even our internal team can't access all of our documents. We use Amazon Web Services, and they also have a very high level of security for all the servers. In addition to all the checks that we do, we also have an algorithm which reads email access information; we verify from where the mail is accessed and how often it is accessed. We also see if the linked bank account has a history or not. If you submit salary slips, you also have to send an email from your official email address. So there are lots of different levels of checks involved, and if there is a doubt in any of them we do a physical verification. We put all of these measures in place, way in advance, so we don't have to worry about scenarios such as this.\"</p><p>This level of dedication seems to be paying off, as the company has released over 50 crores in the past 4 years, with dreams of growing even further. The long term plan is to expand the product into other developing regions as well, such as South East Asia, Africa and Latin America. They can do this thanks to an all-digital interface, as well as the use of machine learning and AI in the algorithms. We asked Bhuvan about his vision towards scaling, and he said, \"For us, the best way to scale is to improve our technologies and make as many automated systems as we can. The more manual intervention there is, the slower the system will be. So, we have a team of around 45 people already, but only one office. We can scale as much as possible as long as we have the digital capacity and security in place. Right now, we can handle 20,000 users at any given time, and we are looking forward to increase that. But it will be a measured growth since we have to account for stability and security. If Facebook or Twitter crash, you can still deal with it, but when it comes to a financial product, you can't take that chance.\" This is certainly a sensible and stable approach towards scaling, which might just help them become the next big tech unicorn for the masses.</p><p>The Bank Will Only Look at Your Financials, But We Also Perform a Proper Character Assessment.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TRNRPR-0052021008</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TRNRPR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YP4-D4F1-DXMP-K53J-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">465002</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"893\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TCG Media Limited, distributed by Contify.com All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>TransREporter</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"31\" month=\"12\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>December 31, 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp; Journals</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000551</classCode><className>ECONOMIC NEWS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001457</classCode><className>RECESSION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001581</classCode><className>SMALL BUSINESS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DDUH</classCode><className>CROWDFUNDING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>ST000D178</classCode><className>CROWDSOURCING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>ST000D0VJ</classCode><className>SOCIAL MEDIA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>N520000CC</classCode><className>BANKING &amp; FINANCE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N523110EC</classCode><className>INVESTMENT BANKING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009RX6</classCode><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>ST000D0VJ</classCode><className>SOCIAL MEDIA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GX143</classCode><className>MUMBAI, MAHARASHTRA, INDIA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GC304</classCode><className>INDIA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

Symbole de cette d\u00e9marche : la mission \" pilote \" annonc\u00e9e en novembre \u00a02018 avec Facebook. Le groupe a re\u00e7u des repr\u00e9sentants des r\u00e9gulateurs fran\u00e7ais et leur a expos\u00e9 ses m\u00e9thodes de mod\u00e9ration des contenus haineux. Leur rapport est attendu ce 10 \u00a0mai.</p><p>Vives batailles de lobbying</p><p>Si les entreprises comme Google ou Facebook saluaient ce nouvel interlocuteur, depuis, quelques nuages ont assombri le tableau. L'annonce, d\u00e8s f\u00e9vrier, de la proposition de loi de r\u00e9gulation des contenus haineux a cr\u00e9\u00e9 un point de tension avec les grandes plates-formes. Ce texte, d\u00e9pos\u00e9 en mars par la d\u00e9put\u00e9e de Paris Laetitia Avia (La R\u00e9publique en marche), n'\u00e9tait pas pr\u00e9vu au moment de la mise en place du groupe de r\u00e9gulateurs, reconna\u00eet-on chez Facebook, tout en assurant que le dialogue a toujours \u00e9t\u00e9 bon avec le gouvernement.</p><p>En fait, M. \u00a0Macron a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 d'acc\u00e9l\u00e9rer, face \u00e0 l'\u00e9motion suscit\u00e9e par la recrudescence de l'antis\u00e9mitisme. \" Nous devons nous inspirer de ce que nos voisins allemands ont su faire de mani\u00e8re efficace et pragmatique \", avait-il dit, lors du d\u00eener du Conseil repr\u00e9sentatif des institutions juives de France (CRIF).</p><p>Or, la loi allemande, qui</p><p>contraint les plates-formes \u00e0 supprimer les contenus haineux en vingt-quatre heures sous peine de fortes amendes, \u00e9tait d\u00e9crite comme un exemple r\u00e9pressif que le gouvernement et Facebook cherchaient justement \u00e0 \u00a0\u00e9viter en collaborant. Le r\u00e9seau social y voit un m\u00e9canisme qui pousse \u00e0 censurer des contenus l\u00e9gaux. Et il juge les montants des sanctions pr\u00e9vus dans la loi Avia \u2013 jusqu'\u00e0 4 \u00a0% du chiffre d'affaires mondial \u2013 excessifs.</p><p>D'autres dossiers ont suscit\u00e9 de vives batailles de lobbying : sans surprise, la \" taxe GAFA \" que la France a tent\u00e9 d'imposer aux plates-formes en Europe, avant de faire voter, en avril, un texte en France. Mais aussi la directive sur le droit d'auteur, qui impose \u00e0 Facebook ou \u00e0 \u00a0YouTube (filiale de Google) de passer des accords avec les ayants droit des oeuvres et de n\u00e9gocier un droit voisin avec les entreprises de presse.</p><p>A l'approche des europ\u00e9ennes, M. \u00a0Macron est dans une position moins forte qu'il y a un an, notamment en raison de la crise des \" gilets jaunes \".Et l'ex\u00e9cutif estime que la demande de justice de ce mouvement s'est, en partie, cristallis\u00e9e sur les grandes entreprises am\u00e9ricaines du num\u00e9rique.</p><p>D'o\u00f9 cette volont\u00e9 de fermet\u00e9, qui n'a pas \u00e9chapp\u00e9 \u00e0 Google ou \u00e0 \u00a0Facebook. Dans sa tribune pour une \" renaissance europ\u00e9enne \", d\u00e9but mars, M. \u00a0Macron promet ainsi de \" r\u00e9guler les g\u00e9ants du num\u00e9rique, en cr\u00e9ant une supervision europ\u00e9enne des grandes plates-formes (sanction acc\u00e9l\u00e9r\u00e9e des atteintes \u00e0 la concurrence, transparence de leurs algorithmes\u2026) \".</p><p>M. \u00a0Zuckerberg n'est pas non plus en meilleure posture : il reste poursuivi par les pol\u00e9miques, comme celle de la diffusion sur Facebook d'images de la tuerie de Christchurch (Nouvelle-Z\u00e9lande), et il est menac\u00e9 de sanctions comme l'amende record attendue du r\u00e9gulateur am\u00e9ricain du commerce. Derri\u00e8re les sourires, des crispations se font sentir, m\u00eame si, pour l'instant, l'int\u00e9r\u00eat des grandes plates-formes et d'Emmanuel Macron \u00e0 collaborer demeure.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MONDE-1352494</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MONDE2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W2Y-PT91-DY7V-P0NB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299258</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"746\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Le Monde Interactif Tous Droits R\u00e9serv\u00e9s</copyright><publicationName>Le Monde</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"19300\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"05\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>11 mai 2019 samedi</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Journal</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>FRENCH</className></classificationItem><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.native\"><className>FRAN\u00c7AIS</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Une fa\u00e7on de tenter de se d\u00e9marquer de ses pr\u00e9d\u00e9cesseurs comme Fran\u00e7ois Hollande ou Nicolas Sarkozy et de profiter du rafra\u00eechissement des relations entre la \u00abbig tech\u00bb et le pr\u00e9sident am\u00e9ricain, Donald Trump.</p><p>Ce jour-l\u00e0, M.Macron avait r\u00e9sum\u00e9 sa doctrine vis-\u00e0-vis des g\u00e9ants du num\u00e9rique: leur tendre la main mais, \u00aben m\u00eame temps\u00bb, les inciter \u00e0 accepter une r\u00e9gulation. Symbole de cette d\u00e9marche: la mission \u00abpilote\u00bb annonc\u00e9e en novembre2018 avec Facebook. Le groupe a re\u00e7u des repr\u00e9sentants des r\u00e9gulateurs fran\u00e7ais et leur a expos\u00e9 ses m\u00e9thodes de mod\u00e9ration des contenus haineux. Leur rapport est attendu ce 10mai.</p><p> Vives batailles de lobbying </p><p>Si les entreprises comme Google ou Facebook saluaient ce nouvel interlocuteur, depuis, quelques nuages ont assombri le tableau. L'annonce, d\u00e8s f\u00e9vrier, de la proposition de loi de r\u00e9gulation des contenus haineux a cr\u00e9\u00e9 un point de tension avec les grandes plates-formes. Ce texte, d\u00e9pos\u00e9 en mars par la d\u00e9put\u00e9e de Paris Laetitia Avia (La R\u00e9publique en marche), n'\u00e9tait pas pr\u00e9vu au moment de la mise en place du groupe de r\u00e9gulateurs, reconna\u00eet-on chez Facebook, tout en assurant que le dialogue a toujours \u00e9t\u00e9 bon avec le gouvernement.</p><p>En fait, M.Macron a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 d'acc\u00e9l\u00e9rer, face \u00e0 l'\u00e9motion suscit\u00e9e par la recrudescence de l'antis\u00e9mitisme sur Internet et en dehors. \u00abNous devons nous inspirer de ce que nos voisins allemands ont su faire de mani\u00e8re efficace et pragmatique\u00bb, avait-il dit, lors du d\u00eener du Conseil repr\u00e9sentatif des institutions juives de France (CRIF).</p><p>Or, la loi allemande, qui contraint les plates-formes \u00e0 supprimer les contenus haineux en vingt-quatre heures sous peine de fortes amendes, \u00e9tait quelques mois plus t\u00f4t d\u00e9crite comme un exemple r\u00e9pressif que le gouvernement et Facebook cherchaient justement \u00e0\u00e9viter en collaborant. Le r\u00e9seau social y voit, en effet, un m\u00e9canisme qui pousse \u00e0 censurer des contenus l\u00e9gaux. Et il juge les montants des sanctions pr\u00e9vus dans la loi Avia - jusqu'\u00e0 4% du chiffre d'affaires mondial - excessifs.</p><p>D'autres dossiers ont suscit\u00e9 de vives batailles de lobbying: sans surprise, la \u00abtaxe GAFA\u00bb que la France a tent\u00e9 d'imposer aux plates-formes en Europe, avant de faire voter, en avril, un texte en France. Mais aussi la directive sur le droit d'auteur, qui impose \u00e0 Facebook ou \u00e0YouTube (filiale de Google) de passer des accords avec les ayants droit des oeuvres et de n\u00e9gocier un droit voisin avec les entreprises de presse.</p><p> Volont\u00e9 de fermet\u00e9 </p><p>A l'approche des \u00e9lections europ\u00e9ennes, M.Macron est dans une position moins forte qu'il y a un an, notamment en raison de la crise des \u00abgilets jaunes\u00bb. Et l'ex\u00e9cutif estime que la demande de justice exprim\u00e9e par ce mouvement s'est, en partie, cristallis\u00e9e sur les grandes entreprises am\u00e9ricaines du num\u00e9rique.</p><p>D'o\u00f9 cette volont\u00e9 de fermet\u00e9, qui n'a pas \u00e9chapp\u00e9 \u00e0 Google ou \u00e0Facebook. Dans sa tribune pour une \u00abrenaissance europ\u00e9enne\u00bb, d\u00e9but mars, M.Macron promet ainsi de \u00abr\u00e9guler les g\u00e9ants du num\u00e9rique, en cr\u00e9ant une supervision europ\u00e9enne des grandes plates-formes (sanction acc\u00e9l\u00e9r\u00e9e des atteintes \u00e0 la concurrence, transparence de leurs algorithmes\u2026)\u00bb.</p><p>M.Zuckerberg n'est pas non plus en meilleure posture: il reste poursuivi par les pol\u00e9miques, comme celle de la diffusion sur Facebook d'images de la tuerie de Christchurch (Nouvelle-Z\u00e9lande), et il est menac\u00e9 de sanctions comme l'amende record attendue du r\u00e9gulateur am\u00e9ricain du commerce, la Federal Trade Commission. Derri\u00e8re les sourires, des crispations se font donc sentir, m\u00eame si, pour l'instant, l'int\u00e9r\u00eat des grandes plates-formes et d'Emmanuel Macron \u00e0 collaborer demeure.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">LMONDF-5460265</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">LMONDF2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W2Y-PTP1-F0K7-80NX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">322025</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"760\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Le Monde Tous droits r\u00e9serv\u00e9s</copyright><publicationName>Le Monde.fr</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"48604\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"05\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>Vendredi 10 Mai 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Publication internet</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>FRENCH</className></classificationItem><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.native\"><className>FRAN\u00c7AIS</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

It is a useful reminder at a time when the world seems dystopian: China running re-education camps, Russia crushing civil-society groups, Britain ripping up international alliances and the American president resisting facts.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">David McCourt believes in inexorable progress. He sees the modern world as one where centralised hierarchies--be they governmental or business--must compete against the power of decentralised groups. He presents this view in \"Total Rethink\" (Wiley, 2019), which traces his career as a tech and media entrepreneur in which he's shaken up industries and won an Emmy Award in 2005. The Economist called him \"a telecoms revolutionary\" in a profile in 1998.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As part of The Economist's Open Future initiative, we questioned Mr McCourt's optimistic ideas. It is followed by an excerpt from his book, on why the current moment calls for leaders who are entrepreneurial; in fact, revolutionary.</p><p>* * *</p><p>The Economist: You argue that power is shifting from institutions to individuals and from centralised organisations to decentralised systems. But when you look at Russia, China, Turkey and elsewhere, traditional power structures look stronger than ever. What makes you optimistic that a \"power shift\" is taking place?</p><p>David McCourt: Autocratic, top-down leaders like Putin, Xi and Erdogan may look like a return to stronger, top-down management, but it is a \"dead cat bounce,\" as the investing expression goes. That is to say, even something without life might still show a glimmer of movement. The bottom-up revolution is still happening, even if some top-down people are in power.</p><p>Authoritarian governments may put a virtual dam around the flow of information into their countries, but like water, information will find a way around it. There's always some unknown woman or man working on a laptop who is able to poke holes through that virtual dam. Data-powered globalisation is now an organic force that cannot be stopped--and can lead to sudden eruptions, as in the Arab Spring, or what we are seeing now in Hong Kong and in Russia.</p><p>The Economist: There was a view in the 1990s that the net was inherently democratising. Now people feel that tech platforms are a cause of many of society's problems. What is the role of regulation in this environment?</p><p>Mr McCourt: There's no denying that we have problems with the tech giants, who have developed faster than regulation has kept up. While they were founded with the right intentions, many of those ideals about democracy and transparency are long gone. We need to give citizens \"portability rights\" over their data, giving ownership, trust and freedom back to individuals. I'm proud to have played my part in getting the telecoms sector to accept the same idea with phone-number portability years ago.</p><p>True, regulated, data portability would force the big tech platforms--Facebook and Google especially--to stop treating us like they own us, and to offer even more innovative and user-friendly services. It would spark real competition that would benefit everyone.</p><p>The Economist: Your book calls for an entrepreneurial mindset in society. But most organisations prefer constancy, not change. Those two things are in tension. So what would you counsel an ambitious, young person to do: beat their head against a wall trying to be a revolutionary in their institution (be it a company, government, charity, etc) or just join a startup?</p><p>Mr McCourt: The book is about individuals who want to change the way they think: being more open-minded, processing information in a different way, assessing and solving problems in new ways. That's what entrepreneurial thinking means. I'm looking at radical rather than incremental change; not operating within the status quo. Society is full of educational and healthcare organisations, state institutions and informal networks that push you to think the same way.  </p><p>I agree most organisations want consistency--that's how they survived in the old world. But it is now a new world. In the old world order, revolutionary thinking got you nothing but arrows in your back. That's not the case today, because these old institutions are seeing their markets erode, their customers jump ship, and new entrants take their place. Young, ambitious people do not have to bang their heads against the wall any longer: their time has come. The old institutions are desperately looking for solutions, and good organisations are open to new ideas.</p><p>The Economist: One of your business mentors was Jack Welch, the iconic and controversial former boss of GE. What did he teach you?</p><p>Mr McCourt: Jack Welch was extremely hard-headed and taught me how to be focused and grow a business. But he believed in forcing incremental change, whereas I'm an apostle of disruption. Disruption is what I did in the telecoms sector. But I took from him the importance of repeating your mission to employees a thousand times, pile-driving the message home. And when it comes to new projects, only use your best people--not whoever is available. He was also big on separating the \"strategy stuff\" from the nuts-and-bolts of operations. I liked that.</p><p>The Economist: If power has indeed shifted, what do today's political and business leaders--steeped in the old paradigm--need to know to succeed in the new environment?</p><p>Mr McCourt: If you lead now, you have to listen. And you've got to talk to people at the level at which people consume information, without succumbing to soundbites. You have to be transparently-free of bullshit. Look at Michelle Obama: if she ran for office in America she would immediately connect because she already has that reputation for being open and honest, hard-working, empowering and respectful.</p><p>Those are the qualities that are necessary. The power-shift taking place will abolish the power of divisiveness. It requires leaders to be inclusive, collaborative, ready to empower people from the bottom and to embrace and promote diversity. Unfortunately, we don't seem to see these traits from the current American president, but they are undoubtedly the key ingredients if we are to see progress in society.</p><p>* * * </p><p>Leadership in technology and societyFrom \"Total Rethink: Why Entrepreneurs Should Act Like Revolutionaries\" by David McCourt (Wiley, 2019).</p><p>Most of us, whether we are business people or political leaders, doctors or teachers, students or parents, live in the present and try to work toward the future one day at a time, taking tiny cautious steps, improving things incrementally. It's been a survival technique the human race has used throughout our evolution, but it may not be enough to save us from the dangers that lie ahead in the near future, and it may also mean that we, both as individuals and as a society, are going to miss the enormous opportunities that technological progress is making possible.</p><p>It is time for us to be bold, to be revolutionary, and to change the way we do things.</p><p>Other forces, some of them constructive, some of them destructive, are now moving too fast for us to keep up with if we continue with the old ways of thinking and acting. There needs to be not one revolution, but many, in both the ways that we think and the ways that we do things if we are going to be successful as individuals and if we are going to improve the lives of the majority of the people on this planet. Positive revolutions could also avert the potential conflicts which are brewing between those of us whose lives are getting better every day and those of us who are being left further and further behind by the increasing speed of progress.</p><p>It's easy to illustrate how this widening of the gap can come about. If you watch an elderly steam train making its way out of a station in India, you will see that it is heavily laden with people. They are clinging to the outsides and squatting on the roofs, as well as filling every carriage to capacity. It would seem obvious that there is a need for some improvement in the services being offered to the population. Now, India's prime minister has commissioned a Japanese company to build the country's first high-speed railway between Mumbai and Ahmedabad in the west. These trains will have top speeds of 200 miles an hour, far too fast for anyone to hope that they can travel by sitting on the roof, and are indicative of how fast India is developing.</p><p>It would obviously be a sign of progress to be able to eventually replace all that elderly rolling stock with such sleek high-speed trains. It would be far more comfortable and efficient for those who can afford to buy tickets and sit inside in air-conditioned comfort, but entirely unattainable to the crowds of poor who throng the stations in the hope of hitching a cheap or free ride. All they will be able to do is stand back and watch as the future shoots past them.</p><p>No one would deny that the creation of a high-speed train that travels at hundreds of miles an hour is a wonderful thing, but at the same time it will increase the gap between those who can afford to travel on it and those who can't, improving the lives of one and making far worse the lives of the other. In other words, this leap forward, which would be a great thing for the country's economy and productivity, would inevitably widen the gap between the haves and the have-nots, so the model for traveling across India needs to be rethought and entirely revolutionized in a way that will improve the lives of all those thousands of people clinging to the outsides of the trains, to make their experience closer to that of the people who will be able to afford to buy tickets on the bullet train.</p><p>I don't have a solution for that particular problem, but it provides a vivid visual metaphor for the fact that every action inevitably has consequences, so we need to be thoughtful with every step we take, conscious of the effects improvements have on those at the bottom as well as those at the top.</p><p>Like those Japanese trains, civilization has progressed too far and is traveling too fast to be able to slow down now. If you want to be successful in any field at all, you can't rely on doing a bit better each year. Companies that increase their revenue by a few percentage points, individuals who marginally increase their earnings, inventors who make superficial improve- ments to their products, will not be the winners of the future. Simply being ambitious for success will not be enough either. We will all have to exercise enormous creativity and imagination in order to see and understand what is happening around us and work out new solutions to the problems that now face us, recognizing both the opportunities and the dangers ahead.</p><p>We need to dream big, but we also need to dream smart if we don't want the billions of people left behind on the platforms to rise up and attack the things they know they can never have and the people they know will always prosper at their expense.</p><p>We need to be bold and creative in everything we do. At a personal level, a cautious, conservative approach to risk and innovation may keep your career or business afloat for just long enough to support you and your family during your lifetime, but it will never change the world and it will never blast your personal achievements into any new stratospheres._____________</p><p>Excerpted from \"Total Rethink: Why Entrepreneurs Should Act Like Revolutionaries.\" Copyright \u00a9 2019 by David McCourt.

Unfortunately, that leaves out who will almost certainly be most impacted by all of this: the end users, as well as small startups and entrepreneurs. Many of you recognize the direct potential impact on you if your connections to certain content is stuck in the slow lane, but there's a much bigger impact out there in terms of how it will scare off or kill tons of new and powerful startups and innovations. Think about how many internet services you use regularly today. Consider how many of them didn't even exist five or ten years ago. How many of them have jumped up out of nowhere? Without a strong and open internet, realize how many future startups will never even come into existence, because the barriers and hurdles to starting a business become much, much higher. </p><p><br/> Here are two compelling stories of startups which, frankly, almost certainly wouldn't exist if the telcos get their wish for fast lanes and slow lanes. The first comes from Ryan Singel, a former reporter/editor at Wired, who left a few years ago to build his own company, Contextly. He recently filed some powerful comments with the FCC[1]. The FCC is receiving an influx of comments[2] (over 45,000 last I checked[3]) and that's even though the site was down for a while in the wake of John Oliver's plea[4] to online commenters to speak out against \"cable company fuckery.\" Not surprisingly, many of those comments are short (and angry) and simply state that the FCC should protect net neutrality and not give in to broadband providers' attempts to create a slow lane on the internet. <br/> While those comments are useful, it's the thoughtful, detailed comments like Singel's that are even more important, and moving, in terms of showing how this debate has a real and serious impact on innovation. Singel's startup, Contextly, tries to be the antidote to all of those crappy \"recommended content\" services that many news sites use to point you to \"other things you may be interested in\" on other sites, but always seem to actually consist of scantily clad women and bogus diet \"secrets\" because that's what pays the best. Instead, it focuses on keeping people on the sites they're already on, pointing them to related content on that site (similar to what we have beneath our stories here on Techdirt, though we built our own system for that). <br/> Singel eloquently lays out how Contextly almost certainly wouldn't exist under the FCC's proposal which would allow for \"commercially reasonable\" discrimination. Like many other startups, if there were a fast lane, we would have needed to be in it on day one. We provide content recommendations at the bottom of news stories. That means that every time a news story on one of our publishers is read, a request is made to our servers to get the right recommendations and we return them along with thumbnail images\u2014anywhere from 4 to 16 images per page. While these are individually not large, the bandwidth quickly adds up when you are serving hundreds of millions of images a month, and need to do so quickly to readers around the country and the world. It would not matter if the 'slow lane' was 'pretty fast.' What would matter was whether we could serve our clients as effectively as our competitors. Being unequal alone would put us at a disadvantage. <br/> We are able to manage these costs because the cost of technology and bandwidth has dropped massively, due to technology and competition. This has made it possible for a bootstrapped Contextly\u2014founded with the modest savings of a former journalist\u2014to compete with companies that have tens of millions of dollars in capital. <br/> [....] <br/> The FCC should not make it even harder to create a company by adopting its proposal to authorize 'commercially reasonable' discrimination rather than to forbid 'unreasonable discrimination.' ATT and Verizon have made it very clear they would like to extract tolls from online services such as Contextly. That's despite the fact that it's their customers who are requesting news stories from our publisher clients. Both Contextly and our publisher clients pay for our outgoing and incoming bandwidth to our hosting providers - but now the FCC proposes to let consumer Internet Service Providers extract fees on both sides of their networks. <br/> If this were the case before I started Contextly using my savings (which were not substantial), I would have never started the company. There's no way I could have afforded to pay Verizon and ATT and Comcast and Cox and Sprint and Time Warner Cable and AOL and T-Mobile to get Contextly images showing up quickly. Our competitors\u2014the ones who post ads to diet pills and 'hot' photos of fitness enthusiasts\u2014could have buried us just by paying for the fast lane\u2014without even needed exclusivity, which they could have negotiated under the Commission's proposal. Even the very idea of \"commercially reasonable\"[5] is somewhat offensive to innovation and enterpreneurship, because it's bureaucrat-speak for \"hire crazy expensive lawyers\" and argue over this for years. That is not a recipe for innovation: Hiring lawyers and negotiating complicated contracts is expensive. I incorporated Contextly myself to avoid significant legal fees and operated on handshake agreements with early customers. Negotiating performance agreements with ISPs would have required resources and skills I didn't possess (and still likely don't have). ISPs could have also asked for equity at a time where I'd have had no choice but to accept their terms\u2014since they control the pipes that get my clients' news and information to American citizens. My equity would not have been worth much at the time, so I would have had to give up much of my company, if not a majority, to get it off the ground. As Singel notes, \"commercially reasonable\" is not a standard for enterpreneurship and innovation. It's a standard for big companies to kill innovation: ...the factors of the commercial reasonableness test are too vague to provide certainty\u2014except for the certainty of expensive and time-consuming litigation if we choose to pursue it. These standards include 'harm to consumers' or 'to competition' and evaluation of a totality-of-the-circumstances. These standards are an invitation to hire dozens of expert witnesses and white shoe lawyers well versed in telecommunications, competition, and consumer law without sufficient guideposts. This standard has already failed to provide any guidance in the one other place it has been used--data roaming. <br/> .... Indeed, a 'commercial reasonableness' standard is a gift to the cable and phone companies who have armies of lawyers and can crush us in legal disputes at the FCC. The second story is a similar one, coming from Jamie Wilkinson, the founder and CEO of VHX, an online video distribution company that helps film and video makers make their videos directly available to fans. Since VHX is in the online video distribution industry, the fact that Netflix is suddenly having to cut deals with ISPs to avoid clogged pipes is of great concern[6]. As he notes, the fact that he might have to pay for access to a fast lane is already chilling his business, as investors are suddenly less willing to fund a startup like his, since they don't know how expensive it's going to be to have to pay off all the big broadband providers, just to offer the same video experience as Netflix or YouTube. //player.vimeo.com/video/95820027?title=0byline=0portrait=0color=ffffff[7] This chilling effect is very real and it's being felt by many startups already -- and hopefully more of them will start to speak out, like Singel and Wilkinson. <br/> What's most incredible to me is that out-of-touch politicians who insist they're out there \"supporting small business and innovation\" are often the most against net neutrality -- even though their position will kill off many small businesses and innovation. Frankly, I still don't quite understand how net neutrality became a partisan \"left vs. right\" issue. In the early days, after the term was first coined, it wasn't a partisan issue and there were some interesting discussions about what net neutrality meant and why it was important. However, somewhere in the mid-2000s, it suddenly became a \"Democratic\" issue, with \"Republicans\" being opposed to it, claiming it was \"regulating the internet.\" However, as we've discussed, the internet is already heavily regulated. The question on net neutrality isn't about regulating or not regulating the internet, but figuring out how[8] it will be regulated: will it be regulated in a way that allows for significant competition and innovation -- or will it be regulated to allow a few giant oligopolists to become gatekeepers to innovation. <br/> Considering that both Democrats and Republicans like to talk about how important innovation, small business and entrepreneurs are, it makes no sense for them to support plans that would actively harm innovation and small businesses -- and yet, that appears to be what many are doing. Obviously, much of this is because the big winners if net neutrality dies will be Comcast, ATT and Verizon -- three giant companies who also are huge political donors. But if Congress (and, for that matter, the FCC) are serious about supporting and encouraging entrepreneurship and innovation, they should be paying much more attention to what those startups are saying about how all of this impacts their business right now. <br/> And then the question is pretty straightforward: do they really support innovation, small business and entrepreneurship? Or do they support the big telcos looking to set up tollbooths to make innovation more expensive?<br/>Permalink[9] | Comments[10] | Email This Story[11]<br/> [1]: <url

Unfortunately, that leaves out who will almost certainly be most impacted by all of this: the end users, as well as small startups and entrepreneurs. Many of you recognize the direct potential impact on you if your connections to certain content is stuck in the slow lane, but there's a much bigger impact out there in terms of how it will scare off or kill tons of new and powerful startups and innovations. Think about how many internet services you use regularly today. Consider how many of them didn't even exist five or ten years ago. How many of them have jumped up out of nowhere? Without a strong and open internet, realize how many future startups will never even come into existence, because the barriers and hurdles to starting a business become much, much higher. </p><p><br/> Here are two compelling stories of startups which, frankly, almost certainly wouldn't exist if the telcos get their wish for fast lanes and slow lanes. The first comes from Ryan Singel, a former reporter/editor at Wired, who left a few years ago to build his own company, Contextly. He recently filed some powerful comments with the FCC[1]. The FCC is receiving an influx of comments[2] (over 45,000 last I checked[3]) and that's even though the site was down for a while in the wake of John Oliver's plea[4] to online commenters to speak out against \"cable company fuckery.\" Not surprisingly, many of those comments are short (and angry) and simply state that the FCC should protect net neutrality and not give in to broadband providers' attempts to create a slow lane on the internet. <br/> While those comments are useful, it's the thoughtful, detailed comments like Singel's that are even more important, and moving, in terms of showing how this debate has a real and serious impact on innovation. Singel's startup, Contextly, tries to be the antidote to all of those crappy \"recommended content\" services that many news sites use to point you to \"other things you may be interested in\" on other sites, but always seem to actually consist of scantily clad women and bogus diet \"secrets\" because that's what pays the best. Instead, it focuses on keeping people on the sites they're already on, pointing them to related content on that site (similar to what we have beneath our stories here on Techdirt, though we built our own system for that). <br/> Singel eloquently lays out how Contextly almost certainly wouldn't exist under the FCC's proposal which would allow for \"commercially reasonable\" discrimination. Like many other startups, if there were a fast lane, we would have needed to be in it on day one. We provide content recommendations at the bottom of news stories. That means that every time a news story on one of our publishers is read, a request is made to our servers to get the right recommendations and we return them along with thumbnail images anywhere from 4 to 16 images per page. While these are individually not large, the bandwidth quickly adds up when you are serving hundreds of millions of images a month, and need to do so quickly to readers around the country and the world. It would not matter if the 'slow lane' was 'pretty fast.' What would matter was whether we could serve our clients as effectively as our competitors. Being unequal alone would put us at a disadvantage. <br/> We are able to manage these costs because the cost of technology and bandwidth has dropped massively, due to technology and competition. This has made it possible for a bootstrapped Contextly founded with the modest savings of a former journalist to compete with companies that have tens of millions of dollars in capital. <br/> [....] <br/> The FCC should not make it even harder to create a company by adopting its proposal to authorize 'commercially reasonable' discrimination rather than to forbid 'unreasonable discrimination.' ATT and Verizon have made it very clear they would like to extract tolls from online services such as Contextly. That's despite the fact that it's their customers who are requesting news stories from our publisher clients. Both Contextly and our publisher clients pay for our outgoing and incoming bandwidth to our hosting providers - but now the FCC proposes to let consumer Internet Service Providers extract fees on both sides of their networks. <br/> If this were the case before I started Contextly using my savings (which were not substantial), I would have never started the company. There's no way I could have afforded to pay Verizon and ATT and Comcast and Cox and Sprint and Time Warner Cable and AOL and T-Mobile to get Contextly images showing up quickly. Our competitors the ones who post ads to diet pills and 'hot' photos of fitness enthusiasts could have buried us just by paying for the fast lane without even needed exclusivity, which they could have negotiated under the Commission's proposal. Even the very idea of \"commercially reasonable\"[5] is somewhat offensive to innovation and enterpreneurship, because it's bureaucrat-speak for \"hire crazy expensive lawyers\" and argue over this for years. That is not a recipe for innovation: Hiring lawyers and negotiating complicated contracts is expensive. I incorporated Contextly myself to avoid significant legal fees and operated on handshake agreements with early customers. Negotiating performance agreements with ISPs would have required resources and skills I didn't possess (and still likely don't have). ISPs could have also asked for equity at a time where I'd have had no choice but to accept their terms since they control the pipes that get my clients' news and information to American citizens. My equity would not have been worth much at the time, so I would have had to give up much of my company, if not a majority, to get it off the ground. As Singel notes, \"commercially reasonable\" is not a standard for enterpreneurship and innovation. It's a standard for big companies to kill innovation: ...the factors of the commercial reasonableness test are too vague to provide certainty except for the certainty of expensive and time-consuming litigation if we choose to pursue it. These standards include 'harm to consumers' or 'to competition' and evaluation of a totality-of-the-circumstances. These standards are an invitation to hire dozens of expert witnesses and white shoe lawyers well versed in telecommunications, competition, and consumer law without sufficient guideposts. This standard has already failed to provide any guidance in the one other place it has been used--data roaming. <br/> .... Indeed, a 'commercial reasonableness' standard is a gift to the cable and phone companies who have armies of lawyers and can crush us in legal disputes at the FCC. The second story is a similar one, coming from Jamie Wilkinson, the founder and CEO of VHX, an online video distribution company that helps film and video makers make their videos directly available to fans. Since VHX is in the online video distribution industry, the fact that Netflix is suddenly having to cut deals with ISPs to avoid clogged pipes is of great concern[6]. As he notes, the fact that he might have to pay for access to a fast lane is already chilling his business, as investors are suddenly less willing to fund a startup like his, since they don't know how expensive it's going to be to have to pay off all the big broadband providers, just to offer the same video experience as Netflix or YouTube. //player.vimeo.com/video/95820027?title=0byline=0portrait=0color=ffffff[7] This chilling effect is very real and it's being felt by many startups already -- and hopefully more of them will start to speak out, like Singel and Wilkinson. <br/> What's most incredible to me is that out-of-touch politicians who insist they're out there \"supporting small business and innovation\" are often the most against net neutrality -- even though their position will kill off many small businesses and innovation. Frankly, I still don't quite understand how net neutrality became a partisan \"left vs. right\" issue. In the early days, after the term was first coined, it wasn't a partisan issue and there were some interesting discussions about what net neutrality meant and why it was important. However, somewhere in the mid-2000s, it suddenly became a \"Democratic\" issue, with \"Republicans\" being opposed to it, claiming it was \"regulating the internet.\" However, as we've discussed, the internet is already heavily regulated. The question on net neutrality isn't about regulating or not regulating the internet, but figuring out how[8] it will be regulated: will it be regulated in a way that allows for significant competition and innovation -- or will it be regulated to allow a few giant oligopolists to become gatekeepers to innovation. <br/> Considering that both Democrats and Republicans like to talk about how important innovation, small business and entrepreneurs are, it makes no sense for them to support plans that would actively harm innovation and small businesses -- and yet, that appears to be what many are doing. Obviously, much of this is because the big winners if net neutrality dies will be Comcast, ATT and Verizon -- three giant companies who also are huge political donors. But if Congress (and, for that matter, the FCC) are serious about supporting and encouraging entrepreneurship and innovation, they should be paying much more attention to what those startups are saying about how all of this impacts their business right now. <br/> And then the question is pretty straightforward: do they really support innovation, small business and entrepreneurship? Or do they support the big telcos looking to set up tollbooths to make innovation more expensive?<br/>Permalink[9] | Comments[10] | Email This Story[11]<br/> [1]: <url

Unfortunately, that leaves out who will almost certainly be most impacted by all of this: the end users, as well as small startups and entrepreneurs. Many of you recognize the direct potential impact on you if your connections to certain content is stuck in the slow lane, but there's a much bigger impact out there in terms of how it will scare off or kill tons of new and powerful startups and innovations. Think about how many internet services you use regularly today. Consider how many of them didn't even exist five or ten years ago. How many of them have jumped up out of nowhere? Without a strong and open internet, realize how many future startups will never even come into existence, because the barriers and hurdles to starting a business become much, much higher. </p><p><br/> Here are two compelling stories of startups which, frankly, almost certainly wouldn't exist if the telcos get their wish for fast lanes and slow lanes. The first comes from Ryan Singel, a former reporter/editor at Wired, who left a few years ago to build his own company, Contextly. He recently filed some powerful comments with the FCC[1]. The FCC is receiving an influx of comments[2] (over 45,000 last I checked[3]) and that's even though the site was down for a while in the wake of John Oliver's plea[4] to online commenters to speak out against \"cable company fuckery.\" Not surprisingly, many of those comments are short (and angry) and simply state that the FCC should protect net neutrality and not give in to broadband providers' attempts to create a slow lane on the internet. <br/> While those comments are useful, it's the thoughtful, detailed comments like Singel's that are even more important, and moving, in terms of showing how this debate has a real and serious impact on innovation. Singel's startup, Contextly, tries to be the antidote to all of those crappy \"recommended content\" services that many news sites use to point you to \"other things you may be interested in\" on other sites, but always seem to actually consist of scantily clad women and bogus diet \"secrets\" because that's what pays the best. Instead, it focuses on keeping people on the sites they're already on, pointing them to related content on that site (similar to what we have beneath our stories here on Techdirt, though we built our own system for that). <br/> Singel eloquently lays out how Contextly almost certainly wouldn't exist under the FCC's proposal which would allow for \"commercially reasonable\" discrimination. Like many other startups, if there were a fast lane, we would have needed to be in it on day one. We provide content recommendations at the bottom of news stories. That means that every time a news story on one of our publishers is read, a request is made to our servers to get the right recommendations and we return them along with thumbnail images anywhere from 4 to 16 images per page. While these are individually not large, the bandwidth quickly adds up when you are serving hundreds of millions of images a month, and need to do so quickly to readers around the country and the world. It would not matter if the 'slow lane' was 'pretty fast.' What would matter was whether we could serve our clients as effectively as our competitors. Being unequal alone would put us at a disadvantage. <br/> We are able to manage these costs because the cost of technology and bandwidth has dropped massively, due to technology and competition. This has made it possible for a bootstrapped Contextly founded with the modest savings of a former journalist to compete with companies that have tens of millions of dollars in capital. <br/> [....] <br/> The FCC should not make it even harder to create a company by adopting its proposal to authorize 'commercially reasonable' discrimination rather than to forbid 'unreasonable discrimination.' ATT and Verizon have made it very clear they would like to extract tolls from online services such as Contextly. That's despite the fact that it's their customers who are requesting news stories from our publisher clients. Both Contextly and our publisher clients pay for our outgoing and incoming bandwidth to our hosting providers - but now the FCC proposes to let consumer Internet Service Providers extract fees on both sides of their networks. <br/> If this were the case before I started Contextly using my savings (which were not substantial), I would have never started the company. There's no way I could have afforded to pay Verizon and ATT and Comcast and Cox and Sprint and Time Warner Cable and AOL and T-Mobile to get Contextly images showing up quickly. Our competitors the ones who post ads to diet pills and 'hot' photos of fitness enthusiasts could have buried us just by paying for the fast lane without even needed exclusivity, which they could have negotiated under the Commission's proposal. Even the very idea of \"commercially reasonable\"[5] is somewhat offensive to innovation and enterpreneurship, because it's bureaucrat-speak for \"hire crazy expensive lawyers\" and argue over this for years. That is not a recipe for innovation: Hiring lawyers and negotiating complicated contracts is expensive. I incorporated Contextly myself to avoid significant legal fees and operated on handshake agreements with early customers. Negotiating performance agreements with ISPs would have required resources and skills I didn't possess (and still likely don't have). ISPs could have also asked for equity at a time where I'd have had no choice but to accept their terms since they control the pipes that get my clients' news and information to American citizens. My equity would not have been worth much at the time, so I would have had to give up much of my company, if not a majority, to get it off the ground. As Singel notes, \"commercially reasonable\" is not a standard for enterpreneurship and innovation. It's a standard for big companies to kill innovation: ...the factors of the commercial reasonableness test are too vague to provide certainty except for the certainty of expensive and time-consuming litigation if we choose to pursue it. These standards include 'harm to consumers' or 'to competition' and evaluation of a totality-of-the-circumstances. These standards are an invitation to hire dozens of expert witnesses and white shoe lawyers well versed in telecommunications, competition, and consumer law without sufficient guideposts. This standard has already failed to provide any guidance in the one other place it has been used--data roaming. <br/> .... Indeed, a 'commercial reasonableness' standard is a gift to the cable and phone companies who have armies of lawyers and can crush us in legal disputes at the FCC. The second story is a similar one, coming from Jamie Wilkinson, the founder and CEO of VHX, an online video distribution company that helps film and video makers make their videos directly available to fans. Since VHX is in the online video distribution industry, the fact that Netflix is suddenly having to cut deals with ISPs to avoid clogged pipes is of great concern[6]. As he notes, the fact that he might have to pay for access to a fast lane is already chilling his business, as investors are suddenly less willing to fund a startup like his, since they don't know how expensive it's going to be to have to pay off all the big broadband providers, just to offer the same video experience as Netflix or YouTube. //player.vimeo.com/video/95820027?title=0byline=0portrait=0color=ffffff[7] This chilling effect is very real and it's being felt by many startups already -- and hopefully more of them will start to speak out, like Singel and Wilkinson. <br/> What's most incredible to me is that out-of-touch politicians who insist they're out there \"supporting small business and innovation\" are often the most against net neutrality -- even though their position will kill off many small businesses and innovation. Frankly, I still don't quite understand how net neutrality became a partisan \"left vs. right\" issue. In the early days, after the term was first coined, it wasn't a partisan issue and there were some interesting discussions about what net neutrality meant and why it was important. However, somewhere in the mid-2000s, it suddenly became a \"Democratic\" issue, with \"Republicans\" being opposed to it, claiming it was \"regulating the internet.\" However, as we've discussed, the internet is already heavily regulated. The question on net neutrality isn't about regulating or not regulating the internet, but figuring out how[8] it will be regulated: will it be regulated in a way that allows for significant competition and innovation -- or will it be regulated to allow a few giant oligopolists to become gatekeepers to innovation. <br/> Considering that both Democrats and Republicans like to talk about how important innovation, small business and entrepreneurs are, it makes no sense for them to support plans that would actively harm innovation and small businesses -- and yet, that appears to be what many are doing. Obviously, much of this is because the big winners if net neutrality dies will be Comcast, ATT and Verizon -- three giant companies who also are huge political donors. But if Congress (and, for that matter, the FCC) are serious about supporting and encouraging entrepreneurship and innovation, they should be paying much more attention to what those startups are saying about how all of this impacts their business right now. <br/> And then the question is pretty straightforward: do they really support innovation, small business and entrepreneurship? Or do they support the big telcos looking to set up tollbooths to make innovation more expensive?<br/>Permalink[9] | Comments[10] | Email This Story[11]<br/> [1]: <url

Even the very idea of \"commercially reasonable\"[5] is somewhat offensive to innovation and enterpreneurship, because it's bureaucrat-speak for \"hire crazy expensive lawyers\" and argue over this for years. That is not a recipe for innovation: Hiring lawyers and negotiating complicated contracts is expensive. I incorporated Contextly myself to avoid significant legal fees and operated on handshake agreements with early customers. Negotiating performance agreements with ISPs would have required resources and skills I didn't possess (and still likely don't have). ISPs could have also asked for equity at a time where I'd have had no choice but to accept their terms\u2014since they control the pipes that get my clients' news and information to American citizens. My equity would not have been worth much at the time, so I would have had to give up much of my company, if not a majority, to get it off the ground. As Singel notes, \"commercially reasonable\" is not a standard for enterpreneurship and innovation. It's a standard for big companies to kill innovation: ...the factors of the commercial reasonableness test are too vague to provide certainty\u2014except for the certainty of expensive and time-consuming litigation if we choose to pursue it. These standards include 'harm to consumers' or 'to competition' and evaluation of a totality-of-the-circumstances. These standards are an invitation to hire dozens of expert witnesses and white shoe lawyers well versed in telecommunications, competition, and consumer law without sufficient guideposts. This standard has already failed to provide any guidance in the one other place it has been used--data roaming. <br/> .... Indeed, a 'commercial reasonableness' standard is a gift to the cable and phone companies who have armies of lawyers and can crush us in legal disputes at the FCC. The second story is a similar one, coming from Jamie Wilkinson, the founder and CEO of VHX, an online video distribution company that helps film and video makers make their videos directly available to fans. Since VHX is in the online video distribution industry, the fact that Netflix is suddenly having to cut deals with ISPs to avoid clogged pipes is of great concern[6]. As he notes, the fact that he might have to pay for access to a fast lane is already chilling his business, as investors are suddenly less willing to fund a startup like his, since they don't know how expensive it's going to be to have to pay off all the big broadband providers, just to offer the same video experience as Netflix or YouTube. //player.vimeo.com/video/95820027?title=0byline=0portrait=0color=ffffff[7] This chilling effect is very real and it's being felt by many startups already -- and hopefully more of them will start to speak out, like Singel and Wilkinson. <br/> What's most incredible to me is that out-of-touch politicians who insist they're out there \"supporting small business and innovation\" are often the most against net neutrality -- even though their position will kill off many small businesses and innovation. Frankly, I still don't quite understand how net neutrality became a partisan \"left vs. right\" issue. In the early days, after the term was first coined, it wasn't a partisan issue and there were some interesting discussions about what net neutrality meant and why it was important. However, somewhere in the mid-2000s, it suddenly became a \"Democratic\" issue, with \"Republicans\" being opposed to it, claiming it was \"regulating the internet.\" However, as we've discussed, the internet is already heavily regulated. The question on net neutrality isn't about regulating or not regulating the internet, but figuring out how[8] it will be regulated: will it be regulated in a way that allows for significant competition and innovation -- or will it be regulated to allow a few giant oligopolists to become gatekeepers to innovation. <br/> Considering that both Democrats and Republicans like to talk about how important innovation, small business and entrepreneurs are, it makes no sense for them to support plans that would actively harm innovation and small businesses -- and yet, that appears to be what many are doing. Obviously, much of this is because the big winners if net neutrality dies will be Comcast, ATT and Verizon -- three giant companies who also are huge political donors. But if Congress (and, for that matter, the FCC) are serious about supporting and encouraging entrepreneurship and innovation, they should be paying much more attention to what those startups are saying about how all of this impacts their business right now. <br/> And then the question is pretty straightforward: do they really support innovation, small business and entrepreneurship? Or do they support the big telcos looking to set up tollbooths to make innovation more expensive?<br/>Permalink[9] | Comments[10] | Email This Story[11]<br/> [1]: <url

companies such as Google and Facebook, as it reduced options for entrepreneurs to sell their businesses.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The tech giants will face greater scrutiny of any mergers that reduced competition or involved the transfer of large amounts of data, under expansions being proposed to merger laws by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Leading tech venture capitalist Daniel Petre of Airtree Ventures warned that government intervention in the market could hurt the start-up and broader industry.</p><p>\"The likes of Facebook, Google and Microsoft all undertake collectively hundreds of acquisitions a year, which allows start-up founders to realise an outcome and go back and start another company,\" Mr Petre said. \"This area [of legislation] needs a lot of care.\"</p><p>The ACCC's final report into digital platforms, released on Friday, warned that Google and Facebook's relentless acquisition of competitors was bad for consumers.</p><p>But entrepreneurs warned that a big payday was a key motivator for getting into business in the first place.</p><p>\"A major motivator for founders to create start-ups, for investors to invest into them and for people to seek employment in early stage start-ups is an exit of some sort,\" said Alexander Dreiling, the chief executive of Clipchamp, an online video editing platform.</p><p>\"If exits are going to be harder in the future, one of the main motivators is being taken away and we won't see the tech industry unfolding its potential positive impact on our economy.\"</p><p>Co-founder of video production start-up Shootsta Tim Moylan said nuance was required if the regulator was going to get tougher on blocking the sale of smaller companies.</p><p>\"If Google, Facebook or any other major technology company are acquiring a business just for consumer data that will give them an advantage, then this needs to be policed and factored into anti-competition policy,\" he said.</p><p>\"On the other hand, if the acquisition is all about benefiting the customer then this is a different matter.</p><p>\"With Shootsta as an example, if an acquisition meant we could offer our 200 clients more user-friendly services to go alongside video production and training, then this shouldn't be blocked or slowed.\"</p><p>The chief executive of ASX-listed software company ShareRoot, Michelle Gallaher, said tech giants often served as an \"incubation foundation\" for other smaller start-ups that piggybacked technologies, services or solutions.</p><p>However, she supported moves by the ACCC to guard against the capricious nature of platform rule changes, that could leave companies stranded.</p><p>The biggest recent example of that was the demise of Australian technology company Unlockd, which collapsed after Google ruled it no longer met its terms of service for its apps.</p><p>\"Like any big brother, the tech platforms can be supportive of innovation and growth of the ecosystem or they can be manipulative and self-serving,\" Ms Gallaher said.</p><p>\"Their anti-competitive behaviour has forced many a start-up to pivot with no notice, eliminating the piggyback opportunity, destroying shareholder value in emerging tech start-ups and academic research projects, dramatically reducing overall development and growth in the market.\"</p><p>Mr Petre said he believed the proposed measures around privacy improvements and moves to address the dramatic market share inequities in advertising had merit.</p><p>But he thought the ACCC was over-reaching in its attempts to force tech companies to expose their algorithms.</p><p>\"The only truly silly bit is around the regulator having oversight of the algorithms used to position news stories and advertising content.</p><p>\"Also in the initial report there was a similar mention with regard to oversight of the pricing algorithms for advertising on these platforms,\" he said.</p><p>\"Advertisers are best placed to decide whether ad rates charged by any platform - be it TV, digital, newspaper or radio - are reasonable.</p><p>\"If I place a display ad on Facebook and it delivers better targeted ads that get a better return for me as an advertiser than, say, free-to-air TV, then that is great for me ... I get to decide how best to use my marketing dollars.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFRONL-1520160256</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFRONL2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WNB-XRH1-JBJ7-N2R5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">429670</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"698\"/><timeReceived>05:31 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

He resigned a short time ago. We all found out about it from a presidential tweet. Tonight we have the details as we know them, and we'll tell you what it might mean for business and regulation.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Also tonight, President Trump gearing up to take on Democrats in states he won. He's about to speak at a campaign rally in Montana. Tonight, his target the Democratic Senator Jon Tester. We're live at that event in Montana when the president begins.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Plus, barring some sort of last minute reprieve, the trade war is on. We're now just hours away from $34 billion in U.S. tariffs going into effect on everything from Chinese machinery, to auto parts, to medical devices. China now saying it is ready to respond immediately.</p><p>It's money and politics, we deliver the debate behind tomorrow's headlines. I'm Connell McShane in for Elizabeth MacDonald. The Evening Edit starts right now.</p><p>On Wall Street today the Dow shaking off trade some of the war angst, ending a 180 plus points higher after the Fed minutes were released and ahead of the monthly jobs report out tomorrow, it's 182 gain by the time the day ended on Wall Street 24,357 for the Dow. More on that in just a moment.</p><p>But first, this breaking this evening. The EPA administrator, a man of many scandals has resigned. President Trump a short time ago, tweeting that he accepted Pruitt's resignation.</p><p>Edwards Lawrence, live for us in Washington with the very latest. Edward?</p><p>EDWARD LAWRENCE, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Well, Connell, the president accepted the resignation letter from Scott Pruitt about 3.30 this afternoon Eastern Time. The president announcing the resignation as you said on Twitter, then tweeting about what's next.</p><p>President Trump said that Andrew Wheeler will assume the acting administrator duties of the EPA. Saying, \"I have no doubt that Andy will continue on with our great and lasting EPA agenda. We have made tremendous progress and the future of the EPA is very bright.\"</p><p>Now Pruitt steps down amid multiple allegations against him of abusing power, misusing taxpayer money. Some of the issues spending $43,000 on a sound-proof phone booth in his office spending more than $100,000 on at least one trip with private tours the Vatican in Europe, first class travel. It was on and on.</p><p>The reaction is coming in from Congress. Senator Bernie Sanders says, quote, \"Scott Pruitt was the worse EPA administrator in the history of the agenda -- history of the agency not only has he acted time and time again, an unethical manner but he has lead the agency in the wrong direction.\"</p><p>Senator Chuck Grassley saying the president did the right thing in taking the resignation letter. Now in the resignation letter Pruitt says that it's effective tomorrow.</p><p>And he adds that \"It is extremely difficult for me to see serving you in this role first because I count it a blessing to serve you in any capacity, but also because of the transformative work that is coming out. However, the unrelenting attacks on me personally, my family are unprecedented and have taken a sizable toll on us.\"</p><p>Several ethics investigation have been open into Pruitt. In fact, some lawmakers on Capitol Hill have even asked the inspector general to get involved. Now it's unclear what happens to all of those probes. Connell?</p><p>MCSHANE: That's the thing. I mean, it could be some legal issues down the line and the rest of it. Edward, thanks. Edward Lawrence in D.C.</p><p>Straight to Bush 43, deputy assistant Brad Blakeman joins us this evening. And we're looking as well at the countdown to midnight which I talk about it a few minutes on the trade war fears. But Brad, let's get straight now to the breaking news on the resignation of Scott Pruitt.</p><p>As Edward talked about, you know, there are all kinds of scandals, right, by some counts it could be a dozen or more of them. So the obvious first question would be, in a situation like this what took so long?</p><p>BRAD BLAKEMAN, FORMER PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH'S DEPUTY ASSISTANT: Absolutely, this guy should have been gone a long time ago, but I'm glad the president cleaned the air at the EPA as far as administration is concerned. The good news is the acting administrator Wheeler will do a fantastic job. And we're not going to hear the baggage and the drama that came with Pruitt.</p><p>MCSHANE: Right.</p><p>BLAKEMAN: He is a guy who is well-known in Washington, very respected environment attorney and energy lobbyist. He is somebody with a long history while serving the nation and also serving the private sector. So I expect nothing will change. The president I think will have a better opportunity to pass his agenda without the -- without the constant headline.</p><p>MCSHANE: That's kind of what makes this all the more puzzling or intriguing or whatever you want to call it, is that you are probably right, nothing will change which goes back to the first question, what took so long. Because if the president knows that. I would presume he does, or that is indeed the case, you know, wouldn't you wanted to -- wouldn't you have wanted to do this much, much sooner at least put it behind you if the policies are going to remain the same. He probably will.</p><p>BLAKEMAN: Yes, I think that the president probably in case was loyal to a fault.</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes.</p><p>BLAKEMAN: He was maybe too loyal to somebody who didn't deserve it. But clearly it's the right decision now, and I think it will be welcomed within the EPA.</p><p>MCSHANE: Now the thing about this story for, you know, our audience, our business audience, to think matters the most is what does that mean for business, what does it mean for regulation.</p><p>You're making the point that Pruitt's deputy, the acting administrator will continue with the same policies. Anything down the line, you know, in terms of he's already been confirmed by the Senate, right. So he come to any type of hurdles that could come in to play here where the administration's, you know, policies come up against it or just status quo.</p><p>BLAKEMAN: Well, the question is, how long will he serve as an acting administrator. Will the president nominates somebody to replace him or will he be actually elevated to the administrator of the EPA.</p><p>My hope is that the president will elevate him. Because he's a known commodity, he's well-known, he's well-respected. And again, I think he is in tune with the president' feeling of deregulation and giving more power to the private sector. And if you want that done then I think this guy probably should be elevated.</p><p>MCSHANE: Right. Because the idea, and that's what, you know, Democrat like Bernie Sanders which was the statement was read by Edward that the -- that this was the worst administrator of all-time, that he'd been leading the agency in the wrong direction. I mean, that's a political point of view but that won't change because of this. I mean, this whole deregulatory agenda continues pretty much--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BLAKEMAN: Right. Bernie Sanders is against the guy, I can assure you he is probably doing the right thing, so we're not looking for any endorsements by Bernie Sanders.</p><p>MCSHANE: It's kind of interesting but again, the scandals some of them were downright silly, I think that, you know, that were brought up, but some of these other things that somebody in this position would allow themselves to have endured. I mean, the $40,000 phone both for one.</p><p>BLAKEMAN: Crazy.</p><p>MCSHANE: I mean, it doesn't make any sense, though. It would go on and on. And then the other thing that, and the president campaigned on this of draining the swamp. I mean, you got a guy in here, let's be honest, asking his own age allegedly to go out and help his wife get like a 200 grand a year job and all that kind of thing was going on, you know, that's not exactly draining the swamp.</p><p>BLAKEMAN: Well, there is an illness in Washington that can affect cabinet members and low level staffers, that is Potomac River.</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes.</p><p>BLAKEMAN: When you get it, it's deadly. I've seen it happen to people. And here Pruitt was an outsider, former attorney general of Oklahoma, he should know better but he came to Washington, and he caught it. And it's fatal.</p><p>MCSHANE: There's no -- right. There's no known cure that we know of.</p><p>BLAKEMAN: Nope.</p><p>MCSHANE: Other than getting out which he will now do. Now I want to get you on a couple of other topics, or at least this big one tonight. We have the countdown clock on, right, so midnight. And the U.S. is said to impose these tariffs. It's $34 billion on imported Chinese machinery, automakers, and medical devices.</p><p>And as we would expect the Chinese have said they are going to come right back at us respond immediately. So the markets we didn't see much today. I mean, there were some reports that trade deals might be worked with the Europeans might have help stocks a bit. But this is certainly an issue.</p><p>Our own Maria Bartiromo spoke about all of this with the president recently. Let's listen then we'll come back and talk about it. Here it is.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We have -- we don't have a trade deal with China, we have a deal. Nobody bothered to make a deal, and they'll charge 25 percent for a car, and we use 2.5 percent. And you'll be using those numbers on your show so I don't want to bore people. But we have a -- some of the worst trade deals in the world. We are losing money with everybody.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCSHANE: This might be the one area, Brad, immigration maybe as well. But this probably the one area that this president has really changed the thinking of the Republican Party certainly different than it was when you were serving in President Bush's administration. What do you make of the moves?</p><p>BLAKEMAN: I think the president is absolutely right, China is a schoolyard bully who has been, you know, knocking us around, and either you can take it or you can stand up to the bully. And we have $400 billion deficit with China. That is just crazy.</p><p>We're the strongest most powerful economy in the world, and we're letting China and others, friend and foe, take advantage of us. I think the president is smart. Now it may cause us a little pain initially, but the gains are going to be well worth what we'll have to go through.</p><p>China like most bullies I predict will back down. They can't afford to go to war with America.</p><p>MCSHANE: Right.</p><p>BLAKEMAN: Those countries can't. And look, I think the president is going to make the best deal he can for the American people, we should be dealing bilaterally not with through this multilateral negotiations because it erodes our power and leverage.</p><p>MCSHANE: To some extent though, Brad, the question is, say you are right that they do back down, the question is when, and how long are the Chinese willing to kind of let this play out for, because that to your point does, you know, lead us into a situation where we might have to deal with maybe more pain than many Americans know they're going to have to deal with now.</p><p>And many of those Americans by the way supported the president when he ran for office. Think about farmers, think about people he's speaking to tonight at this rally in Montano. These policies he is putting in place could hurt people that supported him, right.</p><p>BLAKEMAN: Well, we're getting screwed, to a tune of almost half a trillion dollars. That's unacceptable. And what is Trump trying to do is he's trying to stand up for American jobs. We have to be behind the president. This is thinking long-term.</p><p>You know, I have a new word that diagnosis America's problems, it's called a momentarium. Living in the moment. Great leaders provide for the moment but they plan for our future. Trump is not only looking to take care of us today but he's looking to safeguard us for tomorrow.</p><p>MCSHANE: We'll talk about it tomorrow literally because this go into effect tonight. Good to see you, Brad, as always. Thanks a lot.</p><p>BLAKEMAN: Pleasure.</p><p>MCSHANE: All right. Brad Blakeman. Let's get back and check in on those markets. We mention the Dow closing in the green today with that more than 180 point rally. Job growth continuing into the summer months. ADP announced that business added 177,000 jobs in the month of June. So that was one of the economic data points.</p><p>Our own Nicole Petallides, as usual on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange with the wrap up. Nicole?</p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Up arrows across the board. The Dow gained 182 points. The NASDAQ up 1.1 percent. We heard from federal open market committee pretty much on pace for those for the rate hikes but some trade uncertainly and that weighed.</p><p>Also we saw movement in energy and oil as President Donald Trump tweeted his concerns about OPEC monopoly, and saying that gasoline prices on the rise up about 60 cents year-over-year.</p><p>And some doubts are growing pertaining to the Aramco IPO, will it ever happen. According to the Wall Street journal it was very hot, it could be the largest IPO, a $100 million. And the reports are that it has stalled. And the company is not making any comment. Back to you.</p><p>MCSHANE: All right, Nicole. Thank you, Nicole Petallides.</p><p>President Trump, meantime, moments away from speaking there. You are looking live at a campaign rally that's been set up in the state of Montano. Fox Business will bring you there live when the president arrives in Great Falls.</p><p>Coming up, in the meantime, growing concern over smart TV vacuuming people's data right out of their living room sometimes without their full malice. We have details on that story tonight.</p><p>Also Mark Zuckerberg's Facebook apologizing for flagging a Declaration of Independence post as hate speech.</p><p>Coming up, a guest who is not surprise by that. But first, the president is planning a three-day visit to the U.K. That will be in a few weeks. It comes as report out says the U.K. government told the president he can't meet with a certain member of the European parliament.</p><p>The Brexit architect Nigel Farage. Well, Nigel Farage is here with us. He'll react to that after this.</p><p>MCSHANE: Well, President Trump moments away from speaking at this campaign rally that's been set up in Great Falls, Montana. As you look at the crowd that has filed in to this venue. Remember the idea that the president going to these states where he won the presidential election that are represented in the United States Senate by Democrats.</p><p>In this case, Jon Tester, they try to go after a senator like a Jon Tester, see if Republicans can take back that seat, but as always with this campaign style rallies anything can happen. We're going to carry it live here on Fox Business. Anything from the resignation of Scott Pruitt that we were talking about, to the tariffs on China that go into effect midnight.</p><p>Of course, the Supreme Court pick that's expected on Monday. Anything and everything usually can and does happen at this type of event. So we'll carry that.</p><p>Meantime, July 12, the president planning a three-day visit to the U.K., where he'll meet with Prime Minister Theresa May, he's also meet with the queen. But according to the U.K.'s Daily Telegraph, the U.K. government has told President Trump he should not meet with the European parliament member Nigel Farage during his visit. And you know it, Nigel Farage joins us right now. What do you know about that?</p><p>NIGEL FARAGE, MEMBER, BRITISH PARLIAMENT: You know, ever since I appeared on a campaign platform with Donald Trump in Mississippi back in August 16, the U.K. government has been paranoid about my relationship with the U.S. president, my broader relationship with the administration. They're embarrassed I think that I've got good relations with Donald Trump and with many others.</p><p>And they are trying to deny the fact that I even exist. It is frankly stupid. It is ludicrous. The truth is that relations between the U.K. government under Mrs. May and the American administration under Trump are not as good as they should be.</p><p>MCSHANE: Right.</p><p>FARAGE: And rather than banning me from meeting the president, and by the way, I'm not sure how well he'll take to being told who we should choose to be or not. What they should be doing is using as a bridge between the two. I'm not sure at the moment the U.K. government is bright enough to understand that.</p><p>MCSHANE: So a couple things, have you been told or have you been able to confirm the fact that this is true, that they have come out and banned you from, you know, or try to ban you from meeting with president. And number two, have you spoken with the president or anybody at the White House about it.</p><p>FARAGE: Well, in the last 18 months, ever since -- ever since the president tweeted--</p><p>MCSHANE: Right.</p><p>FARAGE: -- many people in Washington think Nigel Farage would make a good U.K. ambassador. The government in Downing Street have been climbing the walls, that they hate me.</p><p>MCSHANE: Right.</p><p>FARAGE: They hate me because I force Brexit upon them.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCSHANE: So you met I know it's true. But you think, you have every reason to believe based on history that it is.</p><p>FARAGE: It is a completely consistent pattern of behavior. What I do know is the briefing that you've read, written up in a U.K. newspaper.</p><p>MCSHANE: Right.</p><p>FARAGE: Where I know for fact is that it came from the prime minister's office, so yes, it is true. I have not spoken with the president. I have spoken should I say to people close to him. Look, I don't' to embarrass him coming on this trip, if he wants to meet me, I'll meet him, but I won't force it.</p><p>MCSHANE: So you don't know whether that will happen.</p><p>FARAGE: Well, let's wait and see.</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes.</p><p>FARAGE: I don't know, you don't know. And the great thing about Donald Trump is, nobody ever, ever can, you know, predict.</p><p>MCSHANE: Well, that's true. That's definitely true. Like him or not, you don't know what is coming next.</p><p>FARAGE: Absolutely.</p><p>MCSHANE: Even at this rally in the next hour. Think about this trip, there's a lot of -- there's been a lot of back and forth about whether it would happen, how it would happen, would it be an official, this and that. And then this story is getting some attention.</p><p>The mayor of London approves a request from protesters. You're already taking in of this too. But to essentially, well here it is. To fly this blimp, it's a blimp that designed to look like an infant President Trump during the visit. So what do you make of that?</p><p>FARAGE: Look, in a free society, people are able to protest. They can hold up a placard, they can draw a cartoon.</p><p>MCSHANE: Right.</p><p>FARAGE: That is freedom of expression and speech and we all believe in that. But what is happening here is that in parliament square, you know, right in front of our ancient parliament. This blimp of Donald Trump as a baby will be flying 100 foot in the air. And do you know why? Because Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, has given permission for this to happen.</p><p>I think it makes my country look like a laughingstock, there is no country in the world that would insult the U.S. president in this way, and I would beg, I would plead with Fox viewers, and with all Americans, please, next Friday, when you see this ridiculous spectacle next to our parliament, don't judge the whole of my country by it, judge Mayor Sadiq Khan by it.</p><p>MCSHANE: Now I want to take on another issue while we have you here, Nigel on foreign policy.</p><p>FARAGE: Yes,</p><p>MCSHANE: Because this is important. You know, we've been talking about a lot of other things, but North Korea, you know, the Secretary of State Mike Pompeo will be in there in Pyongyang, he is set to arrive there and it will be the first time since the Singapore summit that we are going to get together between the U.S. and North Korea.</p><p>But there have been a lot of stories here in the last week or so, right, that have lead to some skepticism about whether Kim Jong-un really is going to abandon his nuclear arsenal or whether he's adding to it or he's hiding it or whatever the case might be. What do you make -- are skeptical now after maybe reading and hearing some of this, and what do you think Mike Pompeo can do about it?</p><p>FARAGE: Look, you know, you have been through years of Obama making big public declarations about things he would do, and then delivering nothing. That's what western world politics has been like. The point about this Trump administration is they don't just make big gestures, they try to actually do things.</p><p>Now look, the very fact that the meeting happened was great, but what everybody wants to see now is some action, the fact that Mike Pompeo is back there trying to make this happen shows the will of this regime to get a result, it doesn't guarantee a result--</p><p>MCSHANE: Right.</p><p>FARAGE: -- but I think Pompeo is doing exactly the right thing.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCSHANE: When do you, real quick, Nigel. When do you walk away, how do you know when to walk away, you know, how do you know they are not playing you in a situation like this?</p><p>FARAGE: Well, all through history, you know, we've seen, you know, peace deals, accords, and people breaking them.</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes.</p><p>FARAGE: I -- you know. Winston Churchill once said, jaw-jaw is ready than war-war. And right at the moment America and North Korea are going through jaw-jaw. Let's keep that process going as long as we possibly can.</p><p>MCSHANE: All right, we'll continue to check in with you, Nigel.</p><p>FARAGE: Thank you.</p><p>MCSHANE: Maybe any update on the president's visit as well. Thank you for joining us this evening I appreciate it.</p><p>FARAGE: Thank you.</p><p>MCSHANE: OK. As we said, the president is moments away now from this rally, campaign style out in Montana. And it looks like the crowd is getting revved up as it usually does for events like this. We're going to bring it to you live, Fox Business, we'll show when you the president arrives and bring you the rally.</p><p>But first, Mark Zuckerberg Facebook now reinstating a Declaration of Independence post after it was flagged as hate speech, accidental of course, But the details on that and what it means after a quick break.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARK ZUCKERBERG, CEO AND CO-FOUNDER, FACEBOOK: -- voices calling for building walls and distancing people they label as others. Instead of building walls we can help people build bridges.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ZUCKERBERG: We didn't take a broad enough of our responsibility and that was a big mistake. And it was my mistake. And I'm sorry. I started Facebook. I run it. And I'm responsible for what happens here.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCSHANE: All right. Mark Zuckerberg, the Facebook CEO apologizing earlier this year over the platform sharing user's personal data. Now, Facebook apologizing to a Texas newspaper for part of the Declaration of Independence being labeled as hate speech.</p><p>Community newspaper called the Liberty County vindicator had been posting the whole declaration in just small daily chunks on its Facebook page for eight days, this was in a run up to the 4th of July. But the ninth excerpt was not posted on Monday. The paper getting an automated from Facebook, saying that the post, quote, \"goes against our standard on hate speech.\"</p><p>Taking a look at the stock, the Facebook stock, it ended the day as most of the market did in the green, up by about 3 percent.</p><p>Let's go to the Daily Caller News Foundation editor in chief Chris Bedford. Good to see you, Chris. Thanks you for coming on. I appreciate it.</p><p>CHRISTOPHER BEDFORD, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, THE DAILY CALLER: Thanks for having me.</p><p>MCSHANE: All right. So the offending passages such as it was, was part of the bill of particulars and was, you know, written against King George of Britain and it said Thomas Jefferson using the phrase quote, \"merciless Indian savages,\" that's what got flagged, \"merciless Indian savages.\"</p><p>Vindicator's managing editor replied in an article about that, saying, quote, \"Perhaps that Thomas Jefferson written it has Native Americans at a challenging stage of cultural development that would have been better.\"</p><p>So, a tongue and cheek there. Unfortunately, Jefferson like British columnist of his day did not hold an entirely friendly view of Native American. So your reaction to all this, Chris.</p><p>BEDFORD: It wasn't a friendly time on the frontier right then.</p><p>MCSHANE: Right.</p><p>BEDFORD: The British crown had been an exciting tribes in the frontier to attack what were the American revolutionaries are towns and villages trying cause trouble for the frontier. A lot of people actually putting up on the left would call the Declaration of Independence a hate document.</p><p>We heard things like people putting on Twitter that the independent state on a Wednesday which is going to make white nationalist everywhere, come to tears and that was from an editor of Teen Vogue, but this gets caught up in Facebook's larger machinelike algorithms.</p><p>MCSHANE: Right.</p><p>BEDFORD: And publishers I guess are told that they have to trust these algorithms. The problem is of course and so like kind of like the Coca-Cola secret formula we're not allowed to see it. We just have to take to take their word for it, but time and time again it seems like historical thing or conservative things get flagged as hate speech by people and shutdown and there is no transparency at all with the massive, massive--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCSHANE: Zuckerberg talk a lot and, you know, during a Senate House appearance. It's about artificial intelligence, saying A.I. is going to be able to do a lot of this force but it does bring up that question about whether it should be doing all of it or whether human monitors would be better.</p><p>However, as I catch myself, he obviously would have bias with human monitors as well, right.</p><p>BEDFORD: Yes. And you look at who they eventually, who they hired to come on to decide what was actually going to be good news sources. And these were retired people from CNN and from New York Times they got a pretty strong liberal bed. There's not a single person on their news team where they hired that you would have said I actually might agree with them politically if you were on the conservative side of things.</p><p>And if Facebook wants to maintain the trust of a good half of the country they are going to have to figure out bring on some of these people that may be in Silicon Valley they view as knuckle draggers. They don't -- they don't -- I don't think there's a lot of sympathy for conservative sentiments over Silicon Valley.</p><p>MCSHANE: Well to that point, Ted Cruz obviously the Republican side of -- what after Mark Zuckerberg about bias -- political bias in particular during those hearings. Let's take a listen to that -- back in time, then we will talk about it. Here it is.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: There are great many Americans who I think are deeply concerned that Facebook and other tech companies are engaged in a pervasive pattern of bias and political censorship.</p><p>MARK ZUCKERBERG, CEO FACEBOOK: I understand where that concern is coming from, because Facebook and the tech industry are located in Silicon Valley which is an extremely left leaning place and this is actually a concern that I have, then I try to root out in the company is making sure that we don't have any bias in the work that we do. And I think it is a fair concern.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCSHANE: The only thing in this particular case, Chris, I would say, those case we're talking about, this phrase, merciless Indian savages seems, it is just a filter maybe that was not turned on the right way or it needs to be readjusted in some ways as oppose to a political bias or maybe I am wrong. What do you think?</p><p>BEDFORD: Yes. It is basically trying to call out, they have a 25 page manual on what they define as hate speech, and one of them includes attacking a protected group, today and maybe back in 1776, it should had been like this. The American Indian Conservative was a protective group and Thomas Jefferson did not have kind thoughts about the Natives on the Frontier. It makes sense, it was a period of open of warfare between the groups. There was tribes versus colonist. That was a different time in the time of war. So, it is probably just caught by a computer in this case.</p><p>But Facebook problem is there used to be a message board, something that you could post anything you wanted to, and they were not responsible for it, and then after some terrorists started using it and then especially after Hillary Clinton lost and they blamed Facebook for it, people on left said we need to regulate this place and make it so that Hillary Clinton can never be disparage here again. People on the right said, well, you don't have a friend over here, because you have shown bias against Conservatives and right now they are in Washington D.C. without a friend.</p><p>MCSHANE: Right. It is interesting. It gives us a chance to talk about it again. Whether or not in this case it applauds or not they got to take a look at all of this issues. Good to see you, Chris. Thanks a lot.</p><p>BEDFORD: Thank you.</p><p>MCSHANE: Let us go back to Montana, the President getting set to speak at campaign rally this evening, as soon as he begins, let us look at the arena. We are going to bring it to you live, you know Scott Pruitt resignation obviously at the top of the headline tonight, sometimes the President gets to something like that when it breaks, night of other times, avoids it entirely, we'll see, Of course, Supreme Court and his appointment there and another thing a lot of people are thinking about. So we are watching that. First though, an Anti-Trump amend has been fired from his job, a video, emerged of him angrily ripping a hat \"Make America Great Again hat off a head of young boy and throwing a drink at him as he was eating food, this happen in Texas, we are going to talk about that. Next, Trump 2020 campaign senior adviser, Katrina Pearson will be here, don't go away.</p><p>MCSHANE: Breaking news just coming in to us, President Trump just arriving moments ago air force one touched at Great Falls International Airport. So, the President now will motorcade over once he gets out of the plane. As the plane is just out of our camera shot at the moment, but taxing on the tarmac there and then there will be a motorcade over to the arena in Great Falls where the president begins a rally at the top of the next hour. So, some 22, 23 minutes of from now we will expect that to begin usually the President is about on time, it appears to be just about on schedule right now with the touchdown in Montana.</p><p>Let's bring in Trump's 2020 campaign senior adviser, Katrina Pearson, as we wait for the president comments at the top of the hour. I said before the last break, Katrina that pretty much anything and everything could come up usually does at these rallies. The President made headlines tonight obviously with the acceptance of the resignation as EPA administrator Scott Pruitt has been under fire, do you think he talks something like that or is it more focus on other subjects? What do you expect tonight?</p><p>KATRINA PEARSON, TRUMP 2020 CAMPAIGN SENIOR ADVISER: Well, I think your initial thought are absolutely correct. The President could speak about anything tonight, he definitely has his written speech in the teleprompter, but if you ever have been to a Trump rally, the President is known to really just feel the energy in the room and talk about the things that he wants to talk about and the things in the current headlines this may come up, he is definitely going to talk about many accomplishments that he is making and how Democrats are failing miserably to block his agenda. And he is going to show support for his supporters who are constantly under attack now, because you have Democrat politicians encourages physical confrontation.</p><p>MCSHANE: Right. We'll talk about that in a second and -- you have covered enough of these rallies, to know usually what you expect going in is not necessarily the headline that you get coming out, because the president will go of on some other subjects. Maybe tonight, he gives a hint about his Supreme Court nominee. What do you think of that?</p><p>PEARSON: He may, you know, this is where the President is in his element, he is most comfortable with his supporters, as you know. Thousands of people attend these rallies, some of them waiting overnight, there will be thousands on the outside of these rallies. And so, he really want his supporters to really be the first to know many of these types of things, and what is really going on. He uses this opportunity to bypass the mainstream media to get away from those filters on some of those other cable news networks and talk to his supporters so they can hear directly from him, what is going on.</p><p>MCSHANE: You see the supporters are gathered there waiting for President in the next few minutes to make his way over to the arena there, to the venue. You mentioned some of these confrontations that had been going on. And certainly getting a lot of the headlines, I think one, you may have alluded to his video, it has gone viral, the guy comes up, rips a hat right off a young man's head. The Make America Great Again Trump hat, throwing soda on him and what not, so, we will talk about that, but let us watch it first. Here it is.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (BEEP) President. You ain't supporting -- (BEEP). There is no great (BEEP).</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCSHANE: All right. The man has been identified, Keno Jimenez, a bartender work at in San Antonio, Texas at a bar there, they fired him. The bar, they fired him of his job. Here is the teenager that you see there responding to the incident. Listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I didn't think he would generate that amount like, not like what people are doing, like I was looking at comments to some people are like, of yes, this is uncalled for, and people are like, you know, with mixed opinions, but I did not think it would blow up to what it is right now.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes. It has Katrina, blown up to become quite a story. A controversy that the kind of thing you are referring to, right?</p><p>PEARSON: Oh, absolutely. I mean, this this case, this was a cowardly man, this was an adult, a 30-year-old man. Who attacked a teenager? Kids that ride skateboards and play video games, this is how low the left has gone. This is more liberal buffoonery on full display, and this is happening because you have many in the mainstream media who are constantly mischaracterizing the President and his agenda. Along with others politicians on the left pushing for confrontation. And now, there are children involved. But we should be surprised, because this is not the first time. This has been going on since the very beginning, if you followed 2016 campaign, you saw Trump supporters get attacked violently outside some of these rallies. And now the media and the politics making this worse.</p><p>MCSHANE: Now the President's detractor said that he plays some role in it, based on that during the campaign as well, this his language, insights people on the other side to be aggressive against people who disagree with him, you think, there are two sides on this or just one side?</p><p>PEARSON: Well, I think that, you can take anything that you don't like, any policy that maybe does not work in your favor call it whatever you like. The President never encouraged people to go out in publicly confront individuals, and if he was abrasive in any tone it was in defense of his own supporters that were being violently attacked. And so this kid in San Antonio, you know Brad Parscale is from San Antonio, he is the Trump campaign 2020 campaign manager and he tweeted today that he would like to send this young guy a signed hat, give him a brand new MAGA hat with President's signature, because we all stand with Trump supporters all across the country.</p><p>MCSHANE: Coming up lined up tonight in Montana, they will hear the President speak at the top of the hour. Katrina, good to see you, thank you for coming on tonight. We appreciate it.</p><p>PEARSON: Great to be here. Thank you.</p><p>MCSHANE: All right. With this rally set to begin, we will keep our eye on it. Of course, the warming up of the crowds seems to -- just about been completed. The motorcade will be on its way over to the venue in Great Falls, Montana. Live at the Fox Business Network when it begins.</p><p>Also tonight, growing concern over smart TV, this is going to vacuuming people's data right out of their living rooms. Sometimes it happens without their full knowledge, details on that story coming up next.</p><p>MCSHANE: Breaking News in the State of Montana, left and right of the scree, Air Force One, obviously on the left side of the screen with the stairs out, the President set to leave the plane, and head to the motorcade, and then he will by the power of that beast motorcade make his way over to the arena in Great Falls where the presidential lectern is set up for him to begin this rally.</p><p>That is top of the hour, Fox Business live coverage, we'll keep an eye on both of those live pictures. And we will have the president's arrival and then we will have his remarks at the top of the hour as well.</p><p>Now, before last break we promised to talk about this crazy story involving smart TV's that might be keeping track of more than just what you are watching, there is some concern growing over personal data being misused by big tech giants, Facebook alike and also by the smartphone companies, but people's data is being taken right from their living room TV, and sometimes it happens without them knowing about it. Because what happens is, you have to opt in as user agreement, but the language is confusing. We have it up on the screen, right now. Reading in part, interact with your favorite TV shows, get recommendation base on the content you love, connect your devices for exclusive content special offers. Our Susan Li is here this evening with a little bit more on this, this is confusing. What is the company again that is doing this?</p><p>SUSAN LI, FOX BUSINESSES: Well, there are several companies. The largest one that we're focusing on is Samba TV.</p><p>MCSHANE: Samba TV, right.</p><p>LI: Samba, I know it sounds very festive.</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes.</p><p>LI: But really it is kind of different. But that policy is 4,000 words, can you believe that, the opt in is 6500 words, do you read through them.</p><p>MCSHANE: No. There are a lot of times in my (inaudible) as all kinds of things we sign our life away, you know, these contracts come up, agree, agree.</p><p>LI: Right. You just want to get it over with. Make your life a lot easier. But OK. This is what Samba TV does, you know, 45 percent of Americans have smart television. In their living rooms according to IHS. I have one, I am a little scared now. And so what Samba TV does is it vacuums the info off your smart television, and this era of the internet things, your TV connected to the internet, which is then connected to your speaker, possibly to your phone as well. So what Samba TV does, it takes pixel by pixel, it understands what you are watching second by second.</p><p>MCSHANE: And then, that could be used, you know, obviously, you know, privacy experts are concern about, but it could be used for good.</p><p>LI: OK. So they can't directly sell the data, so what they do is they see what you are watching whether it is conservative or even liberal media. That is something that they also keep track of, and then they use -- they target ads to your other devices.</p><p>MCSHANE: Just like what happens on the internet.</p><p>LI: So you are wondering, you are watching, let us say you are watching \"Game of thrones.\"</p><p>MCSHANE: Right. What is that ad?</p><p>LI: And then all of the sudden something pops up on your Facebook thing. Where did that come from? How did they know where they listening?</p><p>MCSHANE: I mean, companies in TV have wanted to do this forever, they have been jealous of the internet for doing it, but now it is really happening, but at the same time obviously, the obvious concerns come up, people say, well, I did not know this is going on.</p><p>LI: Well, yes, so the thing is, the opt in rate for Samba TV, 90 percent according to one executive.</p><p>MCSHANE: Those people have no clue. They don't know what they are clicking on.</p><p>LI: And a big investors are getting involved with Samba TV, as well. Mark Cuban, putting in money, we also have Liberty Media, and Time Warner as well.</p><p>MCSHANE: Now you mentioned they can't sell, so what are the restriction, real quick.</p><p>LI: They can't directly sell the data, that is single restriction, but there are big companies are working with them, like Citi and JetBlue in the past, Expedia, Spell Advertisers with Samba TV, as well.</p><p>MCSHANE: Sad world.</p><p>LI: Yes, this is the world it is, you want to target ads, you want them to be effective, I mean, the one that get the right eyeballs.</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes, that is it. You have to give up something to get it I guess. Good to see you, Susan.</p><p>LI: Good to see you.</p><p>MCSHANE: Thanks, Susan Li.</p><p>All right. President Trump will be speaking here, just a few minutes really at this campaign rally, see the crowd gathered behind the lectern with the Presidential seal on it in Montana. Remember, he won big out there, 20 plus points in the election and the idea is you go in the state where you won if you are President Trump that represented by Democrats in this case John Tester, in the Senate and you target that state. Kayleigh Mcenany is here, she will weigh in on that more. Coming up next from the RNC.</p><p>MCSHANE: News alert out in Montana. Once again, moments away from the president at this rally in a State carried by 20 plus points. Let's bring in Kayleigh Mcenany in from the RNC as we set you up for President's rally this evening. Good to see you, Kayleigh. A couple of things we are wondering about.</p><p>KAYLEIGH MCENANY, REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE SPOKESPERSON: Good to see you.</p><p>MCSHANE: Obviously about the Supreme Court, whether we will get any hint. The president spoke briefly on Air Force One on the reporters about that and some other topics. I think he has it down to three possibly two is what he is saying. But, your thoughts on some of these picks? I mean, we have Judge (inaudible), they are all appeals court judges. He is appointed by President Bush, await away 51 years old. You have two other picks Judge Kavanagh, again, kind of a lot of Gorsuch comparisons there for Judge Kavanaugh who is appointed by President Bush as well, so that is somebody that could be considered and there is supposedly one other person in the running as well, Judge Amy Coney. So, if those are the three picks, can't go wrong from your point of view or how do you view this?</p><p>MCENANY: that is right. You cannot go wrong it is important to remind everyone that these three individuals all come from that list of 25 Judges that was put together during the campaign that was a list put together by Trump in consultation with a guy name Leonard Leo, who is the head of the Federalist Society and a member of the Federalist Society during my time in Harvard law school This organization is all about finding strict constitutionalist to interpret the words on the page as they should mean and their original context when put together by the founders. All three of these judges, Kavanaugh, and Coney they all -- Barrett, I should say Coney Barrett, you know they all have pass this test at the Federalist Society, and I think that that you can't go wrong.</p><p>MCSHANE: I am sorry, the President made some sort of remark on Air Force One, that any of the 25 on his list would have been terrific. But to the point of view of conservatives that is probably true, because it is going to that mold that you are talking about, the Federalist Society Consultant on the entire list which we knew that going in.</p><p>MCENANY: That is right. Make no mistake, each and every one of these men and women on the list, will be demonized, the left right now is coming up with a playbook to attack all of them, it does not matter who the nominee is, they will say that they are going to overturn Roe v. Wade and they will say this is rolling back the civil rights it is nonsense, but it does not matter what the name is, you can imagine the same line of attack that are going to come.</p><p>MCSHANE: No doubt. Less of a minute left actually, this just came out, we just got pull a report from Air Force One, the President threatening another 300 billion in tariffs on the Chinese, with the 30 plus billion going into effect tonight, we're in a trade war here, Kayleigh, aren't we?</p><p>MCENANY: You know, I think trade war, we can use that term or we can used a grand negotiation is how I see it.</p><p>MCSHANE: OK.</p><p>MCENANY: Because I think, as the President has said China has more to lose than we do, in fact they are the ones with a trade surplus. We are the ones with the deficit. So, I hope there is an opening salvo of what will be a long negotiation and one that will be better off for the American worker in the long run.</p><p>MCSHANE: All right Kayleigh, we cut it short, I want to get the president on time at the top of the hour. Thanks a lot as always for coming on tonight, we appreciate it.</p><p>MCENANY: Thank you, Connell.</p><p>MCSHANE: All right Kayleigh Mcenany, from the RNC. The president's rally will be getting just moments from now, Great Falls, Montana. We'll come back and have it live for you on Fox Business in just a moment.</p><p>MCSHANE: As we wait for the President to begin this rally in Montana. We said it in a number of times this evening that anything can and will happen at this rallies. The President talked about the resignation of his EPA chief, Scott Pruitt on Air Force One, saying there is really no final straw when it came to Pruitt. He called him a terrific guy, but at the end he said it was his decision to resign. So, we will look for that and his comments on the Supreme Court. And all the other breaking news of the day, but we thank you for joining us this evening.

He resigned a short time ago. We all found  out about it from a presidential tweet. Tonight we have the details as we  know them, and we'll tell you what it might mean for business and  regulation. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Also tonight, President Trump gearing up to take on Democrats in states he  won. He's about to speak at a campaign rally in Montana. Tonight, his  target the Democratic Senator Jon Tester. We're live at that event in  Montana when the president begins. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Plus, barring some sort of last minute reprieve, the trade war is on. We're  now just hours away from $34 billion in U.S. tariffs going into effect on  everything from Chinese machinery, to auto parts, to medical devices. China  now saying it is ready to respond immediately.</p><p> It's money and politics, we deliver the debate behind tomorrow's headlines.  I'm Connell McShane in for Elizabeth MacDonald. The Evening Edit starts  right now. </p><p> On Wall Street today the Dow shaking off trade some of the war angst,  ending a 180 plus points higher after the Fed minutes were released and  ahead of the monthly jobs report out tomorrow, it's 182 gain by the time  the day ended on Wall Street 24,357 for the Dow. More on that in just a  moment.</p><p> But first, this breaking this evening. The EPA administrator, a man of many  scandals has resigned. President Trump a short time ago, tweeting that he  accepted Pruitt's resignation.</p><p> Edwards Lawrence, live for us in Washington with the very latest. Edward?</p><p> EDWARD LAWRENCE, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT:  Well, Connell, the president  accepted the resignation letter from Scott Pruitt about 3.30 this afternoon  Eastern Time. The president announcing the resignation as you said on  Twitter, then tweeting about what's next. </p><p> President Trump said that Andrew Wheeler will assume the acting  administrator duties of the EPA. Saying, \"I have no doubt that Andy will  continue on with our great and lasting EPA agenda. We have made tremendous  progress and the future of the EPA is very bright.\"</p><p> Now Pruitt steps down amid multiple allegations against him of abusing  power, misusing taxpayer money. Some of the issues spending $43,000 on a  sound-proof phone booth in his office spending more than $100,000 on at  least one trip with private tours the Vatican in Europe, first class  travel. It was on and on.</p><p> The reaction is coming in from Congress. Senator Bernie Sanders says,  quote, \"Scott Pruitt was the worse EPA administrator in the history of the  agenda -- history of the agency not only has he acted time and time again,  an unethical manner but he has lead the agency in the wrong direction.\" </p><p> Senator Chuck Grassley saying the president did the right thing in taking  the resignation letter. Now in the resignation letter Pruitt says that it's  effective tomorrow. </p><p> And he adds that \"It is extremely difficult for me to see serving you in  this role first because I count it a blessing to serve you in any capacity,  but also because of the transformative work that is coming out. However,  the unrelenting attacks on me personally, my family are unprecedented and  have taken a sizable toll on us.\" </p><p> Several ethics investigation have been open into Pruitt. In fact, some  lawmakers on Capitol Hill have even asked the inspector general to get  involved. Now it's unclear what happens to all of those probes. Connell?</p><p> MCSHANE:  That's the thing. I mean, it could be some legal issues down the  line and the rest of it. Edward, thanks. Edward Lawrence in D.C.</p><p> Straight to Bush 43, deputy assistant Brad Blakeman joins us this evening.  And we're looking as well at the countdown to midnight which I talk about  it a few minutes on the trade war fears. But Brad, let's get straight now  to the breaking news on the resignation of Scott Pruitt. </p><p> As Edward talked about, you know, there are all kinds of scandals, right,  by some counts it could be a dozen or more of them. So the obvious first  question would be, in a situation like this what took so long? </p><p> BRAD BLAKEMAN, FORMER PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH'S DEPUTY ASSISTANT:   Absolutely, this guy should have been gone a long time ago, but I'm glad  the president cleaned the air at the EPA as far as administration is  concerned. The good news is the acting administrator Wheeler will do a  fantastic job. And we're not going to hear the baggage and the drama that  came with Pruitt.</p><p> MCSHANE:  Right.</p><p> BLAKEMAN:  He is a guy who is well-known in Washington, very respected  environment attorney and energy lobbyist. He is somebody with a long  history while serving the nation and also serving the private sector. So I  expect nothing will change. The president I think will have a better  opportunity to pass his agenda without the -- without the constant  headline. </p><p> MCSHANE:  That's kind of what makes this all the more puzzling or  intriguing or whatever you want to call it, is that you are probably right,  nothing will change which goes back to the first question, what took so  long. Because if the president knows that. I would presume he does, or that  is indeed the case, you know, wouldn't you wanted to -- wouldn't you have  wanted to do this much, much sooner at least put it behind you if the  policies are going to remain the same. He probably will. </p><p> BLAKEMAN:  Yes, I think that the president probably in case was loyal to a  fault.</p><p> MCSHANE:  Yes.</p><p> BLAKEMAN:  He was maybe too loyal to somebody who didn't deserve it. But  clearly it's the right decision now, and I think it will be welcomed within  the EPA. </p><p> MCSHANE:  Now the thing about this story for, you know, our audience, our  business audience, to think matters the most is what does that mean for  business, what does it mean for regulation. </p><p> You're making the point that Pruitt's deputy, the acting administrator will  continue with the same policies. Anything down the line, you know, in terms  of he's already been confirmed by the Senate, right. So he come to any type  of hurdles that could come in to play here where the administration's, you  know, policies come up against it or just status quo. </p><p> BLAKEMAN:  Well, the question is, how long will he serve as an acting  administrator. Will the president nominates somebody to replace him or will  he be actually elevated to the administrator of the EPA.</p><p> My hope is that the president will elevate him. Because he's a known  commodity, he's well-known, he's well-respected. And again, I think he is  in tune with the president' feeling of deregulation and giving more power  to the private sector. And if you want that done then I think this guy  probably should be elevated. </p><p> MCSHANE:  Right. Because the idea, and that's what, you know, Democrat like  Bernie Sanders which was the statement was read by Edward that the -- that  this was the worst administrator of all-time, that he'd been leading the  agency in the wrong direction. I mean, that's a political point of view but  that won't change because of this. I mean, this whole deregulatory agenda  continues pretty much--</p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> BLAKEMAN:  Right. Bernie Sanders is against the guy, I can assure you he is  probably doing the right thing, so we're not looking for any endorsements  by Bernie Sanders. </p><p> MCSHANE:  It's kind of interesting but again, the scandals some of them  were downright silly, I think that, you know, that were brought up, but  some of these other things that somebody in this position would allow  themselves to have endured. I mean, the $40,000 phone both for one. </p><p> BLAKEMAN:  Crazy. </p><p> MCSHANE:  I mean, it doesn't make any sense, though. It would go on and on.  And then the other thing that, and the president campaigned on this of  draining the swamp. I mean, you got a guy in here, let's be honest, asking  his own age allegedly to go out and help his wife get like a 200 grand a  year job and all that kind of thing was going on, you know, that's not  exactly draining the swamp. </p><p> BLAKEMAN:  Well, there is an illness in Washington that can affect cabinet  members and low level staffers, that is Potomac River.</p><p> MCSHANE:  Yes.</p><p> BLAKEMAN:  When you get it, it's deadly. I've seen it happen to people. And  here Pruitt was an outsider, former attorney general of Oklahoma, he should  know better but he came to Washington, and he caught it. And it's fatal. </p><p> MCSHANE:  There's no -- right. There's no known cure that we know of. </p><p> BLAKEMAN:  Nope. </p><p> MCSHANE:  Other than getting out which he will now do. Now I want to get  you on a couple of other topics, or at least this big one tonight. We have  the countdown clock on, right, so midnight. And the U.S. is said to impose  these tariffs. It's $34 billion on imported Chinese machinery, automakers,  and medical devices. </p><p> And as we would expect the Chinese have said they are going to come right  back at us respond immediately. So the markets we didn't see much today. I  mean, there were some reports that trade deals might be worked with the  Europeans might have help stocks a bit. But this is certainly an issue. </p><p> Our own Maria Bartiromo spoke about all of this with the president  recently. Let's listen then we'll come back and talk about it. Here it is.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  We have -- we don't have a  trade deal with China, we have a deal. Nobody bothered to make a deal, and  they'll charge 25 percent for a car, and we use 2.5 percent. And you'll be  using those numbers on your show so I don't want to bore people. But we  have a -- some of the worst trade deals in the world. We are losing money  with everybody.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> MCSHANE:  This might be the one area, Brad, immigration maybe as well. But  this probably the one area that this president has really changed the  thinking of the Republican Party certainly different than it was when you  were serving in President Bush's administration. What do you make of the  moves? </p><p> BLAKEMAN:  I think the president is absolutely right, China is a schoolyard  bully who has been, you know, knocking us around, and either you can take  it or you can stand up to the bully. And we have $400 billion deficit with  China. That is just crazy.</p><p> We're the strongest most powerful economy in the world, and we're letting  China and others, friend and foe, take advantage of us. I think the  president is smart. Now it may cause us a little pain initially, but the  gains are going to be well worth what we'll have to go through. </p><p> China like most bullies I predict will back down. They can't afford to go  to war with America.</p><p> MCSHANE:  Right.</p><p> BLAKEMAN:  Those countries can't. And look, I think the president is going  to make the best deal he can for the American people, we should be dealing  bilaterally not with through this multilateral negotiations because it  erodes our power and leverage. </p><p> MCSHANE:  To some extent though, Brad, the question is, say you are right  that they do back down, the question is when, and how long are the Chinese  willing to kind of let this play out for, because that to your point does,  you know, lead us into a situation where we might have to deal with maybe  more pain than many Americans know they're going to have to deal with now. </p><p> And many of those Americans by the way supported the president when he ran  for office. Think about farmers, think about people he's speaking to  tonight at this rally in Montano. These policies he is putting in place  could hurt people that supported him, right. </p><p> BLAKEMAN:  Well, we're getting screwed, to a tune of almost half a trillion  dollars. That's unacceptable. And what is Trump trying to do is he's trying  to stand up for American jobs. We have to be behind the president. This is  thinking long-term. </p><p> You know, I have a new word that diagnosis America's problems, it's called  a momentarium. Living in the moment. Great leaders provide for the moment  but they plan for our future. Trump is not only looking to take care of us  today but he's looking to safeguard us for tomorrow. </p><p> MCSHANE:  We'll talk about it tomorrow literally because this go into  effect tonight. Good to see you, Brad, as always. Thanks a lot. </p><p> BLAKEMAN:  Pleasure.</p><p> MCSHANE:  All right. Brad Blakeman. Let's get back and check in on those  markets. We mention the Dow closing in the green today with that more than  180 point rally. Job growth continuing into the summer months. ADP  announced that business added 177,000 jobs in the month of June. So that  was one of the economic data points. </p><p> Our own Nicole Petallides, as usual on the floor of the New York Stock  Exchange with the wrap up. Nicole? </p><p> NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Up arrows across the board. The  Dow gained 182 points. The NASDAQ up 1.1 percent. We heard from federal  open market committee pretty much on pace for those for the rate hikes but  some trade uncertainly and that weighed. </p><p> Also we saw movement in energy and oil as President Donald Trump tweeted  his concerns about OPEC monopoly, and saying that gasoline prices on the  rise up about 60 cents year-over-year. </p><p> And some doubts are growing pertaining to the Aramco IPO, will it ever  happen. According to the Wall Street journal it was very hot, it could be  the largest IPO, a $100 million. And the reports are that it has stalled.  And the company is not making any comment. Back to you.</p><p> MCSHANE:  All right, Nicole. Thank you, Nicole Petallides. </p><p> President Trump, meantime, moments away from speaking there. You are  looking live at a campaign rally that's been set up in the state of  Montano. Fox Business will bring you there live when the president arrives  in Great Falls. </p><p> Coming up, in the meantime, growing concern over smart TV vacuuming  people's data right out of their living room sometimes without their full  malice. We have details on that story tonight. </p><p> Also Mark Zuckerberg's Facebook apologizing for flagging a Declaration of  Independence post as hate speech. </p><p> Coming up, a guest who is not surprise by that. But first, the president is  planning a three-day visit to the U.K. That will be in a few weeks. It  comes as report out says the U.K. government told the president he can't  meet with a certain member of the European parliament. </p><p> The Brexit architect Nigel Farage. Well, Nigel Farage is here with us.  He'll react to that after this.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MCSHANE:  Well, President Trump moments away from speaking at this campaign  rally that's been set up in Great Falls, Montana. As you look at the crowd  that has filed in to this venue. Remember the idea that the president going  to these states where he won the presidential election that are represented  in the United States Senate by Democrats. </p><p> In this case, Jon Tester, they try to go after a senator like a Jon Tester,  see if Republicans can take back that seat, but as always with this  campaign style rallies anything can happen. We're going to carry it live  here on Fox Business. Anything from the resignation of Scott Pruitt that we  were talking about, to the tariffs on China that go into effect midnight.</p><p> Of course, the Supreme Court pick that's expected on Monday. Anything and  everything usually can and does happen at this type of event. So we'll  carry that. </p><p> Meantime, July 12, the president planning a three-day visit to the U.K.,  where he'll meet with Prime Minister Theresa May, he's also meet with the  queen. But according to the U.K.'s Daily Telegraph, the U.K. government has  told President Trump he should not meet with the European parliament member  Nigel Farage during his visit. And you know it, Nigel Farage joins us right  now. What do you know about that? </p><p> NIGEL FARAGE, MEMBER, BRITISH PARLIAMENT:  You know, ever since I appeared  on a campaign platform with Donald Trump in Mississippi back in August 16,  the U.K. government has been paranoid about my relationship with the U.S.  president, my broader relationship with the administration. They're  embarrassed I think that I've got good relations with Donald Trump and with  many others. </p><p> And they are trying to deny the fact that I even exist. It is frankly  stupid. It is ludicrous. The truth is that relations between the U.K.  government under Mrs. May and the American administration under Trump are  not as good as they should be. </p><p> MCSHANE:  Right.</p><p> FARAGE:  And rather than banning me from meeting the president, and by the  way, I'm not sure how well he'll take to being told who we should choose to  be or not. What they should be doing is using as a bridge between the two.  I'm not sure at the moment the U.K. government is bright enough to  understand that. </p><p> MCSHANE:  So a couple things, have you been told or have you been able to  confirm the fact that this is true, that they have come out and banned you  from, you know, or try to ban you from meeting with president. And number  two, have you spoken with the president or anybody at the White House about  it. </p><p> FARAGE:  Well, in the last 18 months, ever since -- ever since the  president tweeted--</p><p> MCSHANE:  Right.</p><p> FARAGE:  -- many people in Washington think Nigel Farage would make a good  U.K. ambassador. The government in Downing Street have been climbing the  walls, that they hate me.</p><p> MCSHANE:  Right.</p><p> FARAGE:  They hate me because I force Brexit upon them. </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> MCSHANE:  So you met I know it's true. But you think, you have every reason  to believe based on history that it is. </p><p> FARAGE:  It is a completely consistent pattern of behavior. What I do know  is the briefing that you've read, written up in a U.K. newspaper.</p><p> MCSHANE:  Right.</p><p> FARAGE:  Where I know for fact is that it came from the prime minister's  office, so yes, it is true. I have not spoken with the president. I have  spoken should I say to people close to him. Look, I don't' to embarrass him  coming on this trip, if he wants to meet me, I'll meet him, but I won't  force it. </p><p> MCSHANE:  So you don't know whether that will happen. </p><p> FARAGE:  Well, let's wait and see. </p><p> MCSHANE:  Yes.</p><p> FARAGE:  I don't know, you don't know. And the great thing about Donald  Trump is, nobody ever, ever can, you know, predict. </p><p> MCSHANE:  Well, that's true. That's definitely true. Like him or not, you  don't know what is coming next. </p><p> FARAGE:  Absolutely.</p><p> MCSHANE:  Even at this rally in the next hour. Think about this trip,  there's a lot of -- there's been a lot of back and forth about whether it  would happen, how it would happen, would it be an official, this and that.  And then this story is getting some attention. </p><p> The mayor of London approves a request from protesters. You're already  taking in of this too. But to essentially, well here it is. To fly this  blimp, it's a blimp that designed to look like an infant President Trump  during the visit. So what do you make of that?</p><p> FARAGE:  Look, in a free society, people are able to protest. They can hold  up a placard, they can draw a cartoon.</p><p> MCSHANE:  Right.</p><p> FARAGE:  That is freedom of expression and speech and we all believe in  that. But what is happening here is that in parliament square, you know,  right in front of our ancient parliament. This blimp of Donald Trump as a  baby will be flying 100 foot in the air. And do you know why? Because Sadiq  Khan, the mayor of London, has given permission for this to happen. </p><p> I think it makes my country look like a laughingstock, there is no country  in the world that would insult the U.S. president in this way, and I would  beg, I would plead with Fox viewers, and with all Americans, please, next  Friday, when you see this ridiculous spectacle next to our parliament,  don't judge the whole of my country by it, judge Mayor Sadiq Khan by it. </p><p> MCSHANE:  Now I want to take on another issue while we have you here, Nigel  on foreign policy.</p><p> FARAGE:  Yes,</p><p> MCSHANE:  Because this is important. You know, we've been talking about a  lot of other things, but North Korea, you know, the Secretary of State Mike  Pompeo will be in there in Pyongyang, he is set to arrive there and it will  be the first time since the Singapore summit that we are going to get  together between the U.S. and North Korea.</p><p> But there have been a lot of stories here in the last week or so, right,  that have lead to some skepticism about whether Kim Jong-un really is going  to abandon his nuclear arsenal or whether he's adding to it or he's hiding  it or whatever the case might be. What do you make -- are skeptical now  after maybe reading and hearing some of this, and what do you think Mike  Pompeo can do about it? </p><p> FARAGE:  Look, you know, you have been through years of Obama making big  public declarations about things he would do, and then delivering nothing.  That's what western world politics has been like. The point about this  Trump administration is they don't just make big gestures, they try to  actually do things. </p><p> Now look, the very fact that the meeting happened was great, but what  everybody wants to see now is some action, the fact that Mike Pompeo is  back there trying to make this happen shows the will of this regime to get  a result, it doesn't guarantee a result--</p><p> MCSHANE:  Right.</p><p> FARAGE:  -- but I think Pompeo is doing exactly the right thing. </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> MCSHANE:  When do you, real quick, Nigel. When do you walk away, how do you  know when to walk away, you know, how do you know they are not playing you  in a situation like this? </p><p> FARAGE:  Well, all through history, you know, we've seen, you know, peace  deals, accords, and people breaking them. </p><p> MCSHANE:  Yes.</p><p> FARAGE:  I -- you know. Winston Churchill once said, jaw-jaw is ready than  war-war. And right at the moment America and North Korea are going through  jaw-jaw. Let's keep that process going as long as we possibly can. </p><p> MCSHANE:  All right, we'll continue to check in with you, Nigel.</p><p> FARAGE:  Thank you.</p><p> MCSHANE:  Maybe any update on the president's visit as well. Thank you for  joining us this evening I appreciate it. </p><p> FARAGE:  Thank you. </p><p> MCSHANE:  OK. As we said, the president is moments away now from this  rally, campaign style out in Montana. And it looks like the crowd is  getting revved up as it usually does for events like this. We're going to  bring it to you live, Fox Business, we'll show when you the president  arrives and bring you the rally. </p><p> But first, Mark Zuckerberg Facebook now reinstating a Declaration of  Independence post after it was flagged as hate speech, accidental of  course, But the details on that and what it means after a quick break. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MARK ZUCKERBERG, CEO AND CO-FOUNDER, FACEBOOK:  -- voices calling for  building walls and distancing people they label as others. Instead of  building walls we can help people build bridges.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> ZUCKERBERG:  We didn't take a broad enough of our responsibility and that  was a big mistake. And it was my mistake. And I'm sorry. I started  Facebook. I run it. And I'm responsible for what happens here.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MCSHANE:  All right. Mark Zuckerberg, the Facebook CEO apologizing earlier  this year over the platform sharing user's personal data. Now, Facebook  apologizing to a Texas newspaper for part of the Declaration of  Independence being labeled as hate speech. </p><p> Community newspaper called the Liberty County vindicator had been posting  the whole declaration in just small daily chunks on its Facebook page for  eight days, this was in a run up to the 4th of July. But the ninth excerpt  was not posted on Monday. The paper getting an automated from Facebook,  saying that the post, quote, \"goes against our standard on hate speech.\" </p><p> Taking a look at the stock, the Facebook stock, it ended the day as most of  the market did in the green, up by about 3 percent. </p><p> Let's go to the Daily Caller News Foundation editor in chief Chris Bedford.  Good to see you, Chris. Thanks you for coming on. I appreciate it.</p><p> CHRISTOPHER BEDFORD, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, THE DAILY CALLER:  Thanks for having  me.</p><p> MCSHANE:  All right. So the offending passages such as it was, was part of  the bill of particulars and was, you know, written against King George of  Britain and it said Thomas Jefferson using the phrase quote, \"merciless  Indian savages,\" that's what got flagged, \"merciless Indian savages.\" </p><p> Vindicator's managing editor replied in an article about that, saying,  quote, \"Perhaps that Thomas Jefferson written it has Native Americans at a  challenging stage of cultural development that would have been better.\" </p><p> So, a tongue and cheek there. Unfortunately, Jefferson like British  columnist of his day did not hold an entirely friendly view of Native  American. So your reaction to all this, Chris.</p><p> BEDFORD:  It wasn't a friendly time on the frontier right then.</p><p> MCSHANE:  Right.</p><p> BEDFORD:  The British crown had been an exciting tribes in the frontier to  attack what were the American revolutionaries are towns and villages trying  cause trouble for the frontier. A lot of people actually putting up on the  left would call the Declaration of Independence a hate document. </p><p> We heard things like people putting on Twitter that the independent state  on a Wednesday which is going to make white nationalist everywhere, come to  tears and that was from an editor of Teen Vogue, but this gets caught up in  Facebook's larger machinelike algorithms.</p><p> MCSHANE:  Right.</p><p> BEDFORD:  And publishers I guess are told that they have to trust these  algorithms. The problem is of course and so like kind of like the Coca-Cola  secret formula we're not allowed to see it. We just have to take to take  their word for it, but time and time again it seems like historical thing  or conservative things get flagged as hate speech by people and shutdown  and there is no transparency at all with the massive, massive--</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> MCSHANE:  Zuckerberg talk a lot and, you know, during a Senate House  appearance. It's about artificial intelligence, saying A.I. is going to be  able to do a lot of this force but it does bring up that question about  whether it should be doing all of it or whether human monitors would be  better.</p><p> However, as I catch myself, he obviously would have bias with human  monitors as well, right.</p><p> BEDFORD:  Yes. And you look at who they eventually, who they hired to come  on to decide what was actually going to be good news sources. And these  were retired people from CNN and from New York Times they got a pretty  strong liberal bed. There's not a single person on their news team where  they hired that you would have said I actually might agree with them  politically if you were on the conservative side of things.</p><p> And if Facebook wants to maintain the trust of a good half of the country  they are going to have to figure out bring on some of these people that may  be in Silicon Valley they view as knuckle draggers. They don't -- they  don't -- I don't think there's a lot of sympathy for conservative  sentiments over Silicon Valley.  </p><p> MCSHANE:  Well to that point, Ted Cruz obviously the Republican side of --  what after Mark Zuckerberg about bias -- political bias in particular  during those hearings.  Let's take a listen to that -- back in time, then  we will talk about it.  Here it is.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  There are great many Americans who I think are deeply  concerned that Facebook and other tech companies are engaged in a pervasive  pattern of bias and political censorship.  </p><p> MARK ZUCKERBERG, CEO FACEBOOK:  I understand where that concern is coming  from, because Facebook and the tech industry are located in Silicon Valley  which is an extremely left leaning place and this is actually a concern  that I have, then I try to root out in the company is making sure that we  don't have any bias in the work that we do.  And I think it is a fair  concern.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> MCSHANE:  The only thing in this particular case, Chris, I would say, those  case we're talking about, this phrase, merciless Indian savages seems, it  is just a filter maybe that was not turned on the right way or it needs to  be readjusted in some ways as oppose to a political bias or maybe I am  wrong.  What do you think?  </p><p> BEDFORD:  Yes.  It is basically trying to call out, they have a 25 page  manual on what they define as hate speech, and one of them includes  attacking a protected group, today and maybe back in 1776, it should had  been like this.  The American Indian Conservative was a protective group  and Thomas Jefferson did not have kind thoughts about the Natives on the  Frontier.  It makes sense, it was a period of open of warfare between the  groups.  There was tribes versus colonist.  That was a different time in  the time of war.  So, it is probably just caught by a computer in this  case.  </p><p> But Facebook problem is there used to be a message board, something that  you could post anything you wanted to, and they were not responsible for  it, and then after some terrorists started using it and then especially  after Hillary Clinton lost and they blamed Facebook for it, people on left  said we need to regulate this place and make it so that Hillary Clinton can  never be disparage here again.  People on the right said, well, you don't  have a friend over here, because you have shown bias against Conservatives  and right now they are in Washington D.C. without a friend.  </p><p> MCSHANE:  Right.  It is interesting.  It gives us a chance to talk about it  again.  Whether or not in this case it applauds or not they got to take a  look at all of this issues.  Good to see you, Chris. Thanks a lot.  </p><p> BEDFORD:  Thank you.  </p><p> MCSHANE:  Let us go back to Montana, the President getting set to speak at  campaign rally this evening, as soon as he begins, let us look at the  arena.  We are going to bring it to you live, you know Scott Pruitt  resignation obviously at the top of the headline tonight, sometimes the  President gets to something like that when it breaks, night of other times,  avoids it entirely, we'll see,  Of course, Supreme Court and his  appointment there and another thing a lot of people are thinking about.  So  we are watching that.  First though, an Anti-Trump amend has been fired  from his job, a video, emerged of him angrily ripping a hat \"Make America  Great Again hat off a head of young boy and throwing a drink at him as he  was eating food, this happen in Texas, we are going to talk about that.   Next, Trump 2020 campaign senior adviser, Katrina Pearson will be here,  don't go away.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  </p><p> MCSHANE:  Breaking news just coming in to us, President Trump just arriving  moments ago air force one touched at Great Falls International Airport.   So, the President now will motorcade over once he gets out of the plane.   As the plane is just out of our camera shot at the moment, but taxing on  the tarmac there and then there will be a motorcade over to the arena in  Great Falls where the president begins a rally at the top of the next hour.   So, some 22, 23 minutes of from now we will expect that to begin usually  the President is about on time, it appears to be just about on schedule  right now with the touchdown in Montana.  </p><p> Let's bring in Trump's 2020 campaign senior adviser, Katrina Pearson, as we  wait for the president comments at the top of the hour.  I said before the  last break, Katrina that pretty much anything and everything could come up  usually does at these rallies.  The President made headlines tonight  obviously with the acceptance of the resignation as EPA administrator Scott  Pruitt has been under fire, do you think he talks something like that or is  it more focus on other subjects?  What do you expect tonight?  </p><p> KATRINA PEARSON, TRUMP 2020 CAMPAIGN SENIOR ADVISER:  Well, I think your  initial thought are absolutely correct.  The President could speak about  anything tonight, he definitely has his written speech in the teleprompter,  but if you ever have been to a Trump rally, the President is known to  really just feel the energy in the room and talk about the things that he  wants to talk about and the things in the current headlines this may come  up, he is definitely going to talk about many accomplishments that he is  making and how Democrats are failing miserably to block his agenda.  And he  is going to show support for his supporters who are constantly under attack  now, because you have Democrat politicians encourages physical  confrontation.  </p><p> MCSHANE:  Right.  We'll talk about that in a second and -- you have covered  enough of these rallies, to know usually what you expect going in is not  necessarily the headline that you get coming out, because the president  will go of on some other subjects.  Maybe tonight, he gives a hint about  his Supreme Court nominee.  What do you think of that?  </p><p> PEARSON:  He may, you know, this is where the President is in his element,  he is most comfortable with his supporters, as you know.  Thousands of  people attend these rallies, some of them waiting overnight, there will be  thousands on the outside of these rallies.  And so, he really want his  supporters to really be the first to know many of these types of things,  and what is really going on.  He uses this opportunity to bypass the  mainstream media to get away from those filters on some of those other  cable news networks and talk to his supporters so they can hear directly  from him, what is going on.  </p><p> MCSHANE:  You see the supporters are gathered there waiting for President  in the next few minutes to make his way over to the arena there, to the  venue.  You mentioned some of these confrontations that had been going on.   And certainly getting a lot of the headlines, I think one, you may have  alluded to his video, it has gone viral, the guy comes up, rips a hat right  off a young man's head.  The Make America Great Again Trump hat, throwing  soda on him and what not, so, we will talk about that, but let us watch it  first.  Here it is.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  (BEEP) President.  You ain't supporting -- (BEEP).   There is no great (BEEP).  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> MCSHANE:  All right.  The man has been identified, Keno Jimenez, a  bartender work at in San Antonio, Texas at a bar there, they fired him.   The bar, they fired him of his job.  Here is the teenager that you see  there responding to the incident.  Listen.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I didn't think he would generate that amount like, not  like what people are doing, like I was looking at comments to some people  are like, of yes, this is uncalled for, and people are like, you know, with  mixed opinions, but I did not think it would blow up to what it is right  now.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> MCSHANE:  Yes.  It has Katrina, blown up to become quite a story.  A  controversy that the kind of thing you are referring to, right?  </p><p> PEARSON:  Oh, absolutely.  I mean, this this case, this was a cowardly man,  this was an adult, a 30-year-old man.  Who attacked a teenager?  Kids that  ride skateboards and play video games, this is how low the left has gone.   This is more liberal buffoonery on full display, and this is happening  because you have many in the mainstream media who are constantly  mischaracterizing the President and his agenda.  Along with others  politicians on the left pushing for confrontation.  And now, there are  children involved.  But we should be surprised, because this is not the  first time.  This has been going on since the very beginning, if you  followed 2016 campaign, you saw Trump supporters get attacked violently  outside some of these rallies.  And now the media and the politics making  this worse.  </p><p> MCSHANE:  Now the President's detractor said that he plays some role in it,  based on that during the campaign as well, this his language, insights  people on the other side to be aggressive against people who disagree with  him, you think, there are two sides on this or just one side?  </p><p> PEARSON:  Well, I think that, you can take anything that you don't like,  any policy that maybe does not work in your favor call it whatever you  like.  The President never encouraged people to go out in publicly confront  individuals, and if he was abrasive in any tone it was in defense of his  own supporters that were being violently attacked.  And so this kid in San  Antonio, you know Brad Parscale is from San Antonio, he is the Trump  campaign 2020 campaign manager and he tweeted today that he would like to  send this young guy a signed hat, give him a brand new MAGA hat with  President's signature, because we all stand with Trump supporters all  across the country.  </p><p> MCSHANE:  Coming up lined up tonight in Montana, they will hear the  President speak at the top of the hour.  Katrina, good to see you, thank  you for coming on tonight.  We appreciate it.  </p><p> PEARSON:  Great to be here.  Thank you.  </p><p> MCSHANE:  All right.  With this rally set to begin, we will keep our eye on  it.  Of course, the warming up of the crowds seems to -- just about been  completed.  The motorcade will be on its way over to the venue in Great  Falls, Montana.  Live at the Fox Business Network when it begins.  </p><p> Also tonight, growing concern over smart TV, this is going to vacuuming  people's data right out of their living rooms.  Sometimes it happens  without their full knowledge, details on that story coming up next.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  </p><p> MCSHANE:  Breaking News in the State of Montana, left and right of the  scree, Air Force One, obviously on the left side of the screen with the  stairs out, the President set to leave the plane, and head to the  motorcade, and then he will by the power of that beast motorcade make his  way over to the arena in Great Falls where the presidential lectern is set  up for him to begin this rally.  </p><p> That is top of the hour, Fox Business live coverage, we'll keep an eye on  both of those live pictures.  And we will have the president's arrival and  then we will have his remarks at the top of the hour as well.  </p><p> Now, before last break we promised to talk about this crazy story involving  smart TV's that might be keeping track of more than just what you are  watching, there is some concern growing over personal data being misused by  big tech giants, Facebook alike and also by the smartphone companies, but  people's data is being taken right from their living room TV, and sometimes  it happens without them knowing about it.  Because what happens is, you  have to opt in as user agreement, but the language is confusing.  We have  it up on the screen, right now.  Reading in part, interact with your  favorite TV shows, get recommendation base on the content you love, connect  your devices for exclusive content special offers.  Our Susan Li is here  this evening with a little bit more on this, this is confusing.  What is  the company again that is doing this?  </p><p> SUSAN LI, FOX BUSINESSES:  Well, there are several companies.  The largest  one that we're focusing on is Samba TV.  </p><p> MCSHANE:  Samba TV, right.  </p><p> LI:  Samba, I know it sounds very festive.  </p><p> MCSHANE:  Yes.  </p><p> LI:  But really it is kind of different.  But that policy is 4,000 words,  can you believe that, the opt in is 6500 words, do you read through them.  </p><p> MCSHANE:  No.  There are a lot of times in my (inaudible) as all kinds of  things we sign our life away, you know, these contracts come up, agree,  agree.  </p><p> LI:  Right.  You just want to get it over with.  Make your life a lot  easier.  But OK.  This is what Samba TV does, you know, 45 percent of  Americans have smart television.  In their living rooms according to IHS.   I have one, I am a little scared now.  And so what Samba TV does is it  vacuums the info off your smart television, and this era of the internet  things, your TV connected to the internet, which is then connected to your  speaker, possibly to your phone as well.  So what Samba TV does, it takes  pixel by pixel, it understands what you are watching second by second.  </p><p> MCSHANE:  And then, that could be used, you know, obviously, you know,  privacy experts are concern about, but it could be used for good.  </p><p> LI:  OK.  So they can't directly sell the data, so what they do is they see  what you are watching whether it is conservative or even liberal media.   That is something that they also keep track of, and then they use -- they  target ads to your other devices.  </p><p> MCSHANE:  Just like what happens on the internet.  </p><p> LI:  So you are wondering, you are watching, let us say you are watching  \"Game of thrones.\"  </p><p> MCSHANE:  Right.  What is that ad?  </p><p> LI:  And then all of the sudden something pops up on your Facebook thing.   Where did that come from?  How did they know where they listening?  </p><p> MCSHANE:  I mean, companies in TV have wanted to do this forever, they have  been jealous of the internet for doing it, but now it is really happening,  but at the same time obviously, the obvious concerns come up, people say,  well, I did not know this is going on.  </p><p> LI:  Well, yes, so the thing is, the opt in rate for Samba TV, 90 percent  according to one executive.  </p><p> MCSHANE:  Those people have no clue.  They don't know what they are  clicking on.  </p><p> LI:  And a big investors are getting involved with Samba TV, as well.  Mark  Cuban, putting in money, we also have Liberty Media, and Time Warner as  well.  </p><p> MCSHANE:  Now you mentioned they can't sell, so what are the restriction,  real quick.  </p><p> LI:  They can't directly sell the data, that is single restriction, but  there are big companies are working with them, like Citi and JetBlue in the  past, Expedia, Spell Advertisers with Samba TV, as well.  </p><p> MCSHANE:  Sad world.  </p><p> LI:  Yes, this is the world it is, you want to target ads, you want them to  be effective, I mean, the one that get the right eyeballs.  </p><p> MCSHANE:  Yes, that is it.  You have to give up something to get it I  guess.  Good to see you, Susan.  </p><p> LI:  Good to see you.  </p><p> MCSHANE:  Thanks, Susan Li.  </p><p> All right.  President Trump will be speaking here, just a few minutes  really at this campaign rally, see the crowd gathered behind the lectern  with the Presidential seal on it in Montana.  Remember, he won big out  there, 20 plus points in the election and the idea is you go in the state  where you won if you are President Trump that represented by Democrats in  this case John Tester, in the Senate and you target that state.  Kayleigh  Mcenany is here, she will weigh in on that more.  Coming up next from the  RNC.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  </p><p> MCSHANE:  News alert out in Montana.  Once again, moments away from the  president at this rally in a State carried by 20 plus points.  Let's bring  in Kayleigh Mcenany in from the RNC as we set you up for President's rally  this evening.  Good to see you, Kayleigh.  A couple of things we are  wondering about.  </p><p> KAYLEIGH MCENANY, REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE SPOKESPERSON:  Good to see  you.  </p><p> MCSHANE:  Obviously about the Supreme Court, whether we will get any hint.   The president spoke briefly on Air Force One on the reporters about that  and some other topics.  I think he has it down to three possibly two is  what he is saying.  But, your thoughts on some of these picks?  I mean, we  have Judge (inaudible), they are all appeals court judges.  He is appointed  by President Bush, await away 51 years old.  You have two other picks Judge  Kavanagh, again, kind of a lot of Gorsuch comparisons there for Judge  Kavanaugh who is appointed by President Bush as well, so that is somebody  that could be considered and there is supposedly one other person in the  running as well, Judge Amy Coney.  So, if those are the three picks, can't  go wrong from your point of view or how do you view this?  </p><p> MCENANY:  that is right.  You cannot go wrong it is important to remind  everyone that these three individuals all come from that list of 25 Judges  that was put together during the campaign that was a list put together by  Trump in consultation with a guy name Leonard Leo, who is the head of the  Federalist Society and a member of the Federalist Society during my time in  Harvard law school   This organization is all about finding strict  constitutionalist to interpret the words on the page as they should mean  and their original context when put together by the founders.  All three of  these judges, Kavanaugh, and Coney they all -- Barrett, I should say Coney  Barrett, you know they all have pass this test at the Federalist Society,  and I think that that you can't go wrong.  </p><p> MCSHANE:  I am sorry, the President made some sort of remark on Air Force  One, that any of the 25 on his list would have been terrific.  But to the  point of view of conservatives that is probably true, because it is going  to that mold that you are talking about, the Federalist Society Consultant  on the entire list which we knew that going in.  </p><p> MCENANY:  That is right.  Make no mistake, each and every one of these men  and women on the list, will be demonized, the left right now is coming up  with a playbook to attack all of them, it does not matter who the nominee  is, they will say that they are going to overturn Roe v. Wade and they will  say this is rolling back the civil rights it is nonsense, but it does not  matter what the name is, you can imagine the same line of attack that are  going to come.  </p><p> MCSHANE:  No doubt.  Less of a minute left actually, this just came out, we  just got pull a report from Air Force One, the President threatening  another 300 billion in tariffs on the Chinese, with the 30 plus billion  going into effect tonight, we're in a trade war here, Kayleigh, aren't we?  </p><p> MCENANY:  You know, I think trade war, we can use that term or we can used  a grand negotiation is how I see it.  </p><p> MCSHANE:  OK.  </p><p> MCENANY:  Because I think, as the President has said China has more to lose  than we do, in fact they are the ones with a trade surplus.  We are the  ones with the deficit.  So, I hope there is an opening salvo of what will  be a long negotiation and one that will be better off for the American  worker in the long run.  </p><p> MCSHANE:  All right Kayleigh, we cut it short, I want to get the president  on time at the top of the hour.  Thanks a lot as always for coming on  tonight, we appreciate it.  </p><p> MCENANY:  Thank you, Connell.  </p><p> MCSHANE:  All right Kayleigh Mcenany, from the RNC.  The president's rally  will be getting just moments from now, Great Falls, Montana.  We'll come  back and have it live for you on Fox Business in just a moment.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  </p><p> MCSHANE:  As we wait for the President to begin this rally in Montana.  We  said it in a number of times this evening that anything can and will happen  at this rallies.  The President talked about the resignation of his EPA  chief, Scott Pruitt on Air Force One, saying there is really no final straw  when it came to Pruitt.  He called him a terrific guy, but at the end he  said it was his decision to resign.  So, we will look for that and his  comments on the Supreme Court.  And all the other breaking news of the day,  but we thank you for joining us this evening.  It's Charles Payne now with  \"Making Money.\"  Take it away Charles.  </p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

He resigned a short time ago. We all found  out about it from a presidential tweet. Tonight we have the details as we  know them, and we'll tell you what it might mean for business and  regulation. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Also tonight, President Trump gearing up to take on Democrats in states he  won. He's about to speak at a campaign rally in Montana. Tonight, his  target the Democratic Senator Jon Tester. We're live at that event in  Montana when the president begins. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Plus, barring some sort of last minute reprieve, the trade war is on. We're  now just hours away from $34 billion in U.S. tariffs going into effect on  everything from Chinese machinery, to auto parts, to medical devices. China  now saying it is ready to respond immediately.</p><p>It's money and politics, we deliver the debate behind tomorrow's headlines.  I'm Connell McShane in for Elizabeth MacDonald. The Evening Edit starts  right now. </p><p>On Wall Street today the Dow shaking off trade some of the war angst,  ending a 180 plus points higher after the Fed minutes were released and  ahead of the monthly jobs report out tomorrow, it's 182 gain by the time  the day ended on Wall Street 24,357 for the Dow. More on that in just a  moment.</p><p>But first, this breaking this evening. The EPA administrator, a man of many  scandals has resigned. President Trump a short time ago, tweeting that he  accepted Pruitt's resignation.</p><p>Edwards Lawrence, live for us in Washington with the very latest. Edward?</p><p>EDWARD LAWRENCE, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT:  Well, Connell, the president  accepted the resignation letter from Scott Pruitt about 3.30 this afternoon  Eastern Time. The president announcing the resignation as you said on  Twitter, then tweeting about what's next. </p><p>President Trump said that Andrew Wheeler will assume the acting  administrator duties of the EPA. Saying, \"I have no doubt that Andy will  continue on with our great and lasting EPA agenda. We have made tremendous  progress and the future of the EPA is very bright.\"</p><p>Now Pruitt steps down amid multiple allegations against him of abusing  power, misusing taxpayer money. Some of the issues spending $43,000 on a  sound-proof phone booth in his office spending more than $100,000 on at  least one trip with private tours the Vatican in Europe, first class  travel. It was on and on.</p><p>The reaction is coming in from Congress. Senator Bernie Sanders says,  quote, \"Scott Pruitt was the worse EPA administrator in the history of the  agenda -- history of the agency not only has he acted time and time again,  an unethical manner but he has lead the agency in the wrong direction.\" </p><p>Senator Chuck Grassley saying the president did the right thing in taking  the resignation letter. Now in the resignation letter Pruitt says that it's  effective tomorrow. </p><p>And he adds that \"It is extremely difficult for me to see serving you in  this role first because I count it a blessing to serve you in any capacity,  but also because of the transformative work that is coming out. However,  the unrelenting attacks on me personally, my family are unprecedented and  have taken a sizable toll on us.\" </p><p>Several ethics investigation have been open into Pruitt. In fact, some  lawmakers on Capitol Hill have even asked the inspector general to get  involved. Now it's unclear what happens to all of those probes. Connell?</p><p>MCSHANE:  That's the thing. I mean, it could be some legal issues down the  line and the rest of it. Edward, thanks. Edward Lawrence in D.C.</p><p>Straight to Bush 43, deputy assistant Brad Blakeman joins us this evening.  And we're looking as well at the countdown to midnight which I talk about  it a few minutes on the trade war fears. But Brad, let's get straight now  to the breaking news on the resignation of Scott Pruitt. </p><p>As Edward talked about, you know, there are all kinds of scandals, right,  by some counts it could be a dozen or more of them. So the obvious first  question would be, in a situation like this what took so long? </p><p>BRAD BLAKEMAN, FORMER PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH'S DEPUTY ASSISTANT:   Absolutely, this guy should have been gone a long time ago, but I'm glad  the president cleaned the air at the EPA as far as administration is  concerned. The good news is the acting administrator Wheeler will do a  fantastic job. And we're not going to hear the baggage and the drama that  came with Pruitt.</p><p>MCSHANE:  Right.</p><p>BLAKEMAN:  He is a guy who is well-known in Washington, very respected  environment attorney and energy lobbyist. He is somebody with a long  history while serving the nation and also serving the private sector. So I  expect nothing will change. The president I think will have a better  opportunity to pass his agenda without the -- without the constant  headline. </p><p>MCSHANE:  That's kind of what makes this all the more puzzling or  intriguing or whatever you want to call it, is that you are probably right,  nothing will change which goes back to the first question, what took so  long. Because if the president knows that. I would presume he does, or that  is indeed the case, you know, wouldn't you wanted to -- wouldn't you have  wanted to do this much, much sooner at least put it behind you if the  policies are going to remain the same. He probably will. </p><p>BLAKEMAN:  Yes, I think that the president probably in case was loyal to a  fault.</p><p>MCSHANE:  Yes.</p><p>BLAKEMAN:  He was maybe too loyal to somebody who didn't deserve it. But  clearly it's the right decision now, and I think it will be welcomed within  the EPA. </p><p>MCSHANE:  Now the thing about this story for, you know, our audience, our  business audience, to think matters the most is what does that mean for  business, what does it mean for regulation. </p><p>You're making the point that Pruitt's deputy, the acting administrator will  continue with the same policies. Anything down the line, you know, in terms  of he's already been confirmed by the Senate, right. So he come to any type  of hurdles that could come in to play here where the administration's, you  know, policies come up against it or just status quo. </p><p>BLAKEMAN:  Well, the question is, how long will he serve as an acting  administrator. Will the president nominates somebody to replace him or will  he be actually elevated to the administrator of the EPA.</p><p>My hope is that the president will elevate him. Because he's a known  commodity, he's well-known, he's well-respected. And again, I think he is  in tune with the president' feeling of deregulation and giving more power  to the private sector. And if you want that done then I think this guy  probably should be elevated. </p><p>MCSHANE:  Right. Because the idea, and that's what, you know, Democrat like  Bernie Sanders which was the statement was read by Edward that the -- that  this was the worst administrator of all-time, that he'd been leading the  agency in the wrong direction. I mean, that's a political point of view but  that won't change because of this. I mean, this whole deregulatory agenda  continues pretty much--</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>BLAKEMAN:  Right. Bernie Sanders is against the guy, I can assure you he is  probably doing the right thing, so we're not looking for any endorsements  by Bernie Sanders. </p><p>MCSHANE:  It's kind of interesting but again, the scandals some of them  were downright silly, I think that, you know, that were brought up, but  some of these other things that somebody in this position would allow  themselves to have endured. I mean, the $40,000 phone both for one. </p><p>BLAKEMAN:  Crazy. </p><p>MCSHANE:  I mean, it doesn't make any sense, though. It would go on and on.  And then the other thing that, and the president campaigned on this of  draining the swamp. I mean, you got a guy in here, let's be honest, asking  his own age allegedly to go out and help his wife get like a 200 grand a  year job and all that kind of thing was going on, you know, that's not  exactly draining the swamp. </p><p>BLAKEMAN:  Well, there is an illness in Washington that can affect cabinet  members and low level staffers, that is Potomac River.</p><p>MCSHANE:  Yes.</p><p>BLAKEMAN:  When you get it, it's deadly. I've seen it happen to people. And  here Pruitt was an outsider, former attorney general of Oklahoma, he should  know better but he came to Washington, and he caught it. And it's fatal. </p><p>MCSHANE:  There's no -- right. There's no known cure that we know of. </p><p>BLAKEMAN:  Nope. </p><p>MCSHANE:  Other than getting out which he will now do. Now I want to get  you on a couple of other topics, or at least this big one tonight. We have  the countdown clock on, right, so midnight. And the U.S. is said to impose  these tariffs. It's $34 billion on imported Chinese machinery, automakers,  and medical devices. </p><p>And as we would expect the Chinese have said they are going to come right  back at us respond immediately. So the markets we didn't see much today. I  mean, there were some reports that trade deals might be worked with the  Europeans might have help stocks a bit. But this is certainly an issue. </p><p>Our own Maria Bartiromo spoke about all of this with the president  recently. Let's listen then we'll come back and talk about it. Here it is.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  We have -- we don't have a  trade deal with China, we have a deal. Nobody bothered to make a deal, and  they'll charge 25 percent for a car, and we use 2.5 percent. And you'll be  using those numbers on your show so I don't want to bore people. But we  have a -- some of the worst trade deals in the world. We are losing money  with everybody.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MCSHANE:  This might be the one area, Brad, immigration maybe as well. But  this probably the one area that this president has really changed the  thinking of the Republican Party certainly different than it was when you  were serving in President Bush's administration. What do you make of the  moves? </p><p>BLAKEMAN:  I think the president is absolutely right, China is a schoolyard  bully who has been, you know, knocking us around, and either you can take  it or you can stand up to the bully. And we have $400 billion deficit with  China. That is just crazy.</p><p>We're the strongest most powerful economy in the world, and we're letting  China and others, friend and foe, take advantage of us. I think the  president is smart. Now it may cause us a little pain initially, but the  gains are going to be well worth what we'll have to go through. </p><p>China like most bullies I predict will back down. They can't afford to go  to war with America.</p><p>MCSHANE:  Right.</p><p>BLAKEMAN:  Those countries can't. And look, I think the president is going  to make the best deal he can for the American people, we should be dealing  bilaterally not with through this multilateral negotiations because it  erodes our power and leverage. </p><p>MCSHANE:  To some extent though, Brad, the question is, say you are right  that they do back down, the question is when, and how long are the Chinese  willing to kind of let this play out for, because that to your point does,  you know, lead us into a situation where we might have to deal with maybe  more pain than many Americans know they're going to have to deal with now. </p><p>And many of those Americans by the way supported the president when he ran  for office. Think about farmers, think about people he's speaking to  tonight at this rally in Montano. These policies he is putting in place  could hurt people that supported him, right. </p><p>BLAKEMAN:  Well, we're getting screwed, to a tune of almost half a trillion  dollars. That's unacceptable. And what is Trump trying to do is he's trying  to stand up for American jobs. We have to be behind the president. This is  thinking long-term. </p><p>You know, I have a new word that diagnosis America's problems, it's called  a momentarium. Living in the moment. Great leaders provide for the moment  but they plan for our future. Trump is not only looking to take care of us  today but he's looking to safeguard us for tomorrow. </p><p>MCSHANE:  We'll talk about it tomorrow literally because this go into  effect tonight. Good to see you, Brad, as always. Thanks a lot. </p><p>BLAKEMAN:  Pleasure.</p><p>MCSHANE:  All right. Brad Blakeman. Let's get back and check in on those  markets. We mention the Dow closing in the green today with that more than  180 point rally. Job growth continuing into the summer months. ADP  announced that business added 177,000 jobs in the month of June. So that  was one of the economic data points. </p><p>Our own Nicole Petallides, as usual on the floor of the New York Stock  Exchange with the wrap up. Nicole? </p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Up arrows across the board. The  Dow gained 182 points. The NASDAQ up 1.1 percent. We heard from federal  open market committee pretty much on pace for those for the rate hikes but  some trade uncertainly and that weighed. </p><p>Also we saw movement in energy and oil as President Donald Trump tweeted  his concerns about OPEC monopoly, and saying that gasoline prices on the  rise up about 60 cents year-over-year. </p><p>And some doubts are growing pertaining to the Aramco IPO, will it ever  happen. According to the Wall Street journal it was very hot, it could be  the largest IPO, a $100 million. And the reports are that it has stalled.  And the company is not making any comment. Back to you.</p><p>MCSHANE:  All right, Nicole. Thank you, Nicole Petallides. </p><p>President Trump, meantime, moments away from speaking there. You are  looking live at a campaign rally that's been set up in the state of  Montano. Fox Business will bring you there live when the president arrives  in Great Falls. </p><p>Coming up, in the meantime, growing concern over smart TV vacuuming  people's data right out of their living room sometimes without their full  malice. We have details on that story tonight. </p><p>Also Mark Zuckerberg's Facebook apologizing for flagging a Declaration of  Independence post as hate speech. </p><p>Coming up, a guest who is not surprise by that. But first, the president is  planning a three-day visit to the U.K. That will be in a few weeks. It  comes as report out says the U.K. government told the president he can't  meet with a certain member of the European parliament. </p><p>The Brexit architect Nigel Farage. Well, Nigel Farage is here with us.  He'll react to that after this.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCSHANE:  Well, President Trump moments away from speaking at this campaign  rally that's been set up in Great Falls, Montana. As you look at the crowd  that has filed in to this venue. Remember the idea that the president going  to these states where he won the presidential election that are represented  in the United States Senate by Democrats. </p><p>In this case, Jon Tester, they try to go after a senator like a Jon Tester,  see if Republicans can take back that seat, but as always with this  campaign style rallies anything can happen. We're going to carry it live  here on Fox Business. Anything from the resignation of Scott Pruitt that we  were talking about, to the tariffs on China that go into effect midnight.</p><p>Of course, the Supreme Court pick that's expected on Monday. Anything and  everything usually can and does happen at this type of event. So we'll  carry that. </p><p>Meantime, July 12, the president planning a three-day visit to the U.K.,  where he'll meet with Prime Minister Theresa May, he's also meet with the  queen. But according to the U.K.'s Daily Telegraph, the U.K. government has  told President Trump he should not meet with the European parliament member  Nigel Farage during his visit. And you know it, Nigel Farage joins us right  now. What do you know about that? </p><p>NIGEL FARAGE, MEMBER, BRITISH PARLIAMENT:  You know, ever since I appeared  on a campaign platform with Donald Trump in Mississippi back in August 16,  the U.K. government has been paranoid about my relationship with the U.S.  president, my broader relationship with the administration. They're  embarrassed I think that I've got good relations with Donald Trump and with  many others. </p><p>And they are trying to deny the fact that I even exist. It is frankly  stupid. It is ludicrous. The truth is that relations between the U.K.  government under Mrs. May and the American administration under Trump are  not as good as they should be. </p><p>MCSHANE:  Right.</p><p>FARAGE:  And rather than banning me from meeting the president, and by the  way, I'm not sure how well he'll take to being told who we should choose to  be or not. What they should be doing is using as a bridge between the two.  I'm not sure at the moment the U.K. government is bright enough to  understand that. </p><p>MCSHANE:  So a couple things, have you been told or have you been able to  confirm the fact that this is true, that they have come out and banned you  from, you know, or try to ban you from meeting with president. And number  two, have you spoken with the president or anybody at the White House about  it. </p><p>FARAGE:  Well, in the last 18 months, ever since -- ever since the  president tweeted--</p><p>MCSHANE:  Right.</p><p>FARAGE:  -- many people in Washington think Nigel Farage would make a good  U.K. ambassador. The government in Downing Street have been climbing the  walls, that they hate me.</p><p>MCSHANE:  Right.</p><p>FARAGE:  They hate me because I force Brexit upon them. </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCSHANE:  So you met I know it's true. But you think, you have every reason  to believe based on history that it is. </p><p>FARAGE:  It is a completely consistent pattern of behavior. What I do know  is the briefing that you've read, written up in a U.K. newspaper.</p><p>MCSHANE:  Right.</p><p>FARAGE:  Where I know for fact is that it came from the prime minister's  office, so yes, it is true. I have not spoken with the president. I have  spoken should I say to people close to him. Look, I don't' to embarrass him  coming on this trip, if he wants to meet me, I'll meet him, but I won't  force it. </p><p>MCSHANE:  So you don't know whether that will happen. </p><p>FARAGE:  Well, let's wait and see. </p><p>MCSHANE:  Yes.</p><p>FARAGE:  I don't know, you don't know. And the great thing about Donald  Trump is, nobody ever, ever can, you know, predict. </p><p>MCSHANE:  Well, that's true. That's definitely true. Like him or not, you  don't know what is coming next. </p><p>FARAGE:  Absolutely.</p><p>MCSHANE:  Even at this rally in the next hour. Think about this trip,  there's a lot of -- there's been a lot of back and forth about whether it  would happen, how it would happen, would it be an official, this and that.  And then this story is getting some attention. </p><p>The mayor of London approves a request from protesters. You're already  taking in of this too. But to essentially, well here it is. To fly this  blimp, it's a blimp that designed to look like an infant President Trump  during the visit. So what do you make of that?</p><p>FARAGE:  Look, in a free society, people are able to protest. They can hold  up a placard, they can draw a cartoon.</p><p>MCSHANE:  Right.</p><p>FARAGE:  That is freedom of expression and speech and we all believe in  that. But what is happening here is that in parliament square, you know,  right in front of our ancient parliament. This blimp of Donald Trump as a  baby will be flying 100 foot in the air. And do you know why? Because Sadiq  Khan, the mayor of London, has given permission for this to happen. </p><p>I think it makes my country look like a laughingstock, there is no country  in the world that would insult the U.S. president in this way, and I would  beg, I would plead with Fox viewers, and with all Americans, please, next  Friday, when you see this ridiculous spectacle next to our parliament,  don't judge the whole of my country by it, judge Mayor Sadiq Khan by it. </p><p>MCSHANE:  Now I want to take on another issue while we have you here, Nigel  on foreign policy.</p><p>FARAGE:  Yes,</p><p>MCSHANE:  Because this is important. You know, we've been talking about a  lot of other things, but North Korea, you know, the Secretary of State Mike  Pompeo will be in there in Pyongyang, he is set to arrive there and it will  be the first time since the Singapore summit that we are going to get  together between the U.S. and North Korea.</p><p>But there have been a lot of stories here in the last week or so, right,  that have lead to some skepticism about whether Kim Jong-un really is going  to abandon his nuclear arsenal or whether he's adding to it or he's hiding  it or whatever the case might be. What do you make -- are skeptical now  after maybe reading and hearing some of this, and what do you think Mike  Pompeo can do about it? </p><p>FARAGE:  Look, you know, you have been through years of Obama making big  public declarations about things he would do, and then delivering nothing.  That's what western world politics has been like. The point about this  Trump administration is they don't just make big gestures, they try to  actually do things. </p><p>Now look, the very fact that the meeting happened was great, but what  everybody wants to see now is some action, the fact that Mike Pompeo is  back there trying to make this happen shows the will of this regime to get  a result, it doesn't guarantee a result--</p><p>MCSHANE:  Right.</p><p>FARAGE:  -- but I think Pompeo is doing exactly the right thing. </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCSHANE:  When do you, real quick, Nigel. When do you walk away, how do you  know when to walk away, you know, how do you know they are not playing you  in a situation like this? </p><p>FARAGE:  Well, all through history, you know, we've seen, you know, peace  deals, accords, and people breaking them. </p><p>MCSHANE:  Yes.</p><p>FARAGE:  I -- you know. Winston Churchill once said, jaw-jaw is ready than  war-war. And right at the moment America and North Korea are going through  jaw-jaw. Let's keep that process going as long as we possibly can. </p><p>MCSHANE:  All right, we'll continue to check in with you, Nigel.</p><p>FARAGE:  Thank you.</p><p>MCSHANE:  Maybe any update on the president's visit as well. Thank you for  joining us this evening I appreciate it. </p><p>FARAGE:  Thank you. </p><p>MCSHANE:  OK. As we said, the president is moments away now from this  rally, campaign style out in Montana. And it looks like the crowd is  getting revved up as it usually does for events like this. We're going to  bring it to you live, Fox Business, we'll show when you the president  arrives and bring you the rally. </p><p>But first, Mark Zuckerberg Facebook now reinstating a Declaration of  Independence post after it was flagged as hate speech, accidental of  course, But the details on that and what it means after a quick break. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARK ZUCKERBERG, CEO AND CO-FOUNDER, FACEBOOK:  -- voices calling for  building walls and distancing people they label as others. Instead of  building walls we can help people build bridges.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ZUCKERBERG:  We didn't take a broad enough of our responsibility and that  was a big mistake. And it was my mistake. And I'm sorry. I started  Facebook. I run it. And I'm responsible for what happens here.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCSHANE:  All right. Mark Zuckerberg, the Facebook CEO apologizing earlier  this year over the platform sharing user's personal data. Now, Facebook  apologizing to a Texas newspaper for part of the Declaration of  Independence being labeled as hate speech. </p><p>Community newspaper called the Liberty County vindicator had been posting  the whole declaration in just small daily chunks on its Facebook page for  eight days, this was in a run up to the 4th of July. But the ninth excerpt  was not posted on Monday. The paper getting an automated from Facebook,  saying that the post, quote, \"goes against our standard on hate speech.\" </p><p>Taking a look at the stock, the Facebook stock, it ended the day as most of  the market did in the green, up by about 3 percent. </p><p>Let's go to the Daily Caller News Foundation editor in chief Chris Bedford.  Good to see you, Chris. Thanks you for coming on. I appreciate it.</p><p>CHRISTOPHER BEDFORD, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, THE DAILY CALLER:  Thanks for having  me.</p><p>MCSHANE:  All right. So the offending passages such as it was, was part of  the bill of particulars and was, you know, written against King George of  Britain and it said Thomas Jefferson using the phrase quote, \"merciless  Indian savages,\" that's what got flagged, \"merciless Indian savages.\" </p><p>Vindicator's managing editor replied in an article about that, saying,  quote, \"Perhaps that Thomas Jefferson written it has Native Americans at a  challenging stage of cultural development that would have been better.\" </p><p>So, a tongue and cheek there. Unfortunately, Jefferson like British  columnist of his day did not hold an entirely friendly view of Native  American. So your reaction to all this, Chris.</p><p>BEDFORD:  It wasn't a friendly time on the frontier right then.</p><p>MCSHANE:  Right.</p><p>BEDFORD:  The British crown had been an exciting tribes in the frontier to  attack what were the American revolutionaries are towns and villages trying  cause trouble for the frontier. A lot of people actually putting up on the  left would call the Declaration of Independence a hate document. </p><p>We heard things like people putting on Twitter that the independent state  on a Wednesday which is going to make white nationalist everywhere, come to  tears and that was from an editor of Teen Vogue, but this gets caught up in  Facebook's larger machinelike algorithms.</p><p>MCSHANE:  Right.</p><p>BEDFORD:  And publishers I guess are told that they have to trust these  algorithms. The problem is of course and so like kind of like the Coca-Cola  secret formula we're not allowed to see it. We just have to take to take  their word for it, but time and time again it seems like historical thing  or conservative things get flagged as hate speech by people and shutdown  and there is no transparency at all with the massive, massive--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCSHANE:  Zuckerberg talk a lot and, you know, during a Senate House  appearance. It's about artificial intelligence, saying A.I. is going to be  able to do a lot of this force but it does bring up that question about  whether it should be doing all of it or whether human monitors would be  better.</p><p>However, as I catch myself, he obviously would have bias with human  monitors as well, right.</p><p>BEDFORD:  Yes. And you look at who they eventually, who they hired to come  on to decide what was actually going to be good news sources. And these  were retired people from CNN and from New York Times they got a pretty  strong liberal bed. There's not a single person on their news team where  they hired that you would have said I actually might agree with them  politically if you were on the conservative side of things.</p><p>And if Facebook wants to maintain the trust of a good half of the country  they are going to have to figure out bring on some of these people that may  be in Silicon Valley they view as knuckle draggers. They don't -- they  don't -- I don't think there's a lot of sympathy for conservative  sentiments over Silicon Valley.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Well to that point, Ted Cruz obviously the Republican side of --  what after Mark Zuckerberg about bias -- political bias in particular  during those hearings.  Let's take a listen to that -- back in time, then  we will talk about it.  Here it is.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  There are great many Americans who I think are deeply  concerned that Facebook and other tech companies are engaged in a pervasive  pattern of bias and political censorship.  </p><p>MARK ZUCKERBERG, CEO FACEBOOK:  I understand where that concern is coming  from, because Facebook and the tech industry are located in Silicon Valley  which is an extremely left leaning place and this is actually a concern  that I have, then I try to root out in the company is making sure that we  don't have any bias in the work that we do.  And I think it is a fair  concern.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>MCSHANE:  The only thing in this particular case, Chris, I would say, those  case we're talking about, this phrase, merciless Indian savages seems, it  is just a filter maybe that was not turned on the right way or it needs to  be readjusted in some ways as oppose to a political bias or maybe I am  wrong.  What do you think?  </p><p>BEDFORD:  Yes.  It is basically trying to call out, they have a 25 page  manual on what they define as hate speech, and one of them includes  attacking a protected group, today and maybe back in 1776, it should had  been like this.  The American Indian Conservative was a protective group  and Thomas Jefferson did not have kind thoughts about the Natives on the  Frontier.  It makes sense, it was a period of open of warfare between the  groups.  There was tribes versus colonist.  That was a different time in  the time of war.  So, it is probably just caught by a computer in this  case.  </p><p>But Facebook problem is there used to be a message board, something that  you could post anything you wanted to, and they were not responsible for  it, and then after some terrorists started using it and then especially  after Hillary Clinton lost and they blamed Facebook for it, people on left  said we need to regulate this place and make it so that Hillary Clinton can  never be disparage here again.  People on the right said, well, you don't  have a friend over here, because you have shown bias against Conservatives  and right now they are in Washington D.C. without a friend.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Right.  It is interesting.  It gives us a chance to talk about it  again.  Whether or not in this case it applauds or not they got to take a  look at all of this issues.  Good to see you, Chris. Thanks a lot.  </p><p>BEDFORD:  Thank you.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Let us go back to Montana, the President getting set to speak at  campaign rally this evening, as soon as he begins, let us look at the  arena.  We are going to bring it to you live, you know Scott Pruitt  resignation obviously at the top of the headline tonight, sometimes the  President gets to something like that when it breaks, night of other times,  avoids it entirely, we'll see,  Of course, Supreme Court and his  appointment there and another thing a lot of people are thinking about.  So  we are watching that.  First though, an Anti-Trump amend has been fired  from his job, a video, emerged of him angrily ripping a hat \"Make America  Great Again hat off a head of young boy and throwing a drink at him as he  was eating food, this happen in Texas, we are going to talk about that.   Next, Trump 2020 campaign senior adviser, Katrina Pearson will be here,  don't go away.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Breaking news just coming in to us, President Trump just arriving  moments ago air force one touched at Great Falls International Airport.   So, the President now will motorcade over once he gets out of the plane.   As the plane is just out of our camera shot at the moment, but taxing on  the tarmac there and then there will be a motorcade over to the arena in  Great Falls where the president begins a rally at the top of the next hour.   So, some 22, 23 minutes of from now we will expect that to begin usually  the President is about on time, it appears to be just about on schedule  right now with the touchdown in Montana.  </p><p>Let's bring in Trump's 2020 campaign senior adviser, Katrina Pearson, as we  wait for the president comments at the top of the hour.  I said before the  last break, Katrina that pretty much anything and everything could come up  usually does at these rallies.  The President made headlines tonight  obviously with the acceptance of the resignation as EPA administrator Scott  Pruitt has been under fire, do you think he talks something like that or is  it more focus on other subjects?  What do you expect tonight?  </p><p>KATRINA PEARSON, TRUMP 2020 CAMPAIGN SENIOR ADVISER:  Well, I think your  initial thought are absolutely correct.  The President could speak about  anything tonight, he definitely has his written speech in the teleprompter,  but if you ever have been to a Trump rally, the President is known to  really just feel the energy in the room and talk about the things that he  wants to talk about and the things in the current headlines this may come  up, he is definitely going to talk about many accomplishments that he is  making and how Democrats are failing miserably to block his agenda.  And he  is going to show support for his supporters who are constantly under attack  now, because you have Democrat politicians encourages physical  confrontation.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Right.  We'll talk about that in a second and -- you have covered  enough of these rallies, to know usually what you expect going in is not  necessarily the headline that you get coming out, because the president  will go of on some other subjects.  Maybe tonight, he gives a hint about  his Supreme Court nominee.  What do you think of that?  </p><p>PEARSON:  He may, you know, this is where the President is in his element,  he is most comfortable with his supporters, as you know.  Thousands of  people attend these rallies, some of them waiting overnight, there will be  thousands on the outside of these rallies.  And so, he really want his  supporters to really be the first to know many of these types of things,  and what is really going on.  He uses this opportunity to bypass the  mainstream media to get away from those filters on some of those other  cable news networks and talk to his supporters so they can hear directly  from him, what is going on.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  You see the supporters are gathered there waiting for President  in the next few minutes to make his way over to the arena there, to the  venue.  You mentioned some of these confrontations that had been going on.   And certainly getting a lot of the headlines, I think one, you may have  alluded to his video, it has gone viral, the guy comes up, rips a hat right  off a young man's head.  The Make America Great Again Trump hat, throwing  soda on him and what not, so, we will talk about that, but let us watch it  first.  Here it is.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  (BEEP) President.  You ain't supporting -- (BEEP).   There is no great (BEEP).  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>MCSHANE:  All right.  The man has been identified, Keno Jimenez, a  bartender work at in San Antonio, Texas at a bar there, they fired him.   The bar, they fired him of his job.  Here is the teenager that you see  there responding to the incident.  Listen.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I didn't think he would generate that amount like, not  like what people are doing, like I was looking at comments to some people  are like, of yes, this is uncalled for, and people are like, you know, with  mixed opinions, but I did not think it would blow up to what it is right  now.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Yes.  It has Katrina, blown up to become quite a story.  A  controversy that the kind of thing you are referring to, right?  </p><p>PEARSON:  Oh, absolutely.  I mean, this this case, this was a cowardly man,  this was an adult, a 30-year-old man.  Who attacked a teenager?  Kids that  ride skateboards and play video games, this is how low the left has gone.   This is more liberal buffoonery on full display, and this is happening  because you have many in the mainstream media who are constantly  mischaracterizing the President and his agenda.  Along with others  politicians on the left pushing for confrontation.  And now, there are  children involved.  But we should be surprised, because this is not the  first time.  This has been going on since the very beginning, if you  followed 2016 campaign, you saw Trump supporters get attacked violently  outside some of these rallies.  And now the media and the politics making  this worse.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Now the President's detractor said that he plays some role in it,  based on that during the campaign as well, this his language, insights  people on the other side to be aggressive against people who disagree with  him, you think, there are two sides on this or just one side?  </p><p>PEARSON:  Well, I think that, you can take anything that you don't like,  any policy that maybe does not work in your favor call it whatever you  like.  The President never encouraged people to go out in publicly confront  individuals, and if he was abrasive in any tone it was in defense of his  own supporters that were being violently attacked.  And so this kid in San  Antonio, you know Brad Parscale is from San Antonio, he is the Trump  campaign 2020 campaign manager and he tweeted today that he would like to  send this young guy a signed hat, give him a brand new MAGA hat with  President's signature, because we all stand with Trump supporters all  across the country.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Coming up lined up tonight in Montana, they will hear the  President speak at the top of the hour.  Katrina, good to see you, thank  you for coming on tonight.  We appreciate it.  </p><p>PEARSON:  Great to be here.  Thank you.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  All right.  With this rally set to begin, we will keep our eye on  it.  Of course, the warming up of the crowds seems to -- just about been  completed.  The motorcade will be on its way over to the venue in Great  Falls, Montana.  Live at the Fox Business Network when it begins.  </p><p>Also tonight, growing concern over smart TV, this is going to vacuuming  people's data right out of their living rooms.  Sometimes it happens  without their full knowledge, details on that story coming up next.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Breaking News in the State of Montana, left and right of the  scree, Air Force One, obviously on the left side of the screen with the  stairs out, the President set to leave the plane, and head to the  motorcade, and then he will by the power of that beast motorcade make his  way over to the arena in Great Falls where the presidential lectern is set  up for him to begin this rally.  </p><p>That is top of the hour, Fox Business live coverage, we'll keep an eye on  both of those live pictures.  And we will have the president's arrival and  then we will have his remarks at the top of the hour as well.  </p><p>Now, before last break we promised to talk about this crazy story involving  smart TV's that might be keeping track of more than just what you are  watching, there is some concern growing over personal data being misused by  big tech giants, Facebook alike and also by the smartphone companies, but  people's data is being taken right from their living room TV, and sometimes  it happens without them knowing about it.  Because what happens is, you  have to opt in as user agreement, but the language is confusing.  We have  it up on the screen, right now.

Our Susan Li is here  this evening with a little bit more on this, this is confusing.  What is  the company again that is doing this?  </p><p>SUSAN LI, FOX BUSINESSES:  Well, there are several companies.  The largest  one that we're focusing on is Samba TV.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Samba TV, right.  </p><p>LI:  Samba, I know it sounds very festive.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Yes.  </p><p>LI:  But really it is kind of different.  But that policy is 4,000 words,  can you believe that, the opt in is 6500 words, do you read through them.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  No.  There are a lot of times in my (inaudible) as all kinds of  things we sign our life away, you know, these contracts come up, agree,  agree.  </p><p>LI:  Right.  You just want to get it over with.  Make your life a lot  easier.  But OK.  This is what Samba TV does, you know, 45 percent of  Americans have smart television.  In their living rooms according to IHS.   I have one, I am a little scared now.  And so what Samba TV does is it  vacuums the info off your smart television, and this era of the internet  things, your TV connected to the internet, which is then connected to your  speaker, possibly to your phone as well.  So what Samba TV does, it takes  pixel by pixel, it understands what you are watching second by second.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  And then, that could be used, you know, obviously, you know,  privacy experts are concern about, but it could be used for good.  </p><p>LI:  OK.  So they can't directly sell the data, so what they do is they see  what you are watching whether it is conservative or even liberal media.   That is something that they also keep track of, and then they use -- they  target ads to your other devices.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Just like what happens on the internet.  </p><p>LI:  So you are wondering, you are watching, let us say you are watching  \"Game of thrones.\"  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Right.  What is that ad?  </p><p>LI:  And then all of the sudden something pops up on your Facebook thing.   Where did that come from?  How did they know where they listening?  </p><p>MCSHANE:  I mean, companies in TV have wanted to do this forever, they have  been jealous of the internet for doing it, but now it is really happening,  but at the same time obviously, the obvious concerns come up, people say,  well, I did not know this is going on.  </p><p>LI:  Well, yes, so the thing is, the opt in rate for Samba TV, 90 percent  according to one executive.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Those people have no clue.  They don't know what they are  clicking on.  </p><p>LI:  And a big investors are getting involved with Samba TV, as well.  Mark  Cuban, putting in money, we also have Liberty Media, and Time Warner as  well.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Now you mentioned they can't sell, so what are the restriction,  real quick.  </p><p>LI:  They can't directly sell the data, that is single restriction, but  there are big companies are working with them, like Citi and JetBlue in the  past, Expedia, Spell Advertisers with Samba TV, as well.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Sad world.  </p><p>LI:  Yes, this is the world it is, you want to target ads, you want them to  be effective, I mean, the one that get the right eyeballs.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Yes, that is it.  You have to give up something to get it I  guess.  Good to see you, Susan.  </p><p>LI:  Good to see you.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Thanks, Susan Li.  </p><p>All right.  President Trump will be speaking here, just a few minutes  really at this campaign rally, see the crowd gathered behind the lectern  with the Presidential seal on it in Montana.  Remember, he won big out  there, 20 plus points in the election and the idea is you go in the state  where you won if you are President Trump that represented by Democrats in  this case John Tester, in the Senate and you target that state.  Kayleigh  Mcenany is here, she will weigh in on that more.  Coming up next from the  RNC.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)  </p><p>MCSHANE:  News alert out in Montana.  Once again, moments away from the  president at this rally in a State carried by 20 plus points.  Let's bring  in Kayleigh Mcenany in from the RNC as we set you up for President's rally  this evening.  Good to see you, Kayleigh.  A couple of things we are  wondering about.  </p><p>KAYLEIGH MCENANY, REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE SPOKESPERSON:  Good to see  you.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Obviously about the Supreme Court, whether we will get any hint.   The president spoke briefly on Air Force One on the reporters about that  and some other topics.  I think he has it down to three possibly two is  what he is saying.  But, your thoughts on some of these picks?  I mean, we  have Judge (inaudible), they are all appeals court judges.  He is appointed  by President Bush, await away 51 years old.  You have two other picks Judge  Kavanagh, again, kind of a lot of Gorsuch comparisons there for Judge  Kavanaugh who is appointed by President Bush as well, so that is somebody  that could be considered and there is supposedly one other person in the  running as well, Judge Amy Coney.  So, if those are the three picks, can't  go wrong from your point of view or how do you view this?  </p><p>MCENANY:  that is right.  You cannot go wrong it is important to remind  everyone that these three individuals all come from that list of 25 Judges  that was put together during the campaign that was a list put together by  Trump in consultation with a guy name Leonard Leo, who is the head of the  Federalist Society and a member of the Federalist Society during my time in  Harvard law school   This organization is all about finding strict  constitutionalist to interpret the words on the page as they should mean  and their original context when put together by the founders.  All three of  these judges, Kavanaugh, and Coney they all -- Barrett, I should say Coney  Barrett, you know they all have pass this test at the Federalist Society,  and I think that that you can't go wrong.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  I am sorry, the President made some sort of remark on Air Force  One, that any of the 25 on his list would have been terrific.  But to the  point of view of conservatives that is probably true, because it is going  to that mold that you are talking about, the Federalist Society Consultant  on the entire list which we knew that going in.  </p><p>MCENANY:  That is right.  Make no mistake, each and every one of these men  and women on the list, will be demonized, the left right now is coming up  with a playbook to attack all of them, it does not matter who the nominee  is, they will say that they are going to overturn Roe v. Wade and they will  say this is rolling back the civil rights it is nonsense, but it does not  matter what the name is, you can imagine the same line of attack that are  going to come.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  No doubt.  Less of a minute left actually, this just came out, we  just got pull a report from Air Force One, the President threatening  another 300 billion in tariffs on the Chinese, with the 30 plus billion  going into effect tonight, we're in a trade war here, Kayleigh, aren't we?  </p><p>MCENANY:  You know, I think trade war, we can use that term or we can used  a grand negotiation is how I see it.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  OK.  </p><p>MCENANY:  Because I think, as the President has said China has more to lose  than we do, in fact they are the ones with a trade surplus.  We are the  ones with the deficit.  So, I hope there is an opening salvo of what will  be a long negotiation and one that will be better off for the American  worker in the long run.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  All right Kayleigh, we cut it short, I want to get the president  on time at the top of the hour.  Thanks a lot as always for coming on  tonight, we appreciate it.  </p><p>MCENANY:  Thank you, Connell.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  All right Kayleigh Mcenany, from the RNC.  The president's rally  will be getting just moments from now, Great Falls, Montana.  We'll come  back and have it live for you on Fox Business in just a moment.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)  </p><p>MCSHANE:  As we wait for the President to begin this rally in Montana.  We  said it in a number of times this evening that anything can and will happen  at this rallies.  The President talked about the resignation of his EPA  chief, Scott Pruitt on Air Force One, saying there is really no final straw  when it came to Pruitt.  He called him a terrific guy, but at the end he  said it was his decision to resign.  So, we will look for that and his  comments on the Supreme Court.  And all the other breaking news of the day,  but we thank you for joining us this evening.  It's Charles Payne now with  \"Making Money.\"  Take it away Charles.  </p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

China  now saying it is ready to respond immediately.</p><p> It's money and politics, we deliver the debate behind tomorrow's headlines.  I'm Connell McShane in for Elizabeth MacDonald.

Edward?</p><p> EDWARD LAWRENCE, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT:  Well, Connell, the president  accepted the resignation letter from Scott Pruitt about 3.30 this afternoon  Eastern Time. The president announcing the resignation as you said on  Twitter, then tweeting about what's next. </p><p> President Trump said that Andrew Wheeler will assume the acting  administrator duties of the EPA. Saying, \"I have no doubt that Andy will  continue on with our great and lasting EPA agenda. We have made tremendous  progress and the future of the EPA is very bright.\"</p><p> Now Pruitt steps down amid multiple allegations against him of abusing  power, misusing taxpayer money. Some of the issues spending $43,000 on a  sound-proof phone booth in his office spending more than $100,000 on at  least one trip with private tours the Vatican in Europe, first class  travel. It was on and on.</p><p> The reaction is coming in from Congress. Senator Bernie Sanders says,  quote, \"Scott Pruitt was the worse EPA administrator in the history of the  agenda -- history of the agency not only has he acted time and time again,  an unethical manner but he has lead the agency in the wrong direction.\" </p><p> Senator Chuck Grassley saying the president did the right thing in taking  the resignation letter. Now in the resignation letter Pruitt says that it's  effective tomorrow. </p><p> And he adds that \"It is extremely difficult for me to see serving you in  this role first because I count it a blessing to serve you in any capacity,  but also because of the transformative work that is coming out. However,  the unrelenting attacks on me personally, my family are unprecedented and  have taken a sizable toll on us.\" </p><p> Several ethics investigation have been open into Pruitt. In fact, some  lawmakers on Capitol Hill have even asked the inspector general to get  involved. Now it's unclear what happens to all of those probes. Connell?</p><p> MCSHANE:  That's the thing. I mean, it could be some legal issues down the  line and the rest of it. Edward, thanks. Edward Lawrence in D.C.</p><p> Straight to Bush 43, deputy assistant Brad Blakeman joins us this evening.  And we're looking as well at the countdown to midnight which I talk about  it a few minutes on the trade war fears. But Brad, let's get straight now  to the breaking news on the resignation of Scott Pruitt. </p><p> As Edward talked about, you know, there are all kinds of scandals, right,  by some counts it could be a dozen or more of them. So the obvious first  question would be, in a situation like this what took so long? </p><p> BRAD BLAKEMAN, FORMER PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH'S DEPUTY ASSISTANT:   Absolutely, this guy should have been gone a long time ago, but I'm glad  the president cleaned the air at the EPA as far as administration is  concerned. The good news is the acting administrator Wheeler will do a  fantastic job. And we're not going to hear the baggage and the drama that  came with Pruitt.</p><p> MCSHANE:  Right.</p><p> BLAKEMAN:  He is a guy who is well-known in Washington, very respected  environment attorney and energy lobbyist. He is somebody with a long  history while serving the nation and also serving the private sector. So I  expect nothing will change. The president I think will have a better  opportunity to pass his agenda without the -- without the constant  headline. </p><p> MCSHANE:  That's kind of what makes this all the more puzzling or  intriguing or whatever you want to call it, is that you are probably right,  nothing will change which goes back to the first question, what took so  long. Because if the president knows that. I would presume he does, or that  is indeed the case, you know, wouldn't you wanted to -- wouldn't you have  wanted to do this much, much sooner at least put it behind you if the  policies are going to remain the same. He probably will. </p><p> BLAKEMAN:  Yes, I think that the president probably in case was loyal to a  fault.</p><p> MCSHANE:  Yes.</p><p> BLAKEMAN:  He was maybe too loyal to somebody who didn't deserve it. But  clearly it's the right decision now, and I think it will be welcomed within  the EPA. </p><p> MCSHANE:  Now the thing about this story for, you know, our audience, our  business audience, to think matters the most is what does that mean for  business, what does it mean for regulation. </p><p> You're making the point that Pruitt's deputy, the acting administrator will  continue with the same policies. Anything down the line, you know, in terms  of he's already been confirmed by the Senate, right. So he come to any type  of hurdles that could come in to play here where the administration's, you  know, policies come up against it or just status quo. </p><p> BLAKEMAN:  Well, the question is, how long will he serve as an acting  administrator. Will the president nominates somebody to replace him or will  he be actually elevated to the administrator of the EPA.</p><p> My hope is that the president will elevate him. Because he's a known  commodity, he's well-known, he's well-respected. And again, I think he is  in tune with the president' feeling of deregulation and giving more power  to the private sector. And if you want that done then I think this guy  probably should be elevated. </p><p> MCSHANE:  Right. Because the idea, and that's what, you know, Democrat like  Bernie Sanders which was the statement was read by Edward that the -- that  this was the worst administrator of all-time, that he'd been leading the  agency in the wrong direction. I mean, that's a political point of view but  that won't change because of this. I mean, this whole deregulatory agenda  continues pretty much--</p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> BLAKEMAN:  Right. Bernie Sanders is against the guy, I can assure you he is  probably doing the right thing, so we're not looking for any endorsements  by Bernie Sanders. </p><p> MCSHANE:  It's kind of interesting but again, the scandals some of them  were downright silly, I think that, you know, that were brought up, but  some of these other things that somebody in this position would allow  themselves to have endured. I mean, the $40,000 phone both for one. </p><p> BLAKEMAN:  Crazy. </p><p> MCSHANE:  I mean, it doesn't make any sense, though. It would go on and on.  And then the other thing that, and the president campaigned on this of  draining the swamp. I mean, you got a guy in here, let's be honest, asking  his own age allegedly to go out and help his wife get like a 200 grand a  year job and all that kind of thing was going on, you know, that's not  exactly draining the swamp. </p><p> BLAKEMAN:  Well, there is an illness in Washington that can affect cabinet  members and low level staffers, that is Potomac River.</p><p> MCSHANE:  Yes.</p><p> BLAKEMAN:  When you get it, it's deadly. I've seen it happen to people. And  here Pruitt was an outsider, former attorney general of Oklahoma, he should  know better but he came to Washington, and he caught it. And it's fatal. </p><p> MCSHANE:  There's no -- right. There's no known cure that we know of. </p><p> BLAKEMAN:  Nope. </p><p> MCSHANE:  Other than getting out which he will now do. Now I want to get  you on a couple of other topics, or at least this big one tonight. We have  the countdown clock on, right, so midnight. And the U.S. is said to impose  these tariffs. It's $34 billion on imported Chinese machinery, automakers,  and medical devices. </p><p> And as we would expect the Chinese have said they are going to come right  back at us respond immediately. So the markets we didn't see much today. I  mean, there were some reports that trade deals might be worked with the  Europeans might have help stocks a bit. But this is certainly an issue. </p><p> Our own Maria Bartiromo spoke about all of this with the president  recently. Let's listen then we'll come back and talk about it. Here it is.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  We have -- we don't have a  trade deal with China, we have a deal. Nobody bothered to make a deal, and  they'll charge 25 percent for a car, and we use 2.5 percent. And you'll be  using those numbers on your show so I don't want to bore people. But we  have a -- some of the worst trade deals in the world. We are losing money  with everybody.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> MCSHANE:  This might be the one area, Brad, immigration maybe as well. But  this probably the one area that this president has really changed the  thinking of the Republican Party certainly different than it was when you  were serving in President Bush's administration. What do you make of the  moves? </p><p> BLAKEMAN:  I think the president is absolutely right, China is a schoolyard  bully who has been, you know, knocking us around, and either you can take  it or you can stand up to the bully. And we have $400 billion deficit with  China. That is just crazy.</p><p> We're the strongest most powerful economy in the world, and we're letting  China and others, friend and foe, take advantage of us. I think the  president is smart. Now it may cause us a little pain initially, but the  gains are going to be well worth what we'll have to go through. </p><p> China like most bullies I predict will back down. They can't afford to go  to war with America.</p><p> MCSHANE:  Right.</p><p> BLAKEMAN:  Those countries can't. And look, I think the president is going  to make the best deal he can for the American people, we should be dealing  bilaterally not with through this multilateral negotiations because it  erodes our power and leverage. </p><p> MCSHANE:  To some extent though, Brad, the question is, say you are right  that they do back down, the question is when, and how long are the Chinese  willing to kind of let this play out for, because that to your point does,  you know, lead us into a situation where we might have to deal with maybe  more pain than many Americans know they're going to have to deal with now. </p><p> And many of those Americans by the way supported the president when he ran  for office. Think about farmers, think about people he's speaking to  tonight at this rally in Montano. These policies he is putting in place  could hurt people that supported him, right. </p><p> BLAKEMAN:  Well, we're getting screwed, to a tune of almost half a trillion  dollars. That's unacceptable. And what is Trump trying to do is he's trying  to stand up for American jobs. We have to be behind the president. This is  thinking long-term. </p><p> You know, I have a new word that diagnosis America's problems, it's called  a momentarium. Living in the moment. Great leaders provide for the moment  but they plan for our future. Trump is not only looking to take care of us  today but he's looking to safeguard us for tomorrow. </p><p> MCSHANE:  We'll talk about it tomorrow literally because this go into  effect tonight. Good to see you, Brad, as always. Thanks a lot. </p><p> BLAKEMAN:  Pleasure.</p><p> MCSHANE:  All right. Brad Blakeman. Let's get back and check in on those  markets. We mention the Dow closing in the green today with that more than  180 point rally. Job growth continuing into the summer months. ADP  announced that business added 177,000 jobs in the month of June. So that  was one of the economic data points. </p><p> Our own Nicole Petallides, as usual on the floor of the New York Stock  Exchange with the wrap up. Nicole? </p><p> NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Up arrows across the board. The  Dow gained 182 points. The NASDAQ up 1.1 percent. We heard from federal  open market committee pretty much on pace for those for the rate hikes but  some trade uncertainly and that weighed. </p><p> Also we saw movement in energy and oil as President Donald Trump tweeted  his concerns about OPEC monopoly, and saying that gasoline prices on the  rise up about 60 cents year-over-year. </p><p> And some doubts are growing pertaining to the Aramco IPO, will it ever  happen. According to the Wall Street journal it was very hot, it could be  the largest IPO, a $100 million. And the reports are that it has stalled.  And the company is not making any comment. Back to you.</p><p> MCSHANE:  All right, Nicole. Thank you, Nicole Petallides. </p><p> President Trump, meantime, moments away from speaking there. You are  looking live at a campaign rally that's been set up in the state of  Montano. Fox Business will bring you there live when the president arrives  in Great Falls. </p><p> Coming up, in the meantime, growing concern over smart TV vacuuming  people's data right out of their living room sometimes without their full  malice. We have details on that story tonight. </p><p> Also Mark Zuckerberg's Facebook apologizing for flagging a Declaration of  Independence post as hate speech. </p><p> Coming up, a guest who is not surprise by that. But first, the president is  planning a three-day visit to the U.K. That will be in a few weeks. It  comes as report out says the U.K. government told the president he can't  meet with a certain member of the European parliament. </p><p> The Brexit architect Nigel Farage. Well, Nigel Farage is here with us.  He'll react to that after this.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MCSHANE:  Well, President Trump moments away from speaking at this campaign  rally that's been set up in Great Falls, Montana. As you look at the crowd  that has filed in to this venue. Remember the idea that the president going  to these states where he won the presidential election that are represented  in the United States Senate by Democrats. </p><p> In this case, Jon Tester, they try to go after a senator like a Jon Tester,  see if Republicans can take back that seat, but as always with this  campaign style rallies anything can happen. We're going to carry it live  here on Fox Business. Anything from the resignation of Scott Pruitt that we  were talking about, to the tariffs on China that go into effect midnight.</p><p> Of course, the Supreme Court pick that's expected on Monday. Anything and  everything usually can and does happen at this type of event. So we'll  carry that. </p><p> Meantime, July 12, the president planning a three-day visit to the U.K.,  where he'll meet with Prime Minister Theresa May, he's also meet with the  queen. But according to the U.K.'s Daily Telegraph, the U.K. government has  told President Trump he should not meet with the European parliament member  Nigel Farage during his visit. And you know it, Nigel Farage joins us right  now. What do you know about that? </p><p> NIGEL FARAGE, MEMBER, BRITISH PARLIAMENT:  You know, ever since I appeared  on a campaign platform with Donald Trump in Mississippi back in August 16,  the U.K. government has been paranoid about my relationship with the U.S.  president, my broader relationship with the administration. They're  embarrassed I think that I've got good relations with Donald Trump and with  many others. </p><p> And they are trying to deny the fact that I even exist. It is frankly  stupid. It is ludicrous. The truth is that relations between the U.K.  government under Mrs. May and the American administration under Trump are  not as good as they should be. </p><p> MCSHANE:  Right.</p><p> FARAGE:  And rather than banning me from meeting the president, and by the  way, I'm not sure how well he'll take to being told who we should choose to  be or not. What they should be doing is using as a bridge between the two.  I'm not sure at the moment the U.K. government is bright enough to  understand that. </p><p> MCSHANE:  So a couple things, have you been told or have you been able to  confirm the fact that this is true, that they have come out and banned you  from, you know, or try to ban you from meeting with president. And number  two, have you spoken with the president or anybody at the White House about  it. </p><p> FARAGE:  Well, in the last 18 months, ever since -- ever since the  president tweeted--</p><p> MCSHANE:  Right.</p><p> FARAGE:  -- many people in Washington think Nigel Farage would make a good  U.K. ambassador. The government in Downing Street have been climbing the  walls, that they hate me.</p><p> MCSHANE:  Right.</p><p> FARAGE:  They hate me because I force Brexit upon them. </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> MCSHANE:  So you met I know it's true. But you think, you have every reason  to believe based on history that it is. </p><p> FARAGE:  It is a completely consistent pattern of behavior. What I do know  is the briefing that you've read, written up in a U.K. newspaper.</p><p> MCSHANE:  Right.</p><p> FARAGE:  Where I know for fact is that it came from the prime minister's  office, so yes, it is true. I have not spoken with the president. I have  spoken should I say to people close to him. Look, I don't' to embarrass him  coming on this trip, if he wants to meet me, I'll meet him, but I won't  force it. </p><p> MCSHANE:  So you don't know whether that will happen. </p><p> FARAGE:  Well, let's wait and see. </p><p> MCSHANE:  Yes.</p><p> FARAGE:  I don't know, you don't know. And the great thing about Donald  Trump is, nobody ever, ever can, you know, predict. </p><p> MCSHANE:  Well, that's true. That's definitely true. Like him or not, you  don't know what is coming next. </p><p> FARAGE:  Absolutely.</p><p> MCSHANE:  Even at this rally in the next hour. Think about this trip,  there's a lot of -- there's been a lot of back and forth about whether it  would happen, how it would happen, would it be an official, this and that.  And then this story is getting some attention. </p><p> The mayor of London approves a request from protesters. You're already  taking in of this too. But to essentially, well here it is. To fly this  blimp, it's a blimp that designed to look like an infant President Trump  during the visit. So what do you make of that?</p><p> FARAGE:  Look, in a free society, people are able to protest. They can hold  up a placard, they can draw a cartoon.</p><p> MCSHANE:  Right.</p><p> FARAGE:  That is freedom of expression and speech and we all believe in  that. But what is happening here is that in parliament square, you know,  right in front of our ancient parliament. This blimp of Donald Trump as a  baby will be flying 100 foot in the air. And do you know why? Because Sadiq  Khan, the mayor of London, has given permission for this to happen. </p><p> I think it makes my country look like a laughingstock, there is no country  in the world that would insult the U.S. president in this way, and I would  beg, I would plead with Fox viewers, and with all Americans, please, next  Friday, when you see this ridiculous spectacle next to our parliament,  don't judge the whole of my country by it, judge Mayor Sadiq Khan by it. </p><p> MCSHANE:  Now I want to take on another issue while we have you here, Nigel  on foreign policy.</p><p> FARAGE:  Yes,</p><p> MCSHANE:  Because this is important. You know, we've been talking about a  lot of other things, but North Korea, you know, the Secretary of State Mike  Pompeo will be in there in Pyongyang, he is set to arrive there and it will  be the first time since the Singapore summit that we are going to get  together between the U.S. and North Korea.</p><p> But there have been a lot of stories here in the last week or so, right,  that have lead to some skepticism about whether Kim Jong-un really is going  to abandon his nuclear arsenal or whether he's adding to it or he's hiding  it or whatever the case might be. What do you make -- are skeptical now  after maybe reading and hearing some of this, and what do you think Mike  Pompeo can do about it? </p><p> FARAGE:  Look, you know, you have been through years of Obama making big  public declarations about things he would do, and then delivering nothing.  That's what western world politics has been like. The point about this  Trump administration is they don't just make big gestures, they try to  actually do things. </p><p> Now look, the very fact that the meeting happened was great, but what  everybody wants to see now is some action, the fact that Mike Pompeo is  back there trying to make this happen shows the will of this regime to get  a result, it doesn't guarantee a result--</p><p> MCSHANE:  Right.</p><p> FARAGE:  -- but I think Pompeo is doing exactly the right thing. </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> MCSHANE:  When do you, real quick, Nigel. When do you walk away, how do you  know when to walk away, you know, how do you know they are not playing you  in a situation like this? </p><p> FARAGE:  Well, all through history, you know, we've seen, you know, peace  deals, accords, and people breaking them. </p><p> MCSHANE:  Yes.</p><p> FARAGE:  I -- you know. Winston Churchill once said, jaw-jaw is ready than  war-war. And right at the moment America and North Korea are going through  jaw-jaw. Let's keep that process going as long as we possibly can. </p><p> MCSHANE:  All right, we'll continue to check in with you, Nigel.</p><p> FARAGE:  Thank you.</p><p> MCSHANE:  Maybe any update on the president's visit as well. Thank you for  joining us this evening I appreciate it. </p><p> FARAGE:  Thank you. </p><p> MCSHANE:  OK. As we said, the president is moments away now from this  rally, campaign style out in Montana. And it looks like the crowd is  getting revved up as it usually does for events like this. We're going to  bring it to you live, Fox Business, we'll show when you the president  arrives and bring you the rally. </p><p> But first, Mark Zuckerberg Facebook now reinstating a Declaration of  Independence post after it was flagged as hate speech, accidental of  course, But the details on that and what it means after a quick break. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MARK ZUCKERBERG, CEO AND CO-FOUNDER, FACEBOOK:  -- voices calling for  building walls and distancing people they label as others. Instead of  building walls we can help people build bridges.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> ZUCKERBERG:  We didn't take a broad enough of our responsibility and that  was a big mistake. And it was my mistake. And I'm sorry. I started  Facebook. I run it. And I'm responsible for what happens here.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MCSHANE:  All right. Mark Zuckerberg, the Facebook CEO apologizing earlier  this year over the platform sharing user's personal data. Now, Facebook  apologizing to a Texas newspaper for part of the Declaration of  Independence being labeled as hate speech. </p><p> Community newspaper called the Liberty County vindicator had been posting  the whole declaration in just small daily chunks on its Facebook page for  eight days, this was in a run up to the 4th of July. But the ninth excerpt  was not posted on Monday. The paper getting an automated from Facebook,  saying that the post, quote, \"goes against our standard on hate speech.\" </p><p> Taking a look at the stock, the Facebook stock, it ended the day as most of  the market did in the green, up by about 3 percent. </p><p> Let's go to the Daily Caller News Foundation editor in chief Chris Bedford.  Good to see you, Chris. Thanks you for coming on. I appreciate it.</p><p> CHRISTOPHER BEDFORD, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, THE DAILY CALLER:  Thanks for having  me.</p><p> MCSHANE:  All right. So the offending passages such as it was, was part of  the bill of particulars and was, you know, written against King George of  Britain and it said Thomas Jefferson using the phrase quote, \"merciless  Indian savages,\" that's what got flagged, \"merciless Indian savages.\" </p><p> Vindicator's managing editor replied in an article about that, saying,  quote, \"Perhaps that Thomas Jefferson written it has Native Americans at a  challenging stage of cultural development that would have been better.\" </p><p> So, a tongue and cheek there. Unfortunately, Jefferson like British  columnist of his day did not hold an entirely friendly view of Native  American. So your reaction to all this, Chris.</p><p> BEDFORD:  It wasn't a friendly time on the frontier right then.</p><p> MCSHANE:  Right.</p><p> BEDFORD:  The British crown had been an exciting tribes in the frontier to  attack what were the American revolutionaries are towns and villages trying  cause trouble for the frontier. A lot of people actually putting up on the  left would call the Declaration of Independence a hate document. </p><p> We heard things like people putting on Twitter that the independent state  on a Wednesday which is going to make white nationalist everywhere, come to  tears and that was from an editor of Teen Vogue, but this gets caught up in  Facebook's larger machinelike algorithms.</p><p> MCSHANE:  Right.</p><p> BEDFORD:  And publishers I guess are told that they have to trust these  algorithms. The problem is of course and so like kind of like the Coca-Cola  secret formula we're not allowed to see it. We just have to take to take  their word for it, but time and time again it seems like historical thing  or conservative things get flagged as hate speech by people and shutdown  and there is no transparency at all with the massive, massive--</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> MCSHANE:  Zuckerberg talk a lot and, you know, during a Senate House  appearance. It's about artificial intelligence, saying A.I. is going to be  able to do a lot of this force but it does bring up that question about  whether it should be doing all of it or whether human monitors would be  better.</p><p> However, as I catch myself, he obviously would have bias with human  monitors as well, right.</p><p> BEDFORD:  Yes. And you look at who they eventually, who they hired to come  on to decide what was actually going to be good news sources. And these  were retired people from CNN and from New York Times they got a pretty  strong liberal bed. There's not a single person on their news team where  they hired that you would have said I actually might agree with them  politically if you were on the conservative side of things.</p><p> And if Facebook wants to maintain the trust of a good half of the country  they are going to have to figure out bring on some of these people that may  be in Silicon Valley they view as knuckle draggers. They don't -- they  don't -- I don't think there's a lot of sympathy for conservative  sentiments over Silicon Valley.  </p><p> MCSHANE:  Well to that point, Ted Cruz obviously the Republican side of --  what after Mark Zuckerberg about bias -- political bias in particular  during those hearings.  Let's take a listen to that -- back in time, then  we will talk about it.  Here it is.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  There are great many Americans who I think are deeply  concerned that Facebook and other tech companies are engaged in a pervasive  pattern of bias and political censorship.  </p><p> MARK ZUCKERBERG, CEO FACEBOOK:  I understand where that concern is coming  from, because Facebook and the tech industry are located in Silicon Valley  which is an extremely left leaning place and this is actually a concern  that I have, then I try to root out in the company is making sure that we  don't have any bias in the work that we do.  And I think it is a fair  concern.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> MCSHANE:  The only thing in this particular case, Chris, I would say, those  case we're talking about, this phrase, merciless Indian savages seems, it  is just a filter maybe that was not turned on the right way or it needs to  be readjusted in some ways as oppose to a political bias or maybe I am  wrong.  What do you think?  </p><p> BEDFORD:  Yes.  It is basically trying to call out, they have a 25 page  manual on what they define as hate speech, and one of them includes  attacking a protected group, today and maybe back in 1776, it should had  been like this.  The American Indian Conservative was a protective group  and Thomas Jefferson did not have kind thoughts about the Natives on the  Frontier.  It makes sense, it was a period of open of warfare between the  groups.  There was tribes versus colonist.  That was a different time in  the time of war.  So, it is probably just caught by a computer in this  case.  </p><p> But Facebook problem is there used to be a message board, something that  you could post anything you wanted to, and they were not responsible for  it, and then after some terrorists started using it and then especially  after Hillary Clinton lost and they blamed Facebook for it, people on left  said we need to regulate this place and make it so that Hillary Clinton can  never be disparage here again.  People on the right said, well, you don't  have a friend over here, because you have shown bias against Conservatives  and right now they are in Washington D.C. without a friend.  </p><p> MCSHANE:  Right.  It is interesting.  It gives us a chance to talk about it  again.  Whether or not in this case it applauds or not they got to take a  look at all of this issues.  Good to see you, Chris. Thanks a lot.  </p><p> BEDFORD:  Thank you.  </p><p> MCSHANE:  Let us go back to Montana, the President getting set to speak at  campaign rally this evening, as soon as he begins, let us look at the  arena.  We are going to bring it to you live, you know Scott Pruitt  resignation obviously at the top of the headline tonight, sometimes the  President gets to something like that when it breaks, night of other times,  avoids it entirely, we'll see,  Of course, Supreme Court and his  appointment there and another thing a lot of people are thinking about.  So  we are watching that.  First though, an Anti-Trump amend has been fired  from his job, a video, emerged of him angrily ripping a hat \"Make America  Great Again hat off a head of young boy and throwing a drink at him as he  was eating food, this happen in Texas, we are going to talk about that.   Next, Trump 2020 campaign senior adviser, Katrina Pearson will be here,  don't go away.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  </p><p> MCSHANE:  Breaking news just coming in to us, President Trump just arriving  moments ago air force one touched at Great Falls International Airport.   So, the President now will motorcade over once he gets out of the plane.   As the plane is just out of our camera shot at the moment, but taxing on  the tarmac there and then there will be a motorcade over to the arena in  Great Falls where the president begins a rally at the top of the next hour.   So, some 22, 23 minutes of from now we will expect that to begin usually  the President is about on time, it appears to be just about on schedule  right now with the touchdown in Montana.  </p><p> Let's bring in Trump's 2020 campaign senior adviser, Katrina Pearson, as we  wait for the president comments at the top of the hour.  I said before the  last break, Katrina that pretty much anything and everything could come up  usually does at these rallies.  The President made headlines tonight  obviously with the acceptance of the resignation as EPA administrator Scott  Pruitt has been under fire, do you think he talks something like that or is  it more focus on other subjects?  What do you expect tonight?  </p><p> KATRINA PEARSON, TRUMP 2020 CAMPAIGN SENIOR ADVISER:  Well, I think your  initial thought are absolutely correct.  The President could speak about  anything tonight, he definitely has his written speech in the teleprompter,  but if you ever have been to a Trump rally, the President is known to  really just feel the energy in the room and talk about the things that he  wants to talk about and the things in the current headlines this may come  up, he is definitely going to talk about many accomplishments that he is  making and how Democrats are failing miserably to block his agenda.  And he  is going to show support for his supporters who are constantly under attack  now, because you have Democrat politicians encourages physical  confrontation.  </p><p> MCSHANE:  Right.  We'll talk about that in a second and -- you have covered  enough of these rallies, to know usually what you expect going in is not  necessarily the headline that you get coming out, because the president  will go of on some other subjects.  Maybe tonight, he gives a hint about  his Supreme Court nominee.  What do you think of that?  </p><p> PEARSON:  He may, you know, this is where the President is in his element,  he is most comfortable with his supporters, as you know.  Thousands of  people attend these rallies, some of them waiting overnight, there will be  thousands on the outside of these rallies.  And so, he really want his  supporters to really be the first to know many of these types of things,  and what is really going on.  He uses this opportunity to bypass the  mainstream media to get away from those filters on some of those other  cable news networks and talk to his supporters so they can hear directly  from him, what is going on.  </p><p> MCSHANE:  You see the supporters are gathered there waiting for President  in the next few minutes to make his way over to the arena there, to the  venue.  You mentioned some of these confrontations that had been going on.   And certainly getting a lot of the headlines, I think one, you may have  alluded to his video, it has gone viral, the guy comes up, rips a hat right  off a young man's head.  The Make America Great Again Trump hat, throwing  soda on him and what not, so, we will talk about that, but let us watch it  first.  Here it is.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  (BEEP) President.  You ain't supporting -- (BEEP).   There is no great (BEEP).  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> MCSHANE:  All right.  The man has been identified, Keno Jimenez, a  bartender work at in San Antonio, Texas at a bar there, they fired him.   The bar, they fired him of his job.  Here is the teenager that you see  there responding to the incident.  Listen.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I didn't think he would generate that amount like, not  like what people are doing, like I was looking at comments to some people  are like, of yes, this is uncalled for, and people are like, you know, with  mixed opinions, but I did not think it would blow up to what it is right  now.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> MCSHANE:  Yes.  It has Katrina, blown up to become quite a story.  A  controversy that the kind of thing you are referring to, right?  </p><p> PEARSON:  Oh, absolutely.  I mean, this this case, this was a cowardly man,  this was an adult, a 30-year-old man.  Who attacked a teenager?  Kids that  ride skateboards and play video games, this is how low the left has gone.   This is more liberal buffoonery on full display, and this is happening  because you have many in the mainstream media who are constantly  mischaracterizing the President and his agenda.  Along with others  politicians on the left pushing for confrontation.  And now, there are  children involved.  But we should be surprised, because this is not the  first time.  This has been going on since the very beginning, if you  followed 2016 campaign, you saw Trump supporters get attacked violently  outside some of these rallies.  And now the media and the politics making  this worse.  </p><p> MCSHANE:  Now the President's detractor said that he plays some role in it,  based on that during the campaign as well, this his language, insights  people on the other side to be aggressive against people who disagree with  him, you think, there are two sides on this or just one side?  </p><p> PEARSON:  Well, I think that, you can take anything that you don't like,  any policy that maybe does not work in your favor call it whatever you  like.  The President never encouraged people to go out in publicly confront  individuals, and if he was abrasive in any tone it was in defense of his  own supporters that were being violently attacked.  And so this kid in San  Antonio, you know Brad Parscale is from San Antonio, he is the Trump  campaign 2020 campaign manager and he tweeted today that he would like to  send this young guy a signed hat, give him a brand new MAGA hat with  President's signature, because we all stand with Trump supporters all  across the country.  </p><p> MCSHANE:  Coming up lined up tonight in Montana, they will hear the  President speak at the top of the hour.  Katrina, good to see you, thank  you for coming on tonight.  We appreciate it.  </p><p> PEARSON:  Great to be here.  Thank you.  </p><p> MCSHANE:  All right.  With this rally set to begin, we will keep our eye on  it.  Of course, the warming up of the crowds seems to -- just about been  completed.  The motorcade will be on its way over to the venue in Great  Falls, Montana.  Live at the Fox Business Network when it begins.  </p><p> Also tonight, growing concern over smart TV, this is going to vacuuming  people's data right out of their living rooms.  Sometimes it happens  without their full knowledge, details on that story coming up next.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  </p><p> MCSHANE:  Breaking News in the State of Montana, left and right of the  scree, Air Force One, obviously on the left side of the screen with the  stairs out, the President set to leave the plane, and head to the  motorcade, and then he will by the power of that beast motorcade make his  way over to the arena in Great Falls where the presidential lectern is set  up for him to begin this rally.  </p><p> That is top of the hour, Fox Business live coverage, we'll keep an eye on  both of those live pictures.  And we will have the president's arrival and  then we will have his remarks at the top of the hour as well.  </p><p> Now, before last break we promised to talk about this crazy story involving  smart TV's that might be keeping track of more than just what you are  watching, there is some concern growing over personal data being misused by  big tech giants, Facebook alike and also by the smartphone companies, but  people's data is being taken right from their living room TV, and sometimes  it happens without them knowing about it.  Because what happens is, you  have to opt in as user agreement, but the language is confusing.  We have  it up on the screen, right now.  Reading in part, interact with your  favorite TV shows, get recommendation base on the content you love, connect  your devices for exclusive content special offers.  Our Susan Li is here  this evening with a little bit more on this, this is confusing.  What is  the company again that is doing this?  </p><p> SUSAN LI, FOX BUSINESSES:  Well, there are several companies.  The largest  one that we're focusing on is Samba TV.  </p><p> MCSHANE:  Samba TV, right.  </p><p> LI:  Samba, I know it sounds very festive.  </p><p> MCSHANE:  Yes.  </p><p> LI:  But really it is kind of different.  But that policy is 4,000 words,  can you believe that, the opt in is 6500 words, do you read through them.  </p><p> MCSHANE:  No.  There are a lot of times in my (inaudible) as all kinds of  things we sign our life away, you know, these contracts come up, agree,  agree.  </p><p> LI:  Right.  You just want to get it over with.  Make your life a lot  easier.  But OK.  This is what Samba TV does, you know, 45 percent of  Americans have smart television.  In their living rooms according to IHS.   I have one, I am a little scared now.  And so what Samba TV does is it  vacuums the info off your smart television, and this era of the internet  things, your TV connected to the internet, which is then connected to your  speaker, possibly to your phone as well.  So what Samba TV does, it takes  pixel by pixel, it understands what you are watching second by second.  </p><p> MCSHANE:  And then, that could be used, you know, obviously, you know,  privacy experts are concern about, but it could be used for good.  </p><p> LI:  OK.  So they can't directly sell the data, so what they do is they see  what you are watching whether it is conservative or even liberal media.   That is something that they also keep track of, and then they use -- they  target ads to your other devices.  </p><p> MCSHANE:  Just like what happens on the internet.  </p><p> LI:  So you are wondering, you are watching, let us say you are watching  \"Game of thrones.\"  </p><p> MCSHANE:  Right.  What is that ad?  </p><p> LI:  And then all of the sudden something pops up on your Facebook thing.   Where did that come from?  How did they know where they listening?  </p><p> MCSHANE:  I mean, companies in TV have wanted to do this forever, they have  been jealous of the internet for doing it, but now it is really happening,  but at the same time obviously, the obvious concerns come up, people say,  well, I did not know this is going on.  </p><p> LI:  Well, yes, so the thing is, the opt in rate for Samba TV, 90 percent  according to one executive.  </p><p> MCSHANE:  Those people have no clue.  They don't know what they are  clicking on.  </p><p> LI:  And a big investors are getting involved with Samba TV, as well.  Mark  Cuban, putting in money, we also have Liberty Media, and Time Warner as  well.  </p><p> MCSHANE:  Now you mentioned they can't sell, so what are the restriction,  real quick.  </p><p> LI:  They can't directly sell the data, that is single restriction, but  there are big companies are working with them, like Citi and JetBlue in the  past, Expedia, Spell Advertisers with Samba TV, as well.  </p><p> MCSHANE:  Sad world.  </p><p> LI:  Yes, this is the world it is, you want to target ads, you want them to  be effective, I mean, the one that get the right eyeballs.  </p><p> MCSHANE:  Yes, that is it.  You have to give up something to get it I  guess.  Good to see you, Susan.  </p><p> LI:  Good to see you.  </p><p> MCSHANE:  Thanks, Susan Li.  </p><p> All right.  President Trump will be speaking here, just a few minutes  really at this campaign rally, see the crowd gathered behind the lectern  with the Presidential seal on it in Montana.  Remember, he won big out  there, 20 plus points in the election and the idea is you go in the state  where you won if you are President Trump that represented by Democrats in  this case John Tester, in the Senate and you target that state.  Kayleigh  Mcenany is here, she will weigh in on that more.  Coming up next from the  RNC.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  </p><p> MCSHANE:  News alert out in Montana.  Once again, moments away from the  president at this rally in a State carried by 20 plus points.  Let's bring  in Kayleigh Mcenany in from the RNC as we set you up for President's rally  this evening.  Good to see you, Kayleigh.  A couple of things we are  wondering about.  </p><p> KAYLEIGH MCENANY, REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE SPOKESPERSON:  Good to see  you.  </p><p> MCSHANE:  Obviously about the Supreme Court, whether we will get any hint.   The president spoke briefly on Air Force One on the reporters about that  and some other topics.  I think he has it down to three possibly two is  what he is saying.  But, your thoughts on some of these picks?  I mean, we  have Judge (inaudible), they are all appeals court judges.  He is appointed  by President Bush, await away 51 years old.  You have two other picks Judge  Kavanagh, again, kind of a lot of Gorsuch comparisons there for Judge  Kavanaugh who is appointed by President Bush as well, so that is somebody  that could be considered and there is supposedly one other person in the  running as well, Judge Amy Coney.  So, if those are the three picks, can't  go wrong from your point of view or how do you view this?  </p><p> MCENANY:  that is right.  You cannot go wrong it is important to remind  everyone that these three individuals all come from that list of 25 Judges  that was put together during the campaign that was a list put together by  Trump in consultation with a guy name Leonard Leo, who is the head of the  Federalist Society and a member of the Federalist Society during my time in  Harvard law school   This organization is all about finding strict  constitutionalist to interpret the words on the page as they should mean  and their original context when put together by the founders.  All three of  these judges, Kavanaugh, and Coney they all -- Barrett, I should say Coney  Barrett, you know they all have pass this test at the Federalist Society,  and I think that that you can't go wrong.  </p><p> MCSHANE:  I am sorry, the President made some sort of remark on Air Force  One, that any of the 25 on his list would have been terrific.  But to the  point of view of conservatives that is probably true, because it is going  to that mold that you are talking about, the Federalist Society Consultant  on the entire list which we knew that going in.  </p><p> MCENANY:  That is right.  Make no mistake, each and every one of these men  and women on the list, will be demonized, the left right now is coming up  with a playbook to attack all of them, it does not matter who the nominee  is, they will say that they are going to overturn Roe v. Wade and they will  say this is rolling back the civil rights it is nonsense, but it does not  matter what the name is, you can imagine the same line of attack that are  going to come.  </p><p> MCSHANE:  No doubt.  Less of a minute left actually, this just came out, we  just got pull a report from Air Force One, the President threatening  another 300 billion in tariffs on the Chinese, with the 30 plus billion  going into effect tonight, we're in a trade war here, Kayleigh, aren't we?  </p><p> MCENANY:  You know, I think trade war, we can use that term or we can used  a grand negotiation is how I see it.  </p><p> MCSHANE:  OK.  </p><p> MCENANY:  Because I think, as the President has said China has more to lose  than we do, in fact they are the ones with a trade surplus.  We are the  ones with the deficit.  So, I hope there is an opening salvo of what will  be a long negotiation and one that will be better off for the American  worker in the long run.  </p><p> MCSHANE:  All right Kayleigh, we cut it short, I want to get the president  on time at the top of the hour.  Thanks a lot as always for coming on  tonight, we appreciate it.  </p><p> MCENANY:  Thank you, Connell.  </p><p> MCSHANE:  All right Kayleigh Mcenany, from the RNC.  The president's rally  will be getting just moments from now, Great Falls, Montana.  We'll come  back and have it live for you on Fox Business in just a moment.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  </p><p> MCSHANE:  As we wait for the President to begin this rally in Montana.  We  said it in a number of times this evening that anything can and will happen  at this rallies.  The President talked about the resignation of his EPA  chief, Scott Pruitt on Air Force One, saying there is really no final straw  when it came to Pruitt.  He called him a terrific guy, but at the end he  said it was his decision to resign.  So, we will look for that and his  comments on the Supreme Court.  And all the other breaking news of the day,  but we thank you for joining us this evening.  It's Charles Payne now with  \"Making Money.\"  Take it away Charles.  </p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

He resigned a short time ago. We all found  out about it from a presidential tweet. Tonight we have the details as we  know them, and we'll tell you what it might mean for business and  regulation. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Also tonight, President Trump gearing up to take on Democrats in states he  won. He's about to speak at a campaign rally in Montana. Tonight, his  target the Democratic Senator Jon Tester. We're live at that event in  Montana when the president begins. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Plus, barring some sort of last minute reprieve, the trade war is on. We're  now just hours away from $34 billion in U.S. tariffs going into effect on  everything from Chinese machinery, to auto parts, to medical devices. China  now saying it is ready to respond immediately.</p><p>It's money and politics, we deliver the debate behind tomorrow's headlines.  I'm Connell McShane in for Elizabeth MacDonald. The Evening Edit starts  right now. </p><p>On Wall Street today the Dow shaking off trade some of the war angst,  ending a 180 plus points higher after the Fed minutes were released and  ahead of the monthly jobs report out tomorrow, it's 182 gain by the time  the day ended on Wall Street 24,357 for the Dow. More on that in just a  moment.</p><p>But first, this breaking this evening. The EPA administrator, a man of many  scandals has resigned. President Trump a short time ago, tweeting that he  accepted Pruitt's resignation.</p><p>Edwards Lawrence, live for us in Washington with the very latest. Edward?</p><p>EDWARD LAWRENCE, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT:  Well, Connell, the president  accepted the resignation letter from Scott Pruitt about 3.30 this afternoon  Eastern Time. The president announcing the resignation as you said on  Twitter, then tweeting about what's next. </p><p>President Trump said that Andrew Wheeler will assume the acting  administrator duties of the EPA. Saying, \"I have no doubt that Andy will  continue on with our great and lasting EPA agenda. We have made tremendous  progress and the future of the EPA is very bright.\"</p><p>Now Pruitt steps down amid multiple allegations against him of abusing  power, misusing taxpayer money. Some of the issues spending $43,000 on a  sound-proof phone booth in his office spending more than $100,000 on at  least one trip with private tours the Vatican in Europe, first class  travel. It was on and on.</p><p>The reaction is coming in from Congress. Senator Bernie Sanders says,  quote, \"Scott Pruitt was the worse EPA administrator in the history of the  agenda -- history of the agency not only has he acted time and time again,  an unethical manner but he has lead the agency in the wrong direction.\" </p><p>Senator Chuck Grassley saying the president did the right thing in taking  the resignation letter. Now in the resignation letter Pruitt says that it's  effective tomorrow. </p><p>And he adds that \"It is extremely difficult for me to see serving you in  this role first because I count it a blessing to serve you in any capacity,  but also because of the transformative work that is coming out. However,  the unrelenting attacks on me personally, my family are unprecedented and  have taken a sizable toll on us.\" </p><p>Several ethics investigation have been open into Pruitt. In fact, some  lawmakers on Capitol Hill have even asked the inspector general to get  involved. Now it's unclear what happens to all of those probes. Connell?</p><p>MCSHANE:  That's the thing. I mean, it could be some legal issues down the  line and the rest of it. Edward, thanks. Edward Lawrence in D.C.</p><p>Straight to Bush 43, deputy assistant Brad Blakeman joins us this evening.  And we're looking as well at the countdown to midnight which I talk about  it a few minutes on the trade war fears. But Brad, let's get straight now  to the breaking news on the resignation of Scott Pruitt. </p><p>As Edward talked about, you know, there are all kinds of scandals, right,  by some counts it could be a dozen or more of them. So the obvious first  question would be, in a situation like this what took so long? </p><p>BRAD BLAKEMAN, FORMER PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH'S DEPUTY ASSISTANT:   Absolutely, this guy should have been gone a long time ago, but I'm glad  the president cleaned the air at the EPA as far as administration is  concerned. The good news is the acting administrator Wheeler will do a  fantastic job. And we're not going to hear the baggage and the drama that  came with Pruitt.</p><p>MCSHANE:  Right.</p><p>BLAKEMAN:  He is a guy who is well-known in Washington, very respected  environment attorney and energy lobbyist. He is somebody with a long  history while serving the nation and also serving the private sector. So I  expect nothing will change. The president I think will have a better  opportunity to pass his agenda without the -- without the constant  headline. </p><p>MCSHANE:  That's kind of what makes this all the more puzzling or  intriguing or whatever you want to call it, is that you are probably right,  nothing will change which goes back to the first question, what took so  long. Because if the president knows that. I would presume he does, or that  is indeed the case, you know, wouldn't you wanted to -- wouldn't you have  wanted to do this much, much sooner at least put it behind you if the  policies are going to remain the same. He probably will. </p><p>BLAKEMAN:  Yes, I think that the president probably in case was loyal to a  fault.</p><p>MCSHANE:  Yes.</p><p>BLAKEMAN:  He was maybe too loyal to somebody who didn't deserve it. But  clearly it's the right decision now, and I think it will be welcomed within  the EPA. </p><p>MCSHANE:  Now the thing about this story for, you know, our audience, our  business audience, to think matters the most is what does that mean for  business, what does it mean for regulation. </p><p>You're making the point that Pruitt's deputy, the acting administrator will  continue with the same policies. Anything down the line, you know, in terms  of he's already been confirmed by the Senate, right. So he come to any type  of hurdles that could come in to play here where the administration's, you  know, policies come up against it or just status quo. </p><p>BLAKEMAN:  Well, the question is, how long will he serve as an acting  administrator. Will the president nominates somebody to replace him or will  he be actually elevated to the administrator of the EPA.</p><p>My hope is that the president will elevate him. Because he's a known  commodity, he's well-known, he's well-respected. And again, I think he is  in tune with the president' feeling of deregulation and giving more power  to the private sector. And if you want that done then I think this guy  probably should be elevated. </p><p>MCSHANE:  Right. Because the idea, and that's what, you know, Democrat like  Bernie Sanders which was the statement was read by Edward that the -- that  this was the worst administrator of all-time, that he'd been leading the  agency in the wrong direction. I mean, that's a political point of view but  that won't change because of this. I mean, this whole deregulatory agenda  continues pretty much--</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>BLAKEMAN:  Right. Bernie Sanders is against the guy, I can assure you he is  probably doing the right thing, so we're not looking for any endorsements  by Bernie Sanders. </p><p>MCSHANE:  It's kind of interesting but again, the scandals some of them  were downright silly, I think that, you know, that were brought up, but  some of these other things that somebody in this position would allow  themselves to have endured. I mean, the $40,000 phone both for one. </p><p>BLAKEMAN:  Crazy. </p><p>MCSHANE:  I mean, it doesn't make any sense, though. It would go on and on.  And then the other thing that, and the president campaigned on this of  draining the swamp. I mean, you got a guy in here, let's be honest, asking  his own age allegedly to go out and help his wife get like a 200 grand a  year job and all that kind of thing was going on, you know, that's not  exactly draining the swamp. </p><p>BLAKEMAN:  Well, there is an illness in Washington that can affect cabinet  members and low level staffers, that is Potomac River.</p><p>MCSHANE:  Yes.</p><p>BLAKEMAN:  When you get it, it's deadly. I've seen it happen to people. And  here Pruitt was an outsider, former attorney general of Oklahoma, he should  know better but he came to Washington, and he caught it. And it's fatal. </p><p>MCSHANE:  There's no -- right. There's no known cure that we know of. </p><p>BLAKEMAN:  Nope. </p><p>MCSHANE:  Other than getting out which he will now do. Now I want to get  you on a couple of other topics, or at least this big one tonight. We have  the countdown clock on, right, so midnight. And the U.S. is said to impose  these tariffs. It's $34 billion on imported Chinese machinery, automakers,  and medical devices. </p><p>And as we would expect the Chinese have said they are going to come right  back at us respond immediately. So the markets we didn't see much today. I  mean, there were some reports that trade deals might be worked with the  Europeans might have help stocks a bit. But this is certainly an issue. </p><p>Our own Maria Bartiromo spoke about all of this with the president  recently. Let's listen then we'll come back and talk about it. Here it is.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  We have -- we don't have a  trade deal with China, we have a deal. Nobody bothered to make a deal, and  they'll charge 25 percent for a car, and we use 2.5 percent. And you'll be  using those numbers on your show so I don't want to bore people. But we  have a -- some of the worst trade deals in the world. We are losing money  with everybody.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MCSHANE:  This might be the one area, Brad, immigration maybe as well. But  this probably the one area that this president has really changed the  thinking of the Republican Party certainly different than it was when you  were serving in President Bush's administration. What do you make of the  moves? </p><p>BLAKEMAN:  I think the president is absolutely right, China is a schoolyard  bully who has been, you know, knocking us around, and either you can take  it or you can stand up to the bully. And we have $400 billion deficit with  China. That is just crazy.</p><p>We're the strongest most powerful economy in the world, and we're letting  China and others, friend and foe, take advantage of us. I think the  president is smart. Now it may cause us a little pain initially, but the  gains are going to be well worth what we'll have to go through. </p><p>China like most bullies I predict will back down. They can't afford to go  to war with America.</p><p>MCSHANE:  Right.</p><p>BLAKEMAN:  Those countries can't. And look, I think the president is going  to make the best deal he can for the American people, we should be dealing  bilaterally not with through this multilateral negotiations because it  erodes our power and leverage. </p><p>MCSHANE:  To some extent though, Brad, the question is, say you are right  that they do back down, the question is when, and how long are the Chinese  willing to kind of let this play out for, because that to your point does,  you know, lead us into a situation where we might have to deal with maybe  more pain than many Americans know they're going to have to deal with now. </p><p>And many of those Americans by the way supported the president when he ran  for office. Think about farmers, think about people he's speaking to  tonight at this rally in Montano. These policies he is putting in place  could hurt people that supported him, right. </p><p>BLAKEMAN:  Well, we're getting screwed, to a tune of almost half a trillion  dollars. That's unacceptable. And what is Trump trying to do is he's trying  to stand up for American jobs. We have to be behind the president. This is  thinking long-term. </p><p>You know, I have a new word that diagnosis America's problems, it's called  a momentarium. Living in the moment. Great leaders provide for the moment  but they plan for our future. Trump is not only looking to take care of us  today but he's looking to safeguard us for tomorrow. </p><p>MCSHANE:  We'll talk about it tomorrow literally because this go into  effect tonight. Good to see you, Brad, as always. Thanks a lot. </p><p>BLAKEMAN:  Pleasure.</p><p>MCSHANE:  All right. Brad Blakeman. Let's get back and check in on those  markets. We mention the Dow closing in the green today with that more than  180 point rally. Job growth continuing into the summer months. ADP  announced that business added 177,000 jobs in the month of June. So that  was one of the economic data points. </p><p>Our own Nicole Petallides, as usual on the floor of the New York Stock  Exchange with the wrap up. Nicole? </p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Up arrows across the board. The  Dow gained 182 points. The NASDAQ up 1.1 percent. We heard from federal  open market committee pretty much on pace for those for the rate hikes but  some trade uncertainly and that weighed. </p><p>Also we saw movement in energy and oil as President Donald Trump tweeted  his concerns about OPEC monopoly, and saying that gasoline prices on the  rise up about 60 cents year-over-year. </p><p>And some doubts are growing pertaining to the Aramco IPO, will it ever  happen. According to the Wall Street journal it was very hot, it could be  the largest IPO, a $100 million. And the reports are that it has stalled.  And the company is not making any comment. Back to you.</p><p>MCSHANE:  All right, Nicole. Thank you, Nicole Petallides. </p><p>President Trump, meantime, moments away from speaking there. You are  looking live at a campaign rally that's been set up in the state of  Montano. Fox Business will bring you there live when the president arrives  in Great Falls. </p><p>Coming up, in the meantime, growing concern over smart TV vacuuming  people's data right out of their living room sometimes without their full  malice. We have details on that story tonight. </p><p>Also Mark Zuckerberg's Facebook apologizing for flagging a Declaration of  Independence post as hate speech. </p><p>Coming up, a guest who is not surprise by that. But first, the president is  planning a three-day visit to the U.K. That will be in a few weeks. It  comes as report out says the U.K. government told the president he can't  meet with a certain member of the European parliament. </p><p>The Brexit architect Nigel Farage. Well, Nigel Farage is here with us.  He'll react to that after this.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCSHANE:  Well, President Trump moments away from speaking at this campaign  rally that's been set up in Great Falls, Montana. As you look at the crowd  that has filed in to this venue. Remember the idea that the president going  to these states where he won the presidential election that are represented  in the United States Senate by Democrats. </p><p>In this case, Jon Tester, they try to go after a senator like a Jon Tester,  see if Republicans can take back that seat, but as always with this  campaign style rallies anything can happen. We're going to carry it live  here on Fox Business. Anything from the resignation of Scott Pruitt that we  were talking about, to the tariffs on China that go into effect midnight.</p><p>Of course, the Supreme Court pick that's expected on Monday. Anything and  everything usually can and does happen at this type of event. So we'll  carry that. </p><p>Meantime, July 12, the president planning a three-day visit to the U.K.,  where he'll meet with Prime Minister Theresa May, he's also meet with the  queen. But according to the U.K.'s Daily Telegraph, the U.K. government has  told President Trump he should not meet with the European parliament member  Nigel Farage during his visit. And you know it, Nigel Farage joins us right  now. What do you know about that? </p><p>NIGEL FARAGE, MEMBER, BRITISH PARLIAMENT:  You know, ever since I appeared  on a campaign platform with Donald Trump in Mississippi back in August 16,  the U.K. government has been paranoid about my relationship with the U.S.  president, my broader relationship with the administration. They're  embarrassed I think that I've got good relations with Donald Trump and with  many others. </p><p>And they are trying to deny the fact that I even exist. It is frankly  stupid. It is ludicrous. The truth is that relations between the U.K.  government under Mrs. May and the American administration under Trump are  not as good as they should be. </p><p>MCSHANE:  Right.</p><p>FARAGE:  And rather than banning me from meeting the president, and by the  way, I'm not sure how well he'll take to being told who we should choose to  be or not. What they should be doing is using as a bridge between the two.  I'm not sure at the moment the U.K. government is bright enough to  understand that. </p><p>MCSHANE:  So a couple things, have you been told or have you been able to  confirm the fact that this is true, that they have come out and banned you  from, you know, or try to ban you from meeting with president. And number  two, have you spoken with the president or anybody at the White House about  it. </p><p>FARAGE:  Well, in the last 18 months, ever since -- ever since the  president tweeted--</p><p>MCSHANE:  Right.</p><p>FARAGE:  -- many people in Washington think Nigel Farage would make a good  U.K. ambassador. The government in Downing Street have been climbing the  walls, that they hate me.</p><p>MCSHANE:  Right.</p><p>FARAGE:  They hate me because I force Brexit upon them. </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCSHANE:  So you met I know it's true. But you think, you have every reason  to believe based on history that it is. </p><p>FARAGE:  It is a completely consistent pattern of behavior. What I do know  is the briefing that you've read, written up in a U.K. newspaper.</p><p>MCSHANE:  Right.</p><p>FARAGE:  Where I know for fact is that it came from the prime minister's  office, so yes, it is true. I have not spoken with the president. I have  spoken should I say to people close to him. Look, I don't' to embarrass him  coming on this trip, if he wants to meet me, I'll meet him, but I won't  force it. </p><p>MCSHANE:  So you don't know whether that will happen. </p><p>FARAGE:  Well, let's wait and see. </p><p>MCSHANE:  Yes.</p><p>FARAGE:  I don't know, you don't know. And the great thing about Donald  Trump is, nobody ever, ever can, you know, predict. </p><p>MCSHANE:  Well, that's true. That's definitely true. Like him or not, you  don't know what is coming next. </p><p>FARAGE:  Absolutely.</p><p>MCSHANE:  Even at this rally in the next hour. Think about this trip,  there's a lot of -- there's been a lot of back and forth about whether it  would happen, how it would happen, would it be an official, this and that.  And then this story is getting some attention. </p><p>The mayor of London approves a request from protesters. You're already  taking in of this too. But to essentially, well here it is. To fly this  blimp, it's a blimp that designed to look like an infant President Trump  during the visit. So what do you make of that?</p><p>FARAGE:  Look, in a free society, people are able to protest. They can hold  up a placard, they can draw a cartoon.</p><p>MCSHANE:  Right.</p><p>FARAGE:  That is freedom of expression and speech and we all believe in  that. But what is happening here is that in parliament square, you know,  right in front of our ancient parliament. This blimp of Donald Trump as a  baby will be flying 100 foot in the air. And do you know why? Because Sadiq  Khan, the mayor of London, has given permission for this to happen. </p><p>I think it makes my country look like a laughingstock, there is no country  in the world that would insult the U.S. president in this way, and I would  beg, I would plead with Fox viewers, and with all Americans, please, next  Friday, when you see this ridiculous spectacle next to our parliament,  don't judge the whole of my country by it, judge Mayor Sadiq Khan by it. </p><p>MCSHANE:  Now I want to take on another issue while we have you here, Nigel  on foreign policy.</p><p>FARAGE:  Yes,</p><p>MCSHANE:  Because this is important. You know, we've been talking about a  lot of other things, but North Korea, you know, the Secretary of State Mike  Pompeo will be in there in Pyongyang, he is set to arrive there and it will  be the first time since the Singapore summit that we are going to get  together between the U.S. and North Korea.</p><p>But there have been a lot of stories here in the last week or so, right,  that have lead to some skepticism about whether Kim Jong-un really is going  to abandon his nuclear arsenal or whether he's adding to it or he's hiding  it or whatever the case might be. What do you make -- are skeptical now  after maybe reading and hearing some of this, and what do you think Mike  Pompeo can do about it? </p><p>FARAGE:  Look, you know, you have been through years of Obama making big  public declarations about things he would do, and then delivering nothing.  That's what western world politics has been like. The point about this  Trump administration is they don't just make big gestures, they try to  actually do things. </p><p>Now look, the very fact that the meeting happened was great, but what  everybody wants to see now is some action, the fact that Mike Pompeo is  back there trying to make this happen shows the will of this regime to get  a result, it doesn't guarantee a result--</p><p>MCSHANE:  Right.</p><p>FARAGE:  -- but I think Pompeo is doing exactly the right thing. </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCSHANE:  When do you, real quick, Nigel. When do you walk away, how do you  know when to walk away, you know, how do you know they are not playing you  in a situation like this? </p><p>FARAGE:  Well, all through history, you know, we've seen, you know, peace  deals, accords, and people breaking them. </p><p>MCSHANE:  Yes.</p><p>FARAGE:  I -- you know. Winston Churchill once said, jaw-jaw is ready than  war-war. And right at the moment America and North Korea are going through  jaw-jaw. Let's keep that process going as long as we possibly can. </p><p>MCSHANE:  All right, we'll continue to check in with you, Nigel.</p><p>FARAGE:  Thank you.</p><p>MCSHANE:  Maybe any update on the president's visit as well. Thank you for  joining us this evening I appreciate it. </p><p>FARAGE:  Thank you. </p><p>MCSHANE:  OK. As we said, the president is moments away now from this  rally, campaign style out in Montana. And it looks like the crowd is  getting revved up as it usually does for events like this. We're going to  bring it to you live, Fox Business, we'll show when you the president  arrives and bring you the rally. </p><p>But first, Mark Zuckerberg Facebook now reinstating a Declaration of  Independence post after it was flagged as hate speech, accidental of  course, But the details on that and what it means after a quick break. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARK ZUCKERBERG, CEO AND CO-FOUNDER, FACEBOOK:  -- voices calling for  building walls and distancing people they label as others. Instead of  building walls we can help people build bridges.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ZUCKERBERG:  We didn't take a broad enough of our responsibility and that  was a big mistake. And it was my mistake. And I'm sorry. I started  Facebook. I run it. And I'm responsible for what happens here.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCSHANE:  All right. Mark Zuckerberg, the Facebook CEO apologizing earlier  this year over the platform sharing user's personal data. Now, Facebook  apologizing to a Texas newspaper for part of the Declaration of  Independence being labeled as hate speech. </p><p>Community newspaper called the Liberty County vindicator had been posting  the whole declaration in just small daily chunks on its Facebook page for  eight days, this was in a run up to the 4th of July. But the ninth excerpt  was not posted on Monday. The paper getting an automated from Facebook,  saying that the post, quote, \"goes against our standard on hate speech.\" </p><p>Taking a look at the stock, the Facebook stock, it ended the day as most of  the market did in the green, up by about 3 percent. </p><p>Let's go to the Daily Caller News Foundation editor in chief Chris Bedford.  Good to see you, Chris. Thanks you for coming on. I appreciate it.</p><p>CHRISTOPHER BEDFORD, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, THE DAILY CALLER:  Thanks for having  me.</p><p>MCSHANE:  All right. So the offending passages such as it was, was part of  the bill of particulars and was, you know, written against King George of  Britain and it said Thomas Jefferson using the phrase quote, \"merciless  Indian savages,\" that's what got flagged, \"merciless Indian savages.\" </p><p>Vindicator's managing editor replied in an article about that, saying,  quote, \"Perhaps that Thomas Jefferson written it has Native Americans at a  challenging stage of cultural development that would have been better.\" </p><p>So, a tongue and cheek there. Unfortunately, Jefferson like British  columnist of his day did not hold an entirely friendly view of Native  American. So your reaction to all this, Chris.</p><p>BEDFORD:  It wasn't a friendly time on the frontier right then.</p><p>MCSHANE:  Right.</p><p>BEDFORD:  The British crown had been an exciting tribes in the frontier to  attack what were the American revolutionaries are towns and villages trying  cause trouble for the frontier. A lot of people actually putting up on the  left would call the Declaration of Independence a hate document. </p><p>We heard things like people putting on Twitter that the independent state  on a Wednesday which is going to make white nationalist everywhere, come to  tears and that was from an editor of Teen Vogue, but this gets caught up in  Facebook's larger machinelike algorithms.</p><p>MCSHANE:  Right.</p><p>BEDFORD:  And publishers I guess are told that they have to trust these  algorithms. The problem is of course and so like kind of like the Coca-Cola  secret formula we're not allowed to see it. We just have to take to take  their word for it, but time and time again it seems like historical thing  or conservative things get flagged as hate speech by people and shutdown  and there is no transparency at all with the massive, massive--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCSHANE:  Zuckerberg talk a lot and, you know, during a Senate House  appearance. It's about artificial intelligence, saying A.I. is going to be  able to do a lot of this force but it does bring up that question about  whether it should be doing all of it or whether human monitors would be  better.</p><p>However, as I catch myself, he obviously would have bias with human  monitors as well, right.</p><p>BEDFORD:  Yes. And you look at who they eventually, who they hired to come  on to decide what was actually going to be good news sources. And these  were retired people from CNN and from New York Times they got a pretty  strong liberal bed. There's not a single person on their news team where  they hired that you would have said I actually might agree with them  politically if you were on the conservative side of things.</p><p>And if Facebook wants to maintain the trust of a good half of the country  they are going to have to figure out bring on some of these people that may  be in Silicon Valley they view as knuckle draggers. They don't -- they  don't -- I don't think there's a lot of sympathy for conservative  sentiments over Silicon Valley.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Well to that point, Ted Cruz obviously the Republican side of --  what after Mark Zuckerberg about bias -- political bias in particular  during those hearings.  Let's take a listen to that -- back in time, then  we will talk about it.  Here it is.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  There are great many Americans who I think are deeply  concerned that Facebook and other tech companies are engaged in a pervasive  pattern of bias and political censorship.  </p><p>MARK ZUCKERBERG, CEO FACEBOOK:  I understand where that concern is coming  from, because Facebook and the tech industry are located in Silicon Valley  which is an extremely left leaning place and this is actually a concern  that I have, then I try to root out in the company is making sure that we  don't have any bias in the work that we do.  And I think it is a fair  concern.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>MCSHANE:  The only thing in this particular case, Chris, I would say, those  case we're talking about, this phrase, merciless Indian savages seems, it  is just a filter maybe that was not turned on the right way or it needs to  be readjusted in some ways as oppose to a political bias or maybe I am  wrong.  What do you think?  </p><p>BEDFORD:  Yes.  It is basically trying to call out, they have a 25 page  manual on what they define as hate speech, and one of them includes  attacking a protected group, today and maybe back in 1776, it should had  been like this.  The American Indian Conservative was a protective group  and Thomas Jefferson did not have kind thoughts about the Natives on the  Frontier.  It makes sense, it was a period of open of warfare between the  groups.  There was tribes versus colonist.  That was a different time in  the time of war.  So, it is probably just caught by a computer in this  case.  </p><p>But Facebook problem is there used to be a message board, something that  you could post anything you wanted to, and they were not responsible for  it, and then after some terrorists started using it and then especially  after Hillary Clinton lost and they blamed Facebook for it, people on left  said we need to regulate this place and make it so that Hillary Clinton can  never be disparage here again.  People on the right said, well, you don't  have a friend over here, because you have shown bias against Conservatives  and right now they are in Washington D.C. without a friend.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Right.  It is interesting.  It gives us a chance to talk about it  again.  Whether or not in this case it applauds or not they got to take a  look at all of this issues.  Good to see you, Chris. Thanks a lot.  </p><p>BEDFORD:  Thank you.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Let us go back to Montana, the President getting set to speak at  campaign rally this evening, as soon as he begins, let us look at the  arena.  We are going to bring it to you live, you know Scott Pruitt  resignation obviously at the top of the headline tonight, sometimes the  President gets to something like that when it breaks, night of other times,  avoids it entirely, we'll see,  Of course, Supreme Court and his  appointment there and another thing a lot of people are thinking about.  So  we are watching that.  First though, an Anti-Trump amend has been fired  from his job, a video, emerged of him angrily ripping a hat \"Make America  Great Again hat off a head of young boy and throwing a drink at him as he  was eating food, this happen in Texas, we are going to talk about that.   Next, Trump 2020 campaign senior adviser, Katrina Pearson will be here,  don't go away.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Breaking news just coming in to us, President Trump just arriving  moments ago air force one touched at Great Falls International Airport.   So, the President now will motorcade over once he gets out of the plane.   As the plane is just out of our camera shot at the moment, but taxing on  the tarmac there and then there will be a motorcade over to the arena in  Great Falls where the president begins a rally at the top of the next hour.   So, some 22, 23 minutes of from now we will expect that to begin usually  the President is about on time, it appears to be just about on schedule  right now with the touchdown in Montana.  </p><p>Let's bring in Trump's 2020 campaign senior adviser, Katrina Pearson, as we  wait for the president comments at the top of the hour.  I said before the  last break, Katrina that pretty much anything and everything could come up  usually does at these rallies.  The President made headlines tonight  obviously with the acceptance of the resignation as EPA administrator Scott  Pruitt has been under fire, do you think he talks something like that or is  it more focus on other subjects?  What do you expect tonight?  </p><p>KATRINA PEARSON, TRUMP 2020 CAMPAIGN SENIOR ADVISER:  Well, I think your  initial thought are absolutely correct.  The President could speak about  anything tonight, he definitely has his written speech in the teleprompter,  but if you ever have been to a Trump rally, the President is known to  really just feel the energy in the room and talk about the things that he  wants to talk about and the things in the current headlines this may come  up, he is definitely going to talk about many accomplishments that he is  making and how Democrats are failing miserably to block his agenda.  And he  is going to show support for his supporters who are constantly under attack  now, because you have Democrat politicians encourages physical  confrontation.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Right.  We'll talk about that in a second and -- you have covered  enough of these rallies, to know usually what you expect going in is not  necessarily the headline that you get coming out, because the president  will go of on some other subjects.  Maybe tonight, he gives a hint about  his Supreme Court nominee.  What do you think of that?  </p><p>PEARSON:  He may, you know, this is where the President is in his element,  he is most comfortable with his supporters, as you know.  Thousands of  people attend these rallies, some of them waiting overnight, there will be  thousands on the outside of these rallies.  And so, he really want his  supporters to really be the first to know many of these types of things,  and what is really going on.  He uses this opportunity to bypass the  mainstream media to get away from those filters on some of those other  cable news networks and talk to his supporters so they can hear directly  from him, what is going on.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  You see the supporters are gathered there waiting for President  in the next few minutes to make his way over to the arena there, to the  venue.  You mentioned some of these confrontations that had been going on.   And certainly getting a lot of the headlines, I think one, you may have  alluded to his video, it has gone viral, the guy comes up, rips a hat right  off a young man's head.  The Make America Great Again Trump hat, throwing  soda on him and what not, so, we will talk about that, but let us watch it  first.  Here it is.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  (BEEP) President.  You ain't supporting -- (BEEP).   There is no great (BEEP).  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>MCSHANE:  All right.  The man has been identified, Keno Jimenez, a  bartender work at in San Antonio, Texas at a bar there, they fired him.   The bar, they fired him of his job.  Here is the teenager that you see  there responding to the incident.  Listen.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I didn't think he would generate that amount like, not  like what people are doing, like I was looking at comments to some people  are like, of yes, this is uncalled for, and people are like, you know, with  mixed opinions, but I did not think it would blow up to what it is right  now.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Yes.  It has Katrina, blown up to become quite a story.  A  controversy that the kind of thing you are referring to, right?  </p><p>PEARSON:  Oh, absolutely.  I mean, this this case, this was a cowardly man,  this was an adult, a 30-year-old man.  Who attacked a teenager?  Kids that  ride skateboards and play video games, this is how low the left has gone.   This is more liberal buffoonery on full display, and this is happening  because you have many in the mainstream media who are constantly  mischaracterizing the President and his agenda.  Along with others  politicians on the left pushing for confrontation.  And now, there are  children involved.  But we should be surprised, because this is not the  first time.  This has been going on since the very beginning, if you  followed 2016 campaign, you saw Trump supporters get attacked violently  outside some of these rallies.  And now the media and the politics making  this worse.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Now the President's detractor said that he plays some role in it,  based on that during the campaign as well, this his language, insights  people on the other side to be aggressive against people who disagree with  him, you think, there are two sides on this or just one side?  </p><p>PEARSON:  Well, I think that, you can take anything that you don't like,  any policy that maybe does not work in your favor call it whatever you  like.  The President never encouraged people to go out in publicly confront  individuals, and if he was abrasive in any tone it was in defense of his  own supporters that were being violently attacked.  And so this kid in San  Antonio, you know Brad Parscale is from San Antonio, he is the Trump  campaign 2020 campaign manager and he tweeted today that he would like to  send this young guy a signed hat, give him a brand new MAGA hat with  President's signature, because we all stand with Trump supporters all  across the country.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Coming up lined up tonight in Montana, they will hear the  President speak at the top of the hour.  Katrina, good to see you, thank  you for coming on tonight.  We appreciate it.  </p><p>PEARSON:  Great to be here.  Thank you.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  All right.  With this rally set to begin, we will keep our eye on  it.  Of course, the warming up of the crowds seems to -- just about been  completed.  The motorcade will be on its way over to the venue in Great  Falls, Montana.  Live at the Fox Business Network when it begins.  </p><p>Also tonight, growing concern over smart TV, this is going to vacuuming  people's data right out of their living rooms.  Sometimes it happens  without their full knowledge, details on that story coming up next.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Breaking News in the State of Montana, left and right of the  scree, Air Force One, obviously on the left side of the screen with the  stairs out, the President set to leave the plane, and head to the  motorcade, and then he will by the power of that beast motorcade make his  way over to the arena in Great Falls where the presidential lectern is set  up for him to begin this rally.  </p><p>That is top of the hour, Fox Business live coverage, we'll keep an eye on  both of those live pictures.  And we will have the president's arrival and  then we will have his remarks at the top of the hour as well.  </p><p>Now, before last break we promised to talk about this crazy story involving  smart TV's that might be keeping track of more than just what you are  watching, there is some concern growing over personal data being misused by  big tech giants, Facebook alike and also by the smartphone companies, but  people's data is being taken right from their living room TV, and sometimes  it happens without them knowing about it.  Because what happens is, you  have to opt in as user agreement, but the language is confusing.  We have  it up on the screen, right now.  Reading in part, interact with your  favorite TV shows, get recommendation base on the content you love, connect  your devices for exclusive content special offers.  Our Susan Li is here  this evening with a little bit more on this, this is confusing.  What is  the company again that is doing this?  </p><p>SUSAN LI, FOX BUSINESSES:  Well, there are several companies.  The largest  one that we're focusing on is Samba TV.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Samba TV, right.  </p><p>LI:  Samba, I know it sounds very festive.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Yes.  </p><p>LI:  But really it is kind of different.  But that policy is 4,000 words,  can you believe that, the opt in is 6500 words, do you read through them.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  No.  There are a lot of times in my (inaudible) as all kinds of  things we sign our life away, you know, these contracts come up, agree,  agree.  </p><p>LI:  Right.  You just want to get it over with.  Make your life a lot  easier.  But OK.  This is what Samba TV does, you know, 45 percent of  Americans have smart television.  In their living rooms according to IHS.   I have one, I am a little scared now.  And so what Samba TV does is it  vacuums the info off your smart television, and this era of the internet  things, your TV connected to the internet, which is then connected to your  speaker, possibly to your phone as well.  So what Samba TV does, it takes  pixel by pixel, it understands what you are watching second by second.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  And then, that could be used, you know, obviously, you know,  privacy experts are concern about, but it could be used for good.  </p><p>LI:  OK.  So they can't directly sell the data, so what they do is they see  what you are watching whether it is conservative or even liberal media.   That is something that they also keep track of, and then they use -- they  target ads to your other devices.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Just like what happens on the internet.  </p><p>LI:  So you are wondering, you are watching, let us say you are watching  \"Game of thrones.\"  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Right.  What is that ad?  </p><p>LI:  And then all of the sudden something pops up on your Facebook thing.   Where did that come from?  How did they know where they listening?  </p><p>MCSHANE:  I mean, companies in TV have wanted to do this forever, they have  been jealous of the internet for doing it, but now it is really happening,  but at the same time obviously, the obvious concerns come up, people say,  well, I did not know this is going on.  </p><p>LI:  Well, yes, so the thing is, the opt in rate for Samba TV, 90 percent  according to one executive.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Those people have no clue.  They don't know what they are  clicking on.  </p><p>LI:  And a big investors are getting involved with Samba TV, as well.  Mark  Cuban, putting in money, we also have Liberty Media, and Time Warner as  well.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Now you mentioned they can't sell, so what are the restriction,  real quick.  </p><p>LI:  They can't directly sell the data, that is single restriction, but  there are big companies are working with them, like Citi and JetBlue in the  past, Expedia, Spell Advertisers with Samba TV, as well.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Sad world.  </p><p>LI:  Yes, this is the world it is, you want to target ads, you want them to  be effective, I mean, the one that get the right eyeballs.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Yes, that is it.  You have to give up something to get it I  guess.  Good to see you, Susan.  </p><p>LI:  Good to see you.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Thanks, Susan Li.  </p><p>All right.  President Trump will be speaking here, just a few minutes  really at this campaign rally, see the crowd gathered behind the lectern  with the Presidential seal on it in Montana.  Remember, he won big out  there, 20 plus points in the election and the idea is you go in the state  where you won if you are President Trump that represented by Democrats in  this case John Tester, in the Senate and you target that state.  Kayleigh  Mcenany is here, she will weigh in on that more.  Coming up next from the  RNC.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)  </p><p>MCSHANE:  News alert out in Montana.  Once again, moments away from the  president at this rally in a State carried by 20 plus points.  Let's bring  in Kayleigh Mcenany in from the RNC as we set you up for President's rally  this evening.  Good to see you, Kayleigh.  A couple of things we are  wondering about.  </p><p>KAYLEIGH MCENANY, REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE SPOKESPERSON:  Good to see  you.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Obviously about the Supreme Court, whether we will get any hint.   The president spoke briefly on Air Force One on the reporters about that  and some other topics.  I think he has it down to three possibly two is  what he is saying.  But, your thoughts on some of these picks?  I mean, we  have Judge (inaudible), they are all appeals court judges.  He is appointed  by President Bush, await away 51 years old.  You have two other picks Judge  Kavanagh, again, kind of a lot of Gorsuch comparisons there for Judge  Kavanaugh who is appointed by President Bush as well, so that is somebody  that could be considered and there is supposedly one other person in the  running as well, Judge Amy Coney.  So, if those are the three picks, can't  go wrong from your point of view or how do you view this?  </p><p>MCENANY:  that is right.  You cannot go wrong it is important to remind  everyone that these three individuals all come from that list of 25 Judges  that was put together during the campaign that was a list put together by  Trump in consultation with a guy name Leonard Leo, who is the head of the  Federalist Society and a member of the Federalist Society during my time in  Harvard law school   This organization is all about finding strict  constitutionalist to interpret the words on the page as they should mean  and their original context when put together by the founders.  All three of  these judges, Kavanaugh, and Coney they all -- Barrett, I should say Coney  Barrett, you know they all have pass this test at the Federalist Society,  and I think that that you can't go wrong.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  I am sorry, the President made some sort of remark on Air Force  One, that any of the 25 on his list would have been terrific.  But to the  point of view of conservatives that is probably true, because it is going  to that mold that you are talking about, the Federalist Society Consultant  on the entire list which we knew that going in.  </p><p>MCENANY:  That is right.  Make no mistake, each and every one of these men  and women on the list, will be demonized, the left right now is coming up  with a playbook to attack all of them, it does not matter who the nominee  is, they will say that they are going to overturn Roe v. Wade and they will  say this is rolling back the civil rights it is nonsense, but it does not  matter what the name is, you can imagine the same line of attack that are  going to come.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  No doubt.  Less of a minute left actually, this just came out, we  just got pull a report from Air Force One, the President threatening  another 300 billion in tariffs on the Chinese, with the 30 plus billion  going into effect tonight, we're in a trade war here, Kayleigh, aren't we?  </p><p>MCENANY:  You know, I think trade war, we can use that term or we can used  a grand negotiation is how I see it.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  OK.  </p><p>MCENANY:  Because I think, as the President has said China has more to lose  than we do, in fact they are the ones with a trade surplus.  We are the  ones with the deficit.  So, I hope there is an opening salvo of what will  be a long negotiation and one that will be better off for the American  worker in the long run.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  All right Kayleigh, we cut it short, I want to get the president  on time at the top of the hour.  Thanks a lot as always for coming on  tonight, we appreciate it.  </p><p>MCENANY:  Thank you, Connell.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  All right Kayleigh Mcenany, from the RNC.  The president's rally  will be getting just moments from now, Great Falls, Montana.  We'll come  back and have it live for you on Fox Business in just a moment.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)  </p><p>MCSHANE:  As we wait for the President to begin this rally in Montana.  We  said it in a number of times this evening that anything can and will happen  at this rallies.  The President talked about the resignation of his EPA  chief, Scott Pruitt on Air Force One, saying there is really no final straw  when it came to Pruitt.  He called him a terrific guy, but at the end he  said it was his decision to resign.  So, we will look for that and his  comments on the Supreme Court.  And all the other breaking news of the day,  but we thank you for joining us this evening.  It's Charles Payne now with  \"Making Money.\"  Take it away Charles.  </p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

Reliance on voluntary codes, such as the one at EU level on Disinformation, is no longer an option. This report proves beyond doubt that legal liabilities are needed urgently so that tech companies, whose predatory and unscrupulous behaviour threatens the future of our independent press as well as society at large, act against harmful or illegal content on their sites.\"<br/><br/>The report calls for:<br/><br/>Compulsory Code of Ethics for tech companies overseen by independent regulator<br/><br/>Regulator given powers to launch legal action against companies breaching code<br/><br/>Government to reform current electoral communications laws and rules on overseas involvement in UK elections<br/><br/>Social media companies obliged to take down known sources of harmful content, including proven sources of disinformation<br/><br/>The report also concludes that:<br/><br/>Electoral law is 'not fit for purpose'<br/><br/>Facebook has intentionally and knowingly violated both data privacy and anti-competition laws<br/><br/>Angela continued: \"This report is a damning indictment of the internet wild west. Society needs to comprehend the harm that is being done to our fundamental freedoms and democracy, and governments need to act to protect them. We join Damian Collins, MP, in calling for urgent action to tackle the monopolistic tech giants to prevent electoral fraud, protect our privacy and protect the vulnerable from online harm\".<br/><br/>In a statement, Damian Collins MP, Chair of the DCMS Committee says:<br/><br/>\"Our inquiry over the last year has identified three big threats to our society. The challenge for the year ahead is to start to fix them; we cannot delay any longer.<br/><br/>\"Democracy is at risk from the malicious and relentless targeting of citizens with disinformation and personalised 'dark adverts' from unidentifiable sources, delivered through the major social media platforms we use every day. Much of this is directed from agencies working in foreign countries, including Russia.<br/><br/>\"The big tech companies are failing in the duty of care they owe to their users to act against harmful content, and to respect their data privacy rights.<br/><br/>\"Companies like Facebook exercise massive market power which enables them to make money by bullying the smaller technology companies and developers who rely on this platform to reach their customers.<br/><br/>The Committee calls for the Government to include concrete proposals for action in its forthcoming White Paper on online harms.<br/><br/>For further information, please contact Heidi Lambert on Tel: +44 1245 476 265 or Angela Mills Wade on Tel +44 1865 310 732<br/><br/>@epc_press<br/><br/><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.epceurope.eu\">www.epceurope.eu</url><br/><br/>The final report can be found here:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/digital-culture-media-and-sport-committee/news/fake-news-report-published-17-19/\">https://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/digital-culture-media-and-sport-committee/news/fake-news-report-published-17-19/</url><br/><br/>For further information about the work of the DCMS Committee:<br/><br/>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/digital-culture-media-and-sport-committee/\">https://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/digital-culture-media-and-sport-committee/</url><br/><br/>Information about the EU Code of Practice on Disinformation:<br/><br/>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/first-results-eu-code-practice-against-disinformation\">https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/first-results-eu-code-practice-against-disinformation</url><br/><br/><br/><br/>(Distributed by M2 Communications (      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.m2.com\">www.m2.com</url>))   </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INVEST-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INVEST2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VFR-5SP1-F0K1-N3X7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">276313</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-02-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"684\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Investrend Communications, Inc.

Reliance on voluntary codes, such as the one at EU level on Disinformation, is no longer an option. This report proves beyond doubt that legal liabilities are needed urgently so that tech companies, whose predatory and unscrupulous behaviour threatens the future of our independent press as well as society at large, act against harmful or illegal content on their sites.\"<br/><br/>The report calls for:<br/><br/>Compulsory Code of Ethics for tech companies overseen by independent regulator<br/><br/>Regulator given powers to launch legal action against companies breaching code<br/><br/>Government to reform current electoral communications laws and rules on overseas involvement in UK elections<br/><br/>Social media companies obliged to take down known sources of harmful content, including proven sources of disinformation<br/><br/>The report also concludes that:<br/><br/>Electoral law is 'not fit for purpose'<br/><br/>Facebook has intentionally and knowingly violated both data privacy and anti-competition laws<br/><br/>Angela continued: \"This report is a damning indictment of the internet wild west. Society needs to comprehend the harm that is being done to our fundamental freedoms and democracy, and governments need to act to protect them. We join Damian Collins, MP, in calling for urgent action to tackle the monopolistic tech giants to prevent electoral fraud, protect our privacy and protect the vulnerable from online harm\".<br/><br/>In a statement, Damian Collins MP, Chair of the DCMS Committee says:<br/><br/>\"Our inquiry over the last year has identified three big threats to our society. The challenge for the year ahead is to start to fix them; we cannot delay any longer.<br/><br/>\"Democracy is at risk from the malicious and relentless targeting of citizens with disinformation and personalised 'dark adverts' from unidentifiable sources, delivered through the major social media platforms we use every day. Much of this is directed from agencies working in foreign countries, including Russia.<br/><br/>\"The big tech companies are failing in the duty of care they owe to their users to act against harmful content, and to respect their data privacy rights.<br/><br/>\"Companies like Facebook exercise massive market power which enables them to make money by bullying the smaller technology companies and developers who rely on this platform to reach their customers.<br/><br/>The Committee calls for the Government to include concrete proposals for action in its forthcoming White Paper on online harms.<br/><br/>For further information, please contact Heidi Lambert on Tel: +44 1245 476 265 or Angela Mills Wade on Tel +44 1865 310 732<br/><br/>@epc_press<br/><br/><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.epceurope.eu\">www.epceurope.eu</url><br/><br/>The final report can be found here:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/digital-culture-media-and-sport-committee/news/fake-news-report-published-17-19/\">https://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/digital-culture-media-and-sport-committee/news/fake-news-report-published-17-19/</url><br/><br/>For further information about the work of the DCMS Committee:<br/><br/>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/digital-culture-media-and-sport-committee/\">https://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/digital-culture-media-and-sport-committee/</url><br/><br/>Information about the EU Code of Practice on Disinformation:<br/><br/>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/first-results-eu-code-practice-against-disinformation\">https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/first-results-eu-code-practice-against-disinformation</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">M2PW-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">M2PW2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VFR-5SP1-F0K1-N46S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">162367</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-02-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"680\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Normans Media Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>M2 PressWIRE</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"21233\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"02\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>February 18, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Plenty of big-name companies, including Microsoft, Amazon, Netflix, Spotify, Match Group (maker of Tinder) and even Google itself (oh yes, this is a tale of rank hypocrisy) are allowed to charge for products and services outside of app stores, and carry those purchase benefits through to apps that are downloaded via stores, without incurring the 30 per cent commission.</p><p>Nevertheless, both Apple and Google booted Fortnite from their stores citing breaches of their terms and conditions, leading to the most public skirmish in a war that has been brewing between developers and big tech for years.</p><p>In order to let some apps avoid the fee while still maintaining with a straight face that it applies the same terms and conditions to everyone, Apple, in particular, has been forced to come up with some convoluted distinctions over the years.</p><p>It has carved out fee exemptions for apps that are merely \"Readers\" of services purchased elsewhere (which explains why you can use Netflix on your iPhone).</p><p>However, this is as long as those apps are not Readers of email and messaging services paid for elsewhere, unless the email and messaging services are purchased by businesses and not purchased directly by consumers (which explains why you can use Slack on your iPhone) . . . unless the email and messaging service purchased directly by consumers actually has been exempted from the 30 per cent fee, in which case <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.protocol.com/hey-email-app-store-rejection\">Apple won't discuss it any more</url>.</p><p>Legal battle begins</p><p>Although you don't need to be a lawyer to come to a snap judgment in the court of public opinion that there is something deeply rotten about how Apple and Google exert power over their app stores, Epic Games has actually sued Apple and Google in a court of law, and lawyers will tell you that its chances there aren't quite so clear-cut.</p><p>The law, it seems, is yet to cotton on to the idea that Apple and Google wield enormous economic power through their app stores to make or break companies, which nowadays have no choice but to sell their goods and services through mobile phones.</p><p>In Australia, there are a couple of legal arguments an app developer could mount against its treatment in an app store, though legal scholars I've spoken to will tell you that the arguments will be difficult to win in a court of law.</p><p>One argument, which has the advantage of being based in reality, is that app stores have become vital economic infrastructure and as such should be closely regulated in the same way that, say, shipping ports and other pieces of infrastructure are regulated.</p><p>The manager of a shipping port wouldn't be allowed to deny access to a ship that happens to be owned by a competitor, and in the same way Apple and Google shouldn't be allowed to deny access to apps and services that happen to compete with their own apps and services, the argument goes.</p><p>Less of a stretch is Section 46 of the Trade Practices Act, which is summarised by the ACCC as follows: A firm with a substantial degree of power in a particular market (by market share or otherwise) cannot take advantage of that power for the purpose of damaging other businesses by refusing to deal or by offering to do business on such unrealistic terms that it is tantamount to refusal to deal.</p><p>There's no doubt that Apple and Google hold substantial power in the particular market of e-commerce. Indeed, the e-commerce markets represented by iPhone and Android users are each so vast and pervasive that some lawyers argue that the iOS and Android operating systems should each be regarded as their own markets for legal purposes, meaning that Apple has 100 per cent control over one market, and Google has 100 per cent control over another.</p><p>Forget the question of market share: both Apple and Google are total monopolists to which laws such as \"refusal to deal\" should clearly apply, the argument goes.</p><p>But as it stands, the infrastructure argument and the refusal to deal argument aren't clear winners, and it's likely that law reform will be needed if abuses of power in app stores are to be reined in.</p><p>As part of the fallout of the first <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.afr.com/companies/media-and-marketing/accc-solicits-views-on-news-media-and-digital-platforms-bargaining-code-20200519-p54u95\">Digital Platforms Inquiry</url>, the ACCC has commenced a five-year investigation into digital platforms, with a view to such law reform. Insiders say the ACCC is indeed treating app stores as digital platforms in their own right, meaning they will be scrutinised in ways that Apple and Google have been at pains to avoid.</p><p>So it's no longer a question of if the app stores will be held to account. It's only a question of when. For some app developers that have been booted off the app stores for reasons that only Apple and Google can understand, five years may prove too long.</p><p>In the meantime, the court of public opinion might have to take action.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFRONL-1520314187</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFRONL2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60MP-PS41-DY19-C28K-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">429670</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"965\"/><timeReceived>02:12 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

Epic then immediately sued Apple (as well as Google), alleging that the fee was a monopolistic abuse of its platform. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Now, Epic says that Apple is threatening to terminate the company's developer accounts for iOS by Aug. 28 -- a move that would affect the company's non-Fortnite business as well. </p><p>In a filing that cited Apple CEO Tim Cook's words at a congressional hearing last month that Apple \"do[es] not retaliate or bully people,\" Epic Games alleged that Apple \"has done just that.\"</p><p>\"[W]hen Epic sued Apple to break its monopoly on app stores and in-app payments, Apple retaliated ferociously,\" the company wrote in the filing. </p><p>Epic claimed that Apple's move would stop Epic's ability to create software on Apple's platforms for non-Fortnite assets, like the Unreal Engine, the company's profitable visualization tool that it licenses to other developers and companies. </p><p>Epic added that Apple has never claimed Unreal Engine had violated any Apple policies, unlike Fortnite. </p><p>\"Not content simply to remove Fortnite from the App Store, Apple is attacking Epic's entire business in unrelated areas,\" the company said. \"Epic is likely to succeed on the merits of its claims, but without an injunction, Epic will be irreparably harmed long before final judgment comes.\"</p><p>Without an injunction, Epic added, the action will \"be catastrophic for the future of the separate Unreal Engine business,\" if it can no longer be supported on Apple platforms.</p><p>Apple declined to comment on Epic's request for a temporary restraining order. Instead a spokesperson gave the same statement as last week, when it removed Fortnite from the Apple store. </p><p>\"Epic has had apps on the App Store for a decade, and has benefited from the App Store ecosystem -- including its tools, testing, and distribution that Apple provides to all developers,\" Apple said in the statement. \"Epic agreed to the App Store terms and guidelines freely.... The fact that their business interests now lead them to push for a special arrangement does not change the fact that these guidelines create a level playing field for all developers and make the store safe for all users.\"</p><p>Unreal Engine, the graphics software backing up the game, is used across a variety of industries to make 3-D renderings. Movies like the new \"Star Wars\" films and \"Mad Max: Fury Road\" have used it, for example. Brain surgeons have practiced surgery with it, and architects use it to design buildings. </p><p>Like Fortnite, Epic gives Unreal away for free, though some upgrades cost money. </p><p>The company brings in around $200 million per year through its licensing of the engine, but there is still a lot of room to grow that number, Michael Pachter, an analyst at Wedbush Securities, told The News &amp; Observer last year. </p><p>The money from Unreal could help Epic weather the potential loss of revenue it makes from Fortnite on iPhones. </p><p>Fortnite brought in an estimated $1.8 billion last year alone, according to Nielsen's SuperData. But new players of Fortnite cannot download the game on the App Store, and those who already have it on their iPhone won't be able to update. </p><p>Will Hershey, a cofounder of Roundhill Investments, which invests in video game companies, said Epic should be able to handle an extended legal fight with Apple, without App Store revenue. </p><p>\"I think they can hold out for a year or two, at least,\" Hershey said in an email. \"Epic just raised $1.8 billion in an equity financing, $250 million of which came from Sony. They are also still generating revenues from Fortnite on PC and console, not to mention Rocket League and Houseparty, two of the company's recent acquisitions.\"</p><p>Epic's battle with Apple and Google is being widely watched for its implications on tech regulation in the U.S.</p><p>Matt Perault, director of the Center for Science &amp; Technology Policy at Duke University, told The N&amp;O last week that it could encourage U.S. and European regulators to take a more aggressive approach to Big Tech. </p><p>\"By pursuing long-term injunctive relief rather than a short-term remedy or damages that would benefit only Epic, the company is showing its desire to change the landscape for the entire developer ecosystem,\" Perault said. \"(I)t's possible that Epic's actions will provide more momentum to antitrust regulators in the U.S. and Europe.\"</p><p>This story was produced with financial support from a coalition of partners led by Innovate Raleigh as part of an independent journalism fellowship program.

Epic, which has long railed against the 30% fee the companies charge for in-app purchases, had circumvented their payment systems in a new update of the game. </p><p>As soon as Fortnite was removed from the app stores, Epic filed lawsuits and spun out a flashy marketing campaign to paint Apple as a villain to the 350 million Fortnite players around the world. </p><p>The lawsuit made no bones about it: The goal was to set precedent on how the developer ecosystem operates. The company even enlisted Christine Varney, the former assistant attorney general of the antitrust division during the Obama administration, to lead its case. The inclusion of Varney, one of the leading minds in antitrust law, sends a signal that these lawsuits \"should be taken seriously,\" said Rebecca Haw Allensworth, a professor of antitrust at Vanderbilt Law School.</p><p>In its lawsuit against Apple, Epic wrote that it \"is not seeking monetary compensation from this Court for the injuries it has suffered. Nor is Epic seeking favorable treatment for itself, a single company. Instead, Epic is seeking injunctive relief to allow fair competition in these two key markets that directly affect hundreds of millions of consumers and tens of thousands, if not more, of third-party app developers.\"</p><p>EpicApple Complaint </p><p>The main thrust of the argument: The combination of the phone operating systems and their app stores unreasonably restricts distribution of apps and how payments can be processed in those apps. </p><p>Apple, for its part, contends the way it operates its App store creates \"a level playing field for all developers and make(s) the store safe for all users.\"</p><p>Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney took to Twitter to say the lawsuit will be \"a hell of a fight.\" </p><p>Matt Perault, director of the Center for Science &amp; Technology Policy at Duke University, said Epic's legal challenge could further embolden U.S. and European regulators to take a more aggressive stance against the tech giants. </p><p>\"By pursuing long-term injunctive relief rather than a short-term remedy or damages that would benefit only Epic, the company is showing its desire to change the landscape for the entire developer ecosystem,\" Perault said. \"(I)t's possible that Epic's actions will provide more momentum to antitrust regulators in the U.S. and Europe.\" </p><p>Already, Perault noted, European regulators have launched an antitrust investigation into Apple after Spotify complained about the company's 30% fee.</p><p>It was only a few years ago, Allensworth noted, that people talked about antitrust laws -- first created in 1890 -- as if they were dead. Now they're very much top of mind for Big Tech. </p><p>The move isn't without risk for Epic Games. The amount of money at play is significant -- even if the company just raised $1.8 billion from investors.</p><p>Fortnite brought in an estimated $1.8 billion last year alone, according to Nielsen's SuperData. And in the past two years, the game has been downloaded onto iPhones and iPads alone more than 133 million times, bringing in $1.2 billion, The New York Times reported, citing the analytics firm Sensor Tower. That would put Apple's cut at around $360 million, according to Sensor Tower.</p><p>Now, new players of Fortnite will not be able to download the game on the App Store. And for those who already have it installed on their iPhone, they will not be able to update it -- a fact that means it could eventually become obsolete as Apple upgrades its software. A new season of the game is expected to begin soon as well, meaning many users won't be able to play it on their iPhone. </p><p>The problem isn't as immediate for Android users, whose system allows for Fortnite to still be installed from the Epic Games store. Up until April, that was the only way to play the game on an Android phone, as Epic protested Google's fees. </p><p>Google and Apple have more leverage than Epic, reckons Wall Street Journal columnist Dan Gallagher. \"The two companies power nearly every smartphone in the world through their respective operating systems, and few if any will be throwing away their mobile phone in a fit of pique over a video game,\" he wrote. </p><p>Allensworth said the lawsuit will be very hard for Epic to win. \"It is hard to bring these cases unless there is such obvious evidence that competition is really constrained,\" she said. </p><p>The question the courts will be looking at, she said, is whether Apple and Google's actions represent money-seeking behaviors or are they actually trying to constrain a competitor from potentially challenging their monopoly. </p><p>But Epic, with its large following, could win in the court of public opinion. </p><p>\"The antitrust laws are very open textured. It is very possible to change their interpretation over time,\" Allensworth said. \"You have got to be worried, if you are Apple, about shifting public perception trickling down into the interpretation of laws.\"</p><p>This story was produced with financial support from a coalition of partners led by Innovate Raleigh as part of an independent journalism fellowship program.

nitf:lede=\"true\">Spotify and the makers of Fortnite, Epic Games and Match Group are taking on Apple and Google as part of a newly formed coalition calling for 'fair treatment' in the way the tech giants run their app stores.</p><p>The group, called the Coalition for App Fairness, is set to advocate for legal and regulatory changes.</p><p>This includes measures that could block Apple and Google from favoring their own apps in the iPhone and Android operating systems they control. </p><p>The move comes amid criticism of the fees and terms imposed by the app stores, and by both Epic and Spotify to Apple for its 30 percent commission for online subscriptions and in-app purchases.</p><p>The Coalition for App Fairness also aims to be the 'voice of app and game developers in the effort to protect consumer choice and create a level playing field for all,' said a statement from Horacio Gutierrez, head of global affairs and chief legal officer for music-streaming pioneer Spotify. </p><p>Tim Sweeney, CEO and founder of Epic Games, said: 'The basic freedoms of developers are under attack.' </p><p>'We are joining the Coalition for App Fairness to defend the fundamental rights of creators to build apps and to do business directly with their customers. </p><p>'We are an advocate for any company that's ready to reclaim its rights and challenge the anti-competitive behaviors that exist on app stores today.'</p><p>Along with Spotify, Epic Games and Match Group, the coalition includes Basecamp, which previously criticized Apple over the handling of its Hey email app. Tile, Deezer, ProtonMail, Blockchain.com, Skydemon, Prepear, News Media Europe, Blix and the European Publishers Council are also members. </p><p>Apple is the group's main target, though Google's app store policies are also on its radar. </p><p>Both companies this summer dropped the popular game Fortnite from their app stores after the game\u00b4s developer introduced a direct payment plan that bypasses their platforms.</p><p>Apple and Google both take a 30 percent cut from in-app revenue purchases, which has long been a sore spot with developers.</p><p>Epic Games responded by suing the companies over what it sees as anti-competitive behavior. </p><p>However, the game maker was not seeking money from Apple, but rather injunctions that would end many of the companies' practices related to their app stores.</p><p>Apple said it would also be revoking Epic's developer licence - which is needed to publish games for iOS and macOS and gives access to Apple developer tools as a counter attack.</p><p>In addition to Apple's feud with Epic, the tech giant has been accused of manipulating its rules and policies to favor its Find My App over the competing Tile. </p><p>'What doesn't feel fair is Apple curates the App Store, so if you're trending and charting you still may not be visible unless they want you to,' a developer familiar with the issue told Coalition for App Fairness. </p><p>In addition to the app stores, Big Tech is facing fresh scrutiny from antitrust regulators. </p><p>As the Trump administration moves toward antitrust action against search giant Google, it\u00b4s campaigning to enlist support from sympathetic state attorneys general across the country.</p><p>The anticipated lawsuit against Google by the Justice Department could be the government\u00b4s biggest legal offensive to protect competition since the ground-breaking case against Microsoft almost 20 years ago.</p><p>Lawmakers and consumer advocates accuse Google of abusing its dominance in online search and advertising to stifle competition and boost its profits.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

Not many can afford to litigate against adversaries with a combined market cap of $3 trillion, but for publisher Epic Games, which is estimated to be making more than $5 million dollars a day on the hit battle royale game, they have much to gain by keeping Apple and Google\u2019s 30% cut of the proceeds. With 350 million players, Fortnite has the largest game community in the world and is considered in its own right a force to be reckoned with.    To underscore the irony of just how powerful Apple has become, Epic announced their lawsuit with a parody of the tech titan\u2019s iconic 1984 Super Bowl commercial. With a chilling call to action, the video asserts, \u201cEpic Games has defied the App Store Monopoly. In retaliation, Apple is blocking Fortnite from a billion devices. Join the fight to stop 2020 from becoming 1984.\u201d Since its posting, several prominent app developers have been protesting the \u201cApple tax\u201d including Spotify, Match and ironically Facebook , also the subject of antitrust investigations.     But as rebel forces gather to fight the machine, Big Tech has been getting richer as the global economy moves further online to work, shop, socialize and shelter from the pandemic. To understand just how quickly the behemoths are growing, Apple, Amazon and Facebook\u2019s market value jumped a whopping quarter trillion dollars in the two days following the July 29th U.S. Congressional hearings. That\u2019s more than the GDP of New Zealand and AI is behind much of it.         Rockefeller Foundation and The Brookings Institution have published reports on how the profit motive of corporations are driving well-intentioned companies to commit market abuses as machine learning algorithms optimize for data monetiziation to maximize shareholder value at all costs.     I talked with internet pioneer Tim O\u2019Reilly of O\u2019Reilly Media, Rockefeller Foundation\u2019s Zia Khan, author of AI+1: Shaping Our Integrated Future , and Brookings scholar Darrell West, author of Turning Point: Policymaking in the Era of AI , on how better AI governance can reign in surveillance capitalism.    Robots Cannot Save Us From Ourselves         \u201cFacebook, Google and Amazon are larger than many countries in terms of their economies, yet they don\u2019t serve the public good because they\u2019re not programmed to,\u201d O\u2019Reilly said. \u201cAI is constantly being told to do the wrong things. It\u2019s focused on manipulating the consumer for profit. The destruction of small businesses by big businesses is ok because it\u2019s cheaper for the consumer.\u201d    To achieve economic outcomes that benefit all, O\u2019Reilly is advocating that companies build systems that have more complexity and take into account a wider range of factors including what\u2019s good for users, society, and the planet, not just the bottom line. \u201cInnovation needs to occur in the rules, not the tools,\u201d Khan added.    \u201cLike Elon Musk\u2019s strawberry picking robot that decides humanity is in the way of strawberry fields forever, self-improving AI becomes a problem when we are not intentional with setting objectives,\u201d said O\u2019Reilly.    \u201cWhen people fantasize about AI going wrong, they think about this rogue agent acting independently but the real risk is it being badly governed by people who have bad motives.\u201d    Looking ahead, O\u2019Reilly said, \u201cIt\u2019s not a matter of when computers will be more intelligent than humans, it could be argued they\u2019ve already passed the Turing test. Bots fool people all the time, they just can\u2019t decide to do something on their own. But there is no horizon on that. We don\u2019t even understand where volition comes from within ourselves.\u201d    Khan agreed that AI is still in the early stages and can easily be managed, \u201cWhen the killer robot comes, just close the door. They\u2019re good at many things, but bad at opening doors.\u201d    Regarding the techlash against the growing market dominance and alleged predatory practices of Apple, Google, Facebook and Amazon, West agrees that better governance is needed, \u201cThe hands-off stance on the tech sector is ending and we\u2019re entering a new era of greater public oversight and regulation.\u201d    Watch the complete testimony of Apple CEO Tim Cook, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos and</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42842137087</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60KN-MBH1-F07F-8021-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"800\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Forbes.com</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 15, 2020 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>United States</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Americas</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Northern America</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Antitrust &amp;

But its hundreds of millions of worldwide fans will not be able to play it on iPhones or any other Apple devices. That is because the maker of the battle game has launched a real-world battle against Apple, and they announced the legal challenge with a dramatic video.             </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">                            (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)                </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR:                 (As character) This power is ours and ours alone. We shall prevail.             </p><p>AILSA CHANG:                 (Laughter) NPR's Bobby Allyn joins us with more. Hey, Bobby.             </p><p>BOBBY ALLYN:                 Hey, Ailsa.             </p><p>AILSA CHANG:                 All right. So bring us up to speed here. How did Fortnite end up getting kicked out of the Apple app store?             </p><p>BOBBY ALLYN:                 Yeah, right. So Epic Games, which makes Fortnite, just took a big swing at Apple over its 30% fee on app downloads.             </p><p>AILSA CHANG:                 Thirty percent - that sounds like a lot.             </p><p>BOBBY ALLYN:                 Yeah, it is, according to Epic. And they were sick of paying it, you know, as are, you know, countless other developers. So they told their fans to pay for their game outside of the Apple app store. And in retaliation, Apple kicked Fortnite out. Then, Epic sued in epic fashion - right? - by, you know, rallying its 350 million users against Apple. They held an anti-Apple battle contest and offered hats as a game prize that said hashtag #FreeFortnite.             </p><p>                Dan Ives is a tech analyst at Wedbush Securities, and he said everything about Epic's fight with Apple was deliberate, including the timing here - right? - just when lawmakers and regulators are really turning up the heat on Apple over these fees.             </p><p>DAN IVES:                 Epic tried to strike when the iron was hot, go after Apple, groundswell social media movement. But it comes down to the courts. And going up against Apple, it's like trying to dunk over LeBron.             </p><p>AILSA CHANG:                 (Laughter) I mean, yeah, why would anyone even try? So why is Epic so worked up over these fees, besides them being 30%?             </p><p>BOBBY ALLYN:                 Yeah. I mean, developers have complained about them for a while because, you know, they tend to apply to the apps that cost money, the ones you purchase, and those are the big moneymakers for developers. The fees just make Apple and Google bigger and richer, and developers say it hurts their bottom line. If you have an app and you want to get it to people, you only have two options - Apple or Google. And developers are just forced to play by the rules that these two Big Tech giants set. Here's Apple CEO Tim Cook. He's defending the 30% fee at that Big Tech hearing that happened in Washington last month.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)                </p><p>TIM COOK:                 When we entered the app store market, the cost of distributing software was 50% to 70%. And so we took the rate in half, which is 30%, and we've held it in that same level over time or lowered it.             </p><p>BOBBY ALLYN:                 Yeah. What he means is that Apple's fees are lower after the first year. And Tim Cook is right that the cost of packaging, shipping and, you know, space on store shelves is higher than a 30% fee. But Epic says we are living in a different era, and a digital download should not be effectively taxed by Apple. And by the way, Epic is making the same case in court against Google.             </p><p>AILSA CHANG:                 OK, so where do things stand now in all this litigation?             </p><p>BOBBY ALLYN:                 Right. So the judge in the Apple case recently said, yes, there are some serious questions with these fees, but Epic did this to itself, the judge said, by effectively breaching its contract with Apple. So this case is probably going to be dragging on for many months. For Fortnite fans, they can still battle it out on Nintendo and Xbox, but they will not be able to download Fortnite on iPhones or Apple computers. And I guess you can call that an epic disappointment.             </p><p>AILSA CHANG:                 (Laughter) That's NPR's Bobby Allyn.

Any other app would have received the same treatment. Epic manufactured the entire crisis so it could take advantage of the current antitrust landscape regarding big tech, and file its lawsuits against Apple and Google. Epic could have sued Apple and Google without all the extra commotion, but the company is looking to gain public support in what could otherwise be tedious court battles over business practices.When Fortnite developer Epic Games updated its app to allow it to process in-app purchases (IAP) from gamers and skirt Apple and Google, it knew what was going to follow[2]. Neither Apple nor Google would allow any of that as this is a clear violation of the rules they have in place for the App Store and GooglePlay, respectively. </p><p>It's not really about the money, although the 30% cut that Apple and Google get is a factor. Fortnite did so fully knowing that Apple would not blink and ban Fortnite, as it would with any other app that's stepping out of bounds. The rules that govern any community aren't optional for those willing to play along. In this case, the App Store rules are strictly enforced, and Apple would have banned any developer pulling the same stunt. Epic undoubtedly knew this, and that's why it baited Apple in the first. The fact that it was quick to follow up with its own take at a famous Apple commercial, and to sue Apple is only proof that Epic looked to take advantage of the current context in its fight against Apple and Google. And Google, too, banned Fortnite. Epic then sued Google. All this is proof that Epic engineered the Fortnite crisis on mobile to win over public opinion and have gamers on its side in the fight with Apple. Epic could have sued Apple and Google without all the extra bells and whistles. The point of all of this is money. Epic isn't willing to pay up up that 30% fee. Or better said, Epic wants more money from gamers, but it can't do it because of Apple and Google's IAP shares. The Apple cut is really what it all boils down to, and Epic is just taking advantage of the antitrust vibe right now, as big tech companies are under increased scrutiny from regulators in the US, Europe, and elsewhere. Of the $10 you'd pay Fortnite for V-bucks, $7 goes to Fortnite, and $3 to Apple or Google. When Fortnite offered you the option of paying $8 for the same IAP loot, it presented it as a 20% discount to the gamer. But the fact is that $8 happens to be a 14.29% increase in profit for Epic. Well, I'm not including here card processing fees, so let's round it up to 14%. Epic could increase the prices in the App Store and Google Play if it wants more money, but Apple and Google's cuts would also go up. Epic is being incredibly misleading in its public messaging. Yes, that 30% cut is annoying, and many developers don't like it. App Store users would appreciate price cuts for their favorite apps and subscription if it were for Apple to drop that percentage across the board. The same goes for Google and Play customers. But to say that 'Apple has become what it once railed against: the behemoth seeking to control markets, block competition, and stifle innovation' in that 1984 spoof add is false. Were it not for Apple, there wouldn't be more than one billion devices that can run Fortnite. That doesn't just happen overnight. It's also not something that Epic can take for granted after so many years and billions spent on iPhone and iOS research. The same goes for any developer. Getting access to that massive market may not come cheap, and Apple is entitled to set whatever cut of the profits it wants. That's how business works. Nobody forces anyone to buy iPhones, nobody forces Epic to bring its games to the iPhone, and nobody forces people to get IAPs. Apple provides a store that's safe for the regular user to use, both when it comes to user data and privacy and transaction security. The App Store is always up, all the apps and IAP downloads are always available. That's Apple's cloud infrastructure doing all the work. It's not Epic's money that invested in any of that. Apple continues to update the software on all its products and ensures that as many iOS devices can run as many apps as possible, Fortnite included. It offers a variety of SDKs to take advantage of, early access to OS beta versions, and a way for developers to beta test their apps before they're released. It also reviews code to ensure user safety before the apps make it to the App Store. It then takes care of the distribution, it helps with discovery, and safeguards payments. That 30% pays for the keeping up the lights, and probably delivers a profit. That's how business works. Google does all of that too. And most of that happens without the end-user necessarily acknowledging the tremendous effort that goes into making the App Store and Google Play work. By appealing to gamers with this concerted and well-executed PR campaign, Epic is hoping to put pressure on Apple and Google, willfully ignoring the reason why Fortnite works on iPad, iPhone, and Mac in the first place, and why it can make billions of dollars off of Apple's and Google's digital stores.It's easy to back the 'rebel' in this fight, which Epic self-proposes it to be. And I'm probably in the minority defending Apple and Google on this one. But Epic's stunt should not be validated. Again, yes, I'd like to see that 30% go down if that means the savings are passed in their entirety to me. But I'm absolutely not going to trust anyone but Apple and Google with managing the app stores for mobile devices. Let's not forget how Epic launched its Android app last year[3], prompting games to sideload the app as it wanted to avoid the Play Store fees, and willfully ignoring the security risks. Of course, sideloading apps shouldn't be advised \u2014 that's not possible on iPhone, and it's probably something Google should close up as well. Unsurprisingly, malware versions of Fortnite[4] targeted unsuspecting gamers in the months following the Android launch, which is what malicious individuals would do with any popular app that's available from outside the app store. Epic, by the way, had to accept the Play store reluctantly. And let's not forget that Epic has been sued for making it easier for hackers to steal Fortnite accounts[5]. This is not a company that I would want to manage any store that handles data and money exchange. And assuming that Epic does get its way and ends up somehow being allowed to sell apps through its marketplace on iPhone and Android, it'll be interesting to see how it enforces its own store rules. In such a scenario, Epic will, too, take a cut of sales, it will also be able to ban apps for violations, and it will to have to impose Epic's 'way or the highway' to other developers. It's just the way this works. That said, we're not going to learn who wins this out anytime soon. Apple and Google will have their work cut out for themselves in antitrust battles of their own, including the Epic one. And Apple will have a harder time appealing to public opinion on this one as efficiently as Epic just did.

Any other app would have received the same treatment.  Epic manufactured the entire crisis so it could take advantage of the current antitrust landscape regarding big tech, and file its lawsuits against Apple and Google.  Epic could have sued Apple and Google without all the extra commotion, but the company is looking to gain public support in what could otherwise be tedious court battles over business practices.   When Fortnite developer Epic Games updated its app to allow it to process in-app purchases (IAP) from gamers and skirt Apple and Google, it knew what was going to follow . Neither Apple nor Google would allow any of that as this is a clear violation of the rules they have in place for the App Store and GooglePlay, respectively. It\u2019s not really about the money, although the 30% cut that Apple and Google get is a factor.    Fortnite did so fully knowing that Apple would not blink and ban Fortnite, as it would with any other app that\u2019s stepping out of bounds. The rules that govern any community aren\u2019t optional for those willing to play along. In this case, the App Store rules are strictly enforced, and Apple would have banned any developer pulling the same stunt. Epic undoubtedly knew this, and that\u2019s why it baited Apple in the first. The fact that it was quick to follow up with its own take at a famous Apple commercial, and to sue Apple is only proof that Epic looked to take advantage of the current context in its fight against Apple and Google. And Google, too, banned Fortnite. Epic then sued Google. All this is proof that Epic engineered the Fortnite crisis on mobile to win over public opinion and have gamers on its side in the fight with Apple. Epic could have sued Apple and Google without all the extra bells and whistles.    The point of all of this is money. Epic isn\u2019t willing to pay up up that 30% fee. Or better said, Epic wants more money from gamers, but it can\u2019t do it because of Apple and Google\u2019s IAP shares. The Apple cut is really what it all boils down to, and Epic is just taking advantage of the antitrust vibe right now, as big tech companies are under increased scrutiny from regulators in the US, Europe, and elsewhere.    Of the $10 you\u2019d pay Fortnite for V-bucks, $7 goes to Fortnite, and $3 to Apple or Google. When Fortnite offered you the option of paying $8 for the same IAP loot, it presented it as a 20% discount to the gamer. But the fact is that $8 happens to be a 14.29% increase in profit for Epic. Well, I\u2019m not including here card processing fees, so let\u2019s round it up to 14%. Epic could increase the prices in the App Store and Google Play if it wants more money, but Apple and Google\u2019s cuts would also go up.    Epic is being incredibly misleading in its public messaging. Yes, that 30% cut is annoying, and many developers don\u2019t like it. App Store users would appreciate price cuts for their favorite apps and subscription if it were for Apple to drop that percentage across the board. The same goes for Google and Play customers.    But to say that \u201cApple has become what it once railed against: the behemoth seeking to control markets, block competition, and stifle innovation\u201d in that 1984 spoof add is false.    Were it not for Apple, there wouldn\u2019t be more than one billion devices that can run Fortnite. That doesn\u2019t just happen overnight. It\u2019s also not something that Epic can take for granted after so many years and billions spent on iPhone and iOS research. The same goes for any developer.    Getting access to that massive market may not come cheap, and Apple is entitled to set whatever cut of the profits it wants. That\u2019s how business works. Nobody forces anyone to buy iPhones, nobody forces Epic to bring its games to the iPhone, and nobody forces people to get IAPs.    Apple provides a store that\u2019s safe for the regular user to use, both when it comes to user data and privacy and transaction security. The App Store is always up, all the apps and IAP downloads are always available. That\u2019s Apple\u2019s cloud infrastructure doing all the work. It\u2019s not Epic\u2019s money that invested in any of that.    Apple continues to update the software on all its products and ensures that as many iOS devices can run as many apps as possible, Fortnite included. It offers a variety of SDKs to take advantage of, early access to OS beta versions, and a way for developers to beta test their apps before they\u2019re released. It also reviews code to ensure user safety before the apps make it to the App Store. It then takes care of the distribution, it helps with discovery, and safeguards payments. That 30% pays for the keeping up the lights, and probably delivers a profit. That\u2019s how business works.    Google does all of that too. And most of that happens without the end-user necessarily acknowledging the tremendous effort that goes into making the App Store and Google Play work.    By appealing to gamers with this concerted and well-executed PR campaign, Epic is hoping to put pressure on Apple and Google, willfully ignoring the reason why Fortnite works on iPad, iPhone, and Mac in the first place, and why it can make billions of dollars off of Apple\u2019s and Google\u2019s digital stores.    It\u2019s easy to back the \u201crebel\u201d in this fight, which Epic self-proposes it to be. And I\u2019m probably in the minority defending Apple and Google on this one. But Epic\u2019s stunt should not be validated.    Again, yes, I\u2019d like to see that 30% go down if that means the savings are passed in their entirety to me. But I\u2019m absolutely not going to trust anyone but Apple and Google with managing the app stores for mobile devices.    Let\u2019s not forget how Epic launched its Android app last year , prompting games to sideload the app as it wanted to avoid the Play Store fees, and willfully ignoring the security risks. Of course, sideloading apps shouldn\u2019t be advised \u2014 that\u2019s not possible on iPhone, and it\u2019s probably something Google should close up as well. Unsurprisingly, malware versions of Fortnite targeted unsuspecting gamers in the months following the Android launch, which is what malicious individuals would do with any popular app that\u2019s available from outside the app store. Epic, by the way, had to accept the Play store reluctantly. And let\u2019s not forget that Epic has been sued for making it easier for hackers to steal Fortnite accounts .    This is not a company that I would want to manage any store that handles data and money exchange. And assuming that Epic does get its way and ends up somehow being allowed to sell apps through its marketplace on iPhone and Android, it\u2019ll be interesting to see how it enforces its own store rules. In such a scenario, Epic will, too, take a cut of sales, it will also be able to ban apps for violations, and it will to have to impose Epic\u2019s \u201cway or the highway\u201d to other developers. It\u2019s just the way this works.    That said, we\u2019re not going to learn who wins this out anytime soon. Apple and Google will have their work cut out for themselves in antitrust battles of their own, including the Epic one. And Apple will have a harder time appealing to public opinion on this one as efficiently as Epic just did.

Well, the timing isn't half bad, but good luck staring down Apple.    Epic Games' lawsuit and tug-of-war with Apple over App Store fees are part opportunism, given big tech scrutiny, part good business, and a lot of leverage.   Also: Apple mercilessly mocked by Epic where it hurts   Apple on Thursday removed Epic Games' Fortnite from its App Store after the company implemented its own in-app payment system . The upshot was Epic bypassed Apple's 30% cut. Enter lawsuit .   Apple's 30% cut, which looked like a deal when first instituted, has been under scrutiny due to the company's market dominance in the app economy. Google's app distribution has also been under fire.   Must read:   Epic is ultimately looking to leverage its Fortnite community to put pressure on Apple. Fortnite offered permanent discount prices on virtual offers for every purchase on PlayStation, Xbox, Nintendo Switch, PC, and Mac, and then Apple made its iOS move.   In its lawsuit, Epic said:   Apple has become what it once railed against: the behemoth seeking to control markets, block competition, and stifle innovation. Apple is bigger, more powerful, more entrenched, and more pernicious than the monopolists of yesteryear. At a market cap of nearly $2 trillion, Apple's size and reach far exceeds that of any technology monopolist in history.      Epic continues to argue that Apple exacts \"an oppressive 30% tax on the sale of every app.\"   Apple's rebuttal:   Today, Epic Games took the unfortunate step of violating the App Store guidelines that are applied equally to every developer and designed to keep the store safe for our users. As a result their Fortnite app has been removed from the store. Epic enabled a feature in its app which was not reviewed or approved by Apple, and they did so with the express intent of violating the App Store guidelines regarding in-app payments that apply to every developer who sells digital goods or services.   Epic has had apps on the App Store for a decade, and have benefited from the App Store ecosystem - including it's tools, testing, and distribution that Apple provides to all developers. Epic agreed to the App Store terms and guidelines freely and we're glad they've built such a successful business on the App Store. The fact that their business interests now lead them to push for a special arrangement does not change the fact that these guidelines create a level playing field for all developers and make the store safe for all users. We will make every effort to work with Epic to resolve these violations so they can return Fortnite to the App Store.   In addition, Epic said it is looking for injunctive relief on fees instead of monetary. Epic also said it is sticking up for the little developer.   Epic brings this suit to end Apple's unfair and anti-competitive actions that Apple undertakes to unlawfully maintain its monopoly in two distinct, multibillion-dollar markets: (i) the iOS App Distribution Market, and (ii) the iOS In-App Payment Processing Market (each as defined below). Epic is not seeking monetary compensation from this Court for the injuries it has suffered. Nor is Epic seeking favorable treatment for itself, a single company. Instead, Epic is seeking injunctive relief to allow fair competition in these two key markets that directly affect hundreds of millions of consumers and tens of thousands, if not more, of third-party app developers.   At its WWDC , Apple made sure to mention how much it has supported developers and enabled them to build businesses. On Apple's earnings call July 30 , CEO Tim Cook said:   This quarter, a new study by independent economists at The Analysis Group found that the App Store facilitated more than $0.5 trillion in commerce globally in 2019 alone. Especially in a time of COVID-19, you can measure economic resilience in the ways in which the App Store supports remote ordering for restaurants, digital commerce for small businesses and an enduring entrepreneurial opportunity for creators and visionaries.   Epic begs to differ and said Apple's requirement that developers use its App Store means developers have to ultimately charge consumers more to maintain margins. The recent Congressional hearing on technology monopolies brought up similar points.   Ultimately what Epic is looking to do is force Apple to negotiate, but it's doubtful threats are going to get Apple to budge. Questions that'll need to be addressed going forward:  How much should Apple's cut be to distribute apps: 20% or 10%? What implications will the Epic-Apple face-off have for Google? Will other developers with clout join the Epic fray? And will any of these issues garner antitrust scrutiny or give developers some legal wins?</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42832323690</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60KD-J8P1-F07F-824B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"842\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>ZDNet</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 13, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"97\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"82\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0002KBZ</classCode><className>NINTENDO CO LTD</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"97\"><className>NAICS423430 COMPUTER &amp;

TECH</nitf:hl2></nitf:hedline><nitf:byline><author><person><nameText> By Natalie Yahr </nameText></person></author></nitf:byline></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services is preparing to change the rules on how medical records are shared, and former Governor Tommy Thompson is worried.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In a Wisconsin State Journal op-ed last week, Thompson, who headed HHS under former President George W. Bush, wrote that \"the requirements threaten the booming healthcare tech economy that helps all of Wisconsin.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It's not yet clear exactly what the new rules will require of health information technology companies like Verona medical records software giant Epic Systems. The proposed rules announced last February called on the healthcare industry to \"adopt standardized application programming interfaces (APIs)\" to allow individuals to access electronic health records through third-party smartphone applications.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In statement to the Cap Times, Epic Systems executive Sumit Rana said the proposed rules would require Epic and other electronic health records companies to \"share their intellectual property with venture capitalists and others seeking to monetize patient data.\"</p><p>\"It threatens patient and family privacy if privacy regulations for app vendors aren't in place before the rule begins,\" Rana said. \"The rule would hurt the thriving health IT sector here in Wisconsin and consequently endangers the economy of the state.\"</p><p>The Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology, meanwhile, asserts that the change would \"increase innovation and competition by giving patients and their healthcare providers secure access to health information and new tools, allowing for more choice in care and treatment.\"</p><p>The office provides voluntary certification for health information technology.</p><p>Making records play nice</p><p>The new rule would require that companies seeking to maintain their certification make health records more \"interoperable,\" allowing different health information systems to share patient data across clinics, hospitals, pharmacies and labs, as well as allowing patients themselves to access their health data through smartphone applications like Apple Health.</p><p>The nonprofit Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society Inc. has backed the move toward interoperability, issuing a 2017 \"Call to Action\" on the matter. \"We must achieve secure, appropriate, and ubiquitous data access and electronic exchange of health information,\" the document reads. \"Now is the time for bold action.\"</p><p>The concept is nothing new, said Nick Hatt, senior developer at Redox. The company, which was founded in Madison in 2014 by a former Epic employee, makes a business out of \"simplifying how healthcare shares data.\"</p><p>The 21st Century Cures Act, passed in 2016, prohibited health IT companies from anticompetitive \"information blocking,\" but the new rule would clarify what that entails. The February 2019 proposal offers seven exceptions under which such companies may block a patient's information from being shared, including when sharing the information could harm a person or violate a patient's privacy. The proposed rule also allows for companies to charge a fee for sharing \"for reasonable costs incurred,\" and it allows companies to license their products in order to protect their intellectual property.</p><p>The February proposal also requires certified health IT companies to offer the ability to export the full medical record for a single patient or for all of a provider's patients, a feature intended to give patients more access to their records and to allow providers to switch to a new IT system if needed.</p><p>'A positive light'</p><p>Hatt said Redox views the new requirements \"in a positive light.\"</p><p>\"It's going to allow people to take their records with them in a digital format in a way we've never seen before,\" Hatt said.</p><p>Dr. David Kunstman, associate chief medical information officer for ambulatory care at UW Health, did not discuss the proposed rule with the Cap Times but said when medical records transfer easily and electronically, patients and doctors benefit.</p><p>Kunstman, who spends about half his time working as a primary care doctor, noted that when patients change employers or insurance plans, they often change doctors. At UW Health, which uses Epic for its records, he's able to easily transfer records for any patient coming from another provider that uses Epic.</p><p>\"It makes my job a lot easier because I don't have to repeat basically everything,\" Kunstman said.</p><p>For other patients, it's another story, Kunstman said.</p><p>\"We still do it the old-fashioned way. We still request records, they show up on paper, we scan those into the chart,\" a process that Kunstman said typically takes about three weeks. \"Instantaneous versus three weeks.\"</p><p>Until he gets the records, he's left to guess about the patient's medical history.</p><p>\"Usually somebody shows up at my door - a brand new patient - and they remember that they had something done but they're not really quite sure what,\" he said.</p><p>In one recent case, a patient knew he'd had heart surgery but didn't know just what was done. Reviewing prior notes in the patient's record, Kunstman was able to gather the details he needed.</p><p>Kunstman appreciates the ease with which he can transfer records among Epic customers using Epic's Care Everywhere functionality.</p><p>\"If more folks could be on those standards, it would certainly be helpful,\" he said.</p><p>A threat from Silicon Valley?</p><p>Hatt thinks it's \"too early to tell\" whether Thompson is right about the threat to Epic, but he noted that the new rule would affect Epic and its competitors in the health records industry equally. The rule won't allow some Silicon Valley tech company to require Epic to turn over all its records, he said, noting that health privacy laws still govern these data exchanges.</p><p>\"It's not designed to help the big tech companies get more data and take over and displace people,\" Hatt said. \"It really is centered around the patient and what the patient can do. It's about patient access to data.\"</p><p>But, he said, the rule will place a heavy compliance burden on big companies like Epic. As for startups, he said, \"it's kind of like a knife that cuts both ways,\" as it could give new opportunities to developers who can offer new health-related apps. But any startup charged with information blocking could face steep fines if found in violation.</p><p>Hatt believes that the more stringent certification requirements are likely to consolidate the industry, a trend he's been tracking over the last decade. \"Some firms have done really well,\" Hatt said. \"It's hard to say what the effects will be.\"</p><p>Speak now, or ...</p><p>Companies like Epic were given ample opportunity to comment on the proposal, said regulation attorney Amy S. Leopard. HHS planned for a three-month comment period and then extended that period for an additional month in response to the thousands of responses it had received, a move Leopard called \"unusual.\" The extended period ended on June 3, 2019.</p><p>Leopard, who submitted comment on the rules on behalf of clients - mainly healthcare providers - and professional organizations, described a \"hip hip hooray,\" response. \"Everybody seems excited about APIs and how to safely and securely direct patient information,\" Leopard said.</p><p>She's heard concerns, but they've focused less on intellectual property and more on patient privacy and data security.</p><p>\"Everybody is in favor of innovation and automation,\" Leopard said. \"How do we do it in a way that's as good stewards of patient information?\"</p><p>HHS did not respond to requests for comment before publication and has not announced when the new rules will be released, but Leopard said she's hearing rumblings that the move is \"right around the corner.\" When the announcement is made, she said, it will likely be 60 days before the rules go into effect, and some rules that would be more difficult to implement may come with their own timetables.</p><p>Until then, she's waiting to see how the flood of feedback shapes the new version of the rules.</p><p>\"It's hard to say whether it's good or bad until you see the final pudding,\" Leopard said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>MIKE VANDE VEN JR.

But EHR software may also pull in data collected by health-tracking applications and devices such as Fitbits. Sometimes, the information flows in the other direction, when patients give these outside entities permission to access parts of their medical recordsThe information stored in patients' health records is especially prized by data brokers and hackers; some consider having someone's health data to be more valuable than having the person's credit card information, according to a Reuters report[3].Companies that develop EHR software, such as Verona, WI-based Epic Systems, are now weighing the benefits of letting patients share their health data with outside applications against the potential consequences of it falling into the wrong hands.'We're adding features so that when patients pick an application and authorize it to access their data in the EHR, they're shown information about who made the application, and what it does,' said Sasha TerMaat, a director at Epic. </p><p>The company wants to present such information in a way that's 'easier to understand than the pages of legalese patients might see today, so that they're less likely to make a decision that they would later regret.'The stakes are high. Violations of HIPAA, a law that regulates the use, disclosure, and transmission of protected patient health information, can result in steep fines or even jail time.Leaders at Epic appear to be taking heed of a series of data privacy breaches outside the healthcare industry that have led to dire consequences for companies including Facebook (NASDAQ: FB[4]) and Equifax[5] (NYSE: EFX[6]). Facebook got into trouble because it had permitted outside application developers, including the U.K.-based firm Cambridge Analytica, to extract and store the personal profiles of millions of Facebook users without their knowledge.Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg testified before members of Congress[7] in April that Facebook would take steps to improve data privacy[8] for its users. Still, Cambridge Analytica's harvesting of Facebook data has unquestionably hurt the company's bottom line; on July 26, Facebook's market capitalization fell by $119 billion[9], which was reported to be the largest loss in stock market history.During a conference at the company's headquarters[10] this week, Epic's founder and CEO Judy Faulkner referenced Zuckerberg's congressional testimony as she emphasized the importance of protecting patient data to hospital executives in the audience.'If your patients permit a Cambridge Analytica lookalike to see their data and it includes family history and DNA, you may be up on the Senate floor too,' Faulkner said.Faulkner said Epic plans to develop tools so that when a 'third party' software application\u2014healthcare providers and EHR vendors being the other two parties\u2014asks a patient for permission to access her medical record, Epic can tell the patient what the application is likely to do with her information.The tools would 'ask

However, last year saw some progress for the banking community. The economic boom in the US continued; Brexit became more certain, and some trade wars settled down, with deals or tentative deals in place.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">US banks are ahead on multiple measures compared to their European counterparts. Aggressive policy interventions and forceful regulations helped propel US banks to health after the financial crisis. In the past year, favorable GDP growth, tax cuts and rising rates further bolstered the state of the industry.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">New competition is emerging for large banks, as fintechs and so-called Big Tech companies attract investment and clients, according to EY's Banking in the New Decade report. These companies benefit from not having legacy systems to update, allowing them more freedom to invest in the latest technology. The report says these competitors are driving banks to spend significantly on digital transformation.</p><p>Europe's banks, notes the report, are bolstered by higher capital ratios and a significant decline in nonperforming loans. On the other hand, trade tensions are crimping growth and the EU economy remains weak. Germany and the UK barely escaped recession. \"Monetary easing in the eurozone will continue to lower margins and hinder revenues,\" EY notes, \"while the potential for negative rates means deposit margins-a significant driver of industry revenues before the global financial crisis-are now a drag on the bottom lines of the banks.\"</p><p>2019 saw a decline in revenue for much of the developed economies, while some developing regions saw an uptick. Globally, revenue was down for the industry by 3.6% year-over-year to $76.8 billion in 2019, from $79.7 billion the year prior (which itself was a decline from 2017), according to Dealogic.</p><p>In North America, investment-banking revenue declined 4% in 2018-2019 to $42.7 billion; and in Europe, revenue was down a staggering 15% to $16.4 billion. Japan and Australasia also saw revenue declines of 13%, or $2.9 billion; and 11%, or $1.7 billion, respectively. The regions that saw growth this past year were Latin America, with a 16% year-over-year revenue increase of $1.6 billion; the Middle East, with a 27% revenue growth of $1.4 billion; North Asia, with a 2% growth of $8.4 billion; and Southeast Asia, with a 3% revenue growth of $1.1 billion.</p><p>The winners of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Global Finance</emphasis>'s Best Investment Banks 2020 awards are those institutions that stand out for their ability to maintain and even strengthen their market positions in volatile environments.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WORLD'S BEST INVESTMENT BANKS 2020</emphasis></h><table><tgroup cols=\"2\" xml:id=\"tgroup_1\"><colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col1\" colwidth=\"376\"/><colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col2\" colwidth=\"192\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\" nameend=\"col2\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GLOBAL WINNERS</emphasis></entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Best Investment Bank</emphasis></entry><entry colname=\"col2\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">J.P.

Morgan. The bank has held these spots several years in a row, not just for its size but also for its innovation and its reach across markets. According to Dealogic, revenue-banking share for J.P. Morgan in the Americas grew 11.5% to $4.5 billion from 8.7% the previous year. In J.P. Morgan's annual conference call to investors, the company stated that net income remained relatively flat, from $12 billion in 2018 to $12.3 billion in 2019; however, revenue grew from $36.4 billion in 2018 to $38.3 billion in 2019 (and grew 15% over the past five years).</p><p>According to Daniel Pinto, Co-COO and CEO of J.P. Morgan's Corporate and Investment Bank, \"Capital has gone up in the last five years, from $62 billion to $80 billion. Ninety percent of the increase is related to methodology changes and higher capitalization, with only 10% of it related to new business initiatives.\" He adds that \"an increase in expenses is fully explained by expenses related to the increase in revenue. We invested in that period of time, in technology and talent.\" In the past year, J.P. Morgan reported an expense increase from $20.7 billion to $21.1 billion.</p><p>Global investment banking for J.P. Morgan has grown market share for four consecutive years, according to Dealogic; although the industry wallet has remained flat at $77 billion. Dealogic data show J.P. Morgan has seen M&amp;A growth of 9.2% since last year, to $26 billion, and is ranked number one in debt-capital management and equity-capital management, earning $37 billion and $15 billion, respectively, in those sectors. The bank has participated in all top five fee-paying deals in 2019 and seven of the top 10 fee deals. Notably, this past year, J.P. Morgan participated as lead adviser to Celgene in its sale to Bristol-Myers Squibb and acted as adviser to the world's largest oil producer, Saudi Aramco's, for its purchase of the chemical firm Saudi Basic Industries for $69 billion.</p><p>Revenue share for the Europe, Middle East and Africa region stood at 10.5%, also giving the bank the top spot among peers.</p><p>In the Asia-Pacific region, J.P. Morgan had a 6.6% revenue share, putting it at the number three spot according to Dealogic, but just 0.1% below first place.</p><p>In Western Europe, the continent's largest bank, HSBC, has been setting its sights on the years ahead. Changes were afoot as CEO John Flint stepped down after serving for about a year and a half in the role and Noel Quinn, the CEO of global commercial banking, stepped in as interim CEO.</p><p>The company stated in its annual report that adjusted revenue was \"up 5.9% to $55.4 billion and adjusted profit before tax up 5% to $22.2 billion, reflecting good revenue growth in retail banking and wealth management, global private banking ... together with improved cost control.\"</p><p>However, HSBC has also announced it will cut $4.5 billion in expenses to mitigate the impact of negative forces such as COVID-19 and Hong Kong's political strife. The bank further intends trim its operations in the West in favor of Asia's fast-growth developing markets-an effort that will include a reduction of 35,000 over the next three years. \"The Group's 2019 performance was resilient, however parts of our business are not delivering acceptable returns,\" Quinn said in a statement accompanying the annual report. \"We are therefore outlining a revised plan to increase returns for investors, create the capacity for future investment and build a platform for sustainable growth. We have already begun to implement this plan, which my management team and I are committed to executing at pace.\"</p><p>Many European banks have struggled somewhat in 2019, with some, such as UBS, Credit Suisse, ING, RBS and Barclays, either changing or looking to change top leadership. And as mentioned above, the sector saw an overall drop of 15% year-over-year. Some analysts believe that European banks are still reeling from the financial crisis of 2008 and that regulatory demands and capital requirements are hampering European banking results.</p><p>In Central and Eastern Europe, the regional win went to Poland's Bank Pekao, which in 2019 saw its revenue per corporate client grow by 24% over the last two years, according to bank CEO Marek Lusztyn on an investor conference call. Speaking with <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Global Finance</emphasis>, Lusztyn says the bank's success is \"a result of a unique combination of deep expertise, significant experience and strong team effort of our entire corporate banking franchise, delivering landmark transactions in 2019.\" He adds, \"We played advisory or financing roles in transactions of the largest Polish companies, including Europe's number one copper producer, KGHM; the biggest chain of convenience stores in Poland, Zabka; or the leading e-commerce platform in Poland, Allegro.\"</p><p>Latin America was one of the few markets that saw year-over-year growth, according to Dealogic. Investment banking saw growth of 16%, and equity capital markets grew a staggering 76% to $36.7 billion; but M&amp;A declined by 15%. Bradesco BBI, winner for top spot in Latin America, made its first international acquisition to buy BAC Florida Bank for $500 million. It is a small acquisition in terms of assets, but it puts Bradesco on the international map and gives the company's local clients access to international markets.</p><p>In a conference call announcing its Q4 results, Leandro de Miranda Ara\u00fajo, the bank's executive deputy officer and investor-relations officer, said, \"Our net profit reached an all-time high of BRL25 billion [about $6.2 billion at year's end], a growth of 20%, and with the very good news of our operating profit growing 11.5% itself. We have kept the [return on average equity] over 20%, as you have been seeing all over the year. So it reached 20.6% and our [return on average assets was] at 1.8%.\" He added, \"Credit portfolio presented a robust growth of 13.8% [and] 4.6% in the last quarter.\"</p><p>In the Asia-Pacific region, growth in the investment banking sector was scattered, according to Dealogic. Southeast Asia saw growth of 3%, North Asia saw growth of 2%, Japan had a decline of 14% and Australasia also had a decline of 11%.</p><p>The top investment bank award for the region went to DBS. DBS Group reported that fourth quarter net profit was up 14% from a year ago, to $1.51 billion. This was just above the $1.48 billion average estimate from five analysts, according to Refinitiv.</p><p>Tan Su Shan, group head of institutional banking at DBS, says, \"Our institutional banking sector coverage teams have been reorganized to offer a sharper focus on industry verticals. We seek to deliver industry sector insights that guide our clients' strategic direction, alert them to opportunities for debt and equity fund-raising and connect them across borders with strategic investors and business partners (many of whom are also clients of DBS in different geographic markets). We have also implemented digital tools for trade, working capital and cash management that are intuitive and easy to use and enhance our clients' ability to manage their operations.\"</p><p>Investment banking for Standard Bank, the award winner for top investment bank in Africa, was strong this past year. According to its Analysis of Financial Results for 2019, Investment banking earnings \"grew 12% to R3.9 billion [about $276 million at year's end]. The business saw strong average balance sheet growth across both local and foreign currency loans. Strong competition for South African investment grade debt and higher cash reserving requirements in Nigeria negatively impacted margins. Balance sheet growth outweighed margin squeeze to deliver robust [net interest income] growth of 8%.\"</p><p>In the Middle East, which had strong growth over the past year, Egypt-based EFGHermes took honors for top investment bank in the region. The bank closed 22 transactions, valued at $33.4 billion, of which nine deals were in the equity capital markets area, seven were in the debt capital markets area and six were M&amp;A deals. The bank also executed deals on three different exchanges: the London Stock Exchange, the Tadawul (Saudi) Exchange and the Egyptian Exchange (EGX). EFGHermes also played a role in the above-mentioned IPO for Saudi Aramco.</p><p>Going forward, world economic results are already being tempered and hedged against what could be a severe downturn from the outbreak of COVID-19. Interest rates have come down and the global supply chain is being tested. Investment banks will surely have to weather the storm in 2020 and adjust strategies accordingly. The first half of the year will tell how much effect these events are having and how hard the investment banking sector may be hit as a result.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Picture 1, no caption</p></caption></nitf:media><nitf:media><caption><p>Picture 2, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tan, DBS</emphasis>: We seek to guide our clients' strategic direction, alert them to opportunities for debt and equity fund raising and connect them across borders.</p></caption></nitf:media><nitf:media><caption><p>Picture 3, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">View of a J.P.

NPR wants to know what you think about NPR. Go to nprlistens.org and tell us. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I've always had this question. I've always wondered just how much information about me someone could find out by sitting back and watching my internet traffic online. I'm not talking about someone hacking into my computer or stealing my electronic address book or breaking into my files at work. Really, I've always just wondered how much information about me slides by on the internet, unprotected, unencrypted, for anyone out there to read. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">So a couple of months ago, I asked these two computer experts to spy on me. For an entire week, they were going to watch all of my internet traffic - everything coming into and out of my home office, from my laptop, from my mobile phone. And this guy came to my house, and he actually attached this little box to my internet connection. We plugged it in, and we turned it on. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Yeah. </p><p>OK, so now I'm going to turn on the Wi-Fi. </p><p>Literally, like, a half-second after we started, these guys had collected an amazing amount of information about me. Dave Porcello was part of the team, and he was sitting in his office in Vermont, all the way across the country. And you're going to hear him on a speaker phone, but he was watching as we connected to the net and my iPhone, my little phone, started reaching out to these services all over the world. </p><p>Yahoo, NPR. </p><p>My phone sent Yahoo my location data, totally unprotected in the clear. Then it connected to NPR for my email. Then it pinged Apple, then Google. </p><p>You're not, like, opening apps or anything, right? </p><p>No, it's - my phone is sitting on my desk with... </p><p>I had not touched my iPhone. I didn't search for anything. It was just sitting there all by itself, sending out a cascade of information. </p><p>It's just thousands and thousands of pages of stuff. </p><p>It's easy to think that all of this stuff is anonymous, that no one cares or could tell anything from the data my weather app is giving up or the name of my iPhone. But each little, tiny bit is a clue, and these guys - these computer experts - started to put all these little clues together. Oliver Weis, part of this ad-hoc surveillance team, says when you combine it all, it becomes kind of a digital fingerprint. And my phone spilled this out onto the internet within seconds of connecting. </p><p>A lot of times, it's pretty easy to identify not only the type of device, but the person. You know, how many people's iPhones are named, you know, Steve's iPhone? </p><p>Right. </p><p>Or, you know... </p><p>I mean, when you were talking about that, I was thinking, OK, so it sends out the name of my iPhone - Steve's iPhone. It sends out a ping to NPR Mail, so now you're limited to Steves who work at NPR. And then... </p><p>Right. </p><p>And then it hits my weather app, and it's saying I'm in Menlo Park, Calif., and it's like - all right. </p><p>Exactly. </p><p>We know exactly who you are. You are not Steve Inskeep. You are Steve Henn. </p><p>(Laughter) Right. Exactly. Yeah, it's pretty wild. </p><p>Hello, and welcome to PLANET MONEY. As my iPhone already told you, I'm Steve Henn. And on our show today, we have the story of what happened when I let these guys follow me all over the internet. You know, these days it seems like your smartphone can do anything. It tracks airplanes through the sky above your head. It can give you turn-by-turn directions in Bangkok. It even makes phone calls. But why can't your smartphone keep your secrets? </p><p>                (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"HEARD IT THROUGH THE GRAPEVINE\")        </p><p>(Singing) Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm (ph). </p><p>Now, I should say that it actually does take a little bit of effort now to track someone's internet trail. Most big tech companies have started scrambling personal information they send back and forth. Google does it. Yahoo does it. It's called encryption. So I enlisted this entire team to search for stuff that these companies had missed - stuff that isn't encrypted, that anyone could read. </p><p>I worked with this guy Sean Gallagher from the tech website Ars Technica. And then there were the computer guys in Vermont, Dave and Oliver, who you already met. They founded a company called Pwnie Express, which consults on corporate security. And they were recording everything on my internet connection - everything going in and out - while I just went about my job as a reporter, googling, making calls, more googling. And most of it was really dull. I'm sure it was - a lot of meaningless numbers. And they couldn't see things that had basic security measures. They couldn't get into my bank account or my NPR email. And frankly, I did my best to be boring pretty much all the time. </p><p>But then one day about a week in - it's, like, 6:00 in the morning. I'm making coffee, looking at my email, and something has gotten these guys really, really excited. They're shooting emails back and forth, CC-ing me. You know, and the subject lines are like, holy crap, did you see that? And I'm thinking to myself, what did I just let them see? What did I do? So I called them. Turns out, Dave and Sean had just snatched a copy of a raw interview that I did for a story, a story for NPR that hadn't even aired yet. </p><p>OK, so this is the audio file that we captured out of your internet stream when you were downloading it from the NPR FTP server. </p><p>(Laughter) Oh. </p><p>I can replay it if you need me to. </p><p>                (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)        </p><p>OK. OK. Awesome. Yep. Yep. OK. I'm passing the phone to you. </p><p>Holy cow. </p><p>                (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)        </p><p>Hello, this is Scott Bell (ph). </p><p>So this is a guy I interviewed in a field in Iowa. </p><p>Right. </p><p>I had a producer, actually, who had recorded that interview in Iowa. And then she had sent me the audio over the internet. Sean, Dave and Oliver had snatched it, and they were able to listen to every second. They had been waiting for big files like this - audio, video, pictures - and I unknowingly gave it up to them. Now, so one isolated interview - what could anybody do with that, right? Turns out, that wasn't the only thing I was giving away. </p><p>This was for your - that story you were doing on clean data centers. </p><p>(Laughter) Yeah. </p><p>They knew exactly what my story was about - clean data centers - before it aired, something only me and my editor knew. In fact, these guys actually knew more than my editor did. And how they figured it out tells you something about how anyone's trail can be pieced together online. They had this software that was specifically looking for telephone numbers on web pages I visited. Sean gave me a couple of numbers he had captured. I called them. </p><p>Let's see. I'm calling. I'm going to put it on speakerphone. </p><p>                (SOUNDBITE OF PHONE RINGING)        </p><p>Thank you for calling DuPont Fabros. Press zero at any time to reach the receptionist. </p><p>Did you hear that? </p><p>Yes, I did. </p><p>That's the number of one of my sources for that story (laughter). </p><p>Yes. </p><p>(Laughter) Hold on. Hold on just a second. </p><p>OK. </p><p>Let's call the second number. </p><p>                (SOUNDBITE OF PHONE RINGING)        </p><p>It was another person I'd reached out to and interviewed for this story on data centers. </p><p>(Laughter). </p><p>So, yeah, those are - those are - like, if you go back to that story, those are two interviews - right? - the guy you ended up recording, and DuPont Fabros gave me a tour of their big data center in Santa Clara. And you had Greenpeace. And you had Facebook. You had all my sources for that story. </p><p>They had tracked who I was reaching out to. They had an interview. They'd even managed to piece together my thoughts during that entire week. They had reconstructed my google searches. I had typed, who coined cloud computing? I'd searched for Facebook's data center in Sweden and looked up maps of where I wanted to send that producer. </p><p>I had all your sources. I could have written that story for you. </p><p>                (LAUGHTER)        </p><p>You know, that would have been nice. That would have saved me some time. </p><p>I should say here that the story I was working on wasn't a terribly secret one. It didn't have any unnamed sources or confidential information. But this process scared the hell out of me. I mean, Skype leaked my personal contact book. </p><p>Wow, that's like a sourcebook. </p><p>Yep. </p><p>Yeah, I'd appreciate it if you didn't make that public. </p><p>                (LAUGHTER)        </p><p>It turns out it was just my personal Skype account, so Sean got the contact information for my mom and my sister. But it was startling. Yahoo was leaking my location data. Google was giving up maps. Microsoft showed my full name and a picture. Whatsapp revealed my telephone number. And The New York Times, The Times - that site is unencrypted, so these guys could see what I was reading, including an article about personal bankruptcy. It was awkward. </p><p>And going in, I knew that my email and my phone calls were encrypted and walled off. Most people surfing the web researching medical issues or looking for divorce attorneys probably don't take these kinds of precautions. But I had asked for this. I had invited this team of guys into my house and asked them to bug my office. I had made it easy. But you don't have to go to these kinds of extremes for this to happen to you. A stranger could reconstruct your life this way. This is real. </p><p>It could be anyone with access to your internet connection. It could be the IT guys at work or your roommates or the guy who runs that coffee shop Wi-Fi. And it turns out that that device in your pocket, your beloved smartphone, chances are good that it is constantly relentlessly looking to betray you. It's set up to be on the hunt for open internet connections. And it's not exactly careful about who it hooks up with. </p><p>Pretty much. Basically - yeah. So when you have wireless turned on, your phone or your laptop is sending out what are called probe requests out to the world, saying, hey, where's my network? Hey, where's my network? Is this network around? Where's this network? </p><p>Every AT&amp;T phone is preprogrammed when you buy it, right out of the box, to connect to any network named AT&amp;T Wi-Fi. And even though they call these things smartphones, your phone can't tell if that network is really run by AT&amp;T or if it was set up by hackers. If the network is called AT&amp;T Wi-Fi, that's good enough for your phone. That's it. </p><p>And hackers have actually built evil networks that just sit there, listening for your phone to ask, is this my network? Is this my network? And they wait. And they listen. And then they answer, yes. Yes, it is. And hackers actually don't even need to be that clever. You yourself, you could go to the local mall and set up a Wi-Fi router and name it AT&amp;T Wi-Fi, and hundreds, maybe even thousands, of phones would start connecting to it. </p><p>At that point, it's in the middle. And it can basically intercept all traffic going through it. </p><p>So at that point, this has recreated what we did by actually plugging something physically into my office wall. </p><p>Exactly. </p><p>And then whoever runs that evil Wi-Fi network is in the position to capture your traffic. It can see everything. Well, at least, everything that's not encrypted. And so you have to wonder, why don't all companies encrypt your data? Why don't phone manufacturers and internet providers do more to keep all of our information safe? </p><p>You know, this isn't a hard computer-science problem. It's just math. And math is easy for these machines. Math is what they do. And encryption works really well if it's used correctly. But for years, big tech companies didn't bother to do this, at least not in a way that made it easy for average people to protect themselves. </p><p>And in the past, when I asked companies why, they'd say things like, it's expensive or it's a hassle, it slows my apps down. But, honestly, the real reason is they didn't see any evidence that their customers actually cared. You know, the graveyard of failed Silicon Valley startups is littered with companies that promised greater privacy protections. </p><p>And some of the industry's biggest successes, Facebook and Google, they were built on collecting information about you. Keeping personal information safe and private was never a top priority here. But then last year, something changed. </p><p>                (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)        </p><p>He is routinely called the most wanted man in the world. </p><p>                (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)        </p><p>Mr. Snowden, whom I regard as an American hero and a very great patriot... </p><p>                (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)        </p><p>The bottom line is this is a man who has betrayed his country... </p><p>                (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)        </p><p>My name's Ed Snowden. I'm 29 years old. </p><p>Ed Snowden and the documents he leaked painted this vivid, if kind of fragmented, picture of how the U.S. National Security Agency monitors internet traffic from all over the world. And it turns out they are really good at it. People globally freaked. Cisco saw sales drop overseas. Facebook and Google are now facing new regulations in South America and Europe about how they treat and protect customer data. And executives at these companies suddenly had a powerful new incentive. Nate Cardozo at the Electronic Frontier Foundation says Snowden changed everything. </p><p>Now more and more companies are not just encrypting data on the disk, not just encrypting data between you the end user and their server, but between their own servers. And this is because of a threat introduced honestly by our own government. </p><p>In the past year, Yahoo, Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Twitter and Apple all announced they're beefing up encryption on their networks. And during the week that Sean, Dave and Oliver were tracking me, and for more than a month after they finished, we tested all of these companies and their services. None of them were perfect. When I searched Google for Grundy County, Iowa, the guys tracking me could actually see the map Google sent me in response. </p><p>But here's the thing - when we called Google to let them know this had happened, they fixed it. The press guy called me back and said, yeah, that's a bug. And now when you search for a location, that map you get back will be private. It's encrypted now anywhere, any search anywhere in the world. That's millions and millions of searches. We called Yahoo, too. They're working now with Apple to fix that weather app that was leaking my location data so it won't broadcast that stuff anymore. We called Skype and they said we got it, problem solved. In the end, we called more than a dozen tech companies and no one blew us off. Even NPR - we fixed our bug, too. </p><p>If you want to reach us, you can email us at <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:planetmoney@npr.org\">planetmoney@npr.org</email>, or you can hit me at @HennsEggs on Twitter. Or if you're looking for an encrypted option, you can reach out on Wickr, a secure chat service. I'm at H-E-N-N-S-3-G-G-S, kind of like @HennsEggs but geekier. </p><p>I'd also like to say a huge thank you to Dave Porcello at Pwnie Express. Without him and his team, this wouldn't have been possible. Also Sean Gallagher at Ars Technica and my editor for the radio version of these stories, Bruce Auster. </p><p>                (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"HEARD IT THROUGH THE GRAPEVINE\")        </p><p>(Singing) I bet you wondered how I knew about your plans to make me blue with some other guy... </p><p>And if you were looking for one other way to get in touch with us, go to nprlistens.org and tell us what you think. The producers for today's show were Thea Bennen (ph) and Viet Le (ph). I'm Steve Henn. Thanks for listening. </p><p>                (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"HEARD IT THROUGH THE GRAPEVINE\")        </p><p>(Singing) Oh, I heard through the grapevine not much longer would you be mine. Oh, I heard through the grapevine, oh, I'm just about to lose my mind. Honey, honey, I heard it through the grapevine. How much longer would you be my baby? </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NPRPLM-201406202301</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NPRPLM2014</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5N89-SXB1-DXSR-918H-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438615</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-12-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2627\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2014 National Public Radio (R) All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>NPR Planet Money</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"06\" year=\"2014\"><dateText>June 20, 2014 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

Actually, most of it is still uncharted territory. Along the way, visionaries, builders and enablerslead the change in the finance and banking industry. We wanted to sit down and talk with them so we launched a podcast \u2014 Connect. </p><p>For our very first episode, we had a conversation with EQ Bank's CEO, Andrew Moor. He shared his vision of what customer-centric open banking could shape up to be \u2014 and it has something in common with Spring cleaning. No time? No worries! Read our 5 key takeaways from the conversation Banks need to embrace the idea ofcollaboration withthird parties\u2014real, willful collaborationOpen banking is not just about new technologies, it's also how different business models adapt or react to these new technologies. One of Andrew's goals is to translate EQ Bank's customer-centric approach of making people's lives better in a world where data is easily and securely shared between financial institutions and fintechs. By collaborating with third-party providers, they can focus on a selection of high-quality products, while still allowing their customers to access a wide range of financial services.Today, security is not an acceptable excuse to oppose open bankingA customer-centric mindset means recognizing that financial data belongs to consumers, and enabling them to make it work to their own benefit. Data security is a real concern, but bankers shouldn't use this as an excuse to avoid making it convenient for their customers to deal with more than one financial institution.User experience: Big Tech have something to teach FIsGreat user experience, covering everything from onboarding to troubleshooting problems, will be a key tosucceedas consumers start to shop around. According to Andrew, Canadian financial institutions can learn from companies like Uber and Amazon that really work to understand their customers' need.A desirable future is one where customers have a one-stop shopSimplicity and convenience are concepts that get thrown around when experts talk about open banking. Andrew would like to see open banking move beyond data sharing, to really enable customers to manage all their financial affairs from a single spot and get personalized hints about financial products tailored to their needs.More free time thanks to more automationCoupled with open banking, automation will become a great tool for consumers to manage some of their financial affairs. It'll free up time and resources so they can do what they really like. For instance, they should be able to set up their accounts so if money builds up in a checking account it's automatically transferred to a savings account, or they should get the best mortgage provider for them without having to file multiple applications. Below is an edited transcript of our conversation.Not your typical bankAdam:Today is a discussion with Andrew Moor. He's the CEO of EQ bank, which is a Canadian challenger bank. What we were hoping to get out of today is to learn a little bit about you, learn about your view of building a challenger financial institution within Canada. And specifically, tackling the idea of open banking which is something that we at Flinks arereally passionate about[1]. And I know you guys have beenpretty vocal as well[2]. One of the things that I thought might be interesting to kick it off is just if you can tell us about EQ and where you guys fit within the system. Andrew:Equitable Bank orEQ Bank[3]is a direct-to-consumer brand. It is actually Canada's 9th largest bank. Not many people know that. We're obviously much smaller than the large big six financial institutions. Nonetheless, we have about 25 billion in assets and we're listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange. We're a small company but we have some significant resources to be able to providea competitiveattention and great solutions to Canadian customers. Our mission very much as a challenger bank is to find ways that we can enrich our customers' lives and make things better for them. And, you know, we think we're on that journey in a few areas, for sure. Adam:What do you think has been key to letting you guys grow throughout the years? Andrew:We've always had 'service' as a mantra. So, even if you just look at our annual reports from 10 years ago, you'll see that we were always very keen on service. Ten years ago, a lot of that was driven by people responding to the phone calls quickly. But technology is really changing the world in that regard. We continue to want to have people that respond very quickly to customer requests but really link that up with some great technology, to make people's lives easier, and reduce the friction that's inherent in the banking system. Adam:And is that something that comes through when you're looking at finding people to actually build out your business? Andrew:Yeah, one of the things we're looking for is people who actually care about service. When you leave the bank at the end the day you want to feelthat you made your customers lives betterwith the service you're providing. There's an inherent reward in doing that. And if you can make money while you're doing it, that's just great. But unless you're actually making people's lives better, you know, why bother showing up for work? Adam:That's an interesting role of actually focusingon making people's lives better. What are some concrete examples of how you think EQ helps improve the lives of your customers? Andrew:Well, I think EQ Savings Plus Account is innovative in the Canadian market. Essentially we're seeing it as a hub account. You don't really have to worry about your money. It's always going to get a great interest rate. All of our customers whether you've got $1 in there or $100,000 gets 2.3%. If you joined as a new customer yesterday, or whether you've been with us for a couple of years, you'll get the same rate. And then we try to link that up in ways that make it easy to move your money to other institutions or where you actually want to spend it. You think about the core purpose of banking it really is to hold that money safely, move it easily when you want it, and provide an interest rate on it. If you reduce banking down to its core values, those are the three things we try to focus on. And the Savings Plus Account brings that forward in a way that is unique in the ecosystem today. 'We're realistic that we can only be really great at a few products. You don't go into a department store to buy great coffee, you go to a specialty coffee roaster. And I think that's the way that financial services need to evolve.' Adam:One of the people that I really look up to is Peter Thiel. He's one of the founders of PayPal, a legendary tech investor, the first guy into Facebook. He's got a great question that he asks people to find their contrarian point of view \u2014 what that person believes as a really core fundamental truth that's differentthanhow other people view it. In the EQ Bank context, what do you guys believe is a real core truth about how consumers deal with money or how that relationship should be with their banks, that's different than how other institutions see it? Andrew:We're realistic that we can only be really great at a few products. And we think that consumers should actually shop for banking services and start to segment it much as they do with their retailer. You don't go into a department store to buy great coffee, you go to a specialty coffee roaster. And I think that's the way that financial services need to evolve. And you see lots of the innovation that's really providing value in life like ETFs were not pioneered by the big financial conglomerates. They get pioneered by smaller outfits and then adopted when it's clear that the value is there. Same with therobo-advisors \u2014 we are very close with the folks atWealthsimple[4]. To me, that seems like a great solution for people trying to invest in the equity markets for the first time. These innovations are not things you'd likely to get offered if you just walk into a bank branch and describe your needs. I think that is distinctive from at least the big six banks in Canada would claim they can offer you every financial service need from the time you first got out of school to the time that you die. Adam:When you look beyond the financial sector, is there any companies that you think are doing a really, really good job of delivering value to consumers in a different way? Andrew:Uber's obviously the classic example. I've now got a record of where I went and where I'm going to and then when I expense that, nobody can dispute that it was on business. There was a book on digital banking that I wanted to order from Amazon, it arrived on my desk the following morning. At most five guys in the entire country wanna read this book and yet I was able to get it within 24 hours. Compared to the old days going into a bookstore and trying to find that book and it's not even there, I mean, clearly, this technology is just changing the world for all of us. Adam:How do you think either the established big five banks or a challenger bank like EQ should actually take that back into how they manage their core business? Andrew:Well, far for me to advise anybody running a big five bank how to run the bank, I wouldn't have that arrogance. The way we approach it is to really think about what our customers need, put ourselves inour customer shoes, and try to understand how we can add value to their lives. Just coming in every day with that mindset, 'what's easier for the consumers?' For example, we don't know the gender of our customers. And the reason why we don't know the gender of our customersis that we actually don't need it as part of an onboarding process, right? And so just to make that one click, to make that onboarding that much easier rather looking for information from you so that we can then market other things to you. It's trying to make it easy as possible from the customers perspective. 'Our general thesis is everything should be so self-evident that you don't actually have to need to call us.' Andrew:Well, there are lots of ways. With the call centers, interviewing customers, things like ratings on the App Store. It is interesting, though, in our traditional business where we're dealing with mortgage brokers, it's much easier to go and talk to them. You're in a B2B, in constant relationship with them. When you're dealing with consumers, you're dealing with, you know, many thousands of consumers, dealing with your app, interfacing with you, it's very clear that you could be missing something about their real experience compared to what we think we're trying to deliver. So, I can't say that we necessarily solved for that yet, but we're working on it. Adam:Interesting. How do you get feedback from your customers on their product or something else? Andrew:Our general thesis is everything should be so self-evident that you don't actually have to need to call us \u2014 ie, the use cases should be easy enough that it's self-evident from the app. But we do also get good feedback when people do come in either by chat or telephone into the call center. And our general view about that as well is unlike other banks: we try to really solve the problem so we don't measure how long the phone call is. What we're really interested in is this: did we actually solve the issue and satisfy the customer when they get off the phone? It's a slightly different way of thinking about call centers. We try to pick up the phone within a few rings. Sometimes I call my credit card company at 10:00 at night, and strangely, there's a surge in demand for credit card calls at 10. It just seems impossible to me \u2014 they've basically understaffed that call center. We certainly try to turn the world a bit on its head that way. It shouldn't take 15 minutes to get hold of the credit card company. Adam:Yeah. Wouldn't that be nice?The future of banking is openAdam:The big hairy topic that I wanted to jump into is this idea of open banking, which is something that we as a company care really deeply about. And a lot of people talk about it. But what I think might be interesting is just to set the stage. How would you explain to a typical EQ Bank customer, like a regular person, what is open banking and why it actually matters to them? Andrew:Well, open banking can have many variations but in the simplest form, you're gonna be able to see all your financial affairs in one spot. I think most of us could relate to the fact that today if you had an account at one bank and another account, you'd have to open up both those things, jot down on a piece of paper what the balance is where and try figure that out. In the future, in an open banking environment, you should be able to see all of your statements in one place. So, how much you owe on your credit cards, how much cash you've got in the various banks, what your mortgage balance is. So, you can actually think about your entire financial life even if you've got different providers. Now,a seconditeration of open banking could be that you actually can move money between banks from one singlelog onspot. You come into one bank or to another financial services provider and move money between, let's say the Royal Bank and EQ Bank from that application. That's an interesting evolution about how you could think about being able to manage financial affairs for the best benefit for you. Adam:One of the things that I've heard you say a couple of times before in some interviews is that EQ Back is really well positioned in a world for open banking. What does it mean for a bank, in general, to be well positioned in an open banking world? Andrew:Well, one of the key building pieces of open banking is to have APIs that can talk to other institutions and other service providers. The way we think about that is that our core banking system has a layer on top of it so we can easily build APIs to the outside world. That's a fundamental building block of open banking. Also, all of our technology all sit in the cloud, so it's easily scalable as well as we go forward. I think that's gonna be differentthansome of the larger institutions that still have stuff sitting on mainframes that they've got to pull up and extract data out of. So, it's more a question of IT architecture more than anything else. It gets a bit nerdy to talk about it. But we should be in a place where we can build APIs more quickly and cheaper than other people. Adam:What do you think is the blocker to get you from where we are today and that vision of where you guys wanna get in the future? Is it a technological challenge, a regulatory challenge, a consumer adoption challenge? Andrew:Well, I think it's all of the above. There are serious potential issues about cybersecurity and instability of the financial system. This will have a lot of push from the regulators. The other thing about Canada is that we have a very concentrated banking system. Not everybody has the same interest in opening up the customer data to other third-party providers. And then we need an entrepreneurial ecosystem that supports that. Companies like Flinks that can support the open banking agenda are gonna be important parts of thinking about the possibilities that emerge. The great thing about open banking is you can't even think what that future looks like. Ten years from now it could be completely different than what we have envisioned but it's a catalyst to all kinds of other interesting services for other people. 'We need an entrepreneurial ecosystem that supports that. Companies like Flinks that can support the open banking agenda are gonna be important parts of thinking about the possibilities that emerge.' Adam:You said the open banking agenda. Whose agenda is it? Andrew:Well, it's certainly the government's agenda. Bill Morneau, the Minister of Finance, actually raised it at the budget of February of this year. An expert panel has been appointed and the Ministry of Finance put out a paper on it. So it's in the center of that agenda. I think it should be in the middle of any agenda of anybody that is pro-consumer, frankly. The consumer lobbies should be thinking about this. There are lots of other examples around the world, and Canada is actually a little bit behind compared to Europe and Australia. It's a global force, it's happening in any event to some degree. But to formalize that at a government level and create appropriate regulation is gonna be critical to success in Canada going forward. Adam:Are there any financial institutions that you look to in those more mature markets, as it relates to open banking, that you think have started to tackle this really, really well? Andrew:Certainly people that seem to have the right ideas, that excite me around having the right ideas, there's Sterling Bank in the UK would be one that's almost built itself as a technology shop that has to do a bit banking on the side. They really seem to be good at building those apps and for the onboarding process. The UK is a very interesting example, many banks right now are trying to do different things. Like what I see with Loot, for example. It's not actually necessarily a great example of open banking, but it's how an ecosystem can become more vibrant. This is a bank that focuses on students and it's an interesting niche play. Adam:And is that how you'd imagine the Canadian market to adopt open bank accounts, with more of these niche providers that are really focused on one or two products? Andrew:Well, certainly there's gonna be a place for them and there's gonna be a place for other moregenerally. The idea that you have all your financial products with one bank, which many people still do, will certainly start to break down. You start to think of one of the big sixbeingexcellent for, let's say international remittances. One might be, great for good high-value savings accounts. You might get another one for your credit card because it's got better loyalty points associated with it. We've seen some of that over the last few years but it's still actually pretty inconvenient to deal with more than one financial institution. Most banks are really trying to put their arms around you and answer all of your need. I think we'll see that start to become less effective as consumers start making their own selections.If you love your customers, set them freeAdam:Do you think this is something that consumers need to take more of an active approach into either advocating for something like this or becoming aware that it's available? Andrew:I think consumers will change as it becomes easier. I mean, it's for consumers to live their own life. As for us as the company is trying to provide services to consumers to wave the flag and explain why our products and our approach is better than perhaps what they're getting today. But I don't think there'smuch obligationon the consumer. Different people have different needs and I think most people don't want to spend too much time banking frankly. I think it'll be one of those things like Spring cleaning: you do it infrequently. But you can set it up and your financial affairs will be fairly well sorted. Things like if too much money built up in a checking account, it would automatically move to a savings account; making sure you're paying off credit cards on time so you're not paying interest; making sure your mortgage rates are at an appropriate rate. You know, these are boring things to manage. Adam:But they're critical, right? It's stuff that compounds that actually creates wealth. Andrew:A sensible person just managing their affairs and their own course should be able to do that without really having to disrupt their whole lives. I think open banking is gonna help that. You should have some reasonably trusted shopping services helping you make sure that you're selecting the right products and managing your financial life in the right way. Adam:Outside of managing your financial life, what about actually being able to manage your data about your financial life? This is something you're seeing coming under fire in the States, especially with the data that advertisers or big tech companies have about consumers. And there's a push for consumers to build take back control over that data. You've been quoted a couple of times saying that you believe that consumers own their own data in the financial world. How do you imagine a system where consumers can actually manage who has access to that data in the future? Andrew:It's gonna be a critical part of the open banking agenda. I think you do start with that fundamental principle, as you first laid out there. It's your data. I mean, you did the transactions, it'syour storyof your financial life that belongs to you. And you should be able to share it with people that you want to share it with, you should have access to it. And, frankly, the big tech companies, we're gonna see a fair bit of pushback over the next four or five years about how they've actually abused customer data. I think we will be less comfortable with the way it's been over the last two or three years where it's been a bit of the Wild West and then data is being used in ways that we probably are feeling uncomfortable about and there's no governance around that. So we'll see a bit of pushback against those guys. Meanwhile, I think as bankers we tend to be highly secretive around data. So, part of it's coming from a really good place to try to keep people's data really secure. And really, it's our customers' data. And we need to allow them to use it in ways that make sense for them. 'It's gotta be something I can do in five minutes, and know that if I do it once a month I'm managing things fairly. That's what I would be trying to achieve with an open banking environment. And then I can do something more interesting, like go ride my bike.' Andrew:There are all sorts of insights they have about the customers they should be able to wow them with. There are all kinds of things going on where I would like hints from my financial institution about things going on inmy financiallife that I don't get. Partly that could be because I'm dealing with other FIs that they seem completely oblivious to. So, occasionally I'll get an inbound call offering me some kind of product that is actually completely inappropriate for me because they don't understand some other facet of my financial life with another FI. So, you know, hopefully, they can provide a consolidated view of that. You've applied some intelligence to people in a much as when I go to Amazon and I buy a book about something, that it'll recommend something that's related to that. Adam:How would you imagine a very, very large financial institution, let's take the big five, where do you see the value to them in an open banking world? You know: 'people like you that have this kind of financial profile, find products like this useful', and a curated offer that actually might get me thinking about some of those things in a useful way. So, I think there are lots of opportunities for the big banks to actually have a better understanding of the customers and then be more relevant and more helpful to them. You have to start with a mindset of trying to help the customers, and then think about making sure you're not pre-assuming certain things about their needs in a very complicated world. Adam:Anytime you solve a very complicated problem, you need to start with a first step. What do you think is the baby step into embracing that kind of mindset shift? Andrew:The first thing is to allow people to be able to consolidate all their financial data in one spot. So, data aggregation, it's probably become something of a commodity. Once you've got data aggregation in place, so then you can actually start to try and provide insights and you'll learn whether the insights are relevant or not, depending on how people react to those insights. You'll learn by communicating with the people that created the data. I think open banking has to go way beyond aggregation. It's got to get to the point where we can actually trigger payments from a central spot. From my perspective, I'd much rather go into a single place, see all of my financial affairs, get hints about where how I could optimize the outcomes for me and then move money into the right spot. And I wouldn't have to go into other serviceproviders,and have toremember all sorts of passwords to move money. It's gotta be something I can do in five minutes, and know that if I do it once a month I'm managing things fairly well. That's what I would be trying to achieve with an open banking environment. And then I can do something more interesting, like go ride my bike. Adam:I think that's an amazing note to leave it off on. Andrew, thank you so much. Really appreciate the time. Andrew:Great, thank you.

I'm delighted to welcome Equifax. Mark Begor, Chief Executive Officer; John Gamble, Chief Financial Officer. Thanks so much for being here today. We appreciate it.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Questions and Answers</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">DAVID MARK TOGUT: Just kicking off, on your fourth quarter earnings call, you discussed the detailed time line for Equifax 2020, where you're spending $1.25 billion to move legacy mainframe server technology to the public cloud, build APIs, close legacy data centers and a number of other modernization initiatives. If we fast forward to early 2021, how will Equifax's technology transformation and proprietary data sets differentiate you from the competition?</p><p>MARK W. BEGOR, CEO &amp; DIRECTOR, EQUIFAX INC.: Yes. As you know, that there was really 2 thrusts 2 years ago when we launched this technology transformation. One was to take security to industry leading capabilities. After the cyber incident, you want to make sure you don't have another one. And that's why we are investing so much in our security elements.</p><p>We also saw an opportunity to have great security. You want a great technology, and putting security around a legacy infrastructure is challenging. And then we quickly rolled into how important technology is to our business, having siloed data assets we're going to move to a single data fabric. Being in the cloud, where we can have always-on stability.</p><p>Increasingly, our customers operate online with their consumers. And if you're not -- if you're down, your customers down, and the consumer goes away. So the always-on capability that come from the cloud, we think, are very, very powerful.</p><p>The ability to move products to customers more quickly, we think, is very powerful. And moving products around the globe, when you have a single infrastructure, we think, is going to be long term very attractive to us. And we're convinced that it's going to really distinguish Equifax versus our competitors being cloud native, which is why we made this bet in this big investment 2 years ago.</p><p>And as you said, we're kind of 2/3 of the way through. We're going to complete a lot of the work in 2020. There'll be some tail that will go into 2021 around customer migrations in some of our international platforms. But we're really energized about the benefits that will come from our top line. We think it should increase our long-term top line growth rate from what it was pre this investment.</p><p>We haven't given a framework on that yet, but we will when we put our long-term framework back in place. We also think it's going to deliver some real margin and cost benefits. We've talked about a 15% to 20% benefit from our technology cost that sit inside of our cost of goods sold, which is quite sizable. That margin benefit, some will drop through. Some we'll use to invest in growth going forward.</p><p>And then last, we've talked about the 20% to 25% benefits of our capital expenditures, which is really capitalized software savings going forward, which we'll enhance both from our margin generation being higher and revenue growth being higher. And the combination of that with the cash savings from our lower CapEx spending, our cash generation is going to be higher. That will allow us to invest in M&amp;A and then also invest in buyback and dividends going forward.</p><p>So we think there'll be a real improvement as you get into '21 and '22 in both top line margins and then our cash generation.</p><p>DAVID MARK TOGUT: In the sort of the better cash generation, if we kind of fast forward to capital allocation, which I know you haven't specifically addressed.</p><p>MARK W. BEGOR: I'm going to try not to today also. But go ahead.</p><p>DAVID MARK TOGUT: So is that something that you will address?</p><p>MARK W. BEGOR: Definitely.</p><p>DAVID MARK TOGUT: Sometime later this year or?</p><p>MARK W. BEGOR: Yes.</p><p>DAVID MARK TOGUT: Okay.</p><p>MARK W. BEGOR: We've been trying to be very transparent about everything we're doing. And when I joined 2 years ago, John and I both looked at this, and we had pulled our long-term financial framework as everyone knows. We said there was really 3 things that we want to get clarity on. One was the legal settlements as a result of cyberincident. That's behind us, as you know. Second was USIS recovery. That was a business that was most impacted. Pre-breach was growing kind of 7%, 8%, went down to minus 2%. We've seen kind of sequential improvement. We'd like to see another quarter or 2 on that, but we've seen great progress in 2019. And as you know, the second half for USIS was up almost 2x the first half either with or without mortgage. Just ex mortgage, there was real improvements there.</p><p>And then the last one was around the tech transformation. It's a big project. It's not for the faint of heart. It's one I've done things like this before, John has, our tech leader and our business teams. And when you think about where we are in the tech transformation, there's a lot of data around or risk around will the technology work, meaning getting it into the cloud.</p><p>We're 2 years into that. So that's kind of checked off, meaning we've got exchanges in the cloud. Customers are accessing exchanges. We've got our new applications. They're cloud-based. Customers are migrating to those. And then the other element to that is, how long will it take you to migrate your customers, so you can turn off the old as you're going into the new. And we're getting more confidence around that.</p><p>So back to your question, it's our expectation, call it, the second half of this year, we'll have an Investor Day. We'll do -- roll out our long-term financial framework that we know investors want to see, and we're anxious to do that, too.</p><p>DAVID MARK TOGUT: Got it. You mentioned pushing products to customers a lot faster. Is there a way to quantify how much faster you could be doing this and maybe framing it in the context of your new product innovation strategy and what you're trying to achieve overall?</p><p>MARK W. BEGOR: I think as you know, you followed the industry for a long time. The fuel for growth in our industry from GDP versus the kind of high single-digit growth rate the industry grows and that we want to grow, and we historically did in our prior financial framework is new products. The business itself grows with GDP as far as credit pulls, and how do you go from 2% or 3% or 4% to 6%, 8%, 9%, 10% is really with new products. And one of the things that I did when I joined, and John supported that, is that we are doing this big tech transformation. We want to make sure we could protect the resources around new products.</p><p>And historically, we've been pretty visible with our investors about our new product introductions. And if you look at 2016, '17, '18, we were doing something like 70 to 75 products per year. Last year, we did 90 a little bit. I think we did 92 last year. So we've accelerated that. My expectation is as we go through '20 and to '21 and '22, that's going to ramp up even further. Part of it is going to be the ease of our ability to do it. Part of it is going to be quite deliberate, and I think about the next chapter of Equifax is really throwing the pedal to the metal around innovation and new products. It's really a really great capability.</p><p>The second part of your question was around can you articulate some of the speed? We're starting to roll out new products to customers that are cloud-based, native cloud-based. And we're doing things that we couldn't do before and doing things we don't think our competitors can do today, things like virtual streaming of data to our customers instantly as we have new data inquiries come in.</p><p>Historically, that was done in a batch basis every couple of hours. We didn't have the infrastructure to do it in streaming basis. We're delivering that to customers today. We just rolled out, and we're going -- what went live last week a new identity application with a big customer that we put in market in probably 90 days, which historically would have caught -- taken us 9 months to do, and it's going live.</p><p>So we really won the award and I think it was October and did all the development work collaborating with our customers. And that contract is kind of a $10 million to $15 million run rate contract, sizeable. And this is something that speed, which was important to them and for us, it was real value. We couldn't do it that fast before in the legacy environment.</p><p>And then the last one is the ability to move products globally. It's being a global business. You know we're in 24 markets, including the United States. Being able to take a product from Australia and move it to the U.K. in the old world was really hard. You have to recode it.</p><p>In tomorrow's world, it's not an app like your app phone, your iPhone, but it's in that direction, meaning we've already built it, you move it through the cloud. We've got a single instance, meaning we're not having 5 versions of the same thing in other parts of the world. And that's what drives your tech savings, that 15% to 20%. That's what drives your cash savings from CapEx of that 20% to 25%, is having that consistency in a new framework and one where you don't have multiple versions either in a market or around the globe.</p><p>JOHN W. GAMBLE, CORPORATE VP &amp; CFO, EQUIFAX INC.: We've also seen with some fintech customers that they're running in GCP, and we're running in GCP.</p><p>MARK W. BEGOR: Which makes it really easy.</p><p>JOHN W. GAMBLE: Our ability to integrate with them is much, much faster. We've now seen it now starting this quarter with Cambrian and Ignite, so our analytics platforms that customers can use, are running at GCP. So they're easier for them to access. And also we can spin up new environments in no time, right? Versus having to actually build environments and spin them up in the past. So we're just seeing acceleration in how fast we can deliver and how fast people can consume.</p><p>MARK W. BEGOR: Well, the spin up is another -- I'll do one more example if it's okay. The spin up, we have, in our old environment, situations where a customer wants us to do something unique on their whole credit file, which can be a massive project to like rescore credit file. And you have to have capacity in your mainframes to do that. So you keep a lot of idle capacity to do those unique batch projects in the cloud environment. You just do them and then pull it back down. So you've kind of paid by the drink.</p><p>So #1 is economics. #2 is the ability to do it, meaning you have unlimited capacity in the cloud environment, where we've had situations, in the short 2 years I've been at Equifax, where we've had to say, \"I can't do that for you now. I can do it in 2 months when I have a window of capacity in the legacy environment.\" And that's a reality of our environment and our competitors, too.</p><p>JOHN W. GAMBLE: And internally, there's been acceleration in development because we now have development teams, large teams that have delivered multiple products in a cloud-native way. So they now know how to develop in that way. And it's substantially different than working with other people's software, right? So it is a new skill that we hired to support before, and I think we're now growing very rapidly internally, which is accelerating the progress.</p><p>MARK W. BEGOR: We retooled our team. As you know, we brought in a new technology leader, and he is a cloud-based technology leader. He's got a dozen direct reports, 9 of them were changed out with cloud native kind of people. We've got 5,000 of our 11,000 people are in technology. In the last 2 years, we've changed out 1,500 of them from legacy coding kind of people to cloud people, which is a big transformation, but -- and that's going to continue as we go forward.</p><p>You have to have the -- it's a different skill set that we think is going to be quite transformational for Equifax going forward.</p><p>DAVID MARK TOGUT: You called out virtual streaming of data. What are the major new products we should be looking for in 2020? Are there products that you see as being totally game-changing for the industry? Or are they more incremental?</p><p>MARK W. BEGOR: It's going to be both. Game-changing is a big word. I would characterize as probably not much that's game-changing. Our view is the whole environment we have is going to be game-changing for Equifax, meaning being in a cloud environment, what it does to our top line, what it does to our margins and our cash generation. That's pretty game-changing.</p><p>When you get to specific products, it's hard to see one there. But like in the virtual streaming, the ability increasingly latency or how current information is, is more valuable when you're marketing to consumers or you're trying to engage with a consumer, and this is how our customers engaging with them. So having data that's an hour old or even minutes old versus a day old or 2 days old is a big deal and then getting it to them really quickly. And speed is very -- meaning latency, how fast you're delivering it, is quite unique.</p><p>The other one that we think is still kind of unchartered territory for us but we're really energized about is a single data fabric. And this is one that is really important. Today, we have in the United States, some really massive databases. And our databases are larger than our competitors. Everyone has the credit file. They're basically the same. Every American that is in the credit file. There's small differences.</p><p>We're the only ones that have the NCTUE cellphone utility database. That's 380 million Americans, massive scale. The TWN payroll records that we have that have 105 million actives every pay period. So our scale of data assets is massive. And what's different about how we're approaching those data assets is today, they're siloed and we have, in the United States, close to 50 of them. They're siloed.</p><p>So to find Mark Begor in each database, you have to key and link across each one. There's latency with that. There's -- and it's not 100%, meaning you don't find me in everyone. I might be Mark W. Begor in one, I may be Mark Begor in another. Sometimes the keying and linking connects it, then it doesn't.</p><p>We're going from those siloed data assets that we and our competitors have today, and ours are -- remember, a scale that's different than our competitors to a single data fabric, meaning Mark Begor is going to be there with every data asset already ingested and tied to me. The ability for us and our customers to access the multiple data assets we have, we believe, is going to open up new revenue opportunities.</p><p>Today, we link them. We have scores. We do a lot of things to really work around the limitation of our legacy data environment. We believe it's going to be really transformational and almost unlimited in the amount of data assets that we can store around each individual. And not only static, meaning the current record, but also the history for trended data, which today is complicated in the legacy environment for us and our competitors.</p><p>Tomorrow in a cloud environment, we'll have every data element trended. And we think that's going to be quite powerful.</p><p>JOHN W. GAMBLE: There's also just -- what we're seeing now entering 2020 is also just a nice grouping of substantial new products, right? So we have new scores for personal loans that use multi-data assets. We have new scores for rental that use multi-data assets. We have new scores for insurance that we partnered with Verisk to deliver multi-data assets. We have new header products that use DataX, right? So it's -- which is an alternative data asset, which gives us breadth.</p><p>So none of those are -- I forget the words you used, right, they're not -- none of them are game-changing, but they're all important products that allow us to sell more effectively to our customers, right? And some of them use machine learning so that we're utilizing our assets across the organization.</p><p>MARK W. BEGOR: The machine learning one is still nascent, but it's one we're investing heavily in. And we probably don't talk enough about it. I think you know we have a technology called NDT or NeuroDecision Technology. We're the only patented, explainable AI from an FCRA standpoint. I think everyone in the room knows that, how important that is in the regulated environment we live in. You have to be able to explain when you tell someone they're not going to offer them credit. Why?</p><p>And as you know, AI makes that increasingly complicated, which data asset is why you said why. In a normal kind of regression model, it's complicated, but it's organized today. And I believe that's going to be a really growing trend about the AI because when I meet with customers, they say a couple things. Number one, they want to access to more data. And more data makes it complicated to make the decision to do that regression model without AI. So having the only patent, and we've got 4 patents on it now, we've got 2 or 3 pending, we think will be quite valuable.</p><p>And then the other thing they tell us is help us manage all this data, not only ours but also theirs, how do you put all that together. And AI, it's probably not a -- going to be a real catalyst in '20, but it is in '21, '22, and that's why we're investing in the AI because we think there's a real trend there. And that's -- this happened 2, 3, 4 years ago, we started investing in it, but it's a big area of ours that we think will be a catalyst in the future.</p><p>DAVID MARK TOGUT: I definitely want to go deeper on data and technology, but before I do, I just want to call out 10-year treasury yield at 0.9%, which is a record low. And you have an enormous mortgage business.</p><p>MARK W. BEGOR: Bigger than our competitors, yes.</p><p>DAVID MARK TOGUT: 20% of revenue.</p><p>MARK W. BEGOR: 17%.</p><p>DAVID MARK TOGUT: Oh, 17% type of origination and refi. So I think at the time of the earnings call, you were guiding to flat 2020 mortgage increase, but interest rates were higher.</p><p>MARK W. BEGOR: We said pretty strong in the first quarter on our mortgage business.</p><p>JOHN W. GAMBLE: 20%?</p><p>MARK W. BEGOR: Yes.</p><p>DAVID MARK TOGUT: And then comparison is tougher through the year, but you're probably not banking on 10-year treasury yield at 90 basis points.</p><p>MARK W. BEGOR: No.</p><p>DAVID MARK TOGUT: So how does this most recent step down in interest rates affect your thinking on the 2020 mortgage market?</p><p>MARK W. BEGOR: It's obviously going to be helpful. How long it lasts, you could talk -- we haven't brought up yet the coronavirus, what's the impact of that. But we haven't seen any impact from it. Obviously, we're changing our travel patterns like everyone else is, and being careful and doing the elbows and everything else that the rest of the world is doing. But there's no question this is a tailwind for us. We haven't seen much impact from that in the last few -- in the last week. But because there's usually a lag on when that goes into the marketplace. But there's no question that's going to be helpful to us as we go into 2020.</p><p>DAVID MARK TOGUT: But you're calling out maybe other effects from coronavirus?</p><p>MARK W. BEGOR: No, no, no. We don't see any impacts. I just said, let's not forget that there could be, but we don't see any of that impact in any of our guidance. And we haven't given new guidance. We gave guidance a couple of weeks ago for the first quarter and for the year. You're pointing out that that interest rate drop should be a tailwind to that guidance, and it's hard to disagree with that.</p><p>JOHN W. GAMBLE: And coronavirus, we don't know what's going to happen. So we're like everybody else, yes.</p><p>DAVID MARK TOGUT: Understood. If we look at the health of consumer credit demand, we just talked about mortgage, one of the top 3. You've also got auto and credit cards.</p><p>MARK W. BEGOR: P loans, yes.</p><p>DAVID MARK TOGUT: How do you assess the overall health of the consumer, let's say, starting in the U.S. and going to your other major geographies?</p><p>MARK W. BEGOR: Yes, for us, it starts with an employment and wage growth. And the U.S. consumer is pretty healthy when it comes from an unemployment working standpoint, and that's a good thing. And I think our customers are still very bullish about the consumer. I think there was some tone last summer about, let's do some recession planning, and we helped with customers on that. I hear less of that now. Of course, the coronavirus seems to be taking most of the bandwidth in the last couple of weeks. But the U.S. consumer feels like it's healthy. When I go to other markets, U.K. for us was challenged around the Brexit uncertainty through much of 2019. Now Brexit's solved, but is it solved? It's still unclear. Our U.K. business was up stronger in the second half than the first half. So it kind of exited the year with some momentum versus its historical growth rate still a bit lower than that.</p><p>Australia as a market is one that was bumpy. They kind of started to slow down, not a recession but a slowdown in late '18 that carried through '19. Their fourth quarter was better, and second half was better. We've got a new leader there, which we're excited about, that our best leader in international was a woman from Canada. We put her down there in August, and she is doing great. So we're enthusiastic about that.</p><p>And then the other 2 markets for us, which are much smaller, Argentina and Chile. Argentina was impacted by the political change down there. And then Chile was through their protests or riots, whatever you want to call it, but that had some small impact for us, but that business in Latin America still grew high singles in 2019. Anything else you'd add on economics?</p><p>JOHN W. GAMBLE: No, Canada's...</p><p>MARK W. BEGOR: Canada's doing great.</p><p>JOHN W. GAMBLE: They're fine, yes.</p><p>MARK W. BEGOR: Canada was up high singles in 2019. We've got a strong market position. They have a new leader there that came in from the industry that we're really excited about. So Canada's doing to fine, too.</p><p>DAVID MARK TOGUT: Just focusing on Australia for a minute, that business I think years back, Veda used to be a high single-digit growth business before the -- certainly before Australia slowed down. Is there a path for that business to get back to high single digits over time?</p><p>MARK W. BEGOR: High singles is a big growth rate. Canada's a business that you could look at it as a similar market that that business has been growing high singles for the last 5 years for us through innovation, and it has a similar market position to our Australia business. I don't think I'm ready to give that kind of guidance of high singles, but we expect it to come back to kind of mid- to high singles from a long-term standpoint. Whether they get there in 2020, we want to see how the economy unfolds. If you could add to that, John?</p><p>JOHN W. GAMBLE: That's what we said when we bought them, right? We have said that they will probably grow kind of like USIS, right? Maybe a little faster like the Equifax model. I don't think we ever got the high singles, but we thought that they would grow 5%, 6%, 7%. And I think -- we think there's a path factor.</p><p>MARK W. BEGOR: Yes. Veda, as you may know, had a pretty good run of M&amp;A rolling into their numbers for a time frame. The woman that was running that was quite acquisitive. M&amp;A is a part of our model. Historically, it's been 1% to 2% of our revenue growth. And we'll tell you what our long-term financial framework, my guess is it won't be that different going forward that we want to have 1% to 2% of growth on the top line from M&amp;A.</p><p>And if you look at 2018 and '19, we were in the ZIP code of the low end of that range. We bought DataX in 2018. That was -- added close to 100 basis points. Last year, we bought PayNet. That was kind of close to that 100 basis points. I'd like to move that more up to the 2.</p><p>And I think, as you know, our strategy is very focused around bolt-on M&amp;A. And I think DataX and PayNet are 2 great examples, buying unique data assets or analytics capabilities that we can really leverage inside of Equifax.</p><p>I'm a bolt-on guy. John is, and Equifax has been. And then finding Vedas, finding a platform, if we can find other platforms like Australia that makes sense and lean in to spend a bit more on M&amp;A to get a unique platform like that, we would do that.</p><p>DAVID MARK TOGUT: Your best business, Workforce Solutions, your monopoly position growing double digits.</p><p>MARK W. BEGOR: We don't use that term.</p><p>DAVID MARK TOGUT: Okay. Okay.</p><p>MARK W. BEGOR: Strong competitive position.</p><p>DAVID MARK TOGUT: Okay, great competitive position. What to slow this business down from double digits? I mean especially if mortgage gets a little bit more of a tailwind this year from lower rates?</p><p>MARK W. BEGOR: It's a very unique business. What's unique about the business for me is it's clearly our best business. You might argue it's one of the best businesses in our industry. It has a very unique market position. It has real scale today, and it's got multiple levers for growth. And really unique about those levers, every data business is looking for more use cases, new customers. How else can you use the data? And I'll come back to that with Workforce Solutions.</p><p>Most businesses don't have the ability to add data assets. And I think you know we ended the year at around 100 million records every pay period in that business, about 75 million uniques. People have 2 jobs.</p><p>JOHN W. GAMBLE: Looks closer to 80 million.</p><p>MARK W. BEGOR: 80 million uniques. So people have 2 jobs. That's how you get to 100 million. And with 160 nonfarm payroll, we've got the ability to go from 80 million uniques to 160 million uniques. And last year, we added about 10 million records. Historically, we've been adding 5-plus million records, and those monetize instantly. And that's very unique from a data business to have kind of a real runway of adding records.</p><p>And as you know, we go door to door to corporations and work with the HR leader. I was on an e-mail this morning chain about a corporation that we're adding. So that's one of the ways we do. We have a dedicated team inside of that business that all they do is work on adding records.</p><p>And then the other one, that's a few years old, but we still have a lot of runway left is to partner with payroll processors to add their data assets. So that's a real lever on growing that database. And if you think about that business, which will be north of $1 billion this year, growing at 50 to almost double Equifax's growth rate with margins that are close to 1,000 basis points above Equifax's average.</p><p>It's a very highly accretive business inside of our long-term financial framework. It was before, but it's really accelerated, I think, as you know, in the last couple of years.</p><p>And then you go to the other more traditional ways to grow the business about more verticals, more use cases. And we get the question about like with mortgage, isn't the income and employment report pulled on most mortgages? The answer is yes, where we have a credit, we have a file.</p><p>But then what increasingly is happening is mortgage originators will pull it twice and 3x. So we work with the mortgage originators to try to convince them. Here's how you want to use it a second time and why it's going to enhance your process, meaning you're going to keep the customer, you're going to get a better customer. So more pulls is very attractive.</p><p>And then you go into other verticals like government has been a vertical that's growing above our average at Workforce Solutions, where it's being used for social services here in the United States. Does someone qualify for Medicaid? Do they qualify for food stamps?</p><p>What isn't being done yet, which we see as a real growth opportunity that could more than double our government business is around fraud. There's a huge fraud issue where a consumer is getting food stamps and then gets a better job but still collects the food stamps. It's not used today for that. We're working with the government at the federal level and the state level to work through that. So lots of opportunities in the verticals. And then the other lever for that business is it's got a very deep, but I would characterize, narrow swim lane in income and employment verification. It's a great business.</p><p>So we're going to add -- keep adding records. We're going to keep having more pulls. We'll go into auto, using it for verification of income and employment and near-prime and sub-prime auto in P loans. It's increasingly being used in the credit decision, but it's pulling the report going to how we can have scores or just a flag that says, \"Well, Mark is working. We won't tell you how much he's making or who he's working for.\" There's value in that, and we can sell it differently.</p><p>Basically, we sell the $20, $30, $40 report. Having a $5 or $2 or $1 flag for a credit card company is quite valuable. You may know my background was running GE Capital's credit card business. We didn't use this data asset because the hit rates weren't good enough. Now that you're getting to 40% hit rates, it's very valuable. And if you can deliver a product -- a credit card company can't afford a $40 report on every job I've ever had. They can't afford $1 on Mark's working. It enhances the credit decision.</p><p>And then the last leg for that one is really back to that data fabric being able to combine the credit report with our other data assets, along with our -- is Mark working, how much is he making, how long has he been there at that company, enhances the risk underwriting. Today, we do versions of that in scores. Tomorrow with the data fabric, we'll be much more powerful. It's a business that I talk about internally and externally of being in the second inning, which is fairly bold for a business that we've owned for over a decade. It's $1 billion growing at that pace. That's how I talk to the team about it, about the opportunities because there's a lot of things I talked about there we're not doing yet, but we will with the tech transformation.</p><p>DAVID MARK TOGUT: How do you think about the operating leverage in that business? I mean do you want to grow those margins? Would you rather redeploy it to maximize revenue growth?</p><p>MARK W. BEGOR: Both. It's hard to reinvest all those margins, right? Because we're doing it in that business and other businesses. And there's also a capacity element of how much a team can actually do.</p><p>As you might imagine, our team is pretty red lined around the tech transformation. That's -- we got a full-time job running the business. There's another full-time job doing the tech transformation. And then we're also investing in innovation, going from 75 to 92 new products last year. We want to keep driving that up. So we're building capacity or bandwidth and resources to make sure we're investing in innovation.</p><p>When I think long term about Equifax, the current chapter we're in is really restacking our technology. The next chapter is going to be taking advantage of that. And how do we take advantage of that? It's going to be around innovation and new products and really putting the pedal to the metal around innovation. And that's going to be -- and we're starting that -- we started that last year by adding more resources around product and around innovation and feet on the street. We're doing more of that in 2020. That will continue in '21.</p><p>So there'll likely be a balance between dropping through margin dollars from our transformation to the bottom line and in reinvesting some of that in accelerating the growth even further. There will be a balance there, which every business does.</p><p>JOHN W. GAMBLE: And accelerating the growth in EWS is very accretive to our overall margins because their margins are so high.</p><p>DAVID MARK TOGUT: Let me just pause, see if there are any questions for management.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: [Just following on that.] I mean conceptually, so let's say your margin (inaudible). What will be the reasons why you won't be through those (inaudible)</p><p>MARK W. BEGOR: I think that's a fairly good argument to have. We're certainly -- we're not ready to give our long-term financial framework. But the points you make are the points I was making. That's why we're doing a tech investment to grow our top line, to grow our margins.</p><p>And you point out the very accretive element of EWS. We're going to have an accretive element from the tech savings, and our tech cost is going to be quite positive. We're going to reinvest some of that. But again, we're not ready today to put a long-term framework on that. We've given you good guidance for 2020 when we have an Investor Day and put the framework out later in the year. We'll certainly do that but your points are tough to argue with.</p><p>JOHN W. GAMBLE: There are some areas of increased cost, right? So we've invested more in compliance. We've invested more in security, right?</p><p>MARK W. BEGOR: Those are in our run rate now.</p><p>JOHN W. GAMBLE: They're on our run rate now, but versus '16, they're higher right?</p><p>MARK W. BEGOR: Totally.</p><p>JOHN W. GAMBLE: Our insurance costs are higher. Things like that are in our run rate.</p><p>MARK W. BEGOR: Yes.</p><p>DAVID MARK TOGUT: What are the next steps you need to take to return your U.S. consumer direct business to growth?</p><p>MARK W. BEGOR: The GCS consumer direct, is it? Yes. Well, you saw that in the second half of last year. It was negative in the first half. As you know, we started advertising in late 2018. There's a lag on when that converts into revenue.</p><p>So that was negative in the first half of 2019, positive in the second half. We expect that to continue as we go into 2020.</p><p>JOHN W. GAMBLE: Total GCS. Total GCS.</p><p>MARK W. BEGOR: Yes. So we expect that to continue as we go in -- there's 2 pieces of GCS. There's direct piece as well as the partner piece. That's an important business for us.</p><p>We just brought a new leader in. She started in December. We brought in a woman who used to run the credit card business for Wells Fargo. So we've got a real consumer expert in that. It's a business that we want to keep investing in, but we're never going to be as large as our biggest competitor in the direct-to-consumer. It's just not our game, but it's a business that we want to be in, and we're going to continue to invest in and continue to grow.</p><p>DAVID MARK TOGUT: Any impact from Intuit buying Credit Karma?</p><p>MARK W. BEGOR: No. We are a big partner with Karma. We're also -- Intuit's a customer. We don't see any positive or negative impact. We've got great relationships with both, and we expect those to continue.</p><p>DAVID MARK TOGUT: What do you think is the most misunderstood aspect of Equifax by investors?</p><p>MARK W. BEGOR: Most of our investors' bandwidth around questions around USIS, understandably, which means we don't spend a lot of time talking about Workforce Solutions. I'm not sure our investors fully understand the power of that business, the impact that it has, the accretive nature to our revenue and to our margins.</p><p>And maybe the reason I say that is because we don't talk about it a lot in investor meetings. USIS is all-encompassing. Tech transformation takes up the next 25 minutes, and then there's 5 minutes left. And so yes, talk about Workforce Solutions, where it's such a power business for us. We want to make sure that our investors understand it, understand the runway on it. And I'm sure in our Investor Day, we'll have a segment just on Workforce Solutions, for sure.</p><p>DAVID MARK TOGUT: Will you give out more metrics? I mean you mentioned a 40%-plus hit ratio, for example. Like where do you think you could take that hit ratio on the record database?</p><p>MARK W. BEGOR: If the records go up. As you add data records, your hit rates go up. So it's really, if you think about the portion of the working population we have, really drives those hit rates. It's 70 million to 80 million versus 160 million nonfarm payroll. That drives the hit rates up. Obviously, the mix of who's applying for mortgages in the population.</p><p>But you're getting to like a tipping point, my view, with the 40% hit rates with Workforce Solutions, where it's kind of a must-have to use it. And think about my example. I ran Synchrony, the GE's credit card business for 10 years. When it was 20% hit rate, it was like, well, it's interesting, but if you're only going to get 1 in 5 customers, it's not worth all the effort to put it in. Now that we're getting 1 in 2, it becomes a very valuable asset. And of course, we have to package products for those different market segments. It becomes a very different business from just income and employment verification to becoming a more valuable data asset when your database becomes more comprehensive. So it's a positive.</p><p>DAVID MARK TOGUT: Great. Well, Mark, thanks so much for being with us here today.</p><p>MARK W. BEGOR: Thanks for having us here.</p><p>DAVID MARK TOGUT: John, thanks to you as well.

We have got a lot going on with the Telecity and the acquisition of Bit-isle in Japan. Our gameboard continues to -- we continue to stay active, looking at the market.</p><p>I would tell you, though, on top of those two activities, we are going to be pretty busy in 2016 integrating and making those two acquisitions part of the Equinix family.</p><p>But at the top of our agenda every year is looking for opportunities to, number one, press our advantage in the market. Secondly, there is a lot going on to capture the enterprise customers, and we have talked a lot about that today in our one-on-ones. So everything we are doing today is to enable us to go capture the enterprise. So all the work we are doing with the cloud providers, on top of the network activity we have done in the last 17 years, is to put those two capabilities together to make them very attractive assets to capture more and more of our definition of the enterprise, all the other industry verticals, such as pharmaceutical, healthcare, manufacturing, et cetera.</p><p>We're prosecuting that a little differently in each country. As you would expect, in a Germany we are looking deeper into the manufacturing segments. In a UK, we're in healthcare and pharmaceutical. In the US, it might be a handful of other verticals.</p><p>But we're working hard to get success stories and use cases built so we can figure out how to go after that. Now that takes investment to go after this. This is much different than the last 17 years, where the networks and the digital media companies and the financial services electronic companies knew what they wanted and they came to us because we enabled it.</p><p>This is more of creating demand now, so there is marketing investment. There is sales investment. There is indirect channel investment. There are service offering investments. So there is quite a bit of investment to go after this. But the size of the opportunity and the hundreds of thousands of enterprises that exist in the world today that would look like a prospect to us is a big number.</p><p>And so, we have roughly 6,700, 6,800 customers today. We will layer in another 2,000 plus with Telecity and another 300, 400 with Bit-isle, so call it 8,000, 9,000 customers that we would have today with these acquisitions. There is no good reason in the next five to 10 years that Equinix couldn't have 20,000, 30,000, 40,000, 50,000, 60,000 customers if we figured out how to go prosecute the enterprise -- I should say when we figure out.</p><p>A couple of other things that are always high priority for us every year, we have about six or seven initiatives that -- and those were two of them. We're always looking how to see the next ecosystem, and the couple of areas that look prominent for us, obviously cloud is enabling interconnection in a pretty big way. I don't know if we would declare it as robust an ecosystem as the network to network is and the digital media to network is and as the electronic trading is, but it's well on its way.</p><p>But electronic payments look very promising. We are starting to see the early stages of the Big Data transition to the Internet of Things. With all the sensors and the devices and the screens deployed around the world today, there is a lot of information that companies are trying to monetize, and so we see opportunities to help companies do this.</p><p>The connected car, the connected refrigerator, the connected device, you name it. Everything is getting connected, and we're having lots of requirements coming to us to help them think through that.</p><p>And then underneath all this, there is a lot of work to do to scale this Company, so we are growing fast, so scaling people, organizations, systems, and processes is always on the agenda. We have turned on our quote-to-cash process around the world. It is live everywhere in the world. And we are in that stage now where we are making customers comfortable with interacting with us in a new way.</p><p>But once you get that level of automation in, as you look in the out years you should require less human hiring when you have more automation in the company, so we are trying to push hard on that.</p><p>And the last two things I would mention is we're trying to be great capital allocators. We have mentioned to you that you should expect that our capital allocation will still be in the same buckets as it has been in the past, with dividends at the top of that list now, but followed closely by organic and inorganic growth, and then debt repayment and buying assets where we see feasible. And then, share repurchase will remain on that list, but it is less likely at this point with all the other activities we have.</p><p>But I would tell you that being great capital allocators is high on the priority. What you see at the high end of our CapEx forecast for this year is what you should think about as a starting point as you think about going forward. We have an earnings call on February 18 where we will bring more color to the guidance around all those things on the 18th.</p><p>And then, lastly, we have become pretty big corporate social responsible players in the markets around the world. We are driving the Company to 100% renewable energy, so we are investing pretty big in wind power, solar power, fuel cells, and so we are driving the Company to 100% renewable energy consumer over the next couple of years around the world. There is a lot of focus on that.</p><p>And then -- I think those are the critical areas, Mike.</p><p>MICHAEL ROLLINS: Thanks. Maybe it will be helpful to think about -- as we think about 2016, what you just accomplished in 2015, and based on the guidance that you gave off of the third-quarter results, you increased the organic revenue growth from at least 12% almost a year ago from now to 16%. So can you give us a little bit more color about what drove that outperformance and then how that might play into your momentum for 2016?</p><p>STEVE SMITH: Sure. It starts with, of course, bookings, gross bookings, which is the target that all sales people care about. And we had very good performances last three quarters, as we have reported to you, of greater gross bookings than we anticipated, mostly driven by the cloud enterprise thesis, but we are still seeing very good growth on all the core verticals.</p><p>So the one benefit we have -- we are still seeing 80% to 85% of our bookings coming from the installed base, so that tells you that not only are the cloud players trying to go service the -- everybody is trying to service the enterprise. So everybody is scaling and building more capability and more capacity to go service the enterprise because everybody believes that 80% of the enterprise's spend is in house and it is going to come out to the market and everybody wants to go help them service that.</p><p>So it starts with gross bookings. Our churn was at the low end. I think you have all seen our churn has been bouncing around the 2% the last five quarters. We still want to maintain that 2% to 2.5% guideline. There will be a quarter here and there that will bump up a little bit, but generally speaking, the move we made a few years ago to really make sure we are bringing the right applications in the front door so that it didn't churn at the end of the term is really starting to take hold, because they are more interconnected. They are more mission critical. They are more global in nature, and so that is starting to -- that investment and bet is starting to pay out for us.</p><p>So churn, I think, is going to remain at the lower end of that range, and, again, we might see a quarter or two where it might bump up. You are still going to have occasionally a customer that grew with you for several years. They get to a certain size and they determine they need to build their own data center or they want to move some of that work to a wholesale provider. That dynamic is still going to be with us I think forever.</p><p>And then, lastly, that all cascades down to net bookings, which has been stronger than we expected, and ultimately our sales force has done a very good job preserving price. So our yield has been firm around the world, and if you look at the combination of those four things, it has presented very good results.</p><p>And the last thing I would say, Mike, is we are very fortunate that the secular trends are blowing a hard wind behind us, and so we are definitely playing off the trends, the tech trends that are happening in the industry today. There is no question.</p><p>MICHAEL ROLLINS: So one of the things I thought about in terms of the 2015 performance is you had better bookings that you describe. You also had better nonrecurring revenue, and I think the original thought process of it coming down when you guided was that some of the larger deals early in 2015 wouldn't continue.</p><p>So, is there a story to tell around the size of deals where maybe you had some incremental larger size wins over the course of 2015 that really helped? And this comes back to what you were describing on cloud deployments and some of your big customers deploying more with you. Is there a story within that to try to describe some of the upside and to think about how you came to those benefits?</p><p>STEVE SMITH: Yes, let me try to provide some color on that. So, I think our expectations coming into the year were clearly around betting big on the big three infrastructures or service providers -- Microsoft, Google, and AWS -- and that has played out as we expected.</p><p>So, we spend a lot of time with those three. We have done a lot of development inside of our centers and behind the cloud switches that we put in place in 21 markets, giving them the functionality they wanted to have, higher security, higher performance, and better latency when you wanted to connect to Office 365 at Microsoft or Azure or Google Apps or AWS.</p><p>And so the last 12 to 18 months, there has been a lot of technical development with their technical development teams, putting higher functionality so that when you buy a port on one of our cloud exchanges, on the other side when you see the cloud provider you are trying to connect to, it is at a -- it is a higher security. It is more private. It's all the things I just talked about.</p><p>So we spent an inordinate amount of money and time and effort to try to get those three stood up. I think we decided to bet on those three, and it has paid off for us because today the largest application that an enterprise wants to get to is Office 365 today. And so, the highest demand we see inside of our data centers is to get to Office 365. But all the other apps we are enabling, you can see it starting to unfold.</p><p>So there were some larger deployments that we won, but I think all three of those providers know where we stop and where we will end on a negotiation on price. They have gotten to learn very well that we are not interested in wholesale deployments or interested in stuff that is going to help the pullthrough and the magnetic effect of an ecosystem. So they are getting really good at deciding what to offer to us to bid on and not even offering us the stuff that is down in the wholesale pricing range.</p><p>So that was a factor, and there was quite a few wins that we did this year and I think you are seeing the effect when you look at what's happened with other big tech companies. You look at HP, you look at IBM, you look at Dell, EMC, NetApp; all these companies are feeling the effect of the brush of these three big players. And now, you also see other big players selling data center assets around the world.</p><p>So, the cloud is having a big impact on a lot of companies. We're enabling a lot of that and we get a lot of questions from investors that say, why isn't it affecting you? Well, we're in a position to enable these companies, and it is not just these three, but a lot of the activity out of the gate these last 18 months has been to connect to the three.</p><p>We have over 500 cloud providers as customers in our data center, so there is a lot of midsize companies, smaller companies, all trying to put their stuff in place, connecting to our cloud exchanges, trying to enable this private connectivity in the market.</p><p>So our thesis is let's keep doing these smaller, midsize deals. Occasionally, we're going to take a larger footprint. It could be up to 0.5 megawatt of requirement of power, even up to 1 megawatt, but it will have to be very magnetic and have pullthrough effect.</p><p>And we're going to go create this environment where you can come into Equinix and you can connect to the networks and move whatever traffic you want to move publicly through the public Internet. Now you can also connect privately through the cloud exchange to move private applications to the cloud providers, and that's a pretty attractive multi-cloud, hybrid cloud environment that most of the conversations we are having with any CIO in the world is what they're looking for.</p><p>Certain parts of their application workload, they want them to get to the cloud because of the cost performance and latency benefit. And that's what's happening. There isn't a conversation we have today where any company is not trying to connect to one or all three of those providers.</p><p>MICHAEL ROLLINS: When you take a step back and look at the marketplace, how would you evaluate where market growth is? Has that gotten better as well?</p><p>STEVE SMITH: General market growth for our industry?</p><p>MICHAEL ROLLINS: Yes, for your industry, yes.</p><p>STEVE SMITH: I still think we believe it is in the high single-digit range, and when we build an annual plan, we always build a plan to grow faster than the current growth rate.</p><p>So when we started out at 12% last year, Mike, we felt like the growth rate for network neutral retail colo globally was in the 8%, 9%, 10%, more towards the 8%, 9%. So we built a plan that was to take share. We know we are spending more capital than any of our competitors and we know we are taking share.</p><p>It is very hard to judge that because nobody really can calculate it. It is not done very well in this industry segment, but we know we are taking share just because of the anecdotal evidence and the amount of CapEx we are spending.</p><p>So our plan is always to grow faster at or above market growth rates and that's the plan we start the year out. You notice our guidance strategy now is greater than, and I think you're going to continue to see that from us because it is very hard to predict how fast this stuff is going to happen. We're getting a lot of -- Katrina and I are getting a lot of questions today about, is the enterprise showing up as fast as you expected? It is I don't know what to expect and how fast it is going to show.</p><p>We know it is showing up. It is starting to produce all the new logos. It is starting to connect to the cloud. The thesis is proving out, but it is how fast should this go? It is very hard to predict. So we're going to do our best intelligence and I think you're going to see us continue to do what we did the last couple of years.</p><p>MICHAEL ROLLINS: What is the decision set for an enterprise? If they are looking to connect to these cloud players, is it a choice between deploying cabinets in your facilities versus buying VPN connections from a large telco or a fiber provider? What is the decision set for enterprises and how are you able to describe the value proposition for why they should be a customer or a larger customer for your Company?</p><p>STEVE SMITH: First of all, it starts with -- today, over 50% of our revenue is with customers that are in all three operating regions with us, Asia, EMEA, and the Americas. So, when you consider that our customer base is with us in multiple markets and then it is over 70% that are in multiple regions and then it is over 80% that are in multiple metros, so it is a very global connected customer base and that's the part of the conversation that we have with customers.</p><p>So we will compete locally in markets, but generally speaking, we are taking advantage of the scale and reach that we have for global applications, mission-critical activity, cloud-enabled activity, and then companies that have people, revenue, and customers globally distributed.</p><p>So if you're a customer -- and we have moved from -- I don't know what the number was a couple years ago -- now to over 110, I think it is, and it is growing; there will be more this quarter -- of Fortune 500 companies, they are coming in and they are trying us, they are landing, and we are starting to see they are starting to expand. So we believe the approach with us is going to be land and expand.</p><p>So once we get use cases and success stories built with these big Fortune 500 companies, other companies in those sectors are going to say, wow, Chevron is doing this and airline B is doing this and pharmaceutical D is doing this, and they are going to start paying attention. So, that's how the enterprise game goes with service providers. You got to get use cases and success stories built, and that's where the focus is today.</p><p>MICHAEL ROLLINS: Is there some sort of historical example that we could look at for your Company or maybe another set of similar companies that would help investors assess the synergy opportunity for the Telecity transaction?</p><p>STEVE SMITH: One thing I would tell you probably not to look at is what the Telecity interaction synergy plan was, because it will be apples and oranges, my guess is.</p><p>We will give you some color on February 18, some preliminary color of how we're thinking about it, but you should expect revenue, CapEx, OpEx, and cash flow synergies out of this combination.</p><p>But we are dealing with a global entity, Equinix Europe acquiring a pan-European entity that was running very lean and with about 400 less people than we have in our European business for roughly the same size revenue and actually running at a margin that was 1 or 2 points higher than we were -- EBITDA margin, higher than our European business.</p><p>So you are dealing with a company that is pretty well run, pretty lean, very -- the assets are great assets. We have been asked the question a lot today, why Telecity, why not Interxion? We knew both those assets very well, and when that fuse was lit, there really wasn't any debate about which one. We knew the culture, the locations they were in, the quality of the assets were the combination that we wanted to go after.</p><p>So it is all playing out as we expected. Shareholder vote is on the 11th, Monday, the 11th. They have a court hearing on Wednesday, and then we will close on next Friday, the 15th. That's the current plan for the go-forward.</p><p>There has been a lot of work going on preholiday to get the integration lined up. We've met with all the key players. We have had multiple integration meetings. Keith and I and Charles and the rest of the leadership team have visited almost all the assets and met all the people at the leadership levels. We are very comfortable with where we are and there is a great plan in place. The learnings from Switch and Data and from the other acquisitions will definitely play into getting this thing right right out of the gate.</p><p>The key is you got to keep the sales engine moving, so the bookings is the critical component. We will get these assets tethered. We will get the data center people. All that will fall into place. The real gem of this thing out of the gate is to make sure you maintain the bookings momentum, and helping their sales force learn how to sell a global platform and helping our sales force learn these new assets that we're going to pick up across these new countries.</p><p>MICHAEL ROLLINS: So as you think about investing in sales and trying to go after more customers, is one of the opportunities of the transaction, instead of integrating and optimizing the sales force, using this to create a larger sales force to push, as you said, your advantage in the marketplace?</p><p>STEVE SMITH: You mean with the Telecity sales force, Mike?</p><p>MICHAEL ROLLINS: Yes.</p><p>STEVE SMITH: That will be additive, and the one commitment I will make to everybody, we will do a hell of a lot better job this time with the sales force. I think we overengineered the sales force six, seven years ago with Switch and Data. So there will be a lot more preservation.</p><p>We're actually bringing the entire sales engine to our sales kickoff next week in Florida, which we are going to inject them into the Company and it is a big kickoff. We do it every year and it will get them completely connected culturally to the Company and to their peers, so the timing is absolutely perfect. So we are fortunate there.</p><p>But, yes, we will -- there will be more heads. I think the number, we're around 240 direct salespeople at Equinix now. There is X number coming from Telecity. I don't know the exact number off the top of my head. Katrina, do you know? I don't know.</p><p>KATRINA RYMILL, IR, EQUINIX, INC.: It is 70 to 80.</p><p>STEVE SMITH: 70 to 80 in Telecity, and then the channel, the indirect channel, which I haven't mentioned yet, is stood up now and it is in the 70 to 80 range of total people. So we are partnering now with big partners, medium-size partners, and so we have got different routes to market going.</p><p>And we feel that kind of headcount is what it is going to take to go prosecute the enterprise at the pace we want to go right now.</p><p>MICHAEL ROLLINS: And so, the other part of the Telecity transaction just to hit upon is the announced divestitures. In one of the questions -- actually, there is two questions that have really come up with this. The first one is how to think about what you are actually selling, because there is -- obviously from a selfish perspective, you might want to take some of those customers that are in other facilities of yours or Telecity and try to hold onto that, but that could affect the multiple or the value that you get for those assets.</p><p>So, what exactly are you selling and are there any limitations that you face in terms of trying to maximize the relationships that you're going to get from the transaction itself?</p><p>STEVE SMITH: There are limitations. We faced the same challenge when we sold the 16 assets in the Americas a couple years ago from the Switch and Data assets in the Tier 2 markets, so we are very versed in how you manage that.</p><p>So we have quarantined these eight assets off now. They won't be obviously part of the close. We have identified the people that will go with those assets. The partner has been picked. We have picked a bank. We did a bake-off and we picked RBC to help us through this process. They are ready to go. They were ready to go before the holidays, so we are in full speed right now.</p><p>There is no buyer upfront requirement, so we will close before this has to be done. It will take six, seven, eight, nine months to get this done properly.</p><p>There will be some rules around the customer question, Mike. We will have to be very careful. We can't just try to go after those -- many of these customers are in many sites in these countries, anyways, and there is very specific rules and limitations around going after those customers, so that will be governed very closely.</p><p>Who we dispose these assets to, the EU will have a heavy hand in that. We drive the process. Obviously, our agenda is to not create another competitor, but the EU's agenda is to make sure there is competition in each of these markets. They obviously looked at how much revenue capacity was required to be divested, how much capacity was available in these assets, and how much interconnection density was in these assets. And so, all that came into play where we landed.</p><p>Personally and the leadership team, we are very happy with where we landed on this. We knew it was going to require some amount of disposition. I think we will look back on this thing two, three, four years from now and slap each other on the back and be very happy with where we landed. Having now 64 assets around Europe, that puts us in a very strong position in that part of the world.</p><p>And we will dispose of these eight assets, and everybody that you can imagine is at the table interested in them. These are very critical assets and I think we will have no problem picking and choosing who we want to dispose these assets to.</p><p>MICHAEL ROLLINS: How did you decide to use or issue equity earlier in the year to fund some of your financial needs?</p><p>STEVE SMITH: When we put the financing plan together pre-November, when Keith and I went to the market to do this, we decided that we wanted to have this balanced approach of debt and equity. And we did a term loan in Europe in local currency and we extended an operating line that we had that put about $3.2 billion of liquidity back in play for us.</p><p>So the equity was aimed at the organic growth of the business and the debt was aimed predominantly at concluding the Telecity acquisition. Just philosophically, that's how we came to the conclusion.</p><p>The equity raise did surprise many people when we came -- I mean, we are not a serial equity player, so I think that question came up a lot. But I think as Keith and I went through the discussion over the course of the week and a half we were on the road, people understood and got it when we described the growth of the business and the pace that we were going and the dividend strategy and the rest of the needs of the business.</p><p>So, this puts us in a very strong position from a balance-sheet standpoint for quite some time. We are not putting a time limit on it, but we can see that this is going to handle the dividend requirements, the organic/inorganic growth requirements, and the asset purchase and debt repayment requirements that we have in front of us.</p><p>MICHAEL ROLLINS: You used, I think, some investment in 2015 and it may have held back some of the margin performance in 2015, but your key focus this past year, of course, was the cloud and the enterprise and making progress there. How do we think about the investment initiatives in 2016 for some of the things that you described that you're going after, whether it is the Internet of Things or continuing to push more of this cloud enterprise vision? And how should investors think about margin performance in this period of investment?</p><p>STEVE SMITH: Good question. This is probably the biggest issue that we have is at the rate we are growing, it requires investment, and everybody, including us and our Board, would like to see the margin also improve along with that investment.</p><p>And our trade-offs we're making now is that we want to keep investing to grow the business as top priority. And the investments were just not 2015 investments to stand all this stuff up. There is -- as I mentioned, there is marketing, service offering, and innovation around the cloud exchanges. There is a whole bunch of investments required to put in place the capability to attract enterprises. Enterprises contract differently; enterprises want to be billed -- there is a whole different way to interact with enterprises from all of those fronts. You got to get to them through channel and direct, so there is a lot of investment to be continued there.</p><p>So we're going to continue that journey and preserve margins and at the rate that we are running at. I know that everybody in this room that knows us knows we have got this long-term operating plan, 50% EBITDA margin target that we have out there as long as I have been here, and the aspirations are to drive the Company to that or greater over a time period.</p><p>I think what we all underestimated seven, eight, nine years ago when we put that out there was the growth opportunities that we would be facing and the investment required. And I think also people don't clearly understand that, what I mentioned earlier, to grow this Company in the early days when the networks were coming at us and the digital content was coming at us and the electronic trading was coming at us didn't require the level of investment that it requires now at this stage of the game to go capture enterprises.</p><p>And so that has changed and I'm not sure everybody, including us, saw the order of magnitude of that. So our aspirations are to continue to improve margins, but our top priority today is to invest in growth.</p><p>MICHAEL ROLLINS: So would you say that's one of the greatest differentiators between you and your competitors around the world is the investment in distribution and innovation of product ecosystems?</p><p>STEVE SMITH: At the scale we are doing it, yes. I am sure many of the other competitors we have in the market are investing in these things. Everybody has got their version of a cloud exchange. Everybody is trying to enable the cloud.</p><p>The level of functionality that we have put in place with the big players, I don't think anybody is anywhere near that scale. When you look at the amount of money we invested the last 18 months behind the big three that I mentioned, I don't believe anybody -- well, you can go ask these three. They will tell you that nobody has invested at that level to create that level of functionality.</p><p>Now, the question is with the enterprises that are coming into -- looking out in the world, do they want that level of functionality? We have decided to bet on those three. We believe that they have a pretty good point of view about how the world is going to unfold. It doesn't mean we are not betting on number four, and we put IBM SoftLayer there and then we are doing a lot with VMware and EMC and Cisco and all the rest of the players.</p><p>But the big three, certainly in the Infrastructure-as-a-Service space, have really changed the game, as we all know. It has really disrupted a lot of companies.</p><p>So the heavy dose the last 18 months was getting in behind that initiative. What we are starting to see now is SaaS companies really starting to show up. So Oracle, as we told you last quarter, is now deployed in multiple markets with us and they are going big to go start serving Oracle up as a service. SAP is doing the same thing, and you're going to see a lot more of the SaaS activity, I believe, in 2016, similar to what we saw with the big Infrastructure-as-a-Service players.</p><p>The Platform-as-a-Service still exists, the category, but they are all morphing between SaaS and infrastructure players. And it is -- we are still -- if you look inside of our pipeline today, there is still a lot of cloud players coming in, trying to enable their offerings in our data centers, can't afford to put capacity around the world that we have, and that's what's driving the need for us to spend the capital to go facilitate them to set up shop and do their thing around the world.</p><p>MICHAEL ROLLINS: So when you make the decision to greenlight the new project, expansion, new facility, and day of opening you are there, what is the kind of time frame you are seeing or now expecting in terms of fully booking that facility and then getting full revenue utilization, however you want to define that? Is it a three-year, five-year? How do we think about the timing of that? And then, maybe you can contrast that to what you saw two years ago, for example.</p><p>STEVE SMITH: Yes, it's stayed pretty consistent, Mike, but it really depends on the size of the phase that we are opening. So, we like to go cash flow positive in six to 12 months, but it depends on the size of the phase. But the fill rates are as high as they have ever been, and so we are seeing the big markets, because of the cloud initiative, fill rates are as high as we have ever seen them. So that's why you see capital up at the upper end of our range.</p><p>So, the dynamics that we have talked about always about when we go cash flow positive, when we fill it up, it is hard to answer when we fill it because it depends on how big of a phase it is, whether it is a -- and we tend to phase everything now. But it is as robust as it has been because of the demand that we have.</p><p>MICHAEL ROLLINS: How many markets would you say you are tight in terms of available capacity to sell? Are there some key highlights?</p><p>STEVE SMITH: Less than a handful.</p><p>MICHAEL ROLLINS: Okay.</p><p>STEVE SMITH: Yes, less than a handful, but we have a couple isolated situations where because of local laws or regulation issues where we are at capacity, not constrained yet, but we will be constrained in 2016.</p><p>MICHAEL ROLLINS: Do the mergers help with those markets?</p><p>STEVE SMITH: Yes, yes, they help in a couple of those situations.</p><p>MICHAEL ROLLINS: And if we just move over to some of the cash flow side of the equation, you had a dividend this past year. Presumably there is some level of financial performance growth in 2016, but you also put more assets into the REIT during 2015. You made another distribution in the fourth quarter. Is there a way that investors should think about the dividend growth in 2016, given those two pieces to the equation?</p><p>STEVE SMITH: The key ingredient for dividend growth, it will be organic and inorganic growth, followed by moving more assets from the nonqualified, the T, the TRS to the QRS.</p><p>And so, we have got obviously Telecity. We have got the Bit-isle assets, and we have got assets in Brazil and a couple other places that are not in the qualified REIT subsidiary.</p><p>So the finance team, Keith and his team and the tax team are evaluating how we want to prosecute through that through 2016. He will provide a little bit of color on February 18 on our earnings call about how we are thinking about a growing dividend. And so, we'll give you the pieces of the puzzle how we are thinking about that as we move through 2016.</p><p>MICHAEL ROLLINS: The business has gone through a series of migrations, right? You digested virtualization. You digested greater power density. You have digested larger customers moving to wholesale.</p><p>Are there some other digestions thematically that you have to go through, whether it's customers taking a 10-gig crossconnect and putting 100-gig equipment on it so they might not need as many crossconnects? Or are there other things that you are mindful of as a management team that we should be mindful of and watch over?</p><p>STEVE SMITH: Great question. There is a couple at top of mind that I think about that won't be big global initiatives, but one, for example, is Safe Harbor.</p><p>So Safe Harbor won't affect us directly, but it is going to affect all of our customers that have deployments in Europe. And our guess is that more and more companies, because of the privacy laws now, will probably end up putting more local instances in Europe to protect the privacy of data in some of these facilities, which is going to cause them to put more server infrastructure and storage arrays to do that. That goes in data centers, so we'll probably -- our thesis is we will probably benefit from that, as we did with other trends like that, like regulation in the electronic trading space. When the flash traders and the high-frequency traders got regulated, it caused them to put more server infrastructure in. That went into our facilities and we ended up benefiting.</p><p>The 10-gig to 100-gig transition with moving traffic around the world, we made that transition years ago when we went from 1 gig to 10 gig. We will manage the same thing when we go from 10 gig to 100 gig. It will probably -- there will be some grooming of crossconnects when people take advantage of this.</p><p>We told you on the last earnings call that we are starting to see 100-gig switching be deployed. It is going to take a while for the peering architectures to absorb that and catch up with it, but the architecture's jumped from 10 to 100 gig now and we're starting to see 100-gig traffic.</p><p>And the number one thing, as I said earlier, that drives this Company's business is one word, traffic, so the more traffic we see, the faster we grow, and the more interconnected it is, the higher the margins.</p><p>So, we like this. Yes, there will be some management required, but I think we will manage through it, just like we did going from 1 gig to 10 gig, so those are two I am thinking of.</p><p>There is another thing that is coming up. A lot of you are asking us about Flash storage. Is that going to affect your business? I think that technology shift is happening and I think it will be along the lines of the virtualization phenomenon.</p><p>MICHAEL ROLLINS: And as you look at your other core segments, so we spent a lot of time on cloud and enterprise today, but you have got financials, you have got networks. Are you seeing anything trend-wise that is noteworthy, whether it is acceleration or deceleration, in those other segments?</p><p>STEVE SMITH: It is predominantly -- we are very fortunate that all of these segments are continuing to grow with us, but as I said earlier, they're all also chasing the great old enterprise. And so, networks are upgrading their traffic -- or their switch fabrics. Digital media is trying to push more content around the world to answer all this Big Data and Internet of Things activity that we are benefiting from it because the installed base is still growing with us.</p><p>I remember when we decided to point the Equinix machine at the enterprise four or five years ago, and everybody started asking us, well, does that mean the networks and the digital media companies and the financial services are slowing down? No, but we didn't really know what was going to happen and then cloud showed up.</p><p>So we are very fortunate that the core verticals are continuing to grow because they are chasing the same thing we are. But we just know that when you have 350,000 enterprises in the world that are over $10 million in sales and have at least 500 people, that's a prospect. And when you see the whole world going more and more digital and more and more interconnected, you see the opportunity to go help them do that.</p><p>And the simple equation is they can take advantage of the network variety that we have and density that we have in these facilities, and the cloud variety, to get to the multi-cloud hybrid cloud environment that is the current paradigm shift in computing, and that is at the heart of our thesis.</p><p>MICHAEL ROLLINS: What are the key markets for you there on your radar for geographic expansion?</p><p>STEVE SMITH: China is at the top of that list right now. We've put our toe into Shanghai and there is -- even with all the noise in China today, there is a huge opportunity for us to partner up to get the licenses we need to go further into the Chinese market. Obviously, the next major step would be Beijing. So we are working very hard on that. It requires a partner and so there is more to come there.</p><p>India has always been on our radar, but it is a very tough place to -- you have to pick the right partner to get in there and we just haven't made that happen, but that will remain on the radar screen. South Africa is starting to see a fair amount of demand. I could see us in that market over time. South Korea is always on the radar screen.</p><p>The Americas were pretty much done, I would say. There might be opportunity in Latin America to go deeper beyond Brazil. Someday Russia may settle down and clear up. That's a big -- that's like Brazil and China, and so India and Russia will remain on the radar screen.</p><p>Those are the kind of top-of-mind places, Mike, that we stare at, but it is all going to be driven by customer demand that would pull us there, and we would go in with a big player or two before we would ever invest in one of those big markets.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>MICHAEL ROLLINS: Just a reminder if you have a question, just hit the button on your microphone.</p><p>So, and then just, lastly, has the ship sailed on wholesale/retail for you under one roof or is that still something that you expect to dabble further into?</p><p>STEVE SMITH: Has the ship sailed? I think if -- the possibility of putting together the biggest wholesaler and the biggest retailer probably got pushed sideways when the Telex acquisition was completed, just because of the US regulator point of view on that ever being able to -- you could divest, I guess, to make that happen.</p><p>But we are not spending any time thinking about how to move into wholesale. It is a different business model, services a different part of the customer architecture. I personally think both are going to continue to perform very well.</p><p>Our relationship with Digital continues to be good. It is more complex now, but we are in many of their facilities, so we need to maintain a relationship there. We're building more hybrid facilities in our new assets, so we learned a lot from this business suite product that we built in the DC area. And so, we are not building any more pure business suites, but we are building more hybrid facilities in some of our new locations to handle these larger footprints of these cloud magnetic deployments that we expect to still come in in the coming years, because we understand the benefit of having a magnetic engine that could be 0.5 megawatt, 1 megawatt.</p><p>So there are still larger deals, but far and few between, but we will accommodate those and we're building to accommodate those.</p><p>MICHAEL ROLLINS: Great. Thanks for the insights and your time today. Thanks very much.</p><p>STEVE SMITH: Thanks, Mike.

But stock markets aren't what they used to be. Returns are generally flat these days, even negative \u2013 and even on their best days, stock markets return just a fraction of what the \"real\" investors in a company make.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">That's bad for investors \u2013 and for society. The middle class in countries around the world, and especially the United States, is being squeezed not only by a lack of employment opportunities, but a lack of investment opportunities. Where in the past stock market investors had an opportunity to realized significant returns from stock investments, that has changed radically over the past decade \u2013 closing off yet another income-earning channel for the middle class, contributing to its erosion, and to ever-increasing income disparities between the top and bottom, many experts say.</p><p>But there's a new investment vehicle in town \u2013 one that promises to democratize investing, in the sense that it distributes the proceeds of successful companies much farther and wider than traditional investment vehicles. \"Equity crowdfunding is finally going mainstream,\" according to Jon Medved, the CEO of OurCrowd, the Israeli investment firm that invented crowdfunding as the world knows it today. \"Done right, it works. And it is changing the landscape of investing. Ordinary people with only tens of thousands of dollars to invest now have the same opportunities for major returns that were exclusively reserved for well-heeled venture and angel investors.\"</p><p>Call it the democratization of venture capital, said Medved at a press event announcing outlining a report on the firm's 2015 activity. \"For the first time, ordinary people with $10,000 to $150,000 to invest have a shot at the enormous potential riches from investing in private companies. Crowdfunding is a way for millions of ordinary investors to get into the game and to realize some of those outsized returns from private companies. This new way is called equity crowdfunding. It promises to democratize the world of innovation finance and create a new model for building companies.\"</p><p>That crowdfunding is the new way to get rich is evident in the numbers, Medved said. \"Venture capital and merger/acquisition activity was great in 2015, and crowdfunding, OurCrowd's specialty, 'arrived' last year as well. That's in contrast to investments in public companies, where the returns are much less, if not stagnant.\"</p><p>Medved is talking not about \"regular returns\" from investments \u2013 on average, blue chip stocks have provide a ten percent return annually over the past several decades, taking into account the ups and downs of the market \u2013 but about the \"killer\" investments, the ones that in the past could make a stockholder rich, if the investor \"got in\" early enough. If you bought Apple stock in 1980 and held on to it, for example, you would 400 times your investment today; if you got in on the Amazon IPO when it was first issued in 1997, you would have about 350x your initial investment now.</p><p>Those companies received financing not only on public exchanges, but also from private equity investors \u2013 the venture capitalists who put up X amount of money in exchange for a portion of the profits, if not the company itself. The VCs who invested in Apple saw their money grow 600 times since 1980; for Amazon it was 200 times. In some tech companies, like Oracle, the returns were much better for stock market investors than private equity investors (350x vs 50x). As long as average investors could get in on the party as well, everything worked out fine for everyone.</p><p>A changing equation</p><p>But in recent years that equation has changed dramatically. Almost all the returns for big tech companies that went public after 2000 \u2013 including Google (2004), Facebook (2012), and Twitter (2013) \u2013 have accrued to private equity investors. \"IPOs are messy, because you have to comply with a lot of regulations and issue public reports and the like,\" said Medved. \"If you can raise $60 billion without going public \u2013 that's the current valuation of Uber \u2013 then why would you want to go public? There are currently about 140 billion dollar-plus valuated tech companies that are still not public \u2013 and all the value those companies create are going to private investors.\"</p><p>And that group is an extremely limited one. Only an estimated 300,000 people have made at least one angel investment in the last two years in the US, according to the report. \"That's a tiny number compared to the more than 130 million Americans who own stocks, or the estimated 10 million American accredited households with more than $1 million of investable assets, or $200,000 in annual income,\" Medved said.</p><p>\"Suddenly, the estimated 130 million ordinary Americans who buy stocks and bonds (and scores of millions more around the world) have been shut out of the greatest current opportunity for building wealth. Instead, the gains are going only to a few thousand people who are rich and well connected enough to be private investors,\" he said.</p><p>Enter crowdfunding, the system whereby investors pool resources to reach the sum a start-up or more mature firm is seeking in a funding round. A crowdfunding platform essentially creates a venture capital fund with not just a few rich members' money, but with funds supplied by hundreds or thousands of individuals.</p><p>Breakdown of returns in capital market (gray) vs. private equity (orange) tech investments in recent years (OurCrowd/Xconomy)</p><p>Recent rule changes in the US and other countries allow accredited investors (who have at least a specific minimum net worth) to join a fund that lets them invest relatively modest sums in promising tech companies, instead of the millions of dollars that angels or venture capital funds invest in tech companies. While there was some debate in the US Securities and Exchange Commission about whether crowdfunding was a viable investment method \u2013 or a safe one, given that shysters could pose as entrepreneurs and relieve widows, orphans, and other vulnerable investors of their life savings \u2013 the numbers prove the case for crowdfunding, according to Medved.</p><p>As the Start-Up Nation, Israel has played an important role in building the world's tech economy \u2013 and a crucial role in developing crowdfunding as a way for ordinary investors to get in on the VC money-making party. Medved's OurCrowd was one of the first crowdfunding platforms in the world, established in 2012 just after the SEC in the US implemented rules allowing it.</p><p>In just two years, OurCrowd has invested over $200 million from accredited investors in 91 Israeli tech firms, \"making us one of the largest investors in the Israeli tech ecosystem and one of the largest equity crowdfunding platforms globally. We are driving the democratization of venture capital, opening the door to tens of thousands of accredited investors who want to invest in the next generation of tech leaders,\" said Medved.</p><p>That democratization offers a way for those ordinary Americans \u2013 and ordinary people around the world \u2013 to benefit from the enormous profits generated by investments in tech firms, said Medved. \" \"We are still in the very early days of equity crowdfunding. While we are excited by the rapid progress to date, I think most of us are still unaware just how big this opportunity can ultimately become. I think we will all be surprised by the eventual size, importance and acceptance of equity crowdfunding. As access to capital is flattened around the globe, as deal flow is democratized, and as huge amounts of new money flow to great entrepreneurial companies,I think equity crowdfunding will take its rightful place as the fourth pillar of innovation finance \u2014joining together with corporate finance, venture capital, and angel investment.\"</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://imgs.syndigate.info/588/1673/53/145312880878.jpg\">http://imgs.syndigate.info/588/1673/53/145312880878.jpg</url></p><p>Crowdfunding guru Jon Medved (photo credit: Courtesy)<br/></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://imgs.syndigate.info/588/1673/16/145312880889.jpg\">http://imgs.syndigate.info/588/1673/16/145312880889.jpg</url></p><p>David Shamah<br/></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://imgs.syndigate.info/588/1673/22/145312880897.jpg\">http://imgs.syndigate.info/588/1673/22/145312880897.jpg</url></p><p>Breakdown of returns in capital market (gray) vs. private equity (orange) tech investments in recent years (OurCrowd/Xconomy)<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TIMISR-64631651</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TIMISR2016</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5HWD-4H41-JDJN-628R-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">428572</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2016-08-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1393\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2016 The Times of Israel.

This is a process that has only just begun.\"</p><p>The news is worrying for executives at Nasdaq and NYSE Euronext, owners of the New York Stock Exchange. At the end of 2011, 174 Chinese stocks were listed in the US, represented by the USX China Index. This roster includes internet firms NetEase and Sohu, and search website Baidu, all of which turned their founders into overnight billionaires after New York listings.</p><p>Yet some US investors might not miss an outflow of China stocks. Jialong Shi, a tech analyst at CLSA in Hong Kong, says US investors, burnt by profits warnings and ropey governance, \"tend to price in a discount on Chinese companies\".</p><p>Statistics appear to bear this out. The USX China Index is trading at around 12 times earnings, compared with 20 times for Hong Kong's Hang Seng Composite Information Technology Index.</p><p>And looking at the valuations of single stocks, Perfect World, China's fourth-largest online gaming firm, trades at around 4.5 times its estimated earnings in New York, while its smaller rival, NetDragon Websoft, is trading at just shy of 60 times earnings in Hong Kong. Such valuations, analysts says, give tech firms greater impetus to relocate back home.</p><p>Many believe a trickle from west to east could become a flood. And it's not just tech firms seeking to return home. Sixteen mainland corporates have announced plans to delist from the US since 2010, including Funtalk China Holdings, which delisted from the NYSE in August, and property data provider China Real Estate Information. Funtalk's senior vice-president, Francis Wan, subsequently refused to rule out a relisting in Shanghai or Hong Kong.</p><p>Analysts highlight several Chinese tech firms frustrated by their own rock-bottom valuations. \"I'd look at [online game developers] Changyou and Giant Interactive Group,\" says one Hong Kong-based analyst, who declined to be named. \"Those are the [type of] companies that would benefit from [relisting in] China.\"</p><p>Another points to Ninetowns Internet Technology, an online provider of international trade solutions. Changyou, as of February 21, was trading at 5.5 times estimated earnings, with Giant trading at 7.1 times and Ninetowns at just shy of 13 times.</p><p>Most mainland firms depart the scene quietly and with a modicum of grace, but not all. Harbin Electric chief executive Yang Tianfu, after delisting his firm from the NYSE in November, said he was \"tired of the US\", and he could \"easily\" complete a listing in Shanghai or Hong Kong. US short-sellers, including Citron Research, had alleged the firm was being run fraudulently; Yang, in turn, complained he \"couldn't communicate with investors\".</p><p>Not all corporates will simply swap one stock market for another. Shanda Interactive, for instance, is likely to follow a more nuanced route. Since Beijing bans Chinese firms from having dual mainland listings at group and subsidiary level, Shanda Interactive co-founder Chen Tianqiao is expected to pursue the listing of one or more of his subsidiaries.</p><p>This could include web-based gaming firm Aurora, or Cloudary, an online literary platform, which has flirted with its own New York listing. (Shanda Interactive also owns 72% of another Nasdaq-listed subsidiary, Shanda Games.) This, notes CLSA's Shi, will leave Chen free to complete a mainland listing of Shanda Interactive at a later date.</p><p>Either way, this is a process that has just started. When 87.3% of Shanda Interactive's shareholders voted on February 16 to escape from New York, one era ended and another began.</p><p>Chinese entrepreneurs might still list shares in New York, to keep their fortunes far from Beijing's prying eyes, but the Big Apple is no longer the promised land it once was.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EUROMO-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EUROMO2012</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:558Y-XNG1-JD35-239K-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">318063</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"950\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2012 Euromoney Institutional Investor PLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Euromoney</publicationName><publicationDate month=\"03\" year=\"2012\"><dateText>March 2012</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>CC00027NH</classCode><className>JPMORGAN CHASE &amp;

I'm Jeff Spector. I'm here with my colleague, Shirley Wu. And this is webcast. And speaking for Equity Residential today is Mark Parrell. Mark is President and CEO.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Mark, if you don't mind providing maybe 5-plus minutes of comments about the company. It's a broad group of investors. So some people are familiar with the company. Some people may not be as familiar.</p><p>And then we'll be happy to get into Q&amp;A. We'd like to make this as interactive as possible. So if you have a question, feel free to raise your hand, and Shirley and I will choose on you to ask the question. Otherwise, Shirley and I will moderate.</p><p>With that, Mark, please go ahead.</p><p>MARK J. PARRELL, PRESIDENT, CEO &amp; TRUSTEE, EQUITY RESIDENTIAL: Right. Well, first, thanks to our friends at BofA, Jeff and Shirley, for including us in this event. I'm Mark Parrell, the CEO. Just a little briefer, primer on Equity Residential.</p><p>So we own 80,000 apartments throughout the United States. Those apartments are in Boston, New York, Washington, D.C., Southern California, San Francisco, Seattle and an emerging presence in Denver. We tend own apartments that are predominantly urban, so in the dense centers of cities that differentiates us from some of our competitors and dense suburban areas. So we'll be in both of those areas in cities, and we're looking for a high-quality customer.</p><p>Our average rent is about $2,800 a month. Our average household income of our resident is $122,000 a month. They pay us about 21% of their income in rent. So they're a very affluent subsector to be tied to. They have been getting raises. They've been doing well as customers. We talk a lot about customer quality at Equity Residential.</p><p>We also have a development presence. We have development projects particularly in Boston, a few things in California and Seattle going on. We've made that presence smaller over time. We're probably 2% of our capital in development now. But we have developed more in the past. As prices of construction went up and as rents grew less quickly, that put us in a position where we didn't think that was an advantageous place to invest our capital.</p><p>We've been putting money into things like renovations throughout the portfolio. So we put about $50 million a year into the portfolio in terms of kitchen and bath redos and things like that. We find it's terrific returns on that, 10% to 15% cash-on-cash returns. We also do that to keep competitive with some of the new supply in our markets.</p><p>We've also, I think, benefited greatly from the continuing very strong demand across our markets. So right now, we are 96.5% occupied. We were 96.4% occupied this week last year. So we said on the earnings call 6 weeks ago that if in this period of time because we're heading as a seasonal business towards the end of the year, our transaction volume goes down. People are less likely to move in the fourth quarter and the first quarter than the second and third. So there's just less activity. But as we head into this time of the year, we try to hold occupancy and we indeed are holding occupancy.</p><p>We're seeing good demand across the whole system. Supply pressure, particularly in New York, is considerably less. We do see supply pressure increasing in Los Angeles. We've spoken about that on the call. And we told all of you our numbers in Los Angeles will be lower in the second half of the year than the first. But we're holding in there. New lease rates in New York -- in Los Angeles are flat. But occupancy is great at 96.8%, and we feel good about that market at this point.</p><p>Talking a little bit about investments. There have been some interesting shifts in the last couple of months. As rates have declined significantly as they've declined, as people's interest in hard assets has increased, we have seen a decline in cap rates across all our markets. I'm going to put New York aside for a moment, and I'll talk about that in a moment. But across our other 6 markets, we see that because there's just more people in the auction tent. There's more folks that want to own our kind of high-quality product as well as the value-add stuff that we want to sell.</p><p>So we often are sellers of $500 million to $1 billion or so of our assets a year, just stuff that's become obsolete. And I'll tell you, the value-add bid is extremely strong for that product right now. And our ability to recycle that into better, newer assets is improved. So you should expect to see us sell more and buy more to sort of match over the next couple of years if that pattern continues. The last time these were so close, and by so close, I mean A and B assets in the same market having such close cap rates, was in the '06 to '07 period. That was back in that era that was because of an excess of debt in the system. Now it's just everyone chasing yield.</p><p>So we again believe absolute cap rates have declined. Values have gone up. In our markets in New York, we don't know what's happened. It's post the rent control. So we have not seen meaningful transaction activity in New York on our kinds of assets. So those are $100 million-plus, large, high rises in Manhattan or Brooklyn that are either under the rent stabilization regime or under the -- we have -- about half of our units are not rent controlled at all. So those are market rates. So we just haven't seen a trade. So I can't speak to value here. I have no reason to believe it's gone either direction significantly, but I just don't have an input on that.</p><p>So I'll stop there, Jeff, and throw it back to you, guys.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>JEFFREY ALAN SPECTOR: Thanks, Mark. Maybe at a high level, I'm not sure if you -- how long have you been in the CoC now? A year plus?</p><p>MARK J. PARRELL: It feels like that. It's been 9 months.</p><p>JEFFREY ALAN SPECTOR: 9 months. So I saw Martin in Chicago recently, and he said it's the old team but the new -- new team but the old team. I guess first, just how are you enjoying the role? Was there any strategy shift or anything that you and the Board are thinking about now that you've been in the role, let's say, for 9 months? And how is the new -- how is the team running?</p><p>MARK J. PARRELL: Great. So I've been at the company 20 years. I was the CFO for the 11 years preceding, getting this role in January of this year. So the strategy is ours. The whole executive team owned it together, this urban, dense, suburban strategy. So prior to taking the job, I did spend some time doing a strategy review. We've typically done that with new CEOs and really looked hard at the portfolio. But again, I wouldn't suggest there is any big changes because I'm a product of the system.</p><p>I believe in the strategy of owning dense urban and dense suburban product, of having high-wage renters, of not having concerns about things like people buying single-family homes. Very few of our folks move out to buy single-family homes. Our capital spending -- so an important thing for you journalists in the room to think about is CapEx.</p><p>So what does it cost a company like ours to maintain their assets as is and have them be attractive to renters? And for us, that's about 8% or 1 month's rent per year. For all our competitors except one, who owns a portfolio similar to ours, that number is twice as high. So they have -- because they own suburban product, they have a lot more capital maintenance requirements. Refrigerators cost the same, whether you're putting them in a unit that is getting $3,000 a month rent or whether it's getting to $1,200 a month rent.</p><p>So we have a real advantage in owning the portfolio we own because we don't suffer from competition from single-family housing to the same extent, because we have lower capital cost, because we think our markets are more vibrant. Places like New York do get a lot of supply on occasion, but they work through it so rapidly. So I'm very enthused about the strategy, Jeff. I remain completely committed to it and having looked at it, I think, with a pretty critical eye last year.</p><p>JEFFREY ALAN SPECTOR: And so from just one follow-up and then I'll take the question from the audience. So the current footprint, as you mentioned in your opening remarks, you mentioned your existing cities plus emerging market, Denver, happy with the footprint and thinking about that in terms of recession. We can ask a lot about recession scenarios, As versus Bs, coastal versus Sunbelt, again, where the portfolio is today. Are you happy with that footprint?</p><p>MARK J. PARRELL: Sure. So there's a couple of different questions in there. So maybe to talk just about where we've allocated our capital. So I think you should expect and you've seen us already move our capital a little bit within markets. So for example, in the Washington, D.C. area, we bought an asset in Rockville, Maryland. So that is a close-in suburban location. The average household income there was about $110,000. The average income in our portfolio is about $120,000. So it's a good fit. Those are folks that drive to their jobs, probably the National Institutes of Health and that cluster of biotech jobs that surrounds it in Bethesda.</p><p>So those are good residents for us. So you'll see us be in there, not just to be in the District of Columbia but to be in some of these suburbs that have similar customer characteristics. But we're not interested in being in the further out suburbs. We're either taking a lower-quality customer or a customer that's going to be very attracted to a single-family housing lifestyle.</p><p>So you'll see us do that a little bit of a rotation in the system. We bought a couple of suburban assets in Denver as well as the 4 urban assets we have. So again, a little bit more balanced between dense suburban and urban. We're about 25%, 35% suburban already. So it's just a little bit of a shift there within the markets and to be a little less concentrated in some places like Northwest D.C. and the Upper West Side of New York, where we just had a big concentration. We'd stay in other urban submarkets, but we'll just spread out a little bit more.</p><p>In between the markets, we're about 1% of our NOI in Denver. I'd like to see that number and the Board would to be more in 4% and 5% range. That will happen over time. I think some of that capital will come from a variety of markets. We have older assets again to sell. You may see our total exposure to Washington, D.C. decline a little over time. That's been a market that's been very supplied and will continue to be very supplied, we think. It does have pretty good results at the current time. So I think those are the sort of things that the group has been thinking about in the last year or so.</p><p>JEFFREY ALAN SPECTOR: Thank you. I think we have a question over here.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: Yes. Just on the comment regarding your client cap rates. Just the magnitude of what you're seeing cap rates decline and over what time period are we talking about. Are you talking about as recent as past 2 months? Is it something that's been occurring throughout the year?</p><p>MARK J. PARRELL: I'd say since the big shift down in rates, so call it the last 2 months. I mean -- and again, you're doing smaller sample sizes, right? I mean I'm giving you a feel for what we're seeing. We see product pricing. And there's a lot for sale right now. A lot of merchant builders who started building 5, 6, 7 years ago, they have funded deadlines so they need to sell. Or frankly, they just look at the conditions and the price and they want to sell.</p><p>So there's a lot of product out there to be bought. And so we see that Denver, we see significant cap rate declines. We've seen in some of the other markets as well. And then in the New York again, we just don't have a sample to speak to.</p><p>SHIRLEY WU, RESEARCH ANALYST, BOFAMERRILL LYNCH, RESEARCH DIVISION: Great. So now moving on to some of your markets. You mentioned this a little bit earlier where you're talking about L.A. But could you highlight some markets that are doing a little bit better than expected, worse than expected, call it, through this peak, end of this peak leasing season? And San Diego is doing a little bit worse. How do you see some of those markets performing into, let's say, 2020?</p><p>MARK J. PARRELL: Well, I'm just a bit hesitant. I think a lot of that color belongs to the earnings call. I appreciate the question though. I will say again, we feel terrific about demand across the portfolio and the physical occupancy we have. We talked a little bit on the call about L.A. I gave you a little bit of color on L.A., which is a market we just keep an eye on. So I guess I'm going to kind of demur on that question, if I could. Nice try.</p><p>SHIRLEY WU: Okay. I got to try. I think we have a question in the back.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: I may be dating myself or I may be wrong, but didn't EQR exit Denver in [2016]? And if so, why is it now back in Denver?</p><p>MARK J. PARRELL: Great. So the question was did EQR own Denver before and why did it exit it and why are we back more or less, right? So we did exit it. We sold it to the Starwood organization as part of a big sale in 2016. We own almost entirely garden product at that point. So all of what we owned in Denver effectively was older garden product. So we always like Denver. And at that time, we said it was a portfolio, not a market exit. So we've actually owned Denver since the IPO in 1993 all the way through January of 2016. We sold the portfolio to Starwood. And we said we'd go back and we just look for an opportunity to go back. So we like everything about Denver.</p><p>So again, just to check that list, good, high-wage job growth and a good number of high-wage jobs to begin with, relatively high single-family housing costs, barriers to entry into the market in terms of construction. That's really in the form in Denver being an expensive -- a more expensive place to build over time. Denver has a lot of new supply. I mean they need to build out their downtown, and we'll feel that competition. But we underwrote the deals with relatively low near-term rent growth, and we're doing well in Denver. We're very happy with the 6 assets that we own. So yes, good memory.</p><p>JEFFREY ALAN SPECTOR: Maybe we can focus on demand year-to-date. As you said, it's been a strong year, better than a lot of people expected. Can you talk about your current renter a little bit more, the profile and then what you might see from next 5 years plus, let's say, on how that renter may change? And who's coming in and out of the portfolio?</p><p>MARK J. PARRELL: That's a great question. Most important thing we think in our business is demand. That's likely unsolvable problem. Supply comes and goes. But if you don't have demand, then you don't have a place you want to invest your capital, we think. So we look at our -- as part of this, again, transition in just our periodic process of looking at the strategy, we did some additional demographic research. So our average resident is 33 years old. The average -- the biggest cohort of baby -- excuse me, millennials is 28. So we have tailwinds still. We have more people entering the pool of people that will want to rent with us.</p><p>We also have done a lot of research, and a lot of folks that end up leaving apartment living do so because they've had their second child. And if you look at the age at which people get married and the age at which college-age women tend to have children, those are all increasing. We think the period of time from when people graduate from college to when they have their second child is an increasing period of time. So we both think we have more customers and we have them for longer as we go forward, Jeff.</p><p>So as we think about our demographic, we're very excited. We think this group of people and the attractiveness in our markets -- of our markets to college graduates, to young people, to just everyone of every age group who's interested in living in these exciting cities with these great-paying jobs and these good careers mean it's just a real magnet. And we still see great demand.</p><p>JEFFREY ALAN SPECTOR: And maybe one follow-up on the markets in Denver. I guess is the common thread tech? Is that what's driving this? And are there other tech markets that you're excited about? Or again, these are the markets you're most focused on?</p><p>MARK J. PARRELL: Well, we're looking for high-wage job growth. We don't necessarily chase the tech folks around. A lot of our high-wage job growth in this country has been tech, right? But we do look for that growth in the areas in here in New York, new media. Certainly, we love the biotech cluster up in Cambridge, which I think when you talk about tech, you need to be careful because it's not like the auto industry. The auto industry, and I lived in Detroit, is one thing. And there's not a way that all of it can thrive and it kind of all moves together so to speak. Tech is so large that the social media part of it, I would argue, could do poorly. But the biotech clusters in South San Francisco, San Diego and Cambridge can do great or vice versa.</p><p>So we don't worry about being tied to tech as much as one company. Being tied to a single employer in a market is concerning. So to be in a city where it was just all about one company, that would be concerning to us. But when you look at New York, for example, the financial services bust was certainly significant. But because of the built-in advantages here of having a great university system, a great quality of life, a great attractiveness to this demographic, this city has repopulated itself.</p><p>Financial services, less relevant. Technology and new media, more relevant. Our markets have those characteristics. So if Amazon isn't big in Seattle anymore, somebody else will be. And Microsoft waxed and waned and Boeing waxed and waned and Seattle kept growing. So those are the kind of markets we want to be in.</p><p>SHIRLEY WU: So why don't we talk a little bit about policy? So rent regulation is becoming such a significant issue around the country, with first New York but now more conversations around California with AB-1482. So could you give us a little bit more color on what's happening in California and maybe some of the new dialogues that's happening in New York as well and maybe even a little bit on the [rent stabilization] act of New York City?</p><p>MARK J. PARRELL: Sure. So just that comment on New York because again, I know some of you have listened to all our calls and some of you don't. So we have 9,500 units in the New York metro area. Of those 9,500, 3,000 are outside the city of New York, so not subject to this conversation. They're mostly in North New Jersey. Of the 6,500 that remain, 3,500 of those units are rent-stabilized and 3,000 are market rate. The market rate units have no controls on them from this law effectively, and we can continue to price them as we see fit. For the 3,500 units, there are new rules about renewals.</p><p>And to sum it all up basically, we were charging 4% to 4.5% for renewals, and now we're charging about 3.5% for renewals. The total impact on us of that change over an entire year is something on the order of 20 or 30 basis points for New York and something on the order of 4 basis points negative for the whole portfolio. So not a particularly material impact to the company.</p><p>I would also point out that this is bad policy. This is a bad idea for New York even though it didn't hurt us at that much. It's going to restrict the amount of supply. And because it's going to restrict the amount of supply by deterring people from building because of these rent regulations, those market rate units we own -- and by the way, the 3,500 that I told you were rent-stabilized, every year, certain restrictions expire and they move into the market rate pool. So those 3,000 market-rate units will get bigger by about 150 to 200 units a year every year for us through 2028.</p><p>So as I said on the call, I'm excited about New York's demand, and you heard me speak of it. But I'm really excited about the supply constraint that this rule -- these new rules create because the incentive to build in New York has been diminished, and so we're going to have a little lower renewal growth for a while. But I wonder if we're not going to do pretty good on these market rate units. I also wonder about what our leasing and advertising and turnover costs are going to be because our properties are going to have longer stays. So if I give you a smaller renewal increase, you'll stay at the property longer. So my retention will increase. So my advertising cost will go down. And the turnover cost every time someone leaves, we incur 21 days or so on average of vacancy. We have to clean the unit. Those will go down, too.</p><p>So we haven't seen much of an impact from the New York rules. But again, I think it's a bad idea. And I think the city and the state will see that. And I think some policymakers have already made comments to that effect.</p><p>California is voting today. So switching to the state of California. The state Senate is voting right now on AB-1482, which is the rent control Bill in the state of California. It provides for a CPI plus 5% cap on renewals, CPI as defined by the local area CPI. So for places like San Francisco, that number is often 3%, not the 1% to 2% we think of as national CPI. But in any of that, that's probably creating a 7% to 8% cap on renewals in California. It doesn't do anything to new leases.</p><p>So it doesn't -- it allows vacancy the control. It provides certain additional eviction protections, just cause eviction protections for residents. It sunsets in 10 years. It has a 15-year new construction exemption where properties 15 years or younger aren't subject to any of these rules. And it also importantly prevents local regulation. So it preserves Costa-Hawkins, which is the existing state law, and prevents local regulation of housing.</p><p>So that's great. So that laws come down. As an industry, we think rent regulation is a bad idea. We think these bill is a bad idea. But we decided through the California Apartment Association, which is the industry organ on these matters, not to oppose it. So I will tell you again, I think it will restrict the number of units built on the market. I think Governor Newsom has pushed hard for more production. I think this will lead to less. But I'll also say that for us and for some of our other competitors that I think operate within the rules now, it's not likely to be all that significant, but we have to see what the Legislature passes. If it passes the Senate, it has to go back to the Assembly. The Governor has said he would sign it.</p><p>So I'm not sure if it will get done and in what manner exactly. But again, we feel like the quality of the conversation in California has been great. Tenant advocates have been in there. The industry has been in there. And the New York deal was cut in the dark at night. There were mistakes in the statutes. It's hard to understand. It's very, very complicated.</p><p>So you asked, I think, Shirley, about just administering in New York. Administering New York is a full-time job. But in California, we feel like it's been a much more open and public conversation and that the law is likely to make a lot more sense. But we'll see what actually comes out.</p><p>SHIRLEY WU: I know it's only been like 2 months now. But have you seen any marginal changes in, let's say, consumer behavior in New York, so maybe like lower turnover? Are you seeing that in the consumer?</p><p>MARK J. PARRELL: Too early. Yes, it's too early.</p><p>JEFFREY ALAN SPECTOR: Can you explain -- I think the key difference you were saying between California and New York, California, I think you said that 15 years, new construction excluded versus -- are we saying -- you're saying in New York, I think New York would be the most impacted by less incentives to build because in New York, there is no carve-out?</p><p>MARK J. PARRELL: So in -- I'm sorry, in New York, to really build in New York, it's very hard because you're competing against hospitality. We used to compete against condo as well. To get land is difficult in New York. So most people use the old 421a, now called Affordable New York Program. The Affordable New York Program is a good program but not as good as 421a from a developer point of view. So it hasn't encouraged as much construction already. These rules that are going to cover these limitations on renewals are more problematic. They create another reason not to do Affordable New York. And that, in our opinion, will reduce supply even more. It also does create regulatory uncertainty in the market. That's also bad for capital allocation.</p><p>JEFFREY ALAN SPECTOR: And then just to clarify to make sure everyone understands, in California, if this does pass, then this is it, local municipalities will follow it? It's a state law, at least it seems like you would be done for the next 10 years?</p><p>MARK J. PARRELL: From your lips to God's ears, so what I'd say is what's going to happen next is if the law passes and it's not in any way, shape or form assured, there was a proposition on the ballot in California called Proposition 10 in June of -- excuse me, November of 2018. That was a proposal that would have allowed local regulation and a lot of other things that we thought, as an industry, were really bad for California. It's really going to be an impediment to affordability and certainly bad for our industry, and we fought it. And we spoke to policymakers. We spoke to the public. And we won that battle by 20 percentage points.</p><p>So the people in the state of California resoundingly rejected Proposition 10. Every single county except San Francisco County voted against it. That proposal, a variant of it, is likely to be on the ballot again in November 2020. And I can assure you, the industry will oppose it just as vigorously as it opposed it the last time because it's just plain a bad idea.</p><p>It's going to reduce again the amount of housing that's built. It's going to lower the quality of the housing that exists in this market. And if Governor Newsom was a 3 million units built, I guarantee you that's going to cause that not to be the case. So we're hopeful we can have that conversation again with the public and the policymakers, but it's going to be at least a 2-step process.</p><p>JEFFREY ALAN SPECTOR: And if there are these limits, I guess, in place, is there any investment opportunity for a public REIT or EQR to get involved in something like this where I guess from an ESG standpoint, it's a nice check the box but also, of course, from an investment return standpoint?</p><p>MARK J. PARRELL: So by that, you mean in the conversations with policymakers?</p><p>JEFFREY ALAN SPECTOR: No, but like if there is a limit on new affordable, is there anything out there you're seeing as an opportunity for EQR to get involved in from a return standpoint?</p><p>MARK J. PARRELL: So again, we have 80,000 units. About 3,000 of them are affordable. I mean we have properties here in New York where the prevailing rents are $3,700 a month on a unit and the affordable rent is $700. So I mean we're trying to be constructive in this process. I think when you create programs like Affordable New York and do it right in the 421a program, when you do zoning reform like New York did with Long Island City, we will respond to incentives. And the private sector, I think, should be mobilized by the government to build more units.</p><p>That's the answer to a lack of affordable housing. It doesn't reducing the price. It's encouraging a supply. So I guess I'd answer it by saying we've got to be in the dialogue. I mean if we all put our money together, all the public REITs, and created $1 billion fund to build housing, that's just not that many units in any one of our markets.</p><p>I don't know what any one entity can do to change things. I think it's the government changing some of the rules. And again, that relates to zoning, regulatory costs, incentives to build new housing. That's where the action is on the public policy side. For us, to do some of those things are great. We already do them, and we're very active philanthropically in our markets, but that's a hard way to move the needle.</p><p>JEFFREY ALAN SPECTOR: Okay. Maybe we could turn to supply. In latest marketing meetings, that's been the hot question. Our data source has changed. So even ourselves, we're trying to get through the answer for supply for 2020. Can you comment on 2020 at this point?</p><p>MARK J. PARRELL: Yes. So in our investor materials, which are on our website, we talk about supply by markets. So just a word about our process because there's so many different data sources. I should be clear about this. So in every market, we draw boundaries.</p><p>So for example, in New York, we look at where our residents move because we see their forwarding addresses, and we try to figure out what the competitive set is. And for us, that's all of Manhattan, that's Long Island City, other parts of Queens, almost -- a good part of Brooklyn, North New Jersey, but not places like Westchester County, Central New Jersey or Connecticut where we don't have material operations and where we don't see our residents moving. That doesn't compete with us in our opinion.</p><p>So then we look at those areas. And we have people on the ground in every market, and they drive market or subway the market and look around and see what's for sale -- or what's being built, pardon me. And we keep track of all of that. We then check it against one of the big recognized data sources, and that's our number.</p><p>So we see the number next year lower in 2020, New York considerably so, Los Angeles considerably so. We think Boston will be up year-over-year and will be more in the center of Boston. So that will be more impactful to us because we have a lot of properties in the center of Boston. We see D.C. is about the same. So in our footprint, about 12,000 units again. So D.C. is just a market that just as consistently had pretty high supply. Seattle, about the same, though again a little bit more in the central district, business district, less in the suburbs. And you may feel it a little bit in Seattle. San Francisco, about the same. And again, that's such an underhoused market. We won't feel it. Lower in L.A., lower in Orange County, lower in San Diego. So we like the supply picture go into next year. And I think Los Angeles, as I told you, is going to feel it at the end of this year. But you'll start feeling better about it because the supply will abate next year.</p><p>JEFFREY ALAN SPECTOR: That supply pressure, does it continue into '20? Or in New York and L.A., is it enough of a -- it was a big decrease, I know, in New York this year. It sounds like even lower next year. L.A., lower. So for New York at least, does that start to really fade, that supply pressure?</p><p>MARK J. PARRELL: Yes. I mean one of the reasons we like New York is we think supply has been -- by the regulations and just by the cost here to build been really effective and that there'll be less built for a while in the market. So yes.</p><p>JEFFREY ALAN SPECTOR: Okay. Great. One follow-up I had on just thinking about, again, A versus B popular question at the conference and latest meetings has been on recession. I may have asked this earlier, but I don't know if we answered it. I guess how should we think about A rents versus B rents? And a lot of the feedback to us during our meetings is just the thought process that A would get hit the most during a recession. Is that true? I know you're focused on your -- the affluent customer. But technically, I don't know if EQR is charging A rents on average in markets. Or maybe you are.</p><p>MARK J. PARRELL: If the challenge is that we're not charging enough rent, I think we're up for it. So just if the question is like customer kind of quality, durability in a recession...</p><p>JEFFREY ALAN SPECTOR: People -- conceptually, I guess, people think that A rent will get hit the most during a recession. And people will trade down to B. B would be the most resilient.</p><p>MARK J. PARRELL: -</p><p>Well, we can use New York as an example. What typically happens at this point in the cycle is rents in Manhattan are starting to go up. People will start to cycle to New Jersey, and we have some great assets in New Jersey, and they're doing pretty well. When rents go down in these A assets and these A locations, the people in the B properties and the B locations will move to the A assets.</p><p>So if you kept your job and you're happy and you feel secure and you can live somewhere where you couldn't afford to live before, you'll move in. So if my rents come down and crowd the B assets, there's a reason those assets were less preferred than ours. So those people will move out and move to our assets, and the B rents will decline. This is a big interrelated ecosystem. One variable doesn't move without the other.</p><p>So I don't see how it's likely that in the same geography, you can have just A rents damaged and B rents are okay or vice versa really. I think it all kind of goes together. If A rents collapse, they'll collapse on top of B. The B renters will move into A. The B rents will collapse to C. The whole system will move down.</p><p>SHIRLEY WU: So why don't we talk a little bit more generally then on the apartment sector as a whole? What happened last time with the recession and what's different now? And if we were to go into recession now, what could happen?</p><p>MARK J. PARRELL: Yes. I'm going to go out on a limb and say rents will go down if we have a recession. So what's different? The last recession was extreme. I mean they called it the Great Recession for a reason. We've had to 2 pretty extreme recessions lately, right, the big tech bust in the early 2000s and what happened in 2008. So I'd argue those were pretty extreme recessions. A lot of the conversations that we've had have been maybe the next recession is a little more traditional recession, inventory-based or otherwise and not as severe, in which case again, we wouldn't struggle as much.</p><p>But I guess in a recession, our rents will cycle. When you're capitalized like we are, some recessions can provide opportunities. So we bought a lot of good, inexpensive assets, including here in New York, in the height of the recession. So if there's an opportunity to purchase in a recession, our balance sheet with our low leverage, our A rating, A- credit rating, that will give us, Shirley, some ammunition. So again, we don't like going through recessions, but they are points where we have opportunity, and we do look at them in both ways.</p><p>JEFFREY ALAN SPECTOR: Is your technology different today in how you're running the portfolio? So from an operational standpoint, you might be able to do a better job than 10 years ago? Or is it about the same?</p><p>MARK J. PARRELL: No, I think it's better. I think some of the tools haven't changed. We still use, pardon me, LRO, our lease rent optimizing system, which is a revenue management system. So we still use some of these systems that have been around, but we know how to use them better. And we have adjuncts we put on top of them. We know what operating -- we have more experience. Our Chief Operating Officer has been doing it 20 years. He used to run revenue.</p><p>So we just have a lot of experience. So I would hope, Jeff, we do better every one of these experiences both as a company and as an industry because we have more experience with the tools. We're probably with the Internet a little bit more aware of changes in, for example, demand. We can see the number of inquiries for New York apartments versus Los Angeles apartments on the Internet. We have more demand transparency. And if we saw something collapse, we probably see it earlier.</p><p>JEFFREY ALAN SPECTOR: Maybe we can tie that into and conclude on the balance sheet, where it stands today. And we've seen Simon do some long-dated paper at very good rates. Just what are your thoughts at this point?</p><p>MARK J. PARRELL: Yes. Certainly, the reduction in rates presented an opportunity for everyone. So EQR did a 2.5% coupon, 2.5% for 5% yield, which was the lowest yield any REIT has ever done on a 10-year security. So I'm very proud of that. We just saw the opportunity and we took it. It was actually -- we have this debt sitting on our commercial paper facility, and it was cheaper to term it out and to leave it in our commercial paper. So it's actually accretive to term it out than to leave it short term. That tells you how The Street or how the rate market is thinking about short-term rates, right? The rates are going to go down a fair amount. So in any event, we did that.</p><p>The balance sheet is in the best condition it's ever been. I mean we cover our debt service for 4.5x and we got terrific liquidity. I mean if there is -- again, we don't hope for a recession, but our balance sheet is both the shield and the sword. And if an opportunity came to use it, we wouldn't hesitate to use it. We have capacity to issue debt without issuing equity to buy assets if we saw fit to do that. And we wouldn't hesitate again if we saw assets worth buying.</p><p>JEFFREY ALAN SPECTOR: I should have asked. Any concern on GSE reform change or privatization?</p><p>MARK J. PARRELL: Yes. So a lot of news about GSE reform. I don't know how much will actually get done given how close, I guess, we are to the election and the fact that Congress needs to act on most of it. Because we sold most of our assets that were in, for example, suburban Denver that were predominantly financed by the GSEs, we have less risk than most do as it relates to GSEs. When we sell assets in our big markets, we're usually selling them to a cash buyer. So we're not as concerned with our buyer needing to be financed by the GSEs. But I think it behooves the government not to be disruptive in reordering the capital markets in the apartment business because I think they operate pretty effectively and Fannie and Freddie do a pretty good job. But again, I think single-family is the main story. I don't -- there were some stuff in that piece I read from Treasury about multi, but it was 95% about single-family.</p><p>JEFFREY ALAN SPECTOR: And then just to conclude, we have 3 rapid-fire questions, just very quick answers. BofAML's U.S. economists now estimate a 1 in 3 chance of a recession within the next 12 months. Are you and your Board discussing recession more during recent meetings, the same as earlier in the year or not at all?</p><p>MARK J. PARRELL: I'd say about the same.</p><p>JEFFREY ALAN SPECTOR: With macro risk rising, are you seeing any signs of a slowdown or pullback from your tenants in the last couple of months?</p><p>MARK J. PARRELL: I just don't feel comfortable answering that question.</p><p>JEFFREY ALAN SPECTOR: Okay. Which of the following sector do you think could surprise expectations the most for being defensive in the next recession, industrial, retail, office or residential?</p><p>MARK J. PARRELL: I'm going to vote residential, a shocking development.</p><p>JEFFREY ALAN SPECTOR: Great. Thank you.</p><p>MARK J.

Good news on the war front seems to trump any questions about the economy. Does the resilience surprise you?\u00a0</p><p>Chris Edmonds: In some ways it does, but psychology is a powerful weapon and good psychology, especially in the form of military might, is a power aphrodisiac for the market.\u00a0</p><p> The economic underpinnings remain questionable and, so, I expect to see some chop along the way, but the momentum is clearly on the bullish side.\u00a0</p><p> Glad you mentioned energy, by the way. This OPEC meeting was an absolute disaster. I'm not ready to declare OPEC dead quite yet, but the power Russia and Norway are holding over the cartel sure make you question the impact OPEC can have on prices going forward.\u00a0</p><p>Someone said this morning that it was quite possible that Russian President Putin and President Bush were likely setting oil prices over a bowl of Texas chili in Crawford this morning. How's that for imagery.\u00a0</p><p>Eric Gillin: Interesting analysis and we'll have more on the markets in our weekly Roundtable later in the show.\u00a0</p><p> We have another packed show this week. We'll tackle everything going on in the air and on the ground at least around airports -- with Holly Hegeman, TheStreet.com's own airline analyst and publisher of PlaneBusiness.com.\u00a0</p><p>We'll look at the financial health of the airlines and explore the ramifications of Monday's crash on American Airlines as well as the latest developments on the airport security front in Congress.\u00a0</p><p> Then we'll delve into the mystery of why all of you knock that little white ball around the yard with sticks as we look back on the PGA Tour with two seasoned golf journalists -- Bryan Katrek of PGA Tour Radio and John Steinbreder of Golfweek.\u00a0</p><p> Finally, we wrap up with our Markets Roundtable with a special Thanksgiving twist -- a look at stocks to be thankful for and a look at a turkey or two along the way. All that, the Five Dumbest Things on Wall Street and the latest news headlines.\u00a0</p><p> But first, a toast.\u00a0</p><p>Eric Gillin: New York State Attorney General Eliot Spitzer railed against the Red Cross this week, demanding that the organization distribute every cent of the $543 million received in its Liberty Fund to the loved ones of victims and the victims of September 11.\u00a0</p><p> This was in response to the Red Cross saying that part of the funds would go to those affected by future attacks. Spitzer cried foul and said that the Red Cross misled people who donated money thinking it'd go solely to those impacted by September 11.\u00a0</p><p> Essentially, Spitzer wanted more accountability for what happens to the $1.4 billion in donations given to all charities.\u00a0</p><p> While such a demand is commendable, I'm not raising a glass to Spitzer. He was doing his job. He gets paid to watchdog. For the same reason, I'm not raising a glass to the Red Cross or to any of the other charities. They're also doing their jobs, with some, clearly, performing better than others.\u00a0</p><p> Instead, I toast the charitable.\u00a0</p><p> It's not their jobs to be charitable. In fact, some of those who gave to the Liberty Fund don't even have jobs! Even though times are tough, people have opened their wallets and purses.\u00a0</p><p> Recession be damned, America has kicked open the floodgates. Wrap your brain around this:\u00a0</p><p> On September 10, the Red Cross received $1,024 in donations via its web site. The next day, while chaos reigned in New York, another $1,013,235 came in. The Liberty Fund raised $543 million since the attack -- an average donation of $100 every second.  Before Thanksgiving, half of the $93 million raised by the Twin Towers fund will go to the families of the 406 uniformed personnel killed in the attack. Mayor Rudolph Giuliani says that the average check will be $114,000.<br/>\u00a0<br/>* The September 11 Fund's star-studded telethon, featuring Bruce Springsteen, Billy Joel and Stevie Wonder added $150 million, upping the money raised to $337 million. $50 million has already been given out.<br/>\u00a0<br/>* It's happening everywhere. In Chamblee, Georgia, students of Dunwoody High held a bowl-a-thon at the AMF Bowling Lanes on Savoy Drive. This is in addition to the ribbons sold at the homecoming dance and the $1-a-ticket girls' football game held last week. In total, the high school raised $3,100.<br/>\u00a0<br/>* Recent polls show that 73% of the adults in this nation say they've donated something in the past two months, either it be money, blood or their time and services.\u00a0</p><p> All across this country -- from towns, to cities, to states -- the spirit of giving is strong.\u00a0</p><p>And yet, amid this wellspring of generosity, rankled a controversy. The Red Cross wanted to withhold $300 million of the Liberty Fund for future victims. Critics howled. But don't get mad at the Red Cross. It listened to the critics and released a statement yesterday saying that all of the money in the fund will go to those affected by September 11.\u00a0</p><p> My heart goes out to the Red Cross, stung by complaints and bad press. The organization must have been overwhelmed by America's generosity. After years of begging people to donate blood, The Red Cross suddenly had lines around the block. The organization went from $1,000 a day in donations to $1 million.\u00a0</p><p> Just nine weeks after the attacks, it might have struggled to figure out who precisely needed the money. Accustomed to doing so much with not enough, the Red Cross was trying to set some funds aside for the bumpy road ahead, perhaps thinking that it would never see a half-billion dollars raised ever again.\u00a0</p><p> Sure, The Red Cross could have handled the situation better. But the organization did the best it could.\u00a0</p><p> With all the problems in the world, I'm thankful for this one. What a wonderful quandary -- The Red Cross had too much. So I raise a glass to everyone out there that created that problem, that contributed even a little of their time or money, to help.\u00a0</p><p>A toast to generosity. A toast to the spirit of giving and hopes it will continue, even if there's no tragedy to react to.\u00a0</p><p>Eric Gillin: So, Chris, what are your thoughts on the New York City charity issue.\u00a0</p><p>Chris Edmonds: Two very distinct thoughts: First, the response of our citizens and our communities to this tragedy has been remarkable. Those who have argued the sense of community has diminished in America have certainly been proven wrong.\u00a0</p><p> Our communities may no longer be defined by geography, but the sense of purpose and belonging of the American citizenry and its community is now unquestioned.\u00a0</p><p> As for the charities, let's face it, they are businesses. They have staff and executives and overhead and bureaucracy. They could have done better and should do better. People gave for a very specific purpose. It's important that money be directed to those it was intended for.\u00a0</p><p>Eric Gillin: Interesting observations. And, Chris, our first guest has some prescient observations of her own, specifically related to the airline industry.\u00a0</p><p>Chris Edmonds: Eric, indeed she does. Our first guest is Holly Hegeman, a contributor to TheStreet.com and RealMoney.com and publisher of by far the best, most comprehensive airline industry publication around, PlaneBusiness. Holly joins us from the headquarters of Plane Business in Mandeville, Louisiana.\u00a0</p><p>Holly, thanks for being with us.\u00a0</p><p>Holly Hegeman: Chris and Eric, nice to be with you.\u00a0</p><p>Chris Edmonds: Let's start with the breaking news, the fact there may be an airline security plan finally coming from Congress. What can you tell us about the key provisions of a plan that comes from the Hill? Looks like the real hang-up is over who will actually control the personnel securing the nation's commercial airports.\u00a0</p><p>Holly Hegeman: Obviously the hold up for the past two months has broken down over philosophical arguments: whether or not to be Fed employees.  But then again, what's new? Meanwhile, it's been over two months and we have no bill. There's been a compromise bill submitted.\u00a0</p><p> There's been one signed, or at least put together. It's one of those in between ones. The first year, the screeners will be Federalized, and after that, it gets murky. Supposedly there will be a period of time where they will go under a new office to be set up under the department of transportation, then a look-see after some more years.\u00a0</p><p>It's better than nothing. We could have done better, but we need to have something. Trent Locke said that this will give Americans peace of mind when they get on planes across the country, especially as we approach Thanksgiving.\u00a0</p><p>Chris Edmonds: You talk to a lot of pilots, flight attendants, ramp workers, ticket agents in the business. From those conversations, where is security most lacking in the nation's airports?\u00a0</p><p>Holly Hegeman: Business travelers complain because it varies from day to day. You can't plan ahead. You take a flight from Chicago to Atlanta and get there three hours early and whisk through security in 10-15 minutes. Two days later, they take the same flight and it takes hours.\u00a0</p><p> You've all heard the stories. People go through one line in one airport and are fine, they go through the next and have their tweezers taken away. A lot is for show. Travelers' patience will get short as time goes by. There are no consistent rules and that needs to change.\u00a0</p><p>Eric Gillin: The crash of flight 587 upset me. I live in New York. I work in New York. While the jury may still be out on the cause, it seems like this should have been prevented. Is it appropriate to blame American Airlines for the crash, no matter what the circumstance? And what does that spell for American's future?\u00a0</p><p>Holly Hegeman: It's too early to blame American Airlines. Generally, in the past, when we had a crash like this, TWA flight #800 for instance, immediately the thought was that there was an explosion and the FBI was brought in. This week, there was almost a concerted effort to go the other way. I found this a little peculiar.\u00a0</p><p>Like the bird story. Sources said it was a bird strike. That got all over the wires and there was no truth to it at all.\u00a0</p><p> It's too early to step on American Airlines toes. It's totally unprecedented. When I saw the visual of them pulling it out of the water, it's common sense. If the plane had suffered a bird strike or the engine had failed, you're not going to have this almost intact piece of tail pulled out of the water. That was not enough to take the plane down -- a bird!\u00a0</p><p>Eric Gillin: Not only has fear hurt the airlines, alternative modes of transportation seem to be providing another pinch. Automakers are offering 0% financing, gasoline prices have dropped to two-year lows and Amtrak is offering big savings. All told, Triple A says air travel over the holiday will be off at least 30% while highway travel will soar. What's the long-term impact of alternate transportation on the airlines, especially the short-haul carriers like Southwest?\u00a0</p><p>Holly Hegeman: It depends on where you live. Having lived in the North East, train travel is almost already a good alternative. In some cases, it's better. But that's not the case in the rest of the United States. In those markets not served by rail travel, it is going to be a matter of distance.\u00a0</p><p> I don't think it's that people don't want to fly. People just don't want to go anywhere. In the same Triple A piece, travel across the board will be down. People would just rather stay home and it's just a continuation of what we've seen after September 11. Look at the retails. The home, the nesting stocks. Martha Stewart is doing gangbusters. Southwest, for example, has not cut back any capacity and is doing well.\u00a0</p><p> Look at Jet Blue. A small airline based in New York. If anyone was going to be hit, should have been them. They have not cut back on any of their flights either. They're doing the same amount they did prior to September 11.\u00a0</p><p>Chris Edmonds: Help us size up the winners and losers in this new operating environment. How important were the government subsidies to various carriers and who is best poised to remain competitive and, hence, survive in this more difficult operating environment?\u00a0</p><p>Holly Hegeman: There's no doubt that if you track the industry for the past 2-3 years, you see a trend in place even before September 11. Southwest continues to be a success, and not just with Southwest.\u00a0</p><p> We have it with WestJet, based in Canada. RyanAir in Ireland. Jet Blue is a clone. Frontier is not a clone, but is in some sense. Air Tran. All of these have done very well and the reason is they use a different revenue model. For example, Southwest's philosophy is \"We're going to fly you for the least amount of money as possible, whereas Delta and United has always been \"We're going to try to make as much money off of you as possible.\"\u00a0</p><p>Eric Gillin: A spate of bankruptcies seem almost certain in the new year. What happens if we have fewer carriers? Higher fares and higher profit margins perhaps? What's the outcome if you have fewer players?\u00a0</p><p>Holly Hegeman: I don't think we're going to have as big a problem with higher fares as people think because of what I call the alternative carriers. The Frontier, Southwest, Jetblue, Airtran, because they're in good shape I don't think we'll suffer that much. I don't think it's how much people will suffer in terms of higher fares. The two biggest carriers at risk are probably American and United.\u00a0</p><p>Chris Edmonds: I have one questions about the American Airline crash on Monday. What happens if we find that the problem was mechanical? Does that make a difference in the stock?\u00a0</p><p>Holly Hegeman: If we find out it was an obviously mechanical problem that American Airlines should have caught, that's not going to help their stock. They're at risk anyway. They suffered major crashes prior to September 11. They were roundly chewed out by the NTSB on a report on that Little Rock accident. They are trying to digest the T.W.A acquisition. It definitely is not going to be good for them. How much will it affect the stock long-term with the price today? Probably long term, not that much, honestly. It closed today at $18.75. To be honest, I don't think it will affect them very much.\u00a0</p><p>Chris Edmonds: It's that T.W.A hoax. Will you be taking a look at that Airline Security bill as we go forward here?\u00a0</p><p>Holly Hegeman: Sure.\u00a0</p><p>Chris Edmonds: Holly, thanks for being with us.\u00a0</p><p>Our guest, Holly Hegeman, contributor to TheStreet.com and RealMoney.com and publisher of PlaneBusiness. I'm sure Holly will be back often as the airline saga continues to unfold.\u00a0</p><p>Eric, Holly is one of the smartest minds I know in the airline business. And, K.C. Swanson is one of the smartest minds I know when it comes to finding dumb things to write about.\u00a0</p><p>Eric Gillin: No question, K.C. is one of the best people I know of with only dumb things to say. K.C. what dumb things have you uncovered on Wall Street this week?\u00a0</p><p>K.C. Swanson: The Securities and Exchange Commission has suspended trading in 2DoTrade, doubting the company's claim that it is prepared to distribute a disinfectant for anthrax. No wonder the agency is skeptical: Biotechnology seems a bit far a field from 2DoTrade's goal of developing a business-to-business platform for the African continent.\u00a0</p><p> It's even farther removed from the company's original mission: According to a report filed with the SEC, it wanted to start a chain of full-service, white-tablecloth Italian restaurants \"based on authentic Italian regional recipes.\"\u00a0</p><p>Eric Gillin: Right, they are going to do an Italian restaurant that's a business to business Africa. Are they the same guys who sell webcams over the web?\u00a0</p><p>K.C. Swanson: I don't know. Any time a company doesn't have any revenue and it says it's still in the development stage and the SEC says it's checking into the identity of the companies managers. We can expect to hear a little bit more out of that.\u00a0</p><p>Eric Gillin: Maybe Sybil's on the board. Remember her? She's the one with the multiple personalities?\u00a0</p><p>K.C. Swanson: Hewlett-Packard's affirmation of \"enthusiastic support\" this week for the merger with Compaq rings a bit hollow, given that H-P's stock has seen double-digit losses since the merger was announced. The board's recent frozen-smile commentary came on news that some of the company's most influential investors, members of the Hewlett and Packard families, oppose the deal and will vote against the merger if given the chance. It's not often that the board of a company and its investors are at loggerheads -- and regarding the board's mood, we're reckoning panic might be more accurate than enthusiasm.\u00a0</p><p>Eric Gillin: So who's the big moron on that? Is it just a bad deal that makes you want to cut bait and just forget about it?\u00a0</p><p>K.C. Swanson: Basically, it's just the company saying that there is enthusiasm for a deal and it's pretty unconvincing. We're reckoning that they're panicking at this point.\u00a0</p><p>Eric Gillin: K.C. also wrote about the apparent early leak of news of the demise of the 30-year treasury bond and the SEC's interest in who's responsible, the NYSE's lax regulations of floor brokers and, what else, Enron. You can find all of her excellent work by going to \"The Five Dumbest Things on Wall Street\" at TheStreet.com.\u00a0</p><p>K.C. Swanson: Briefly, the long bond scenario is that the Treasury Department accidentally leaked the news early and some traders got wind of the report and made money from it which is pretty embarrassing. The NYSE still is not over-seeing traders closely enough. Finally the Enron problem. The company is saying that it would have to re-state earnings from 1997 to the end of 2001. That's a pretty extensive amount of time.\u00a0</p><p>Eric Gillin: What's up for next week?\u00a0</p><p>K.C. Swanson: Enron is back. You almost have to admire the gall of Enron CEO Kenneth Lay, who, in exchange for presiding over the company's brisk slide into mayhem, tried to slip out the door with a $60.6 million pay package.\u00a0</p><p>Eric Gillin: That and more on \"The Five Dumbest Things on Wall Street\", tomorrow and every Friday at TheStreet.com.\u00a0</p><p>K.C., thanks.\u00a0</p><p>K.C. Swanson: Take care.\u00a0</p><p>Eric Gillin: Now, with the latest news including how the markets finished at the closing bell, from the Wall Street headquarters of TheStreet.com, our news editor, Yi Ping Ho. Yi Ping, how'd we finish the day and what's ahead?\u00a0</p><p>Yi Ping Ho: Stocks refrained from making any big moves today, as Wall Street cheered a surprising drop in weekly jobless claims but fretted over concerns about terrorism and poor earnings from a big tech company.\u00a0</p><p> The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 48.78 points, or 0.5%, to 9872.39, while the Nasdaq was off 2.60 points, or 0.1%, to 1900.59. The S&amp;P 500 was up a point to 1142.25.\u00a0</p><p> The market was rattled early by news of an airport fire in northwestern Texas and a train derailment north of Detroit. On the corporate front, Applied Materials posted disappointing quarterly earnings after Wednesday's close. The stock lost 4%, to close at $39.09.  Meanwhile, the oil sector created a drag on most major market indexes. On Wednesday, ministers of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries signaled they are willing to endure a price war by refusing to lower oil production, at least not till non-OPEC producers agree to cut output as well.\u00a0</p><p> But some better-than-expected economic news is helping sentiment. This morning, the labor department said the number of Americans filing new unemployment claims totaled 444,000 in the week ended Nov. 10, down from the number of claims a week earlier. Still, continuing claims data for the week are at their highest levels since Feb. 12, 1983.\u00a0</p><p> On Wednesday, October's retail sales surprised everyone when it rose by 7.1%, reflecting the success of auto financing incentives.\u00a0</p><p> Looking ahead, Friday brings about the consumer price index for October. But with inflation barely a concern, investors will likely pay more attention to the latest industrial production and capacity utilization reports by the Federal Reserve for signs of a turnaround in the factory sector.\u00a0</p><p> And while next week could be quiet, given thanksgiving, the market will still be digesting the Conference Board's Index of Leading Economic Indicators, released on Tuesday.\u00a0</p><p>Eric Gillin: Next week we don't have a show, and Yi Ping will be off on a much needed vacation.\u00a0</p><p>And, now, Fore!, Chris, let's hit the links.\u00a0</p><p>Chris Edmonds: Eric, thanks. Indeed, its time for our weekly lighter fare, a look at Wall Street without a coat and tie and a chance to dive into the lighter subjects that make all of us on Wall Street tick.\u00a0</p><p> This week, a look at a game I love and hate -- golf. If only I could hit the ball like Tiger. If only I was on the 18th green in Houston two weeks ago instead of Mike Wier.\u00a0</p><p> Wake me up. We can all dream and here to discuss the game so many dream about playing well are two veteran golf journalists. Bryan Katrek is host of PGA Tour Radio. In addition to broadcasting live play-by-play of PGATour, Senior Tour and Buy-com events, Katrek and his team broadcast daily and weekly in-depth analysis of the tour and its happenings. He joins us from -- and let me get this right, a Golf course?! Atlanta.\u00a0</p><p> Bryan Katrek: Of all places Chris, how about a Golf course?\u00a0</p><p>Chris Edmonds: And which club is in your hand?\u00a0</p><p> Bryan Katrek: Just the shag bag, I'm picking up balls.\u00a0</p><p>Chris Edmonds: Also with us is John Steinbreder, senior writer for Golfweek, covering both the competitive and business sides of the game. John is the author of six books, including two devoted to the game of golf and joins us from his car in Connecticut.\u00a0</p><p>John Steinbreder: I'd much rather be where Bryan is right now.\u00a0</p><p>Chris Edmonds: Bryan, let me begin with you. So many people thought this would be a year dominated by Tiger Woods and while he dominated the money list, his performance level was not as dominant as many would have thought. Was Tiger's performance this year disappointing or did he just become a little bit more human?\u00a0</p><p> Bryan Katrek: He didn't disappoint me. He had five wins, and only one major. He didn't really contend for the Grand-Slam. How is that somehow disappointing? But it is! It's disappointing to the golfing public. It's disappointing to the media. It's probably deep down inside disappointing to Tiger. I don't' think he's ever going to frown at a five win season when he picks up a major. But I don't' think anyone who really knows golf is disappointed.\u00a0</p><p>Chris Edmonds: There were some great stories this year. Jerry Kelly's run at the Players Championship and that look on his face when Tiger holed out on the second hole, Chris DiMarco's great play and Mike Weir's November performance. John, what are some of your fonder moments of the tour just passed?\u00a0</p><p>John Steinbreder: David Toms with the PGA is one of my favorites. I got to know him a few years ago at a tournament in Morocco which he entered and won. It made my season from a spectator's standpoint.\u00a0</p><p>Eric Gillin: Hey guys, Eric Gillin here. Tiger Woods, clearly, is a phenomenon not only in the world of golf, but also in the world outside of sport. Much talk was made about how golf would become more popular with young people and minorities. Years later, Woods is still dominant. So, have we seen golf's demographics change? Are young people and minorities hitting the links? John, let's start with you?\u00a0</p><p>John Steinbreder: From a spectators standpoint, Tiger Woods has bought the game to a whole new audience of people. Younger people, maybe more ethnically diverse group of people.\u00a0</p><p> From a playing standpoint -- First T is doing well with it's program to try to open up a lot of it's inner-city golf courses and minority golf centers. It's making some progress, but the actual numbers themselves -- golf has not really grown in great lengths from the participation standpoint.\u00a0</p><p> There are new people coming into the game. There are also an equal number of people leaving the game every year. Truth be told, it's still a game that costs a fair amount of money to get involved with and requires a lot of real estate. From the spectators' standpoint, he's made an enormous difference. From the participation standpoint, it's very hard to say that he's made much of a difference at all.\u00a0</p><p>Eric Gillin: Bryan, what about the Tiger effect?\u00a0</p><p> Bryan Katrek: I would agree with John. I was talking to a PGA player who echoed those numbers. It's not popular sentiment. For every new face, you've lost some old faces. The new people Tiger has brought to the game are out in front of him costing his rounds to last 6 hours! There is a bit of a trade off. The demographics, the numbers are not growing like we thought they would, but they are certainly getting younger. From a business standpoint, that's not bad.\u00a0</p><p>Eric Gillin: Bryan, are there any young Tigers in the wings? What about this Tryon kid and how is \"Q\" school shaping up? Any surprises.\u00a0</p><p> Bryan Katrek: He is the story, the 17 year old Ty Tryon. I know that John is familiar with this story.  He is so young and made a splash at 16 when he made the cut and contended for the league.  He is not your average 17 yr old.  He's very mature. We aren't advocating everyone try this at home. Don't turn pro when your 12 years old. But he is the exception to the rule. He is the story of Q school, but not even the cream of what's expected to be a fantastic rookie class for 2002.\u00a0</p><p>Eric Gillin: So Tiger could become the old man.\u00a0</p><p> Bryan Katrek : He's already the old man.\u00a0</p><p>Chris Edmonds: Hey Bryan, let me follow up on the Ty Tryon subject. This kid's 17 years old and you've heard a lot of criticism about his parents even allowing him to do this. That he's too young, that he should have gone to college. What's the take on the tour about this young man?\u00a0</p><p> Bryan Katrek : There's a lot of trepidation. It's not that these guys are fearing for their jobs, there are plenty of jobs to go around. A lot of guys on tour have kids Ty's age.\u00a0</p><p> John Cooks got a kid Ty's age on Ty's high school team! So they don't want to have to explain to their own family and other people why it's good for him and not for them. There is some fear for their job and the game is changing.\u00a0</p><p> But it's still a performance based industry. It's the truest form of capitalism. Those who do the best succeed. I don't' think this has a huge effect on the guys on tour because they're already ready for the best. They don't care how old their competitor is. They're expecting their competitor to make every shot and to be tough.\u00a0</p><p>Chris Edmonds: John, there is a lot of talk about the impact of September 11 on the golf economies. Have you and your colleagues at Golfweek noticed any change in recreational or professional golf patterns since the tragedy?\u00a0</p><p>John Steinbreder: It's interesting, to put it in context, golf as an industry was in a recession before this happened. It's been having a tough time. The game has been slumping. There's too much capacity, lousy weather in the spring, and the attacks have had an effect.  Some clubs have lost as many as two dozen members.  No one is buying anything. Anything dependent on travel is hurting. Well I think there is trepidation.\u00a0</p><p>Eric Gillin: Every year, thousands of new irons, drivers, putters, balls, bags and other paraphernalia hit the local golf shop. A few years back, it seemed the mantra was \"bigger is better\" thanks to the success of the Big Bertha driver. With Christmas approaching, everyone wants to know what the big holiday fad will be. Bryan, what can't you do without under the tree?\u00a0</p><p>Bryan Katrek: The newest toys is going to be the golf ball itself. The debate will be do we want these balls to go as far as they're going? Should there be some restriction? In the meantime, the balls seem to be going much farther and that is the new rage.\u00a0</p><p>Not only ProV1 by Titleist, but the Lady Precept had a price point that was much lower and it's a very long golf ball.  Max Wise has one called The Noodle.  Very affordable balls with good feel and extremely long distance. The new toys may be the cheap ones this year. It may be the golf balls.\u00a0</p><p>Eric Gillin: Are you out there shagging Pro VI's or are they pinnacles?\u00a0</p><p>Bryan Katrek: Actually I'm chipping right now an entire bag of Lady Precepts, but I'll try anything!  The things they're doing now with balls almost by accident. They react to a faster swing speed.\u00a0</p><p>Chris Edmonds: John, what about the golf ball wars? The Pro-V does make me a better golfer, but I have no idea why. Yet, everyone is now looking at the premium market. Can anyone make money at this game if everyone is playing?\u00a0</p><p>John Steinbreder: The margins on balls with the established makers are huge. Titleist is making good money in the ball business. It's entire premium ball line in less than a year.\u00a0</p><p> The premium balls make up only 10% of the market.  The established ball makers can do that as long as they don't have debt like Spaulding.  The companies having the hardest time are Calaway's.  They're basically starting from scratch and it's a hard thing for them to do. It's difficult for the newcomers, but for the people that are established -- they'll find that they can make some money.\u00a0</p><p> There is are some cool things coming out for under the tree like the new sea 4 graphite driver from Calaway, which is all graphite, the head and everything. It's very expensive and in this economy people are going to spend on the small ticket items and not the big ones.\u00a0</p><p>Chris Edmonds: Let me ask you about some of the publicly traded companies. What's your take on whether or not these stocks are poised to move in any direction here and give me some of your favorite names.\u00a0</p><p>John Steinbreder: Not being an analyst, I'll be honest, I wouldn't put money in a golf company if you paid me. It's a difficult business.  It's a good time to get in, but you've got Nike coming in right around the corner.\u00a0</p><p>It's hard to get excited about any publicly traded golf company right now.  Even the component companies are having a difficult time for the most part.\u00a0</p><p>Chris Edmonds: OK guys, time for predictions. Give me three golfers to watch in the 2002 season. And, don't worry, we'll hold you to these names and have you back as the tour gets underway next year. John, your up first.\u00a0</p><p>John Steinbreder: I want to watch Tiger.  Charles Hall II has had a heck of a back end.  And a local favorite JJ Henry from Fairfield, Connecticut.  Great year, a great guy, an awesome player.\u00a0</p><p>Chris Edmonds: Bryan, your picks.\u00a0</p><p> Bryan Katrek: I love J.J. Henry. Charles Howell. That guy may bust out and win 4-5 times. Matt Kucher, played his way onto the tour.  And you can't ignore the three guys off the tour, not to mention David Gossett, Heath Slocum, Pat Bates, and, of course, Chad Campbell who wins at every level.  I wouldn't be surprised if he won not only once next year!\u00a0</p><p>Chris Edmonds: What happens to the Buy.com tour?\u00a0</p><p> Bryan Katrek: I don't know about the Buy.com tour next year. They're going to try to not have this name problem next year.  They're going to try to come up with a game that's going to last that's not going to be sponsorship dependent.\u00a0</p><p>John Steinbreder: I think Bryan's right. They're going to come up with a name that the tour can keep itself.\u00a0</p><p>Chris Edmonds: Thanks guys for being here. Our guests, Bryan Katrek, host of PGA Tour Radio and John Steinbreder, Senior Writer for Golfweek magazine.\u00a0</p><p>Eric Gillin: From golf back to the markets. It's time for our weekly markets roundtable. Joining us this week are two veterans of the Roundtable: From Omaha, Ted Bridges of Bridges Investment Counsel and from Princeton, New Jersey Howard Alter of Alter Asset Management. Welcome to you both.\u00a0</p><p> Howard, I'll begin with you. The resilience of this market is pretty amazing. Can we keep it up?\u00a0</p><p>Howard Alter: I'm actually not managing money. I'm taking my four year old son and working on golf with him. The resilience of the market has been incredible. The geo-political situation is improving and people are putting their money to work.\u00a0</p><p>Eric Gillin: Ted, what are your thoughts about the Dow at nearly 9900? Should I dust off my Dow 10K hat?\u00a0</p><p>Ted Bridges: You can have mine. It's hardly been worn. I would say longer term, we're still constructive here.  The investors' best ally now is time.  Shorter term, people have been surprised at the strength of the rally.  We may see some profit taking here.\u00a0</p><p>Chris Edmonds: Howard, clearly there are a number of impacts from the continued decline in the price of oil. This OPEC meeting was a disaster. How can investors play the recent weakness in oil prices? What's the impact on the economy?\u00a0</p><p>Howard Alter: I'll take the last question first.  The impact on the economy is good. When prices were firmer, a number of companies were talking about margin squeezes and we see relief there.  In terms of how to play this, we're looking at Exxon now as a name that we'd want to own on the way down.  And the stock has come down significantly and is back again where it was when the market opened after the tragedy in New York. The time you want to buy is when there is significant uncertainty. We had a drop in prices today. But we won't go much below 12 to 13 dollars. Eventually the Russians are going to realize that they are only hurting themselves.\u00a0</p><p>Chris Edmonds: But your focus would be on the integrated names, not necessarily the drillers or the service names?\u00a0</p><p>Howard Alter: The integrated names provide value and they provide dividends.\u00a0</p><p>Chris Edmonds: Ted, any thoughts?\u00a0</p><p>Ted Bridges: Chris, I would defer to you because you have the background. But I would say that we're looking and getting interested. From a long term perspective, you want to buy when there's a lot of uncertainty and not fear and concern. These prices reflect that.  The question is valuation.\u00a0</p><p>Eric Gillin: Time for some holiday cheer. We're coming into the home stretch here. Hard to believe there are only seven weeks left in 2001. As Thanksgiving approaches what are two or three stocks you are most thankful for. Ted?\u00a0</p><p>Ted Bridges: I would give a couple.  First is Capital One.  It gives you the best of both worlds.  It's down 15-20% YTD but performance is outstanding.  It's down for two reasons.  Providian has blown up in a high-profile disaster.  And people are concerned that going into a recession, consumer finance companies carry more risk. If you look at the operations and it's long-term performance and how it's trading out, which is probably up 20% in the past month but still trading at 15 times next years earnings for a company that is a solid bet to grow for the foreseeable future, it's a bankable name.\u00a0</p><p>Eric Gillin: Howard, what are you giving thanks for in your portfolio?\u00a0</p><p>Howard Alter: Well, I'm a New Jersey Nets fan and the Knicks are having a hard time this season and so is Cablevision. Cablevision has come down significantly.  It is a Cable television operator and it owns sports teams and Madison Square Garden. The company has 3 million in the New York city area alone. Its basic cable and high-speed Net service has been consistent and sustainable. Right now we're really happy about the Nets.\u00a0</p><p>Chris Edmonds: This year has produced lots of Turkeys. Howard, what is your biggest gaggling investment of the year?\u00a0</p><p>Howard Alter: Ours is a chicken.  Not one we bought but sold way to early.  TriCon Global, a spin off of Pepsi.  They have KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell. We lost faith in managements ability to turn Taco Bell around. The company did a better job than we thought. We've left a lot of money on the table that we wish we hadn't.\u00a0</p><p>Chris Edmonds: What are you doing with the stock now?\u00a0</p><p>Howard Alter: The stock has moved to 51-52 and we certainly wouldn't be a buyer here.\u00a0</p><p>Chris Edmonds: Ted, how about you?\u00a0</p><p>Ted Bridges: If Howard was hanging out with our family, he never would have sold because we always go to Taco Bell!  Level 3 was our turkey for the year.  We started buying aggressively about this time last year. The company was building out a telecommunications network.  Thought it was down 75%.  It bottomed at 1.89 a month ago.  I think we haven't see the last.  TheStreet.com had articles in the last day or two.  We still remain very constructive long-term.\u00a0</p><p>Howard Alter: That was our #2 on turkeys as well.\u00a0</p><p>Ted Bridges: I would agree with you. While the company maybe made some errors, it has done a terrific job in the worst time you can imagine.  Now it has been buying back its debt.  With Level 3, it's never easy but always interesting.\u00a0</p><p>Chris Edmonds: Let me jump in with a question about Level 3 and Buffett. There were all sorts of rumors when things were really their darkest that because of Buffett's relationship there that he might have interest or he might take a stake. But could there be any truth to that?\u00a0</p><p>Ted Bridges: The closest analogy I can come up with is when Buffett and Walter Scott together took Cal Energy private a couple of years ago. I think Level 3 looks like a utility, a lot riskier utility. It's a start up in a sense. A utility dealing in a commodity that's next century as opposed to oil or gas.  I would never rule it out but in the short run, it stretched my imagination to think there was something live there. Never say never.\u00a0</p><p>Chris Edmonds: Howard, you're a Berkshire holder, any thoughts?\u00a0</p><p>Howard Alter: He might be more interested in debt now.  Over the last few weeks, there's more optimism that Equity folks may come out good. The returns are attractive.\u00a0</p><p>Ted Bridges: That's a good point.  The odds on Buffett with the Equity would be 1/1,000,000.  That would make sense.\u00a0</p><p>Eric Gillin: What was the biggest lesson you learned this year?\u00a0</p><p>Ted Bridges: This year the thing I've been re-educated on is that valuations always go further higher and further lower than you expect.\u00a0</p><p>Howard Alter: We keep getting slammed every time we leave our core confidence. Our bests are where we really know the players and investors.  Every year we think we know more than we do and get into places where we'd be better off keeping capital in our core level of confidence.  Stick to what you know.\u00a0</p><p>Eric Gillin: Despite scary news reports and panicky people, especially here in New York City, there is much to be thankful for. What companies, stocks, investments or phenomenon are you guys most thankful for?\u00a0</p><p>Howard Alter: The buying we did after September 11 especially in retail, some heavier Disney buying was helpful.  Buying at a time of max fear when the valuations are all good usually leads to some good long term outcomes. It has surprised everyone.\u00a0</p><p>Ted Bridges: I would say, you're thankful for your discipline.  Sometimes it leads you away from your core confidence.  There's a way to insure that you get there. Stay with what you know.  You need to take a long term perspective on the Equity market.  I'm thankful we have the courage to throw some money at it when it seemed like it couldn't get worst and that will help for us mitigate what has been a tough year.  We tend to look at things 5,6.7 years out.\u00a0</p><p>Chris Edmonds: I'm thankful for the two of you and the other guest on our show that provide insights and make our listeners and readers better investors. We'll have you back soon. Since we have a holiday next week, Happy Thanksgiving!\u00a0</p><p>Thanks to Howard Alter of Alter Asset Management and Ted Bridges of Bridges Investment. Eric, another good week. And, a holiday next week. Happy Thanksgiving!\u00a0</p><p>Eric Gillin: That's right, no show next week and we'll miss all of you but we will be back in two weeks and we'll take a look at the early returns from the holiday shopping season and also a look at some serious and not so serious holiday traditions as we kick off a December filled with good cheer and, of course, eggnog.\u00a0</p><p>And, of course, we'll take a look at the markets, the Five Dumbest Things on Wall Street and Yi-Ping and the news.\u00a0</p><p>Until then, thanks to all of our guests and Chris, thanks to you. See you next week.\u00a0</p><p>Chris Edmonds: Look forward to it. Happy Thanksgiving to all and to all a good night.\u00a0</p><p>Eric Gillin: Excellent. Happy Thanksgiving to all as well. Until November 29, Cheers.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TSC-#10004122#</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TSC2001</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:44G6-0SJ0-00MP-T26D-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">220623</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"6720\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>TheStreet.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"19301\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><copyright>Copyright 2001 TheStreet.com, Inc.</copyright><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"11\" year=\"2001\"><dateText>November 16, 2001 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>YAHOO!

He's the management partner and RebelMouse chairman.   He's also the Former CEO of the \"The Huffington Post\" and was an early  investor in companies including Warby Parker, Casper, and Refinery29.  He's  got quite a track record I think is per se.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Eric, welcome back to Bloomberg (ph).  Good to have you here.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> ERIC HIPPEAU, MANAGING PARTNER, LERER HIPPEAU VENTURES:  Good morning.</p><p> WESTIN:  So let's start with this tax reform, tax overhaul.  Supposedly, a  lot of money is going to be coming back into this country, particularly on  the tech companies.  What are they going to do with it?</p><p> HIPPEAU:  Well, they can continue to buy back shares as they've been doing.   But more likely, they're going to start really investing it in areas that  might be a little bit like frontier technology that's a little bit outside  of their core domains.  Google has been doing it already.  Apple has a good  track record of this.</p><p> LISA ABRAMOWICZ, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR:  I'm sorry to cut you off.  But a lot of  people say that these companies, Google, and Amazon, they've already  brought a lot of money back to the bond market.  They have as much cash  that they could possibly imagine.  Why would they need this money to come  back for to do some of these moves?</p><p> HIPPEAU:  Well, probably just because they are under attack.  They're under  attack in the United States.  They're certainly under attack in Europe.   And there's a growing backlash against big tech.  And it's got to do with  the Russian thing, the fact that they don't know what's happening on their  platforms, they have no controls.  This whole privacy issue is starting to  hit home, that we are looking at Equifax.</p><p> So it would be smart for them to start making investments that bolster  their image, that cater better to privacy and security and things of that  nature.</p><p> WESTIN:  And yet when you look at some big deals, you see things like  Amazon buying whole foods, which is, if anything, the opposite direction.   That's not going into privacy of things.  That's going to bricks-and- mortar.  I mean, should we expect to see more of that tech really move into  bricks-and-mortars or the reverse for that matter?</p><p> HIPPEAU:  I think you certainly mentioned some of the companies that we've  invested in, like Warby Parker.  Warby Parker now has over 20 stores.   They're doing very well.  Casper, another one of our businesses is opening  stores.  So you're starting to see digital native companies understand that  consumers like to touch the product.  The interaction is necessary.  So  they're going into the retail business.</p><p> ABRAMOWICZ:  So when you talk about the regulatory pushback and sort of the  under attack aspect of tech right now, do actually think that politicians  are going to take regulatory action or is this just sort of going to goad  the big tech companies try to insulate themselves?</p><p> HIPPEAU:  I don't think politicians really understand what's going on.  So  it's very unlikely that they will take action.  If they take action, it  will be a rear guard action that won't have much of an effect.  I think  it's mostly the users.  There's definitely science that young people are  moving away from the big social platforms.  Older Americans, older people  are posting less personal things.  There's clearly a sign that what you  post will come back and haunt you in the future.  So this is a big change  that's coming from the users themselves</p><p> WESTIN:  So you're known as being a very astute investor in the digital  space, particularly in the early stages.  What does that tell you about  where you should be look for opportunities, so then other people should be  look at opportunities in tech?</p><p> HIPPEAU:  Well, these days we look for opportunities predictably in  artificial intelligence, smart apps, smart systems.  We're big believers  that the robotics world is changing dramatically.  The cost of robots is  going down at really furious pace.  And all the values according to the  software layer which is becoming more and more intelligent.  These are not  necessarily robots or AI that's going to replace workers.  It's in fact  going to enhance the workforce.  It's going to make the workforce more  productive.</p><p> ABRAMOWICZ:  What tech company are people not talking about today that they  will be at the end of 2018?</p><p> HIPPEAU:  Oh, boy.  That's an interesting question.  I'd have to think  about this a little bit more.  Sorry.</p><p> ABRAMOWICZ:  Or is there a company that we're talking about right now, the  reverse, that we're not going to be talking about?</p><p> HIPPEAU:  Well, I think your previous segment mentioned that.  I think the  Chinese companies are all going to come to the United States or a lot of  them are going to come to the United States.  You should see the valuations  in China, talk about bitcoin as a high valuation, all of the valuations in  China, all the deals you hear about china, are made with hundreds of  billions of dollars evaluation.  Alibaba, 10 Cent, all of these companies  are going to be look at the United States.</p><p> ABRAMOWICZ:  Wait.  So you think that Alibaba could actually present a  serious competitive threat to, say, Amazon in the U.S.?</p><p> HIPPEAU:  I'm not sure they will go directly into the end user, consumer,  retail sector but they will be in the infrastructure.  The commerce is  already in China.  All of these companies offer payments, offer  communications on a single platform.  We don't do that very well in the  United States.</p><p> WESTIN:  Well, I was going to ask exactly that question.  Is 10 Cent just  way ahead of us in terms of payments?  I mean, because you go to China and  people do everything with WeChat.  I mean basically they buy everything  they communicate.  They do everything.  And we're way behind in that.   Aren't we?</p><p> HIPPEAU:  Yes, it's surprising to me.  I'm not quite sure I understand why.   But the fact is, that there's no reason why you can't be in the single app  and do everything that you just mentioned, including making real payments  as well as buying digital objects and pretty much living your life in one  app.  We don't do this in the U.S.  There's no reason why we couldn't.</p><p> ABRAMOWICZ:  So which tech company do you think is getting the furthest in  creating that in the U.S.?</p><p> HIPPEAU:  Apple.</p><p> ABRAMOWICZ:  Apple Pay?</p><p> HIPPEAU:  Yes, Apple Pay.  You're going to stop to be able to make each  payments with Apple Pay.  So, yes, Apple is -- because it's such a stored  company, and since Steve Jobs people say, \"Well, Apple is not innovating as  much.\"  I actually don't believe that.  I think Apple is a very strong  company.</p><p> WESTIN:  So when you think about internet of things broadly, when you got  in the home with our Alexia, you got autonomous vehicles seem to be around  the corner.  When is it going to get to health care?  Why don't we have a  device on ourselves that monitor heart rate and things like that for  diabetic sugar levels?  When does that come and who's going to lead that  charge?</p><p> HIPPEAU:  Well, again this watch from Apple already.  If I wanted to -- I  don't.  But if I wanted to --</p><p> ABRAMOWICZ:  Like out of a know?</p><p> HIPPEAU:  Yes, exactly.  I could monitor some of my functions.  This is  getting better and better.  The sensors are getting better.  And the data  is getting better.  The problem with health care is the system of  healthcare is so rigid and so impregnable that they're only touching on the  margin.</p><p> WESTIN:  OK, Eric Hippeau of Lerer Hippeau Ventures.  Thanks so much for  being here, Eric.</p><p> [*]</p><p> ***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p> THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND  OTHER INACCURACIES.

He's the management partner and RebelMouse chairman.   He's also the Former CEO of the \"The Huffington Post\" and was an early  investor in companies including Warby Parker, Casper, and Refinery29.  He's  got quite a track record I think is per se.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Eric, welcome back to Bloomberg (ph).  Good to have you here.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">ERIC HIPPEAU, MANAGING PARTNER, LERER HIPPEAU VENTURES:  Good morning.</p><p>WESTIN:  So let's start with this tax reform, tax overhaul.  Supposedly, a  lot of money is going to be coming back into this country, particularly on  the tech companies.  What are they going to do with it?</p><p>HIPPEAU:  Well, they can continue to buy back shares as they've been doing.   But more likely, they're going to start really investing it in areas that  might be a little bit like frontier technology that's a little bit outside  of their core domains.  Google has been doing it already.  Apple has a good  track record of this.</p><p>LISA ABRAMOWICZ, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR:  I'm sorry to cut you off.  But a lot of  people say that these companies, Google, and Amazon, they've already  brought a lot of money back to the bond market.  They have as much cash  that they could possibly imagine.  Why would they need this money to come  back for to do some of these moves?</p><p>HIPPEAU:  Well, probably just because they are under attack.  They're under  attack in the United States.  They're certainly under attack in Europe.   And there's a growing backlash against big tech.  And it's got to do with  the Russian thing, the fact that they don't know what's happening on their  platforms, they have no controls.  This whole privacy issue is starting to  hit home, that we are looking at Equifax.</p><p>So it would be smart for them to start making investments that bolster  their image, that cater better to privacy and security and things of that  nature.</p><p>WESTIN:  And yet when you look at some big deals, you see things like  Amazon buying whole foods, which is, if anything, the opposite direction.   That's not going into privacy of things.  That's going to bricks-and- mortar.  I mean, should we expect to see more of that tech really move into  bricks-and-mortars or the reverse for that matter?</p><p>HIPPEAU:  I think you certainly mentioned some of the companies that we've  invested in, like Warby Parker.  Warby Parker now has over 20 stores.   They're doing very well.  Casper, another one of our businesses is opening  stores.  So you're starting to see digital native companies understand that  consumers like to touch the product.  The interaction is necessary.  So  they're going into the retail business.</p><p>ABRAMOWICZ:  So when you talk about the regulatory pushback and sort of the  under attack aspect of tech right now, do actually think that politicians  are going to take regulatory action or is this just sort of going to goad  the big tech companies try to insulate themselves?</p><p>HIPPEAU:  I don't think politicians really understand what's going on.  So  it's very unlikely that they will take action.  If they take action, it  will be a rear guard action that won't have much of an effect.  I think  it's mostly the users.  There's definitely science that young people are  moving away from the big social platforms.  Older Americans, older people  are posting less personal things.  There's clearly a sign that what you  post will come back and haunt you in the future.  So this is a big change  that's coming from the users themselves</p><p>WESTIN:  So you're known as being a very astute investor in the digital  space, particularly in the early stages.  What does that tell you about  where you should be look for opportunities, so then other people should be  look at opportunities in tech?</p><p>HIPPEAU:  Well, these days we look for opportunities predictably in  artificial intelligence, smart apps, smart systems.  We're big believers  that the robotics world is changing dramatically.  The cost of robots is  going down at really furious pace.  And all the values according to the  software layer which is becoming more and more intelligent.  These are not  necessarily robots or AI that's going to replace workers.  It's in fact  going to enhance the workforce.  It's going to make the workforce more  productive.</p><p>ABRAMOWICZ:  What tech company are people not talking about today that they  will be at the end of 2018?</p><p>HIPPEAU:  Oh, boy.  That's an interesting question.  I'd have to think  about this a little bit more.  Sorry.</p><p>ABRAMOWICZ:  Or is there a company that we're talking about right now, the  reverse, that we're not going to be talking about?</p><p>HIPPEAU:  Well, I think your previous segment mentioned that.  I think the  Chinese companies are all going to come to the United States or a lot of  them are going to come to the United States.  You should see the valuations  in China, talk about bitcoin as a high valuation, all of the valuations in  China, all the deals you hear about china, are made with hundreds of  billions of dollars evaluation.  Alibaba, 10 Cent, all of these companies  are going to be look at the United States.</p><p>ABRAMOWICZ:  Wait.  So you think that Alibaba could actually present a  serious competitive threat to, say, Amazon in the U.S.?</p><p>HIPPEAU:  I'm not sure they will go directly into the end user, consumer,  retail sector but they will be in the infrastructure.  The commerce is  already in China.  All of these companies offer payments, offer  communications on a single platform.  We don't do that very well in the  United States.</p><p>WESTIN:  Well, I was going to ask exactly that question.  Is 10 Cent just  way ahead of us in terms of payments?  I mean, because you go to China and  people do everything with WeChat.  I mean basically they buy everything  they communicate.  They do everything.  And we're way behind in that.   Aren't we?</p><p>HIPPEAU:  Yes, it's surprising to me.  I'm not quite sure I understand why.   But the fact is, that there's no reason why you can't be in the single app  and do everything that you just mentioned, including making real payments  as well as buying digital objects and pretty much living your life in one  app.  We don't do this in the U.S.  There's no reason why we couldn't.</p><p>ABRAMOWICZ:  So which tech company do you think is getting the furthest in  creating that in the U.S.?</p><p>HIPPEAU:  Apple.</p><p>ABRAMOWICZ:  Apple Pay?</p><p>HIPPEAU:  Yes, Apple Pay.  You're going to stop to be able to make each  payments with Apple Pay.  So, yes, Apple is -- because it's such a stored  company, and since Steve Jobs people say, \"Well, Apple is not innovating as  much.\"  I actually don't believe that.  I think Apple is a very strong  company.</p><p>WESTIN:  So when you think about internet of things broadly, when you got  in the home with our Alexia, you got autonomous vehicles seem to be around  the corner.  When is it going to get to health care?  Why don't we have a  device on ourselves that monitor heart rate and things like that for  diabetic sugar levels?  When does that come and who's going to lead that  charge?</p><p>HIPPEAU:  Well, again this watch from Apple already.  If I wanted to -- I  don't.  But if I wanted to --</p><p>ABRAMOWICZ:  Like out of a know?</p><p>HIPPEAU:  Yes, exactly.  I could monitor some of my functions.  This is  getting better and better.  The sensors are getting better.  And the data  is getting better.  The problem with health care is the system of  healthcare is so rigid and so impregnable that they're only touching on the  margin.</p><p>WESTIN:  OK, Eric Hippeau of Lerer Hippeau Ventures.  Thanks so much for  being here, Eric.</p><p>[*]</p><p>***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p>THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND  OTHER INACCURACIES.

Alex, I'm  going to start with you.  What do you make of this?</p><p> ALEX WAYNE, BLOOMBERG HOST:  It's an interesting lawsuit.  You know, a lot  of previous test case it's really -- because this isn't the only rule that  the Trump administration -- excuse me, Obama era rule, the Trump  administration has stuck to delay, and then eventually get rid of.</p><p> The suit, as I understand it, challenges whether the Obama -- the Trump  administration can do this without opening in a comment period first.</p><p> Now, I think, it's kind of a weird rule that the Trump administration is  trying to resend, it seems like it would normally fit in to like sort of  category of immigrants that the president would like to see more of in the  United States.</p><p> He's advocated for a merit-based immigration system.  But, I think, what's  happening here politically is twofold.</p><p> One, Trump is really trying to establish his legacy as erasing Obama's  legacy including just about every rule that Obama issued late in his  presidency.</p><p> And two, there are -- there are serious immigration restrictions within  this administration.  People who think there should be lower legal  immigration overall.</p><p> And so by repealing this rule, those folks are probably trying to achieve  some of their goals.</p><p> CHANG:  Bobby, why file this suit?  What do you hope to accomplish?</p><p> BOBBY FRANKLIN, CEO, NATIONAL VENTURE CAPITAL ASSOCIATION:  Well, we hope  to get the rule enacted, we hope to make sure that DHS is in a position to  accept applications.</p><p> Emily, this is about a competition that the U.S. is in with the rest of the  world.  In other countries are literally rolling out red carpets.</p><p> You look at Canada, you look at Great Britain, France, Singapore, all  across the globe, they recognize that there are talents in entrepreneurs.</p><p> They're trying to attract them to their country to start and grow this new  company on their soil.</p><p> And what are we doing, we've got red tape.  It's not a partisan issue, it's  not against President Trump, it's not against President Obama.</p><p> In fact, both of them have talked about the importance of bringing  international entrepreneurs that can frankly get capital anywhere across  the globe.</p><p> Bringing them here to our country and making sure that we grow U.S. jobs in  the economy.</p><p> CHANG:  Eric, you are an immigrant, you're an entrepreneur, you're an  investor.  What's your take?</p><p> ERIC HIPPEAU, MANAGING PARTNER, LERER HIPPEAU VENTURES:  Well, my take is  that foreign-entrepreneurs coming in to the United States is a very  desirable thing to do.</p><p> About half of our companies have at least one member of the original team,  the founding team, who is an immigrant.  I'm an immigrant.</p><p> And these are people who make huge contributions to our economy, to our  society.  And I don't see why we would make it difficult for them to come.</p><p> And as Bobby just mentioned, they can go elsewhere.  They can go to Canada,  they can go to France, they can go to other places.  We are competing with  other nations.</p><p> CHANG:  Obviously, President Trump's, you know, explanation here is  creating U.S. jobs, making sure that U.S. workers have a place to work.</p><p> Bobby, what about the idea this is -- that this is merely a stop gap  measure in any way when immigration reform in general is broken?</p><p> FRANKLIN:  Well, it is broken.  And we've been working on this issue for  many years.  Back in 2013, we had the opportunity to get a start of these  passed through the U.S. senate.</p><p> But it didn't make it all the way in to law.  Each year, we work with  congress to try to get them to pass legislation.</p><p> There are bills in this congress introduced by both Republicans and  Democrats that would create a start of these that would make it easier for  these entrepreneurs to come here and start companies.</p><p> But in the absence of legislation, making it in to law, we have to do what  we can.</p><p> And DHS promulgated the rule, they went through comment, and noticed, and  we had a rule ready to take effect July 17th.</p><p> And one week before that, DHS decided to resend that, we don't think they  follow proper procedure under the administrator procedures act.</p><p> And it's the only thing that we have to go on right now to try to get more  entrepreneurs here in our country.</p><p> CHANG:  Now, Alex, obviously, there have been conflicting messages from the  administration when it comes to this, when it comes to DACA, when it comes  to immigration reform, in general.</p><p> What are the next legislative steps that we actually expect to see in the  coming days and weeks when it comes to, you know, taking action on what the  president has signaled?</p><p> WAYNE:  So the priority in the immediate future is to do something about  DACA, the so-called Dreamers, these young immigrants brought to the country  illegally by their parents.</p><p> Democrats say they struck a deal with Trump to deal with -- to handle that  issue and resolve that issue.</p><p> I have not heard anything, any kind of a legislative resolution of this  issue, entrepreneur, immigrants.</p><p> So I would not expect that to be tackled by congress in the near future if  it all -- perhaps, it could be part of a comprehensive immigration bill.</p><p> But that's the way in the future, that's not even under consideration right  now.</p><p> CHANG:  So, Eric, have any of these moves impacted your entrepreneurs in  any way?  I mean, are people nervous or are they changing their plans?</p><p> HIPPEAU:  Well, by definition, we back people who are here legally, who are  with a visa or because they were, you know, they're here -- were under  weather reforms.</p><p> So -- but the community is nervous, the community is saying, \"You know, I  was welcomed when I came here and this is my dream.  My dream is the United  States that's' why I'm here.\"</p><p> \"Why is this changing, why am I not, you know, part of this, you know,  great community?\"  So this is a great degree of anxiety within the  community.</p><p> CHANG:  Right.  Bobby, any response to the lawsuit so far?</p><p> FRANKLIN:  Not yet, but, you know, we'll take the next steps.  We'll likely  file an injunction to try to get DHS to move forward, you know, stay tuned.</p><p> CHANG:  All right.  Bobby Franklin, CEO of the National Venture Capital  Association, Alex Wayne of Bloomberg News.  Thank you both for joining us.</p><p> Eric Hippeau, managing partner of Lerer Hippeau Ventures and my guest host  for the hour, you are sticking with me.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> CHANG:  Still with us, Eric Hippeau, managing partner at Lerer Hippeau  Ventures, we have to talk about this, of course, because we're in New York  today.</p><p> What do you think the likelihood of that -- of Amazon ending up here?</p><p> HIPPEAU:  Well, we would love it, obviously, 50,000 tech workers or quasi- tech workers in Brooklyn that would be fantastic.</p><p> I think the chances are pretty low.  New York is a very expensive place to  set up a business.</p><p> And we -- in the current administration, New York is not particularly  business-friendly.  So I'm not even sure that New York is bidding.</p><p> CHANG:  Where is business-friendly under the current administration?</p><p> HIPPEAU:  Well, I was talking about the local administration, but, you  know, but I think that New York should be looking for those kinds of  opportunities.</p><p> Because those are the kinds of jobs at a higher-paying, that are, you know,  information-based essentially that we need is that -- but I don't know that  the City of New York is actually even active in looking at attracting them.</p><p> CHANG:  So what do you -- I mean, what do you think Amazon should be  looking for in their second headquarters since they can't -- they can't  build out its headquarters in Seattle their capacity.  What should they be  looking for elsewhere?</p><p> HIPPEAU:  I think it needs a city or a place where there's a lot of higher  education, a lot of young people that who are looking for the jobs of the  new economy, and a business-friendly environment.</p><p> CHANG:  We do have some (INAUDIBLE) from the mayor of Philadelphia,  obviously, a lot of cities competing for this now.  Take a listen.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MAYOR JIM KENNEY, PHILADELPHIA, PENNSYLVANIA:  We've gotten criticism, you  know, about corporate tax breaks and that alike.  This is too big of a  deal, and it's too many jobs and too great of a company for us not to go  after it.  And we would love to have it here.</p><p> We have a lot of folks who could use the work and we have a lot of IT  startups and tech companies that have come into Philadelphia recently.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CHANG:  So Philadelphia throwing their hat in the ring as well.  How does  the city benefit?</p><p> HIPPEAU:  Well, you do have to give them some tax breaks, I imagine.  But  on the other hand, you're providing 50,000 really good paying jobs, there  are people who will pay taxes themselves and who will buy local products  and services.</p><p> So it's a -- it's a definite plus for the city.  New York just opened the  Cornell Tech, and Bloomberg is very much involved with that.</p><p> So it would actually go really well with attracting the headquarters or the  second headquarters of a big tech company.</p><p> CHANG:  And I wonder if New York would do a good job of attracting younger  talent, I mean, who doesn't want to live in New York, right?</p><p> HIPPEAU:  Exactly, New York -- New York, well, that's why, I mean, New  York, most of my companies are here.  It's a great place for startups and  most people love to be in New York.</p><p> There's a lot of diversity and a lot of things to do.  But the city needs  to have a plan in place to be able to attract a company like Amazon.</p><p> CHANG:  How would you describe evolution of New York's tax scheme?  I mean,  obviously, it's always been -- it's always placed second to Silicon Valley  to a certain extent, though, you know, many of the big tech companies have  offices here as well and the scene is changing.  You know, how much closer  is Silicon Alley to Silicon Valley these days?</p><p> HIPPEAU:  Well, today, Silicon Alley of New York is the second largest  center of technology in United States, one of the largest in the world.</p><p> And what New York does when it's good at.  New York is good at software  development, New York is good at applications and services.</p><p> We're not going to be reinventing the plumbing of the Internet, we're not  going to create the next generation of routers.</p><p> However, we're starting to see robotics companies, we're starting to see,  you know, all kinds of companies and all kinds of sectors because we have  access in New York to the same technology that people in Silicon Valley  have.</p><p> CHANG:  When is that 10 billion dollar company going to be coming out in  New York, that 10 billion dollar tech company?</p><p> HIPPEAU:  Hopefully, it's in the pipeline.  There's a whole number of  companies which have to reach the billion dollar, at least, in the private  market valuation that, I think, have the potential to be one of those  companies.</p><p> CHANG:  All right.  Eric Hippeau, Lerer Hippeau Ventures, you are sticking  with me.  Thank you</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> CHANG:  Joining me now to discuss the latest in this ongoing saga,  Bloomberg's Mike Riley and still with us, Eric Hippeau, managing partner at  Lerer Hippeau Ventures.</p><p> Eric, you are shaking your head.  Mike, it is so hard not to read these  stories and not get incredibly angry.</p><p> It just gets worst and worst.  What do we know about this new breach and  how much they knew before they told the public?</p><p> MIKE RILEY, BLOOMBERG HOST:  We don't know a lot because they're not being  particularly clear about what they knew.  But we do know a couple of  important things.</p><p> One is that they had a major invest -- security investigation going on  starting in March and going through May.</p><p> They hired Mandiant, the same cyber security firm that they've brought back  in July.</p><p> And they were doing a pretty extensive investigation for three months.   Now, company like Mandiant, that's a pretty expensive prospect.</p><p> But the most interesting thing if you look at their timeline of the July  incident, the one that they found out about July is the hackers, even  though, they found out about the theft of, you know, this data in July.</p><p> When they did the investigation, when Mandiant came back in, they  discovered that that data was stolen in May, which would have put it right  in the middle of this earlier investigation.</p><p> So there's a question of like why that wasn't found, how do you get of a  company like Mandiant examining your networks and other things, and just  missed the presence of a -- of a hacker in your network, and the theft of  this kind of data.</p><p> It also raises this questions about, you know, what the executives knew  when -- whether they knew that the company was having multiple security  problems at the time they did trades in May and in late July, early August.</p><p> So, again, it raises just all sorts of questions.  And one of the things  that's clear is, you know, when a data breach like this, you want to get to  be as transparent with the public as possible and you want to do it as  early as possible.</p><p> And we just keep getting a trickle of new information really almost daily  now.</p><p> CHANG:  It feels like a mess and it feels like they're not being  transparent at all.  I mean, Eric, you probably have a credit card, right?   You probably among the 143 million people just like everyone else?</p><p> HIPPEAU:  Well, that -- it's shocking to me that, first of all, the CEO the  company is still the CEO of the company.  I don't understand what the board  of directors is going.</p><p> But, I think, what we're realizing here is that our data is ending in this  credit service bureaus without us knowing about it.</p><p> I mean, we suspect, of course, we got a credit score and all that.  But  they collect a very sensitive information about us without really our  authorization.</p><p> So the least you would expect is that the most important job that they do  is to maintain that data safe.</p><p> And if you have information on the majority of the American citizens, you  have to expect that there's a whole hacking world is going to come after  you.</p><p> CHANG:  Right, that's their one job, it's to make sure --</p><p> HIPPEAU:  That's your one job.</p><p> CHANG:  -- it's protected.</p><p> HIPPEAU:  And as your colleague just pointed out, if there's any kind of  breach and you need full transparency because how are we possibly going to  be able to trust this people again.</p><p> CHANG:  So, Mike, you know, we are getting -- you are getting new  information about the motivation of these hackers, potentially, that  they're interested in getting in to the big things.  You know, what do we - - what more do we know about the end goals of these attacks?</p><p> RILEY:  Well, again, we don't know a lot because the company doesn't  telling us a lot.  But keep in mind that one of the things we just know is  that if you have hackers in your system, in a system like Equifax, they're  probably not just going to look for one thing even something as valuable as  social security numbers and birth dates on a hundred and forty-three  million U.S. consumers.</p><p> Because Equifax serves a really keep a part of the financial infrastructure  of the country in general.  It has direct links between its system and the  bank systems through APIs.</p><p> And one of the things we did find out is that there is evidence that the  hackers, some hackers used those APIs to get in to at least one major bank  in Canada.</p><p> Now, that raises all sorts of questions about like what else the hackers  did with their time in Equifax.  I mean, keep in mind, again, that by their  own timeline they discovered the breach at the end of July.</p><p> But the hackers had been in there since at least middle of May.  What were  -- and when they took the big stash of data, what were they doing over the  next four months, that's the real question.</p><p> CHANG:  Equifax did announced the retirement of a couple of senior  executives but if there's still a lot of questions surrounding the share  sales, this executive share sale that happened, I mean, how is this fitting  in to the timeline of what we think they knew when?</p><p> RILEY:  Well, it raises some really interesting question.  And their time - - and their timeline is very specific, but it doesn't have much bigger  room.</p><p> What -- basically, what they're saying is they learned about the hack on  July 29th.  The share sales, like one group of share sales happened at the  beginning of August.</p><p> But there's a handful of days, two or three days between the time they  learned and the time of that sale occurred.</p><p> They are basically saying that the executives didn't know about the hack in  the span of those three days.</p><p> And even the people we talked to who work at Equifax say, \"That just seems  really unlikely.\"</p><p> I mean, a company like this has a protocol for what they do when they're  hacked.  And that protocol entails briefing the executives within a short  period of time and certainly not three days.</p><p> So it does raise a lot of questions, we do know that the U.S. prosecutors  have opened an investigation in to those sales because they want to find  out what those executives knew when and whether or not they violated  insider trading laws.</p><p> CHANG:  And so that -- last question, so what is the recourse for consumers  here?</p><p> RILEY:  Well, so keep in mind, this is -- this is a very different tact --  attack that they target because credit card numbers is a temporary thing  that you can just cancel and reissue.</p><p> What these hackers potentially got was very specific data that's at the  center of our confidential identities, birth dates, social security  numbers, and other things.</p><p> This is something that could be used to steal our identity, you know, any  time over the next -- in the next decades over our lifetime.</p><p> So consumers can do short-term things, they can get credit monitoring that  Equifax is offering for free, they can also try and freeze that access to  their credit reports which is typically a hard thing to do in a short-term  measure.</p><p> But what'll they do two years from now or five years from now or 10 years  from now when this data is still being used to steal identities.</p><p> CHANG:  Devastating.  All right.  Bloomberg's Mike Riley, thanks.  Can't  wait to see the scoop you bring up tomorrow.  Eric Hippeau, my guest host  for the hour of Lerer Hippeau Ventures, you are sticking with me.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> CHANG:  Still with us, Eric Hippeau, managing partner at Lerer Hippeau  Ventures, who was CEO of the Huffington Post, four times.  So what do you  think, will we see more media M&amp;A and if so, where?</p><p> HIPPEAU:  Well, for sure, because the traditional media companies need a  bigger additional footprint, bigger additional platforms.</p><p> They need to acquire technology.  They're basically not technology  companies.</p><p> And for the native media technology companies, to be part of a bigger  group, it gives them more resources, it gives them more opportunity to  distribute their content.  So it's a win-win for both.  So it's just --</p><p> CHANG:  So do you see a big consolidation happening?</p><p> HIPPEAU:  I do see -- I don't know how much of a consolidation, but if you  look at the deceleration of subscribers on cable, I think, this is  motivating a lot of people to say, \"Wait, did this uncapping of the cable  world is happening a lot faster than we expected.  We better prepare -- as  we are cash (INAUDIBLE) we better prepare for the future.\"</p><p> CHANG:  All right.  Eric Hippeau, you are sticking with me.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> CHANG:  For more, I want to get straight to our Bloomberg Tech reporter,  Sarah Frier, who covers Twitter and Facebook.</p><p> And still with us, Eric Hippeau of Lerer Hippeau Ventures.  So, Sarah, you  know, what do you make of this?  What do we know?</p><p> SARAH FRIER, BLOOMBERG HOST:  So, Burr, basically saying is -- if Facebook  says they don't have much to hide if they want to be transparent and  cooperative, how about do it in the public.</p><p> So although a date we're hearing hasn't been set, this is something that is  very important to the senators.</p><p> Obviously, Facebook, we know have given more information about the odds  related to the Russian spending to Mueller's Commission, the special  commission looking in to this.</p><p> So we're very much looking forward to anything that we can hear in the  public eye.</p><p> CHANG:  So does this mean we could see Mark Zuckerberg or Sheryl Sandberg  testifying before congress?</p><p> FRIER:  Yes, absolutely.  I think that that could be a possibility.  We  could also see, perhaps, Facebook head of security.</p><p> Anyone who might have more specific information about how this looks, maybe  that they're looking in to it on a -- on a granular level.  I -- but,  nothing has been confirmed yet.</p><p> CHANG:  Eric, what's your take on this story?</p><p> HIPPEAU:  Well, my take is that the issue is actually bigger than just the  Russian hack or whatever.  I think, we're actually in a new relationship  with our big tech companies.</p><p> We, for years, have left them alone.  It was completely less unfair  attitude because we want them to grow and want them to innovate.</p><p> But in (INAUDIBLE) on the eyes of society as users and of government that  this -- that they're really not transparent.  They're not -- they're not  telling us what they're doing.</p><p> They change the algorithms without any start or any other expectations.   They deal with our data in ways that for instance, they -- we just learned  that they allowed people to target races and white supremacies.</p><p> How is that possible?  So they hide in some ways behind this notion that  they're just a utility.  That they're not responsible for the content,  they're not responsible for how the platform is being used.</p><p> And, I think, that society as users and of government, we're not saying,  \"That can't be true.\"  You know, you have to have responsibility, you have  to take charge of what's going on in your own platform.</p><p> CHANG:  Sarah, another story that just crossed European regulators are  going to be telling tech companies that they are going to be fined if they  don't take down terrorist-related content in a matter of hour, which I  wonder, A, is that -- is that possible and what might the reaction be?</p><p> FRIER:  I think that's absolutely going to be something that the company  will say, \"It's very difficult.\"  Of course, Twitter today announced that  it had removed a few 300,000 accounts from ISIS --</p><p> CHANG:  300,000?</p><p> FRIER:  -- about 20 percent --</p><p> CHANG:  300,000 accounts that they removed?  That's a lot.</p><p> FRIER:  That's a lot, it's 20 percent less than this time last year.  But  maybe that means that they're doing something to address the issue.</p><p> The problem the European Regulator say is that they want the company to  address this content within two hours and when it goes up.</p><p> That is very difficult for something, you know, Facebook has more than two  billion users now, and it's very difficult for them to possible that  content.</p><p> What the UN wants new is get these companies and start thinking about this,  the technological level.  Is there a way that they can address this issue  at scale without having to hire thousands of contractors support through  this or is that just in impossibility?</p><p> CHANG:  And yet, it's a problem, obviously, they've known about for a long  time.  Eric, do you think it's fair for them to say, \"We can't do it.  It's  too big.\"</p><p> HIPPEAU:  No, no, it's not.

Alex, I'm going to start with you. What do you make of this?</p><p>ALEX WAYNE, BLOOMBERG HOST: It's an interesting lawsuit. You know, a lot of previous test case it's really -- because this isn't the only rule that the <person><nameText>Trump administration </nameText></person>-- excuse me, Obama era rule, the <person><nameText>Trump administration </nameText></person>has stuck to delay, and then eventually get rid of.</p><p>The suit, as I understand it, challenges whether the Obama -- the <person><nameText>Trump administration </nameText></person>can do this without opening in a comment period first.</p><p>Now, I think, it's kind of a weird rule that the <person><nameText>Trump administration </nameText></person>is trying to resend, it seems like it would normally fit in to like sort of category of immigrants that the president would like to see more of in the United States.</p><p>He's advocated for a merit-based immigration system. But, I think, what's happening here politically is twofold.</p><p>One, Trump is really trying to establish his legacy as erasing Obama's legacy including just about every rule that Obama issued late in his presidency.</p><p>And two, there are -- there are serious immigration restrictions within this administration. People who think there should be lower legal immigration overall.</p><p>And so by repealing this rule, those folks are probably trying to achieve some of their goals.</p><p>CHANG: Bobby, why file this suit? What do you hope to accomplish?</p><p>BOBBY FRANKLIN, CEO, NATIONAL VENTURE CAPITAL ASSOCIATION: Well, we hope to get the rule enacted, we hope to make sure that DHS is in a position to accept applications.</p><p>Emily, this is about a competition that the U.S. is in with the rest of the world. In other countries are literally rolling out red carpets.</p><p>You look at Canada, you look at Great Britain, France, Singapore, all across the globe, they recognize that there are talents in entrepreneurs.</p><p>They're trying to attract them to their country to start and grow this new company on their soil.</p><p>And what are we doing, we've got red tape. It's not a partisan issue, it's not against <person><nameText>President Trump, </nameText></person>it's not against <person><nameText>President Obama.</nameText></person></p><p>In fact, both of them have talked about the importance of bringing international entrepreneurs that can frankly get capital anywhere across the globe.</p><p>Bringing them here to our country and making sure that we grow U.S. jobs in the economy.</p><p>CHANG: Eric, you are an immigrant, you're an entrepreneur, you're an investor. What's your take?</p><p>ERIC HIPPEAU, MANAGING PARTNER, LERER HIPPEAU VENTURES: Well, my take is that foreign-entrepreneurs coming in to the United States is a very desirable thing to do.</p><p>About half of our companies have at least one member of the original team, the founding team, who is an immigrant. I'm an immigrant.</p><p>And these are people who make huge contributions to our economy, to our society. And I don't see why we would make it difficult for them to come.</p><p>And as Bobby just mentioned, they can go elsewhere. They can go to Canada, they can go to France, they can go to other places. We are competing with other nations.</p><p>CHANG: Obviously, <person><nameText>President Trump's, </nameText></person>you know, explanation here is creating U.S. jobs, making sure that U.S. workers have a place to work.</p><p>Bobby, what about the idea this is -- that this is merely a stop gap measure in any way when immigration reform in general is broken?</p><p>FRANKLIN: Well, it is broken. And we've been working on this issue for many years. Back in 2013, we had the opportunity to get a start of these passed through the U.S. senate.</p><p>But it didn't make it all the way in to law. Each year, we work with congress to try to get them to pass legislation.</p><p>There are bills in this congress introduced by both Republicans and Democrats that would create a start of these that would make it easier for these entrepreneurs to come here and start companies.</p><p>But in the absence of legislation, making it in to law, we have to do what we can.</p><p>And DHS promulgated the rule, they went through comment, and noticed, and we had a rule ready to take effect July 17th.</p><p>And one week before that, DHS decided to resend that, we don't think they follow proper procedure under the administrator procedures act.</p><p>And it's the only thing that we have to go on right now to try to get more entrepreneurs here in our country.</p><p>CHANG: Now, Alex, obviously, there have been conflicting messages from the administration when it comes to this, when it comes to DACA, when it comes to immigration reform, in general.</p><p>What are the next legislative steps that we actually expect to see in the coming days and weeks when it comes to, you know, taking action on what the president has signaled?</p><p>WAYNE: So the priority in the immediate future is to do something about DACA, the so-called Dreamers, these young immigrants brought to the country illegally by their parents.</p><p>Democrats say they struck a deal with Trump to deal with -- to handle that issue and resolve that issue.</p><p>I have not heard anything, any kind of a legislative resolution of this issue, entrepreneur, immigrants.</p><p>So I would not expect that to be tackled by congress in the near future if it all -- perhaps, it could be part of a comprehensive immigration bill.</p><p>But that's the way in the future, that's not even under consideration right now.</p><p>CHANG: So, Eric, have any of these moves impacted your entrepreneurs in any way? I mean, are people nervous or are they changing their plans?</p><p>HIPPEAU: Well, by definition, we back people who are here legally, who are with a visa or because they were, you know, they're here -- were under weather reforms.</p><p>So -- but the community is nervous, the community is saying, \"You know, I was welcomed when I came here and this is my dream. My dream is the United States that's' why I'm here.\"</p><p>\"Why is this changing, why am I not, you know, part of this, you know, great community?\" So this is a great degree of anxiety within the community.</p><p>CHANG: Right. Bobby, any response to the lawsuit so far?</p><p>FRANKLIN: Not yet, but, you know, we'll take the next steps. We'll likely file an injunction to try to get DHS to move forward, you know, stay tuned.</p><p>CHANG: All right. Bobby Franklin, CEO of the National Venture Capital Association, Alex Wayne of Bloomberg News. Thank you both for joining us.</p><p>Eric Hippeau, managing partner of Lerer Hippeau Ventures and my guest host for the hour, you are sticking with me.</p><p>CHANG: Still with us, Eric Hippeau, managing partner at Lerer Hippeau Ventures, we have to talk about this, of course, because we're in New York today.</p><p>What do you think the likelihood of that -- of Amazon ending up here?</p><p>HIPPEAU: Well, we would love it, obviously, 50,000 tech workers or quasi- tech workers in Brooklyn that would be fantastic.</p><p>I think the chances are pretty low. New York is a very expensive place to set up a business.</p><p>And we -- in the current administration, New York is not particularly business-friendly. So I'm not even sure that New York is bidding.</p><p>CHANG: Where is business-friendly under the current administration?</p><p>HIPPEAU: Well, I was talking about the local administration, but, you know, but I think that New York should be looking for those kinds of opportunities.</p><p>Because those are the kinds of jobs at a higher-paying, that are, you know, information-based essentially that we need is that -- but I don't know that the City of New York is actually even active in looking at attracting them.</p><p>CHANG: So what do you -- I mean, what do you think Amazon should be looking for in their second headquarters since they can't -- they can't build out its headquarters in Seattle their capacity. What should they be looking for elsewhere?</p><p>HIPPEAU: I think it needs a city or a place where there's a lot of higher education, a lot of young people that who are looking for the jobs of the new economy, and a business-friendly environment.</p><p>CHANG: We do have some (INAUDIBLE) from the mayor of Philadelphia, obviously, a lot of cities competing for this now. Take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MAYOR JIM KENNEY, PHILADELPHIA, PENNSYLVANIA: We've gotten criticism, you know, about corporate tax breaks and that alike. This is too big of a deal, and it's too many jobs and too great of a company for us not to go after it. And we would love to have it here.</p><p>We have a lot of folks who could use the work and we have a lot of IT startups and tech companies that have come into Philadelphia recently.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHANG: So Philadelphia throwing their hat in the ring as well. How does the city benefit?</p><p>HIPPEAU: Well, you do have to give them some tax breaks, I imagine. But on the other hand, you're providing 50,000 really good paying jobs, there are people who will pay taxes themselves and who will buy local products and services.</p><p>So it's a -- it's a definite plus for the city. New York just opened the Cornell Tech, and Bloomberg is very much involved with that.</p><p>So it would actually go really well with attracting the headquarters or the second headquarters of a big tech company.</p><p>CHANG: And I wonder if New York would do a good job of attracting younger talent, I mean, who doesn't want to live in New York, right?</p><p>HIPPEAU: Exactly, New York -- New York, well, that's why, I mean, New York, most of my companies are here. It's a great place for startups and most people love to be in New York.</p><p>There's a lot of diversity and a lot of things to do. But the city needs to have a plan in place to be able to attract a company like Amazon.</p><p>CHANG: How would you describe evolution of New York's tax scheme? I mean, obviously, it's always been -- it's always placed second to Silicon Valley to a certain extent, though, you know, many of the big tech companies have offices here as well and the scene is changing. You know, how much closer is Silicon Alley to Silicon Valley these days?</p><p>HIPPEAU: Well, today, Silicon Alley of New York is the second largest center of technology in United States, one of the largest in the world.</p><p>And what New York does when it's good at. New York is good at software development, New York is good at applications and services.</p><p>We're not going to be reinventing the plumbing of the Internet, we're not going to create the next generation of routers.</p><p>However, we're starting to see robotics companies, we're starting to see, you know, all kinds of companies and all kinds of sectors because we have access in New York to the same technology that people in Silicon Valley have.</p><p>CHANG: When is that 10 billion dollar company going to be coming out in New York, that 10 billion dollar tech company?</p><p>HIPPEAU: Hopefully, it's in the pipeline. There's a whole number of companies which have to reach the billion dollar, at least, in the private market valuation that, I think, have the potential to be one of those companies.</p><p>CHANG: All right. Eric Hippeau, Lerer Hippeau Ventures, you are sticking with me. Thank you</p><p>CHANG: Joining me now to discuss the latest in this ongoing saga, Bloomberg's Mike Riley and still with us, Eric Hippeau, managing partner at Lerer Hippeau Ventures.</p><p>Eric, you are shaking your head. Mike, it is so hard not to read these stories and not get incredibly angry.</p><p>It just gets worst and worst. What do we know about this new breach and how much they knew before they told the public?</p><p>MIKE RILEY, BLOOMBERG HOST: We don't know a lot because they're not being particularly clear about what they knew. But we do know a couple of important things.</p><p>One is that they had a major invest -- security investigation going on starting in March and going through May.</p><p>They hired Mandiant, the same cyber security firm that they've brought back in July.</p><p>And they were doing a pretty extensive investigation for three months. Now, company like Mandiant, that's a pretty expensive prospect.</p><p>But the most interesting thing if you look at their timeline of the July incident, the one that they found out about July is the hackers, even though, they found out about the theft of, you know, this data in July.</p><p>When they did the investigation, when Mandiant came back in, they discovered that that data was stolen in May, which would have put it right in the middle of this earlier investigation.</p><p>So there's a question of like why that wasn't found, how do you get of a company like Mandiant examining your networks and other things, and just missed the presence of a -- of a hacker in your network, and the theft of this kind of data.</p><p>It also raises this questions about, you know, what the executives knew when -- whether they knew that the company was having multiple security problems at the time they did trades in May and in late July, early August.</p><p>So, again, it raises just all sorts of questions. And one of the things that's clear is, you know, when a data breach like this, you want to get to be as transparent with the public as possible and you want to do it as early as possible.</p><p>And we just keep getting a trickle of new information really almost daily now.</p><p>CHANG: It feels like a mess and it feels like they're not being transparent at all. I mean, Eric, you probably have a credit card, right? You probably among the 143 million people just like everyone else?</p><p>HIPPEAU: Well, that -- it's shocking to me that, first of all, the CEO the company is still the CEO of the company. I don't understand what the board of directors is going.</p><p>But, I think, what we're realizing here is that our data is ending in this credit service bureaus without us knowing about it.</p><p>I mean, we suspect, of course, we got a credit score and all that. But they collect a very sensitive information about us without really our authorization.</p><p>So the least you would expect is that the most important job that they do is to maintain that data safe.</p><p>And if you have information on the majority of the American citizens, you have to expect that there's a whole hacking world is going to come after you.</p><p>CHANG: Right, that's their one job, it's to make sure --</p><p>HIPPEAU: That's your one job.</p><p>CHANG: -- it's protected.</p><p>HIPPEAU: And as your colleague just pointed out, if there's any kind of breach and you need full transparency because how are we possibly going to be able to trust this people again.</p><p>CHANG: So, Mike, you know, we are getting -- you are getting new information about the motivation of these hackers, potentially, that they're interested in getting in to the big things. You know, what do we - - what more do we know about the end goals of these attacks?</p><p>RILEY: Well, again, we don't know a lot because the company doesn't telling us a lot. But keep in mind that one of the things we just know is that if you have hackers in your system, in a system like Equifax, they're probably not just going to look for one thing even something as valuable as social security numbers and birth dates on a hundred and forty-three million U.S. consumers.</p><p>Because Equifax serves a really keep a part of the financial infrastructure of the country in general. It has direct links between its system and the bank systems through APIs.</p><p>And one of the things we did find out is that there is evidence that the hackers, some hackers used those APIs to get in to at least one major bank in Canada.</p><p>Now, that raises all sorts of questions about like what else the hackers did with their time in Equifax. I mean, keep in mind, again, that by their own timeline they discovered the breach at the end of July.</p><p>But the hackers had been in there since at least middle of May. What were -- and when they took the big stash of data, what were they doing over the next four months, that's the real question.</p><p>CHANG: Equifax did announced the retirement of a couple of senior executives but if there's still a lot of questions surrounding the share sales, this executive share sale that happened, I mean, how is this fitting in to the timeline of what we think they knew when?</p><p>RILEY: Well, it raises some really interesting question. And their time - - and their timeline is very specific, but it doesn't have much bigger room.</p><p>What -- basically, what they're saying is they learned about the hack on July 29th. The share sales, like one group of share sales happened at the beginning of August.</p><p>But there's a handful of days, two or three days between the time they learned and the time of that sale occurred.</p><p>They are basically saying that the executives didn't know about the hack in the span of those three days.</p><p>And even the people we talked to who work at Equifax say, \"That just seems really unlikely.\"</p><p>I mean, a company like this has a protocol for what they do when they're hacked. And that protocol entails briefing the executives within a short period of time and certainly not three days.</p><p>So it does raise a lot of questions, we do know that the U.S. prosecutors have opened an investigation in to those sales because they want to find out what those executives knew when and whether or not they violated insider trading laws.</p><p>CHANG: And so that -- last question, so what is the recourse for consumers here?</p><p>RILEY: Well, so keep in mind, this is -- this is a very different tact -- attack that they target because credit card numbers is a temporary thing that you can just cancel and reissue.</p><p>What these hackers potentially got was very specific data that's at the center of our confidential identities, birth dates, social security numbers, and other things.</p><p>This is something that could be used to steal our identity, you know, any time over the next -- in the next decades over our lifetime.</p><p>So consumers can do short-term things, they can get credit monitoring that Equifax is offering for free, they can also try and freeze that access to their credit reports which is typically a hard thing to do in a short-term measure.</p><p>But what'll they do two years from now or five years from now or 10 years from now when this data is still being used to steal identities.</p><p>CHANG: Devastating. All right. Bloomberg's Mike Riley, thanks. Can't wait to see the scoop you bring up tomorrow. Eric Hippeau, my guest host for the hour of Lerer Hippeau Ventures, you are sticking with me.</p><p>CHANG: Still with us, Eric Hippeau, managing partner at Lerer Hippeau Ventures, who was CEO of the Huffington Post, four times. So what do you think, will we see more media M&amp;A and if so, where?</p><p>HIPPEAU: Well, for sure, because the traditional media companies need a bigger additional footprint, bigger additional platforms.</p><p>They need to acquire technology. They're basically not technology companies.</p><p>And for the native media technology companies, to be part of a bigger group, it gives them more resources, it gives them more opportunity to distribute their content. So it's a win-win for both. So it's just --</p><p>CHANG: So do you see a big consolidation happening?</p><p>HIPPEAU: I do see -- I don't know how much of a consolidation, but if you look at the deceleration of subscribers on cable, I think, this is motivating a lot of people to say, \"Wait, did this uncapping of the cable world is happening a lot faster than we expected. We better prepare -- as we are cash (INAUDIBLE) we better prepare for the future.\"</p><p>CHANG: All right. Eric Hippeau, you are sticking with me.</p><p>CHANG: For more, I want to get straight to our Bloomberg Tech reporter, Sarah Frier, who covers Twitter and Facebook.</p><p>And still with us, Eric Hippeau of Lerer Hippeau Ventures. So, Sarah, you know, what do you make of this? What do we know?</p><p>SARAH FRIER, BLOOMBERG HOST: So, Burr, basically saying is -- if Facebook says they don't have much to hide if they want to be transparent and cooperative, how about do it in the public.</p><p>So although a date we're hearing hasn't been set, this is something that is very important to the senators.</p><p>Obviously, Facebook, we know have given more information about the odds related to the Russian spending to Mueller's Commission, the special commission looking in to this.</p><p>So we're very much looking forward to anything that we can hear in the public eye.</p><p>CHANG: So does this mean we could see Mark Zuckerberg or Sheryl Sandberg testifying before congress?</p><p>FRIER: Yes, absolutely. I think that that could be a possibility. We could also see, perhaps, Facebook head of security.</p><p>Anyone who might have more specific information about how this looks, maybe that they're looking in to it on a -- on a granular level. I -- but, nothing has been confirmed yet.</p><p>CHANG: Eric, what's your take on this story?</p><p>HIPPEAU: Well, my take is that the issue is actually bigger than just the Russian hack or whatever. I think, we're actually in a new relationship with our big tech companies.</p><p>We, for years, have left them alone. It was completely less unfair attitude because we want them to grow and want them to innovate.</p><p>But in (INAUDIBLE) on the eyes of society as users and of government that this -- that they're really not transparent. They're not -- they're not telling us what they're doing.</p><p>They change the algorithms without any start or any other expectations. They deal with our data in ways that for instance, they -- we just learned that they allowed people to target races and white supremacies.</p><p>How is that possible? So they hide in some ways behind this notion that they're just a utility. That they're not responsible for the content, they're not responsible for how the platform is being used.</p><p>And, I think, that society as users and of government, we're not saying, \"That can't be true.\" You know, you have to have responsibility, you have to take charge of what's going on in your own platform.</p><p>CHANG: Sarah, another story that just crossed European regulators are going to be telling tech companies that they are going to be fined if they don't take down terrorist-related content in a matter of hour, which I wonder, A, is that -- is that possible and what might the reaction be?</p><p>FRIER: I think that's absolutely going to be something that the company will say, \"It's very difficult.\" Of course, Twitter today announced that it had removed a few 300,000 accounts from ISIS --</p><p>CHANG: 300,000?</p><p>FRIER: -- about 20 percent --</p><p>CHANG: 300,000 accounts that they removed? That's a lot.</p><p>FRIER: That's a lot, it's 20 percent less than this time last year. But maybe that means that they're doing something to address the issue.</p><p>The problem the European Regulator say is that they want the company to address this content within two hours and when it goes up.</p><p>That is very difficult for something, you know, Facebook has more than two billion users now, and it's very difficult for them to possible that content.</p><p>What the UN wants new is get these companies and start thinking about this, the technological level. Is there a way that they can address this issue at scale without having to hire thousands of contractors support through this or is that just in impossibility?</p><p>CHANG: And yet, it's a problem, obviously, they've known about for a long time. Eric, do you think it's fair for them to say, \"We can't do it. It's too big.\"</p><p>HIPPEAU: No, no, it's not. And they -- and (INAUDIBLE) the measures that they've taken so far and they seemed to be working that well.</p><p>Facebook has added 2,000 curators, there's more technology, et cetera. But they're not doing enough. And they're certainly not reassuring us that they're doing enough for -- on this matter.</p><p>CHANG: Facebook though did say that they are hiring 3,000 extra workers to --</p><p>FRIER: And, Emily --</p><p>CHANG: -- flag the content. Go ahead, Sarah.</p><p>FRIER: I see --</p><p>CHANG: (INAUDIBLE) 30 seconds.</p><p>FRIER: -- I see that 3,000 workers cited in every post from Facebook on a problem they're trying to address. Those 3,000 workers are dealing with Ad fraud, fake news, hateful content, violate video, all these things. It's very interesting how much they're able to cope with.</p><p>CHANG: Well, they have a lot on their plate, apparently. Sarah Frier of Bloomberg News. I know you'll keep us posted on all these stories.</p><p>Eric Hippeau of Lerer Hippeau Ventures, thank you so much for joining us today.</p><p>HIPPEAU: Yes, my pleasure.</p><p>CHANG: Great to see you here in New York.</p><p>HIPPEAU: Thank you.</p><p>[*]</p><p>***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p>THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND OTHER INACCURACIES.

Alex, I'm  going to start with you.  What do you make of this?</p><p>ALEX WAYNE, BLOOMBERG HOST:  It's an interesting lawsuit.  You know, a lot  of previous test case it's really -- because this isn't the only rule that  the Trump administration -- excuse me, Obama era rule, the Trump  administration has stuck to delay, and then eventually get rid of.</p><p>The suit, as I understand it, challenges whether the Obama -- the Trump  administration can do this without opening in a comment period first.</p><p>Now, I think, it's kind of a weird rule that the Trump administration is  trying to resend, it seems like it would normally fit in to like sort of  category of immigrants that the president would like to see more of in the  United States.</p><p>He's advocated for a merit-based immigration system.  But, I think, what's  happening here politically is twofold.</p><p>One, Trump is really trying to establish his legacy as erasing Obama's  legacy including just about every rule that Obama issued late in his  presidency.</p><p>And two, there are -- there are serious immigration restrictions within  this administration.  People who think there should be lower legal  immigration overall.</p><p>And so by repealing this rule, those folks are probably trying to achieve  some of their goals.</p><p>CHANG:  Bobby, why file this suit?  What do you hope to accomplish?</p><p>BOBBY FRANKLIN, CEO, NATIONAL VENTURE CAPITAL ASSOCIATION:  Well, we hope  to get the rule enacted, we hope to make sure that DHS is in a position to  accept applications.</p><p>Emily, this is about a competition that the U.S. is in with the rest of the  world.  In other countries are literally rolling out red carpets.</p><p>You look at Canada, you look at Great Britain, France, Singapore, all  across the globe, they recognize that there are talents in entrepreneurs.</p><p>They're trying to attract them to their country to start and grow this new  company on their soil.</p><p>And what are we doing, we've got red tape.  It's not a partisan issue, it's  not against President Trump, it's not against President Obama.</p><p>In fact, both of them have talked about the importance of bringing  international entrepreneurs that can frankly get capital anywhere across  the globe.</p><p>Bringing them here to our country and making sure that we grow U.S. jobs in  the economy.</p><p>CHANG:  Eric, you are an immigrant, you're an entrepreneur, you're an  investor.  What's your take?</p><p>ERIC HIPPEAU, MANAGING PARTNER, LERER HIPPEAU VENTURES:  Well, my take is  that foreign-entrepreneurs coming in to the United States is a very  desirable thing to do.</p><p>About half of our companies have at least one member of the original team,  the founding team, who is an immigrant.  I'm an immigrant.</p><p>And these are people who make huge contributions to our economy, to our  society.  And I don't see why we would make it difficult for them to come.</p><p>And as Bobby just mentioned, they can go elsewhere.  They can go to Canada,  they can go to France, they can go to other places.  We are competing with  other nations.</p><p>CHANG:  Obviously, President Trump's, you know, explanation here is  creating U.S. jobs, making sure that U.S. workers have a place to work.</p><p>Bobby, what about the idea this is -- that this is merely a stop gap  measure in any way when immigration reform in general is broken?</p><p>FRANKLIN:  Well, it is broken.  And we've been working on this issue for  many years.  Back in 2013, we had the opportunity to get a start of these  passed through the U.S. senate.</p><p>But it didn't make it all the way in to law.  Each year, we work with  congress to try to get them to pass legislation.</p><p>There are bills in this congress introduced by both Republicans and  Democrats that would create a start of these that would make it easier for  these entrepreneurs to come here and start companies.</p><p>But in the absence of legislation, making it in to law, we have to do what  we can.</p><p>And DHS promulgated the rule, they went through comment, and noticed, and  we had a rule ready to take effect July 17th.</p><p>And one week before that, DHS decided to resend that, we don't think they  follow proper procedure under the administrator procedures act.</p><p>And it's the only thing that we have to go on right now to try to get more  entrepreneurs here in our country.</p><p>CHANG:  Now, Alex, obviously, there have been conflicting messages from the  administration when it comes to this, when it comes to DACA, when it comes  to immigration reform, in general.</p><p>What are the next legislative steps that we actually expect to see in the  coming days and weeks when it comes to, you know, taking action on what the  president has signaled?</p><p>WAYNE:  So the priority in the immediate future is to do something about  DACA, the so-called Dreamers, these young immigrants brought to the country  illegally by their parents.</p><p>Democrats say they struck a deal with Trump to deal with -- to handle that  issue and resolve that issue.</p><p>I have not heard anything, any kind of a legislative resolution of this  issue, entrepreneur, immigrants.</p><p>So I would not expect that to be tackled by congress in the near future if  it all -- perhaps, it could be part of a comprehensive immigration bill.</p><p>But that's the way in the future, that's not even under consideration right  now.</p><p>CHANG:  So, Eric, have any of these moves impacted your entrepreneurs in  any way?  I mean, are people nervous or are they changing their plans?</p><p>HIPPEAU:  Well, by definition, we back people who are here legally, who are  with a visa or because they were, you know, they're here -- were under  weather reforms.</p><p>So -- but the community is nervous, the community is saying, \"You know, I  was welcomed when I came here and this is my dream.  My dream is the United  States that's' why I'm here.\"</p><p>\"Why is this changing, why am I not, you know, part of this, you know,  great community?\"  So this is a great degree of anxiety within the  community.</p><p>CHANG:  Right.  Bobby, any response to the lawsuit so far?</p><p>FRANKLIN:  Not yet, but, you know, we'll take the next steps.  We'll likely  file an injunction to try to get DHS to move forward, you know, stay tuned.</p><p>CHANG:  All right.  Bobby Franklin, CEO of the National Venture Capital  Association, Alex Wayne of Bloomberg News.  Thank you both for joining us.</p><p>Eric Hippeau, managing partner of Lerer Hippeau Ventures and my guest host  for the hour, you are sticking with me.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CHANG:  Still with us, Eric Hippeau, managing partner at Lerer Hippeau  Ventures, we have to talk about this, of course, because we're in New York  today.</p><p>What do you think the likelihood of that -- of Amazon ending up here?</p><p>HIPPEAU:  Well, we would love it, obviously, 50,000 tech workers or quasi- tech workers in Brooklyn that would be fantastic.</p><p>I think the chances are pretty low.  New York is a very expensive place to  set up a business.</p><p>And we -- in the current administration, New York is not particularly  business-friendly.  So I'm not even sure that New York is bidding.</p><p>CHANG:  Where is business-friendly under the current administration?</p><p>HIPPEAU:  Well, I was talking about the local administration, but, you  know, but I think that New York should be looking for those kinds of  opportunities.</p><p>Because those are the kinds of jobs at a higher-paying, that are, you know,  information-based essentially that we need is that -- but I don't know that  the City of New York is actually even active in looking at attracting them.</p><p>CHANG:  So what do you -- I mean, what do you think Amazon should be  looking for in their second headquarters since they can't -- they can't  build out its headquarters in Seattle their capacity.  What should they be  looking for elsewhere?</p><p>HIPPEAU:  I think it needs a city or a place where there's a lot of higher  education, a lot of young people that who are looking for the jobs of the  new economy, and a business-friendly environment.</p><p>CHANG:  We do have some (INAUDIBLE) from the mayor of Philadelphia,  obviously, a lot of cities competing for this now.  Take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MAYOR JIM KENNEY, PHILADELPHIA, PENNSYLVANIA:  We've gotten criticism, you  know, about corporate tax breaks and that alike.  This is too big of a  deal, and it's too many jobs and too great of a company for us not to go  after it.  And we would love to have it here.</p><p>We have a lot of folks who could use the work and we have a lot of IT  startups and tech companies that have come into Philadelphia recently.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHANG:  So Philadelphia throwing their hat in the ring as well.  How does  the city benefit?</p><p>HIPPEAU:  Well, you do have to give them some tax breaks, I imagine.  But  on the other hand, you're providing 50,000 really good paying jobs, there  are people who will pay taxes themselves and who will buy local products  and services.</p><p>So it's a -- it's a definite plus for the city.  New York just opened the  Cornell Tech, and Bloomberg is very much involved with that.</p><p>So it would actually go really well with attracting the headquarters or the  second headquarters of a big tech company.</p><p>CHANG:  And I wonder if New York would do a good job of attracting younger  talent, I mean, who doesn't want to live in New York, right?</p><p>HIPPEAU:  Exactly, New York -- New York, well, that's why, I mean, New  York, most of my companies are here.  It's a great place for startups and  most people love to be in New York.</p><p>There's a lot of diversity and a lot of things to do.  But the city needs  to have a plan in place to be able to attract a company like Amazon.</p><p>CHANG:  How would you describe evolution of New York's tax scheme?  I mean,  obviously, it's always been -- it's always placed second to Silicon Valley  to a certain extent, though, you know, many of the big tech companies have  offices here as well and the scene is changing.  You know, how much closer  is Silicon Alley to Silicon Valley these days?</p><p>HIPPEAU:  Well, today, Silicon Alley of New York is the second largest  center of technology in United States, one of the largest in the world.</p><p>And what New York does when it's good at.  New York is good at software  development, New York is good at applications and services.</p><p>We're not going to be reinventing the plumbing of the Internet, we're not  going to create the next generation of routers.</p><p>However, we're starting to see robotics companies, we're starting to see,  you know, all kinds of companies and all kinds of sectors because we have  access in New York to the same technology that people in Silicon Valley  have.</p><p>CHANG:  When is that 10 billion dollar company going to be coming out in  New York, that 10 billion dollar tech company?</p><p>HIPPEAU:  Hopefully, it's in the pipeline.  There's a whole number of  companies which have to reach the billion dollar, at least, in the private  market valuation that, I think, have the potential to be one of those  companies.</p><p>CHANG:  All right.  Eric Hippeau, Lerer Hippeau Ventures, you are sticking  with me.  Thank you</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CHANG:  Joining me now to discuss the latest in this ongoing saga,  Bloomberg's Mike Riley and still with us, Eric Hippeau, managing partner at  Lerer Hippeau Ventures.</p><p>Eric, you are shaking your head.  Mike, it is so hard not to read these  stories and not get incredibly angry.</p><p>It just gets worst and worst.  What do we know about this new breach and  how much they knew before they told the public?</p><p>MIKE RILEY, BLOOMBERG HOST:  We don't know a lot because they're not being  particularly clear about what they knew.  But we do know a couple of  important things.</p><p>One is that they had a major invest -- security investigation going on  starting in March and going through May.</p><p>They hired Mandiant, the same cyber security firm that they've brought back  in July.</p><p>And they were doing a pretty extensive investigation for three months.   Now, company like Mandiant, that's a pretty expensive prospect.</p><p>But the most interesting thing if you look at their timeline of the July  incident, the one that they found out about July is the hackers, even  though, they found out about the theft of, you know, this data in July.</p><p>When they did the investigation, when Mandiant came back in, they  discovered that that data was stolen in May, which would have put it right  in the middle of this earlier investigation.</p><p>So there's a question of like why that wasn't found, how do you get of a  company like Mandiant examining your networks and other things, and just  missed the presence of a -- of a hacker in your network, and the theft of  this kind of data.</p><p>It also raises this questions about, you know, what the executives knew  when -- whether they knew that the company was having multiple security  problems at the time they did trades in May and in late July, early August.</p><p>So, again, it raises just all sorts of questions.  And one of the things  that's clear is, you know, when a data breach like this, you want to get to  be as transparent with the public as possible and you want to do it as  early as possible.</p><p>And we just keep getting a trickle of new information really almost daily  now.</p><p>CHANG:  It feels like a mess and it feels like they're not being  transparent at all.  I mean, Eric, you probably have a credit card, right?   You probably among the 143 million people just like everyone else?</p><p>HIPPEAU:  Well, that -- it's shocking to me that, first of all, the CEO the  company is still the CEO of the company.  I don't understand what the board  of directors is going.</p><p>But, I think, what we're realizing here is that our data is ending in this  credit service bureaus without us knowing about it.</p><p>I mean, we suspect, of course, we got a credit score and all that.  But  they collect a very sensitive information about us without really our  authorization.</p><p>So the least you would expect is that the most important job that they do  is to maintain that data safe.</p><p>And if you have information on the majority of the American citizens, you  have to expect that there's a whole hacking world is going to come after  you.</p><p>CHANG:  Right, that's their one job, it's to make sure --</p><p>HIPPEAU:  That's your one job.</p><p>CHANG:  -- it's protected.</p><p>HIPPEAU:  And as your colleague just pointed out, if there's any kind of  breach and you need full transparency because how are we possibly going to  be able to trust this people again.</p><p>CHANG:  So, Mike, you know, we are getting -- you are getting new  information about the motivation of these hackers, potentially, that  they're interested in getting in to the big things.  You know, what do we - - what more do we know about the end goals of these attacks?</p><p>RILEY:  Well, again, we don't know a lot because the company doesn't  telling us a lot.  But keep in mind that one of the things we just know is  that if you have hackers in your system, in a system like Equifax, they're  probably not just going to look for one thing even something as valuable as  social security numbers and birth dates on a hundred and forty-three  million U.S. consumers.</p><p>Because Equifax serves a really keep a part of the financial infrastructure  of the country in general.  It has direct links between its system and the  bank systems through APIs.</p><p>And one of the things we did find out is that there is evidence that the  hackers, some hackers used those APIs to get in to at least one major bank  in Canada.</p><p>Now, that raises all sorts of questions about like what else the hackers  did with their time in Equifax.  I mean, keep in mind, again, that by their  own timeline they discovered the breach at the end of July.</p><p>But the hackers had been in there since at least middle of May.  What were  -- and when they took the big stash of data, what were they doing over the  next four months, that's the real question.</p><p>CHANG:  Equifax did announced the retirement of a couple of senior  executives but if there's still a lot of questions surrounding the share  sales, this executive share sale that happened, I mean, how is this fitting  in to the timeline of what we think they knew when?</p><p>RILEY:  Well, it raises some really interesting question.  And their time - - and their timeline is very specific, but it doesn't have much bigger  room.</p><p>What -- basically, what they're saying is they learned about the hack on  July 29th.  The share sales, like one group of share sales happened at the  beginning of August.</p><p>But there's a handful of days, two or three days between the time they  learned and the time of that sale occurred.</p><p>They are basically saying that the executives didn't know about the hack in  the span of those three days.</p><p>And even the people we talked to who work at Equifax say, \"That just seems  really unlikely.\"</p><p>I mean, a company like this has a protocol for what they do when they're  hacked.  And that protocol entails briefing the executives within a short  period of time and certainly not three days.</p><p>So it does raise a lot of questions, we do know that the U.S. prosecutors  have opened an investigation in to those sales because they want to find  out what those executives knew when and whether or not they violated  insider trading laws.</p><p>CHANG:  And so that -- last question, so what is the recourse for consumers  here?</p><p>RILEY:  Well, so keep in mind, this is -- this is a very different tact --  attack that they target because credit card numbers is a temporary thing  that you can just cancel and reissue.</p><p>What these hackers potentially got was very specific data that's at the  center of our confidential identities, birth dates, social security  numbers, and other things.</p><p>This is something that could be used to steal our identity, you know, any  time over the next -- in the next decades over our lifetime.</p><p>So consumers can do short-term things, they can get credit monitoring that  Equifax is offering for free, they can also try and freeze that access to  their credit reports which is typically a hard thing to do in a short-term  measure.</p><p>But what'll they do two years from now or five years from now or 10 years  from now when this data is still being used to steal identities.</p><p>CHANG:  Devastating.  All right.  Bloomberg's Mike Riley, thanks.  Can't  wait to see the scoop you bring up tomorrow.  Eric Hippeau, my guest host  for the hour of Lerer Hippeau Ventures, you are sticking with me.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CHANG:  Still with us, Eric Hippeau, managing partner at Lerer Hippeau  Ventures, who was CEO of the Huffington Post, four times.  So what do you  think, will we see more media M&amp;A and if so, where?</p><p>HIPPEAU:  Well, for sure, because the traditional media companies need a  bigger additional footprint, bigger additional platforms.</p><p>They need to acquire technology.  They're basically not technology  companies.</p><p>And for the native media technology companies, to be part of a bigger  group, it gives them more resources, it gives them more opportunity to  distribute their content.  So it's a win-win for both.  So it's just --</p><p>CHANG:  So do you see a big consolidation happening?</p><p>HIPPEAU:  I do see -- I don't know how much of a consolidation, but if you  look at the deceleration of subscribers on cable, I think, this is  motivating a lot of people to say, \"Wait, did this uncapping of the cable  world is happening a lot faster than we expected.  We better prepare -- as  we are cash (INAUDIBLE) we better prepare for the future.\"</p><p>CHANG:  All right.  Eric Hippeau, you are sticking with me.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CHANG:  For more, I want to get straight to our Bloomberg Tech reporter,  Sarah Frier, who covers Twitter and Facebook.</p><p>And still with us, Eric Hippeau of Lerer Hippeau Ventures.  So, Sarah, you  know, what do you make of this?  What do we know?</p><p>SARAH FRIER, BLOOMBERG HOST:  So, Burr, basically saying is -- if Facebook  says they don't have much to hide if they want to be transparent and  cooperative, how about do it in the public.</p><p>So although a date we're hearing hasn't been set, this is something that is  very important to the senators.</p><p>Obviously, Facebook, we know have given more information about the odds  related to the Russian spending to Mueller's Commission, the special  commission looking in to this.</p><p>So we're very much looking forward to anything that we can hear in the  public eye.</p><p>CHANG:  So does this mean we could see Mark Zuckerberg or Sheryl Sandberg  testifying before congress?</p><p>FRIER:  Yes, absolutely.  I think that that could be a possibility.  We  could also see, perhaps, Facebook head of security.</p><p>Anyone who might have more specific information about how this looks, maybe  that they're looking in to it on a -- on a granular level.  I -- but,  nothing has been confirmed yet.</p><p>CHANG:  Eric, what's your take on this story?</p><p>HIPPEAU:  Well, my take is that the issue is actually bigger than just the  Russian hack or whatever.  I think, we're actually in a new relationship  with our big tech companies.</p><p>We, for years, have left them alone.  It was completely less unfair  attitude because we want them to grow and want them to innovate.</p><p>But in (INAUDIBLE) on the eyes of society as users and of government that  this -- that they're really not transparent.  They're not -- they're not  telling us what they're doing.</p><p>They change the algorithms without any start or any other expectations.   They deal with our data in ways that for instance, they -- we just learned  that they allowed people to target races and white supremacies.</p><p>How is that possible?  So they hide in some ways behind this notion that  they're just a utility.  That they're not responsible for the content,  they're not responsible for how the platform is being used.</p><p>And, I think, that society as users and of government, we're not saying,  \"That can't be true.\"  You know, you have to have responsibility, you have  to take charge of what's going on in your own platform.</p><p>CHANG:  Sarah, another story that just crossed European regulators are  going to be telling tech companies that they are going to be fined if they  don't take down terrorist-related content in a matter of hour, which I  wonder, A, is that -- is that possible and what might the reaction be?</p><p>FRIER:  I think that's absolutely going to be something that the company  will say, \"It's very difficult.\"  Of course, Twitter today announced that  it had removed a few 300,000 accounts from ISIS --</p><p>CHANG:  300,000?</p><p>FRIER:  -- about 20 percent --</p><p>CHANG:  300,000 accounts that they removed?  That's a lot.</p><p>FRIER:  That's a lot, it's 20 percent less than this time last year.  But  maybe that means that they're doing something to address the issue.</p><p>The problem the European Regulator say is that they want the company to  address this content within two hours and when it goes up.</p><p>That is very difficult for something, you know, Facebook has more than two  billion users now, and it's very difficult for them to possible that  content.</p><p>What the UN wants new is get these companies and start thinking about this,  the technological level.  Is there a way that they can address this issue  at scale without having to hire thousands of contractors support through  this or is that just in impossibility?</p><p>CHANG:  And yet, it's a problem, obviously, they've known about for a long  time.  Eric, do you think it's fair for them to say, \"We can't do it.  It's  too big.\"</p><p>HIPPEAU:  No, no, it's not.  And they -- and (INAUDIBLE) the measures that  they've taken so far and they seemed to be working that well.</p><p>Facebook has added 2,000 curators, there's more technology, et cetera.  But  they're not doing enough.  And they're certainly not reassuring us that  they're doing enough for -- on this matter.</p><p>CHANG:  Facebook though did say that they are hiring 3,000 extra workers to  --</p><p>FRIER:  And, Emily --</p><p>CHANG:  -- flag the content.  Go ahead, Sarah.</p><p>FRIER:  I see --</p><p>CHANG:  (INAUDIBLE) 30 seconds.</p><p>FRIER:  -- I see that 3,000 workers cited in every post from Facebook on a  problem they're trying to address.  Those 3,000 workers are dealing with Ad  fraud, fake news, hateful content, violate video, all these things.  It's  very interesting how much they're able to cope with.</p><p>CHANG:  Well, they have a lot on their plate, apparently.  Sarah Frier of  Bloomberg News.  I know you'll keep us posted on all these stories.</p><p>Eric Hippeau of Lerer Hippeau Ventures, thank you so much for joining us  today.</p><p>HIPPEAU:  Yes, my pleasure.</p><p>CHANG:  Great to see you here in New York.</p><p>HIPPEAU:  Thank you.</p><p>[*]</p><p>***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p>THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND  OTHER INACCURACIES.

Alex, I'm going to start with you. What do you make of this?</p><p>ALEX WAYNE, BLOOMBERG HOST: It's an interesting lawsuit. You know, a lot of previous test case it's really -- because this isn't the only rule that the <person><nameText>Trump administration </nameText></person>-- excuse me, Obama era rule, the <person><nameText>Trump administration </nameText></person>has stuck to delay, and then eventually get rid of.</p><p>The suit, as I understand it, challenges whether the Obama -- the <person><nameText>Trump administration </nameText></person>can do this without opening in a comment period first.</p><p>Now, I think, it's kind of a weird rule that the <person><nameText>Trump administration </nameText></person>is trying to resend, it seems like it would normally fit in to like sort of category of immigrants that the president would like to see more of in the United States.</p><p>He's advocated for a merit-based immigration system. But, I think, what's happening here politically is twofold.</p><p>One, Trump is really trying to establish his legacy as erasing Obama's legacy including just about every rule that Obama issued late in his presidency.</p><p>And two, there are -- there are serious immigration restrictions within this administration. People who think there should be lower legal immigration overall.</p><p>And so by repealing this rule, those folks are probably trying to achieve some of their goals.</p><p>CHANG: Bobby, why file this suit? What do you hope to accomplish?</p><p>BOBBY FRANKLIN, CEO, NATIONAL VENTURE CAPITAL ASSOCIATION: Well, we hope to get the rule enacted, we hope to make sure that DHS is in a position to accept applications.</p><p>Emily, this is about a competition that the U.S. is in with the rest of the world. In other countries are literally rolling out red carpets.</p><p>You look at Canada, you look at Great Britain, France, Singapore, all across the globe, they recognize that there are talents in entrepreneurs.</p><p>They're trying to attract them to their country to start and grow this new company on their soil.</p><p>And what are we doing, we've got red tape. It's not a partisan issue, it's not against <person><nameText>President Trump, </nameText></person>it's not against <person><nameText>President Obama.</nameText></person></p><p>In fact, both of them have talked about the importance of bringing international entrepreneurs that can frankly get capital anywhere across the globe.</p><p>Bringing them here to our country and making sure that we grow U.S. jobs in the economy.</p><p>CHANG: Eric, you are an immigrant, you're an entrepreneur, you're an investor. What's your take?</p><p>ERIC HIPPEAU, MANAGING PARTNER, LERER HIPPEAU VENTURES: Well, my take is that foreign-entrepreneurs coming in to the United States is a very desirable thing to do.</p><p>About half of our companies have at least one member of the original team, the founding team, who is an immigrant. I'm an immigrant.</p><p>And these are people who make huge contributions to our economy, to our society. And I don't see why we would make it difficult for them to come.</p><p>And as Bobby just mentioned, they can go elsewhere. They can go to Canada, they can go to France, they can go to other places. We are competing with other nations.</p><p>CHANG: Obviously, <person><nameText>President Trump's, </nameText></person>you know, explanation here is creating U.S. jobs, making sure that U.S. workers have a place to work.</p><p>Bobby, what about the idea this is -- that this is merely a stop gap measure in any way when immigration reform in general is broken?</p><p>FRANKLIN: Well, it is broken. And we've been working on this issue for many years. Back in 2013, we had the opportunity to get a start of these passed through the U.S. senate.</p><p>But it didn't make it all the way in to law. Each year, we work with congress to try to get them to pass legislation.</p><p>There are bills in this congress introduced by both Republicans and Democrats that would create a start of these that would make it easier for these entrepreneurs to come here and start companies.</p><p>But in the absence of legislation, making it in to law, we have to do what we can.</p><p>And DHS promulgated the rule, they went through comment, and noticed, and we had a rule ready to take effect July 17th.</p><p>And one week before that, DHS decided to resend that, we don't think they follow proper procedure under the administrator procedures act.</p><p>And it's the only thing that we have to go on right now to try to get more entrepreneurs here in our country.</p><p>CHANG: Now, Alex, obviously, there have been conflicting messages from the administration when it comes to this, when it comes to DACA, when it comes to immigration reform, in general.</p><p>What are the next legislative steps that we actually expect to see in the coming days and weeks when it comes to, you know, taking action on what the president has signaled?</p><p>WAYNE: So the priority in the immediate future is to do something about DACA, the so-called Dreamers, these young immigrants brought to the country illegally by their parents.</p><p>Democrats say they struck a deal with Trump to deal with -- to handle that issue and resolve that issue.</p><p>I have not heard anything, any kind of a legislative resolution of this issue, entrepreneur, immigrants.</p><p>So I would not expect that to be tackled by congress in the near future if it all -- perhaps, it could be part of a comprehensive immigration bill.</p><p>But that's the way in the future, that's not even under consideration right now.</p><p>CHANG: So, Eric, have any of these moves impacted your entrepreneurs in any way? I mean, are people nervous or are they changing their plans?</p><p>HIPPEAU: Well, by definition, we back people who are here legally, who are with a visa or because they were, you know, they're here -- were under weather reforms.</p><p>So -- but the community is nervous, the community is saying, \"You know, I was welcomed when I came here and this is my dream. My dream is the United States that's' why I'm here.\"</p><p>\"Why is this changing, why am I not, you know, part of this, you know, great community?\" So this is a great degree of anxiety within the community.</p><p>CHANG: Right. Bobby, any response to the lawsuit so far?</p><p>FRANKLIN: Not yet, but, you know, we'll take the next steps. We'll likely file an injunction to try to get DHS to move forward, you know, stay tuned.</p><p>CHANG: All right. Bobby Franklin, CEO of the National Venture Capital Association, Alex Wayne of Bloomberg News. Thank you both for joining us.</p><p>Eric Hippeau, managing partner of Lerer Hippeau Ventures and my guest host for the hour, you are sticking with me.</p><p>CHANG: Still with us, Eric Hippeau, managing partner at Lerer Hippeau Ventures, we have to talk about this, of course, because we're in New York today.</p><p>What do you think the likelihood of that -- of Amazon ending up here?</p><p>HIPPEAU: Well, we would love it, obviously, 50,000 tech workers or quasi- tech workers in Brooklyn that would be fantastic.</p><p>I think the chances are pretty low. New York is a very expensive place to set up a business.</p><p>And we -- in the current administration, New York is not particularly business-friendly. So I'm not even sure that New York is bidding.</p><p>CHANG: Where is business-friendly under the current administration?</p><p>HIPPEAU: Well, I was talking about the local administration, but, you know, but I think that New York should be looking for those kinds of opportunities.</p><p>Because those are the kinds of jobs at a higher-paying, that are, you know, information-based essentially that we need is that -- but I don't know that the City of New York is actually even active in looking at attracting them.</p><p>CHANG: So what do you -- I mean, what do you think Amazon should be looking for in their second headquarters since they can't -- they can't build out its headquarters in Seattle their capacity. What should they be looking for elsewhere?</p><p>HIPPEAU: I think it needs a city or a place where there's a lot of higher education, a lot of young people that who are looking for the jobs of the new economy, and a business-friendly environment.</p><p>CHANG: We do have some (INAUDIBLE) from the mayor of Philadelphia, obviously, a lot of cities competing for this now. Take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MAYOR JIM KENNEY, PHILADELPHIA, PENNSYLVANIA: We've gotten criticism, you know, about corporate tax breaks and that alike. This is too big of a deal, and it's too many jobs and too great of a company for us not to go after it. And we would love to have it here.</p><p>We have a lot of folks who could use the work and we have a lot of IT startups and tech companies that have come into Philadelphia recently.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHANG: So Philadelphia throwing their hat in the ring as well. How does the city benefit?</p><p>HIPPEAU: Well, you do have to give them some tax breaks, I imagine. But on the other hand, you're providing 50,000 really good paying jobs, there are people who will pay taxes themselves and who will buy local products and services.</p><p>So it's a -- it's a definite plus for the city. New York just opened the Cornell Tech, and Bloomberg is very much involved with that.</p><p>So it would actually go really well with attracting the headquarters or the second headquarters of a big tech company.</p><p>CHANG: And I wonder if New York would do a good job of attracting younger talent, I mean, who doesn't want to live in New York, right?</p><p>HIPPEAU: Exactly, New York -- New York, well, that's why, I mean, New York, most of my companies are here. It's a great place for startups and most people love to be in New York.</p><p>There's a lot of diversity and a lot of things to do. But the city needs to have a plan in place to be able to attract a company like Amazon.</p><p>CHANG: How would you describe evolution of New York's tax scheme? I mean, obviously, it's always been -- it's always placed second to Silicon Valley to a certain extent, though, you know, many of the big tech companies have offices here as well and the scene is changing. You know, how much closer is Silicon Alley to Silicon Valley these days?</p><p>HIPPEAU: Well, today, Silicon Alley of New York is the second largest center of technology in United States, one of the largest in the world.</p><p>And what New York does when it's good at. New York is good at software development, New York is good at applications and services.</p><p>We're not going to be reinventing the plumbing of the Internet, we're not going to create the next generation of routers.</p><p>However, we're starting to see robotics companies, we're starting to see, you know, all kinds of companies and all kinds of sectors because we have access in New York to the same technology that people in Silicon Valley have.</p><p>CHANG: When is that 10 billion dollar company going to be coming out in New York, that 10 billion dollar tech company?</p><p>HIPPEAU: Hopefully, it's in the pipeline. There's a whole number of companies which have to reach the billion dollar, at least, in the private market valuation that, I think, have the potential to be one of those companies.</p><p>CHANG: All right. Eric Hippeau, Lerer Hippeau Ventures, you are sticking with me. Thank you</p><p>CHANG: Joining me now to discuss the latest in this ongoing saga, Bloomberg's Mike Riley and still with us, Eric Hippeau, managing partner at Lerer Hippeau Ventures.</p><p>Eric, you are shaking your head. Mike, it is so hard not to read these stories and not get incredibly angry.</p><p>It just gets worst and worst. What do we know about this new breach and how much they knew before they told the public?</p><p>MIKE RILEY, BLOOMBERG HOST: We don't know a lot because they're not being particularly clear about what they knew. But we do know a couple of important things.</p><p>One is that they had a major invest -- security investigation going on starting in March and going through May.</p><p>They hired Mandiant, the same cyber security firm that they've brought back in July.</p><p>And they were doing a pretty extensive investigation for three months. Now, company like Mandiant, that's a pretty expensive prospect.</p><p>But the most interesting thing if you look at their timeline of the July incident, the one that they found out about July is the hackers, even though, they found out about the theft of, you know, this data in July.</p><p>When they did the investigation, when Mandiant came back in, they discovered that that data was stolen in May, which would have put it right in the middle of this earlier investigation.</p><p>So there's a question of like why that wasn't found, how do you get of a company like Mandiant examining your networks and other things, and just missed the presence of a -- of a hacker in your network, and the theft of this kind of data.</p><p>It also raises this questions about, you know, what the executives knew when -- whether they knew that the company was having multiple security problems at the time they did trades in May and in late July, early August.</p><p>So, again, it raises just all sorts of questions. And one of the things that's clear is, you know, when a data breach like this, you want to get to be as transparent with the public as possible and you want to do it as early as possible.</p><p>And we just keep getting a trickle of new information really almost daily now.</p><p>CHANG: It feels like a mess and it feels like they're not being transparent at all. I mean, Eric, you probably have a credit card, right? You probably among the 143 million people just like everyone else?</p><p>HIPPEAU: Well, that -- it's shocking to me that, first of all, the CEO the company is still the CEO of the company. I don't understand what the board of directors is going.</p><p>But, I think, what we're realizing here is that our data is ending in this credit service bureaus without us knowing about it.</p><p>I mean, we suspect, of course, we got a credit score and all that. But they collect a very sensitive information about us without really our authorization.</p><p>So the least you would expect is that the most important job that they do is to maintain that data safe.</p><p>And if you have information on the majority of the American citizens, you have to expect that there's a whole hacking world is going to come after you.</p><p>CHANG: Right, that's their one job, it's to make sure --</p><p>HIPPEAU: That's your one job.</p><p>CHANG: -- it's protected.</p><p>HIPPEAU: And as your colleague just pointed out, if there's any kind of breach and you need full transparency because how are we possibly going to be able to trust this people again.</p><p>CHANG: So, Mike, you know, we are getting -- you are getting new information about the motivation of these hackers, potentially, that they're interested in getting in to the big things. You know, what do we - - what more do we know about the end goals of these attacks?</p><p>RILEY: Well, again, we don't know a lot because the company doesn't telling us a lot. But keep in mind that one of the things we just know is that if you have hackers in your system, in a system like Equifax, they're probably not just going to look for one thing even something as valuable as social security numbers and birth dates on a hundred and forty-three million U.S. consumers.</p><p>Because Equifax serves a really keep a part of the financial infrastructure of the country in general. It has direct links between its system and the bank systems through APIs.</p><p>And one of the things we did find out is that there is evidence that the hackers, some hackers used those APIs to get in to at least one major bank in Canada.</p><p>Now, that raises all sorts of questions about like what else the hackers did with their time in Equifax. I mean, keep in mind, again, that by their own timeline they discovered the breach at the end of July.</p><p>But the hackers had been in there since at least middle of May. What were -- and when they took the big stash of data, what were they doing over the next four months, that's the real question.</p><p>CHANG: Equifax did announced the retirement of a couple of senior executives but if there's still a lot of questions surrounding the share sales, this executive share sale that happened, I mean, how is this fitting in to the timeline of what we think they knew when?</p><p>RILEY: Well, it raises some really interesting question. And their time - - and their timeline is very specific, but it doesn't have much bigger room.</p><p>What -- basically, what they're saying is they learned about the hack on July 29th. The share sales, like one group of share sales happened at the beginning of August.</p><p>But there's a handful of days, two or three days between the time they learned and the time of that sale occurred.</p><p>They are basically saying that the executives didn't know about the hack in the span of those three days.</p><p>And even the people we talked to who work at Equifax say, \"That just seems really unlikely.\"</p><p>I mean, a company like this has a protocol for what they do when they're hacked. And that protocol entails briefing the executives within a short period of time and certainly not three days.</p><p>So it does raise a lot of questions, we do know that the U.S. prosecutors have opened an investigation in to those sales because they want to find out what those executives knew when and whether or not they violated insider trading laws.</p><p>CHANG: And so that -- last question, so what is the recourse for consumers here?</p><p>RILEY: Well, so keep in mind, this is -- this is a very different tact -- attack that they target because credit card numbers is a temporary thing that you can just cancel and reissue.</p><p>What these hackers potentially got was very specific data that's at the center of our confidential identities, birth dates, social security numbers, and other things.</p><p>This is something that could be used to steal our identity, you know, any time over the next -- in the next decades over our lifetime.</p><p>So consumers can do short-term things, they can get credit monitoring that Equifax is offering for free, they can also try and freeze that access to their credit reports which is typically a hard thing to do in a short-term measure.</p><p>But what'll they do two years from now or five years from now or 10 years from now when this data is still being used to steal identities.</p><p>CHANG: Devastating. All right. Bloomberg's Mike Riley, thanks. Can't wait to see the scoop you bring up tomorrow. Eric Hippeau, my guest host for the hour of Lerer Hippeau Ventures, you are sticking with me.</p><p>CHANG: Still with us, Eric Hippeau, managing partner at Lerer Hippeau Ventures, who was CEO of the Huffington Post, four times. So what do you think, will we see more media M&amp;A and if so, where?</p><p>HIPPEAU: Well, for sure, because the traditional media companies need a bigger additional footprint, bigger additional platforms.</p><p>They need to acquire technology. They're basically not technology companies.</p><p>And for the native media technology companies, to be part of a bigger group, it gives them more resources, it gives them more opportunity to distribute their content. So it's a win-win for both. So it's just --</p><p>CHANG: So do you see a big consolidation happening?</p><p>HIPPEAU: I do see -- I don't know how much of a consolidation, but if you look at the deceleration of subscribers on cable, I think, this is motivating a lot of people to say, \"Wait, did this uncapping of the cable world is happening a lot faster than we expected. We better prepare -- as we are cash (INAUDIBLE) we better prepare for the future.\"</p><p>CHANG: All right. Eric Hippeau, you are sticking with me.</p><p>CHANG: For more, I want to get straight to our Bloomberg Tech reporter, Sarah Frier, who covers Twitter and Facebook.</p><p>And still with us, Eric Hippeau of Lerer Hippeau Ventures. So, Sarah, you know, what do you make of this? What do we know?</p><p>SARAH FRIER, BLOOMBERG HOST: So, Burr, basically saying is -- if Facebook says they don't have much to hide if they want to be transparent and cooperative, how about do it in the public.</p><p>So although a date we're hearing hasn't been set, this is something that is very important to the senators.</p><p>Obviously, Facebook, we know have given more information about the odds related to the Russian spending to Mueller's Commission, the special commission looking in to this.</p><p>So we're very much looking forward to anything that we can hear in the public eye.</p><p>CHANG: So does this mean we could see Mark Zuckerberg or Sheryl Sandberg testifying before congress?</p><p>FRIER: Yes, absolutely. I think that that could be a possibility. We could also see, perhaps, Facebook head of security.</p><p>Anyone who might have more specific information about how this looks, maybe that they're looking in to it on a -- on a granular level. I -- but, nothing has been confirmed yet.</p><p>CHANG: Eric, what's your take on this story?</p><p>HIPPEAU: Well, my take is that the issue is actually bigger than just the Russian hack or whatever. I think, we're actually in a new relationship with our big tech companies.</p><p>We, for years, have left them alone. It was completely less unfair attitude because we want them to grow and want them to innovate.</p><p>But in (INAUDIBLE) on the eyes of society as users and of government that this -- that they're really not transparent. They're not -- they're not telling us what they're doing.</p><p>They change the algorithms without any start or any other expectations. They deal with our data in ways that for instance, they -- we just learned that they allowed people to target races and white supremacies.</p><p>How is that possible? So they hide in some ways behind this notion that they're just a utility. That they're not responsible for the content, they're not responsible for how the platform is being used.</p><p>And, I think, that society as users and of government, we're not saying, \"That can't be true.\" You know, you have to have responsibility, you have to take charge of what's going on in your own platform.</p><p>CHANG: Sarah, another story that just crossed European regulators are going to be telling tech companies that they are going to be fined if they don't take down terrorist-related content in a matter of hour, which I wonder, A, is that -- is that possible and what might the reaction be?</p><p>FRIER: I think that's absolutely going to be something that the company will say, \"It's very difficult.\" Of course, Twitter today announced that it had removed a few 300,000 accounts from ISIS --</p><p>CHANG: 300,000?</p><p>FRIER: -- about 20 percent --</p><p>CHANG: 300,000 accounts that they removed? That's a lot.</p><p>FRIER: That's a lot, it's 20 percent less than this time last year. But maybe that means that they're doing something to address the issue.</p><p>The problem the European Regulator say is that they want the company to address this content within two hours and when it goes up.</p><p>That is very difficult for something, you know, Facebook has more than two billion users now, and it's very difficult for them to possible that content.</p><p>What the UN wants new is get these companies and start thinking about this, the technological level. Is there a way that they can address this issue at scale without having to hire thousands of contractors support through this or is that just in impossibility?</p><p>CHANG: And yet, it's a problem, obviously, they've known about for a long time. Eric, do you think it's fair for them to say, \"We can't do it. It's too big.\"</p><p>HIPPEAU: No, no, it's not. And they -- and (INAUDIBLE) the measures that they've taken so far and they seemed to be working that well.</p><p>Facebook has added 2,000 curators, there's more technology, et cetera. But they're not doing enough. And they're certainly not reassuring us that they're doing enough for -- on this matter.</p><p>CHANG: Facebook though did say that they are hiring 3,000 extra workers to --</p><p>FRIER: And, Emily --</p><p>CHANG: -- flag the content. Go ahead, Sarah.</p><p>FRIER: I see --</p><p>CHANG: (INAUDIBLE) 30 seconds.</p><p>FRIER: -- I see that 3,000 workers cited in every post from Facebook on a problem they're trying to address. Those 3,000 workers are dealing with Ad fraud, fake news, hateful content, violate video, all these things. It's very interesting how much they're able to cope with.</p><p>CHANG: Well, they have a lot on their plate, apparently. Sarah Frier of Bloomberg News. I know you'll keep us posted on all these stories.</p><p>Eric Hippeau of Lerer Hippeau Ventures, thank you so much for joining us today.</p><p>HIPPEAU: Yes, my pleasure.</p><p>CHANG: Great to see you here in New York.</p><p>HIPPEAU: Thank you.</p><p>[*]</p><p>***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p>THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND OTHER INACCURACIES.

Alex, I'm going to start with you.  What do you make of this?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WAYNE</emphasis>:  It's an interesting lawsuit.  You know, a lot of previous test case it's really -- because this isn't the only rule that the Trump administration -- excuse me, Obama era rule, the Trump administration has stuck to delay, and then eventually get rid of.  </p><p>      The suit, as I understand it, challenges whether the Obama -- the Trump administration can do this without opening in a comment period first.  </p><p>      Now, I think, it's kind of a weird rule that the Trump administration is trying to resend, it seems like it would normally fit in to like sort of category of immigrants that the president would like to see more of in the United States.  </p><p>      He's advocated for a merit-based immigration system.  But, I think, what's happening here politically is twofold.  </p><p>      One, Trump is really trying to establish his legacy as erasing Obama's legacy including just about every rule that Obama issued late in his presidency.  </p><p>      And two, there are -- there are serious immigration restrictions within this administration.  People who think there should be lower legal immigration overall.  </p><p>      And so by repealing this rule, those folks are probably trying to achieve some of their goals.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANG</emphasis>:  Bobby, why file this suit?  What do you hope to accomplish?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRANKLIN</emphasis>:  Well, we hope to get the rule enacted, we hope to make sure that DHS is in a position to accept applications.  </p><p>      Emily, this is about a competition that the U.S. is in with the rest of the world.  In other countries are literally rolling out red carpets.  </p><p>      You look at Canada, you look at Great Britain, France, Singapore, all across the globe, they recognize that there are talents in entrepreneurs.  </p><p>      They're trying to attract them to their country to start and grow this new company on their soil.  </p><p>      And what are we doing, we've got red tape.  It's not a partisan issue, it's not against President Trump, it's not against President Obama.  </p><p>      In fact, both of them have talked about the importance of bringing international entrepreneurs that can frankly get capital anywhere across the globe.  </p><p>      Bringing them here to our country and making sure that we grow U.S. jobs in the economy.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANG</emphasis>:  Eric, you are an immigrant, you're an entrepreneur, you're an investor.  What's your take?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HIPPEAU</emphasis>:  Well, my take is that foreign-entrepreneurs coming in to the United States is a very desirable thing to do.  </p><p>      About half of our companies have at least one member of the original team, the founding team, who is an immigrant.  I'm an immigrant.  </p><p>      And these are people who make huge contributions to our economy, to our society.  And I don't see why we would make it difficult for them to come.  </p><p>      And as Bobby just mentioned, they can go elsewhere.  They can go to Canada, they can go to France, they can go to other places.  We are competing with other nations.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANG</emphasis>:  Obviously, President Trump's, you know, explanation here is creating U.S. jobs, making sure that U.S. workers have a place to work.  </p><p>      Bobby, what about the idea this is -- that this is merely a stop gap measure in any way when immigration reform in general is broken?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRANKLIN</emphasis>:  Well, it is broken.  And we've been working on this issue for many years.  Back in 2013, we had the opportunity to get a start of these passed through the U.S. senate.  </p><p>      But it didn't make it all the way in to law.  Each year, we work with congress to try to get them to pass legislation.  </p><p>      There are bills in this congress introduced by both Republicans and Democrats that would create a start of these that would make it easier for these entrepreneurs to come here and start companies.  </p><p>      But in the absence of legislation, making it in to law, we have to do what we can.  </p><p>      And DHS promulgated the rule, they went through comment, and noticed, and we had a rule ready to take effect July 17th.  </p><p>      And one week before that, DHS decided to resend that, we don't think they follow proper procedure under the administrator procedures act.  </p><p>      And it's the only thing that we have to go on right now to try to get more entrepreneurs here in our country.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANG</emphasis>:  Now, Alex, obviously, there have been conflicting messages from the administration when it comes to this, when it comes to DACA, when it comes to immigration reform, in general.  </p><p>      What are the next legislative steps that we actually expect to see in the coming days and weeks when it comes to, you know, taking action on what the president has signaled?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WAYNE</emphasis>:  So the priority in the immediate future is to do something about DACA, the so-called Dreamers, these young immigrants brought to the country illegally by their parents.  </p><p>      Democrats say they struck a deal with Trump to deal with -- to handle that issue and resolve that issue.  </p><p>      I have not heard anything, any kind of a legislative resolution of this issue, entrepreneur, immigrants.  </p><p>      So I would not expect that to be tackled by congress in the near future if it all -- perhaps, it could be part of a comprehensive immigration bill.  </p><p>      But that's the way in the future, that's not even under consideration right now.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANG</emphasis>:  So, Eric, have any of these moves impacted your entrepreneurs in any way?  I mean, are people nervous or are they changing their plans?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HIPPEAU</emphasis>:  Well, by definition, we back people who are here legally, who are with a visa or because they were, you know, they're here -- were under weather reforms.  </p><p>      So -- but the community is nervous, the community is saying, \"You know, I was welcomed when I came here and this is my dream.  My dream is the United States that's' why I'm here.\"  </p><p>      \"Why is this changing, why am I not, you know, part of this, you know, great community?\"  So this is a great degree of anxiety within the community.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANG</emphasis>:  Right.  Bobby, any response to the lawsuit so far?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRANKLIN</emphasis>:  Not yet, but, you know, we'll take the next steps. We'll likely file an injunction to try to get DHS to move forward, you know, stay tuned.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANG</emphasis>:  All right.  Bobby Franklin, CEO of the National Venture Capital Association, Alex Wayne of Bloomberg News.  Thank you both for joining us.  </p><p>      Eric Hippeau, managing partner of Lerer Hippeau Ventures and my guest host for the hour, you are sticking with me.  </p><p>      (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANG</emphasis>:  Still with us, Eric Hippeau, managing partner at Lerer Hippeau Ventures, we have to talk about this, of course, because we're in New York today.  </p><p>      What do you think the likelihood of that -- of Amazon ending up here?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HIPPEAU</emphasis>:  Well, we would love it, obviously, 50,000 tech workers or quasi-tech workers in Brooklyn that would be fantastic.  </p><p>      I think the chances are pretty low.  New York is a very expensive place to set up a business.  </p><p>      And we -- in the current administration, New York is not particularly business-friendly.  So I'm not even sure that New York is bidding.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANG</emphasis>:  Where is business-friendly under the current administration?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HIPPEAU</emphasis>:  Well, I was talking about the local administration, but, you know, but I think that New York should be looking for those kinds of opportunities.  </p><p>      Because those are the kinds of jobs at a higher-paying, that are, you know, information-based essentially that we need is that -- but I don't know that the City of New York is actually even active in looking at attracting them.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANG</emphasis>:  So what do you -- I mean, what do you think Amazon should be looking for in their second headquarters since they can't -- they can't build out its headquarters in Seattle their capacity.  What should they be looking for elsewhere?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HIPPEAU</emphasis>:  I think it needs a city or a place where there's a lot of higher education, a lot of young people that who are looking for the jobs of the new economy, and a business-friendly environment.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANG</emphasis>:  We do have some (INAUDIBLE) from the mayor of Philadelphia, obviously, a lot of cities competing for this now.  Take a listen.  </p><p>      (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MAYOR JIM KENNEY, PHILADELPHIA, PENNSYLVANIA</emphasis>:  We've gotten criticism, you know, about corporate tax breaks and that alike.  This is too big of a deal, and it's too many jobs and too great of a company for us not to go after it.  And we would love to have it here.  </p><p>      We have a lot of folks who could use the work and we have a lot of IT startups and tech companies that have come into Philadelphia recently.  </p><p>      (END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANG</emphasis>:  So Philadelphia throwing their hat in the ring as well. How does the city benefit?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HIPPEAU</emphasis>:  Well, you do have to give them some tax breaks, I imagine.  But on the other hand, you're providing 50,000 really good paying jobs, there are people who will pay taxes themselves and who will buy local products and services.  </p><p>      So it's a -- it's a definite plus for the city.  New York just opened the Cornell Tech, and Bloomberg is very much involved with that.  </p><p>      So it would actually go really well with attracting the headquarters or the second headquarters of a big tech company.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANG</emphasis>:  And I wonder if New York would do a good job of attracting younger talent, I mean, who doesn't want to live in New York, right?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HIPPEAU</emphasis>:  Exactly, New York -- New York, well, that's why, I mean, New York, most of my companies are here.  It's a great place for startups and most people love to be in New York.  </p><p>      There's a lot of diversity and a lot of things to do.  But the city needs to have a plan in place to be able to attract a company like Amazon.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANG</emphasis>:  How would you describe evolution of New York's tax scheme?  I mean, obviously, it's always been -- it's always placed second to Silicon Valley to a certain extent, though, you know, many of the big tech companies have offices here as well and the scene is changing.  You know, how much closer is Silicon Alley to Silicon Valley these days?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HIPPEAU</emphasis>:  Well, today, Silicon Alley of New York is the second largest center of technology in United States, one of the largest in the world.  </p><p>      And what New York does when it's good at.  New York is good at software development, New York is good at applications and services.  </p><p>      We're not going to be reinventing the plumbing of the Internet, we're not going to create the next generation of routers.  </p><p>      However, we're starting to see robotics companies, we're starting to see, you know, all kinds of companies and all kinds of sectors because we have access in New York to the same technology that people in Silicon Valley have.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANG</emphasis>:  When is that 10 billion dollar company going to be coming out in New York, that 10 billion dollar tech company?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HIPPEAU</emphasis>:  Hopefully, it's in the pipeline.  There's a whole number of companies which have to reach the billion dollar, at least, in the private market valuation that, I think, have the potential to be one of those companies.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANG</emphasis>:  All right.  Eric Hippeau, Lerer Hippeau Ventures, you are sticking with me.  Thank you   </p><p>      (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANG</emphasis>:  Joining me now to discuss the latest in this ongoing saga, Bloomberg's Mike Riley and still with us, Eric Hippeau, managing partner at Lerer Hippeau Ventures.  </p><p>      Eric, you are shaking your head.  Mike, it is so hard not to read these stories and not get incredibly angry.  </p><p>      It just gets worst and worst.  What do we know about this new breach and how much they knew before they told the public?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RILEY</emphasis>:  We don't know a lot because they're not being particularly clear about what they knew.  But we do know a couple of important things.  </p><p>      One is that they had a major invest -- security investigation going on starting in March and going through May.  </p><p>      They hired Mandiant, the same cyber security firm that they've brought back in July.  </p><p>      And they were doing a pretty extensive investigation for three months.  Now, company like Mandiant, that's a pretty expensive prospect.  </p><p>      But the most interesting thing if you look at their timeline of the July incident, the one that they found out about July is the hackers, even though, they found out about the theft of, you know, this data in July.  </p><p>      When they did the investigation, when Mandiant came back in, they discovered that that data was stolen in May, which would have put it right in the middle of this earlier investigation.  </p><p>      So there's a question of like why that wasn't found, how do you get of a company like Mandiant examining your networks and other things, and just missed the presence of a -- of a hacker in your network, and the theft of this kind of data.  </p><p>      It also raises this questions about, you know, what the executives knew when -- whether they knew that the company was having multiple security problems at the time they did trades in May and in late July, early August.  </p><p>      So, again, it raises just all sorts of questions.  And one of the things that's clear is, you know, when a data breach like this, you want to get to be as transparent with the public as possible and you want to do it as early as possible.  </p><p>      And we just keep getting a trickle of new information really almost daily now. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANG</emphasis>:  It feels like a mess and it feels like they're not being transparent at all.  I mean, Eric, you probably have a credit card, right?  You probably among the 143 million people just like everyone else?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HIPPEAU</emphasis>:  Well, that -- it's shocking to me that, first of all, the CEO the company is still the CEO of the company.  I don't understand what the board of directors is going.  </p><p>      But, I think, what we're realizing here is that our data is ending in this credit service bureaus without us knowing about it.  </p><p>      I mean, we suspect, of course, we got a credit score and all that.  But they collect a very sensitive information about us without really our authorization.  </p><p>      So the least you would expect is that the most important job that they do is to maintain that data safe.  </p><p>      And if you have information on the majority of the American citizens, you have to expect that there's a whole hacking world is going to come after you.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANG</emphasis>:  Right, that's their one job, it's to make sure --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HIPPEAU</emphasis>:  That's your one job.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANG</emphasis>:  -- it's protected.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HIPPEAU</emphasis>:  And as your colleague just pointed out, if there's any kind of breach and you need full transparency because how are we possibly going to be able to trust this people again.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANG</emphasis>:  So, Mike, you know, we are getting -- you are getting new information about the motivation of these hackers, potentially, that they're interested in getting in to the big things.  You know, what do we -- what more do we know about the end goals of these attacks?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RILEY</emphasis>:  Well, again, we don't know a lot because the company doesn't telling us a lot.  But keep in mind that one of the things we just know is that if you have hackers in your system, in a system like Equifax, they're probably not just going to look for one thing even something as valuable as social security numbers and birth dates on a hundred and forty-three million U.S. consumers.  </p><p>      Because Equifax serves a really keep a part of the financial infrastructure of the country in general.  It has direct links between its system and the bank systems through APIs.  </p><p>      And one of the things we did find out is that there is evidence that the hackers, some hackers used those APIs to get in to at least one major bank in Canada.  </p><p>      Now, that raises all sorts of questions about like what else the hackers did with their time in Equifax.  I mean, keep in mind, again, that by their own timeline they discovered the breach at the end of July.  </p><p>      But the hackers had been in there since at least middle of May. What were -- and when they took the big stash of data, what were they doing over the next four months, that's the real question.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANG</emphasis>:  Equifax did announced the retirement of a couple of senior executives but if there's still a lot of questions surrounding the share sales, this executive share sale that happened, I mean, how is this fitting in to the timeline of what we think they knew when?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RILEY</emphasis>:  Well, it raises some really interesting question.  And their time -- and their timeline is very specific, but it doesn't have much bigger room.  </p><p>      What -- basically, what they're saying is they learned about the hack on July 29th.  The share sales, like one group of share sales happened at the beginning of August.  </p><p>      But there's a handful of days, two or three days between the time they learned and the time of that sale occurred.  </p><p>      They are basically saying that the executives didn't know about the hack in the span of those three days.  </p><p>      And even the people we talked to who work at Equifax say, \"That just seems really unlikely.\"  </p><p>      I mean, a company like this has a protocol for what they do when they're hacked.  And that protocol entails briefing the executives within a short period of time and certainly not three days.  </p><p>      So it does raise a lot of questions, we do know that the U.S. prosecutors have opened an investigation in to those sales because they want to find out what those executives knew when and whether or not they violated insider trading laws.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANG</emphasis>:  And so that -- last question, so what is the recourse for consumers here?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RILEY</emphasis>:  Well, so keep in mind, this is -- this is a very different tact -- attack that they target because credit card numbers is a temporary thing that you can just cancel and reissue.  </p><p>      What these hackers potentially got was very specific data that's at the center of our confidential identities, birth dates, social security numbers, and other things.  </p><p>      This is something that could be used to steal our identity, you know, any time over the next -- in the next decades over our lifetime.  </p><p>      So consumers can do short-term things, they can get credit monitoring that Equifax is offering for free, they can also try and freeze that access to their credit reports which is typically a hard thing to do in a short-term measure.  </p><p>      But what'll they do two years from now or five years from now or 10 years from now when this data is still being used to steal identities.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANG</emphasis>:  Devastating.  All right.  Bloomberg's Mike Riley, thanks. Can't wait to see the scoop you bring up tomorrow.  Eric Hippeau, my guest host for the hour of Lerer Hippeau Ventures, you are sticking with me.  </p><p>      (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANG</emphasis>:  Still with us, Eric Hippeau, managing partner at Lerer Hippeau Ventures, who was CEO of the Huffington Post, four times.  So what do you think, will we see more media M&amp;A and if so, where?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HIPPEAU</emphasis>:  Well, for sure, because the traditional media companies need a bigger additional footprint, bigger additional platforms.  </p><p>      They need to acquire technology.  They're basically not technology companies.  </p><p>      And for the native media technology companies, to be part of a bigger group, it gives them more resources, it gives them more opportunity to distribute their content.  So it's a win-win for both. So it's just --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANG</emphasis>:  So do you see a big consolidation happening?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HIPPEAU</emphasis>:  I do see -- I don't know how much of a consolidation, but if you look at the deceleration of subscribers on cable, I think, this is motivating a lot of people to say, \"Wait, did this uncapping of the cable world is happening a lot faster than we expected.  We better prepare -- as we are cash (INAUDIBLE) we better prepare for the future.\"  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANG</emphasis>:  All right.  Eric Hippeau, you are sticking with me.  </p><p>      (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANG</emphasis>:  For more, I want to get straight to our Bloomberg Tech reporter, Sarah Frier, who covers Twitter and Facebook.  </p><p>      And still with us, Eric Hippeau of Lerer Hippeau Ventures.  So, Sarah, you know, what do you make of this?  What do we know?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRIER</emphasis>:  So, Burr, basically saying is -- if Facebook says they don't have much to hide if they want to be transparent and cooperative, how about do it in the public.  </p><p>      So although a date we're hearing hasn't been set, this is something that is very important to the senators.  </p><p>      Obviously, Facebook, we know have given more information about the odds related to the Russian spending to Mueller's Commission, the special commission looking in to this.  </p><p>      So we're very much looking forward to anything that we can hear in the public eye.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANG</emphasis>:  So does this mean we could see Mark Zuckerberg or Sheryl Sandberg testifying before congress?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRIER</emphasis>:  Yes, absolutely.  I think that that could be a possibility.  We could also see, perhaps, Facebook head of security.  </p><p>      Anyone who might have more specific information about how this looks, maybe that they're looking in to it on a -- on a granular level.  I -- but, nothing has been confirmed yet.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANG</emphasis>:  Eric, what's your take on this story?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HIPPEAU</emphasis>:  Well, my take is that the issue is actually bigger than just the Russian hack or whatever.  I think, we're actually in a new relationship with our big tech companies.  </p><p>      We, for years, have left them alone.  It was completely less unfair attitude because we want them to grow and want them to innovate.  </p><p>      But in (INAUDIBLE) on the eyes of society as users and of government that this -- that they're really not transparent.  They're not -- they're not telling us what they're doing.  </p><p>      They change the algorithms without any start or any other expectations.  They deal with our data in ways that for instance, they -- we just learned that they allowed people to target races and white supremacies.  </p><p>      How is that possible?  So they hide in some ways behind this notion that they're just a utility.  That they're not responsible for the content, they're not responsible for how the platform is being used.  </p><p>      And, I think, that society as users and of government, we're not saying, \"That can't be true.\"  You know, you have to have responsibility, you have to take charge of what's going on in your own platform.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANG</emphasis>:  Sarah, another story that just crossed European regulators are going to be telling tech companies that they are going to be fined if they don't take down terrorist-related content in a matter of hour, which I wonder, A, is that -- is that possible and what might the reaction be?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRIER</emphasis>:  I think that's absolutely going to be something that the company will say, \"It's very difficult.\"  Of course, Twitter today announced that it had removed a few 300,000 accounts from ISIS --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANG</emphasis>:  300,000?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRIER</emphasis>:  -- about 20 percent --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANG</emphasis>:  300,000 accounts that they removed?  That's a lot.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRIER</emphasis>:  That's a lot, it's 20 percent less than this time last year.  But maybe that means that they're doing something to address the issue. </p><p>      The problem the European Regulator say is that they want the company to address this content within two hours and when it goes up.  </p><p>      That is very difficult for something, you know, Facebook has more than two billion users now, and it's very difficult for them to possible that content.  </p><p>      What the UN wants new is get these companies and start thinking about this, the technological level.  Is there a way that they can address this issue at scale without having to hire thousands of contractors support through this or is that just in impossibility?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANG</emphasis>:  And yet, it's a problem, obviously, they've known about for a long time.  Eric, do you think it's fair for them to say, \"We can't do it.  It's too big.\"  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HIPPEAU</emphasis>:  No, no, it's not.  And they -- and (INAUDIBLE) the measures that they've taken so far and they seemed to be working that well.  </p><p>Facebook has added 2,000 curators, there's more technology, et cetera.  But they're not doing enough.  And they're certainly not reassuring us that they're doing enough for -- on this matter.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANG</emphasis>:  Facebook though did say that they are hiring 3,000 extra workers to --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRIER</emphasis>:  And, Emily --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANG</emphasis>:  -- flag the content.  Go ahead, Sarah.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRIER</emphasis>:  I see --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANG</emphasis>:  (INAUDIBLE) 30 seconds.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRIER</emphasis>:  -- I see that 3,000 workers cited in every post from Facebook on a problem they're trying to address.  Those 3,000 workers are dealing with Ad fraud, fake news, hateful content, violate video, all these things.  It's very interesting how much they're able to cope with.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANG</emphasis>:  Well, they have a lot on their plate, apparently.  Sarah Frier of Bloomberg News.  I know you'll keep us posted on all these stories.  </p><p>      Eric Hippeau of Lerer Hippeau Ventures, thank you so much for joining us today.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HIPPEAU</emphasis>:  Yes, my pleasure.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANG</emphasis>:  Great to see you here in New York.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HIPPEAU</emphasis>:  Thank you.     </p><p>      ***END OF TRANSCRIPT***  </p><p>      THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100 percent ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND OTHER INACCURACIES.

He's the management partner and RebelMouse chairman.  He's also the Former CEO of the \"The Huffington Post\" and was an early investor in companies including Warby Parker, Casper, and Refinery29. He's got quite a track record I think is per se.  </p><p>      Eric, welcome back to Bloomberg (ph).  Good to have you here.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HIPPEAU</emphasis>:  Good morning.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WESTIN</emphasis>:  So let's start with this tax reform, tax overhaul. Supposedly, a lot of money is going to be coming back into this country, particularly on the tech companies.  What are they going to do with it?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HIPPEAU</emphasis>:  Well, they can continue to buy back shares as they've been doing.  But more likely, they're going to start really investing it in areas that might be a little bit like frontier technology that's a little bit outside of their core domains.  Google has been doing it already.  Apple has a good track record of this.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ABRAMOWICZ</emphasis>:  I'm sorry to cut you off.  But a lot of people say that these companies, Google, and Amazon, they've already brought a lot of money back to the bond market.  They have as much cash that they could possibly imagine.  Why would they need this money to come back for to do some of these moves?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HIPPEAU</emphasis>:  Well, probably just because they are under attack. They're under attack in the United States.  They're certainly under attack in Europe.  And there's a growing backlash against big tech. And it's got to do with the Russian thing, the fact that they don't know what's happening on their platforms, they have no controls.  This whole privacy issue is starting to hit home, that we are looking at Equifax.  </p><p>      So it would be smart for them to start making investments that bolster their image, that cater better to privacy and security and things of that nature.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WESTIN</emphasis>:  And yet when you look at some big deals, you see things like Amazon buying whole foods, which is, if anything, the opposite direction.  That's not going into privacy of things.  That's going to bricks-and-mortar.  I mean, should we expect to see more of that tech really move into bricks-and-mortars or the reverse for that matter?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HIPPEAU</emphasis>:  I think you certainly mentioned some of the companies that we've invested in, like Warby Parker.  Warby Parker now has over 20 stores.  They're doing very well.  Casper, another one of our businesses is opening stores.  So you're starting to see digital native companies understand that consumers like to touch the product. The interaction is necessary.  So they're going into the retail business.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ABRAMOWICZ</emphasis>:  So when you talk about the regulatory pushback and sort of the under attack aspect of tech right now, do actually think that politicians are going to take regulatory action or is this just sort of going to goad the big tech companies try to insulate themselves? </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HIPPEAU</emphasis>:  I don't think politicians really understand what's going on.  So it's very unlikely that they will take action.  If they take action, it will be a rear guard action that won't have much of an effect.  I think it's mostly the users.  There's definitely science that young people are moving away from the big social platforms. Older Americans, older people are posting less personal things. There's clearly a sign that what you post will come back and haunt you in the future.  So this is a big change that's coming from the users themselves  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WESTIN</emphasis>:  So you're known as being a very astute investor in the digital space, particularly in the early stages.  What does that tell you about where you should be look for opportunities, so then other people should be look at opportunities in tech?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HIPPEAU</emphasis>:  Well, these days we look for opportunities predictably in artificial intelligence, smart apps, smart systems.  We're big believers that the robotics world is changing dramatically.  The cost of robots is going down at really furious pace.  And all the values according to the software layer which is becoming more and more intelligent.  These are not necessarily robots or AI that's going to replace workers.  It's in fact going to enhance the workforce.  It's going to make the workforce more productive.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ABRAMOWICZ</emphasis>:  What tech company are people not talking about today that they will be at the end of 2018?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HIPPEAU</emphasis>:  Oh, boy.  That's an interesting question.  I'd have to think about this a little bit more.  Sorry.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ABRAMOWICZ</emphasis>:  Or is there a company that we're talking about right now, the reverse, that we're not going to be talking about?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HIPPEAU</emphasis>:  Well, I think your previous segment mentioned that.  I think the Chinese companies are all going to come to the United States or a lot of them are going to come to the United States.  You should see the valuations in China, talk about bitcoin as a high valuation, all of the valuations in China, all the deals you hear about china, are made with hundreds of billions of dollars evaluation.  Alibaba, 10 Cent, all of these companies are going to be look at the United States.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ABRAMOWICZ</emphasis>:  Wait.  So you think that Alibaba could actually present a serious competitive threat to, say, Amazon in the U.S.?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HIPPEAU</emphasis>:  I'm not sure they will go directly into the end user, consumer, retail sector but they will be in the infrastructure.  The commerce is already in China.  All of these companies offer payments, offer communications on a single platform.  We don't do that very well in the United States.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WESTIN</emphasis>:  Well, I was going to ask exactly that question.  Is 10 Cent just way ahead of us in terms of payments?  I mean, because you go to China and people do everything with WeChat.  I mean basically they buy everything they communicate.  They do everything.  And we're way behind in that.  Aren't we? </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HIPPEAU</emphasis>:  Yes, it's surprising to me.  I'm not quite sure I understand why.  But the fact is, that there's no reason why you can't be in the single app and do everything that you just mentioned, including making real payments as well as buying digital objects and pretty much living your life in one app.  We don't do this in the U.S. There's no reason why we couldn't.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ABRAMOWICZ</emphasis>:  So which tech company do you think is getting the furthest in creating that in the U.S.?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HIPPEAU</emphasis>:  Apple.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ABRAMOWICZ</emphasis>:  Apple Pay?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HIPPEAU</emphasis>:  Yes, Apple Pay.  You're going to stop to be able to make each payments with Apple Pay.  So, yes, Apple is -- because it's such a stored company, and since Steve Jobs people say, \"Well, Apple is not innovating as much.\"  I actually don't believe that.  I think Apple is a very strong company.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WESTIN</emphasis>:  So when you think about internet of things broadly, when you got in the home with our Alexia, you got autonomous vehicles seem to be around the corner.  When is it going to get to health care?  Why don't we have a device on ourselves that monitor heart rate and things like that for diabetic sugar levels?  When does that come and who's going to lead that charge?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HIPPEAU</emphasis>:  Well, again this watch from Apple already.  If I wanted to -- I don't.  But if I wanted to --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ABRAMOWICZ</emphasis>:  Like out of a know?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HIPPEAU</emphasis>:  Yes, exactly.  I could monitor some of my functions. This is getting better and better.  The sensors are getting better. And the data is getting better.  The problem with health care is the system of healthcare is so rigid and so impregnable that they're only touching on the margin.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WESTIN</emphasis>:  OK, Eric Hippeau of Lerer Hippeau Ventures.  Thanks so much for being here, Eric.      </p><p>      ***END OF TRANSCRIPT***  </p><p>      THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100 PERCENT ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND OTHER INACCURACIES.

The U.S. has an \"exorbitant privilege\" in that the dollar is the reserve currency of the world. Foreign companies, central banks and individuals hold dollar-denominated assets simply because the dollar is the reserve currency of the world. That intrinsic demand for dollar-denominated assets allows the U.S. government, U.S. consumers and U.S. companies to borrow at low interest rates. Moreover, it also increases demand for U.S. equities, and it gives the U.S. enormous leverage in international relations.</p><p> This \"exorbitant privilege\" is why China's Zhou Xiaochuan, the former head of the People's Bank of China, revived John Maynard Keynes' idea of the \"Bancor\" during the 2009 financial crisis. Keynes proposed the Bancor and the International Clearing Union as a way to mitigate trade imbalances after World War II. Facebook's Libra has the potential to be operationally very similar to Keynes' ICU and Bancor albeit with one very large distinction. Keynes' Bancor was never going to be used for transactions of goods and services (i.e. compete with government's currencies) whereas Facebook's Libra is a digital currency that can be used for transactions of real goods and services on its platform. Given the size of its platform, this should greatly concern policymakers. Many merchants and individuals in developing nations choose and prefer to conduct transactions in dollars rather than their domestic currency. The Libra would likely be a direct competitor to the U.S. dollar in developing nations as a means of payment. Moreover, transaction history of its users would provide more information on its users, thereby solidifying its dominant role in advertising and truly making it the Standard Oil of the digital era.</p><p> The current cryptocurrency bonanza is best understood as a digital version of the Free Banking Era. Free banking in the United States was a time period in the mid-1800s during which individual banks were able to issue liabilities that were backed by their assets. Put another way, banks could issue their own currency. Merchants could then choose which currencies to reject or accept for real goods and services. Cryptocurrencies that are issued by Big Tech will operate much the same way. In the same way that the U.S. dollar is backed by the \"good faith and credit\" of the U.S. government (i.e. U.S. citizens), the value in the cryptocurrency will be rooted in the confidence in the Big Tech firm that issues the currency and the entity that controls it.</p><p> The cryptocurrency innovation was rooted in the lack of confidence in the monetary system during and immediately after the financial crisis of 2008. Governments had to borrow enormously to stabilize the financial system. Regulators were behind the curve in understanding how financial innovation could contribute to the financial crisis before 2008 and appear to be behind the curve in understanding the threats of cryptocurrencies.</p><p>Congress and President Trump need to get their fiscal house in order to ensure long-term confidence in our dollar. Allowing cryptocurrencies to be widely used as a means of payment will likely influence consumer money demand. Demand deposit balances at banks may fall as consumers choose to hold Facebook's currency due to its ease of use and cross-border applicability. What's the use in holding dollars when I can hold Facebook's Libra and use it for transactions in the U.S., Europe and Africa without exchange fees?</p><p> The current fiat monetary system is rooted in our democracy. The dollars we use for our transactions are our joint liability as U.S. citizens. We elect representatives and presidents who appoint individuals to oversee our money supply. If we don't like how the Federal Reserve handles the money supply, we are able to elect new leaders who appoint different people. Allowing Big Tech to develop cryptocurrencies that can be widely used as an alternative means of payments is ceding some control of the money supply without voter accountability. We have trusted them with data, should we now trust them with a means of payment? Blockchain is a useful innovation that appears to have productive uses, especially in mitigating fraud. However, its use as an alternative to government currencies should not be allowed.</p><p> Alexander Hamilton understood the importance of having a central bank and one currency. The current issues related to cryptocurrencies are not new; they are just digital. Changes in the amount and type of means of payments has real effects on the economy, and it affects real people. The means of payments we use for our transactions in our everyday life should not change. Digitize the U.S. dollar, don't replace it.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TLSWLD-4229eee5761cb36118428cad7c3bf356fa3bb5c</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0EABABE8E0824E33 TLSWLD2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WFW-JPV1-DXVP-V14S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">152788</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"813\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 BH Media Group, Inc. d/b/a Tulsa World All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Tulsa World (Oklahoma)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 30, 2019 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><classCode>CC0009S94</classCode><className>PEOPLE'S BANK OF CHINA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;
