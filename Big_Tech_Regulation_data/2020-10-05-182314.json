Although I rarely trust market moves on the last day of a quarter or the first day of a new quarter, there is little doubt that market volatility is back this year, as I expected it would be. Last year, rather than enduring scary selloffs to correct imbalances, the market simply rotated into neglected market segments from time to time. This conviction to stay invested was largely due to consistent improvement in global economic fundamentals coupled with rising optimism about new fiscal stimulus - leading to a fear of missing out. </p><p>But given the passage of the tax bill and plenty of progress with deregulation last year, I expected investors this year to display more of a Missourian 'show me' attitude as to what Corporate America actually would do with their newfound cash windfalls and looser regulatory noose.

But the proof is in the pudding, as they say, and the price run-up and elevated valuation multiples (that arose in anticipation of tax cuts and new corporate investment) were due for compression, as speculation gives way to reality, along with some 'price rationalization' and deleveraging of speculative portfolios. And on top of those dynamics, the market is suddenly fretting about tariffs, trade wars, inflationary pressures, and the Fed. Nevertheless, there seems to be something for all investors to hold on to, as both fundamentalists and technicians alike should be excited by the lower valuations and successful tests of support in a climate of robust growth and corporate earnings. But I'm not talking about a return to market conditions of old, characterized by falling interest rates, slow growth, and low volatility, which rewarded passive investing in cap-weighted indexes with elevated P/E's. Instead, we likely are entering a new era, characterized by rising interest rates, faster growth, and higher volatility, which rewards sound stock-picking. In this periodic update, I provide a market commentary, offer my technical analysis of the S...00, review Sabrient's latest fundamentals-based SectorCast rankings of the ten US business sectors, and serve up some actionable ETF trading ideas. In summary, our sector rankings still look bullish, while the sector rotation model has fallen into a neutral posture during this period of consolidation and testing of support levels. Read on....[1] Market Commentary: Investors seem to be focusing more on the threats than the opportunities right now. Besides P/E compression, price rationalization, deleveraging, and a fledgling rotation away from the dominant Momentum factor, investors are trying to assess the likely impact of the myriad news headlines, such as the President's actions to address unfair trade agreements with tariffs meant to cajole some accommodation from our global trade partners. In addition, some of the mega-cap Tech stocks (e.g., FAANG) that have led the market for so long are seeing their business practices under attack, especially Amazon.com (AMZN) and Facebook (FB). Also, we have a huge $1.3 trillion federal omnibus budget(despite full employment and solid GDP growth that would normally suggest a budget surplus) that some claim will bankrupt the nation. To be sure, there is nothing desirable about a budget deficit of $1 trillion and a national debt of $22 trillion (21% of GDP). And then there is the fear among some observers that new Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell is more concerned with normalizing short-term rates than he is about supporting the economy (the proverbial 'Fed put'). Not to be outdone, Barron's opined that corporate earnings growth expectations are so exuberant that there is likely more downside risk than upside potential as the earnings reports come in. Meanwhile, some market commentators are pointing to the strengthening technical condition of gold and bonds to say that stocks are in for more pain ahead. And lenders appear to be tightening their credit standards and lending less, suggesting all is not well on Main Street. In other words, there are plenty of negative narratives flying around, and for the moment they are giving rise to the dreaded climate (previously witnessed in the 2H2015-1H2016 timeframe) of news-driven risk-on/risk-off trading, rising correlations, higher volatility, and reduced strategic equity exposures. However, all is not lost. On the contrary, there is no denying the underlying strength in the global economy and the continuously improving outlook for US corporate earnings. In fact, it's hard to fully predict all the various impacts (both direct and indirect) we will see from tax reform and deregulation over the next few years. 1Q2018 earnings reports are on tap in just a matter of days, and with the tailwind of massive tax cuts (corporate tax rates falling from 35% to 21%), consensus S...00 earnings are expected to grow +17% year-over-year versus 1Q2017 (up from expected Q1 growth of +11% at the beginning of the year and the best year-over-year performance since 1Q2011) - and many well-selected stocks should do quite a bit better. Moreover, economists generally expect GDP growth to come in somewhere in the 2.5-3.0% range, compared with 1.2% in 1Q2017. Inflation fears have tempered, bonds have caught a bid, and extreme equity valuations have fallen as technical support levels have been tested. And don't forget, spring is in the air, which is a seasonally strong time for stocks, and Morgan Stanley estimates that about $400 billion in global dividends will be paid out this quarter, adding further buying fuel. President Trump's newly-imposed tariffs and his venting about Amazon's fleecing of the taxpayer by minimizing its taxable income and by leveraging a government-subsidized US Post Office - not to mention its ability to steamroll both large corporate competitors and Mom-and-Pop shops alike - have certainly spooked the markets. After all, tariffs may spark a global trade war, right? And Amazon represents the future of commerce as it shakes up the world through 'creative disruption' to the long-term benefit of us all, right? Well, perhaps, but to me these are simply the latest examples of Trump's negotiating style, as he tries to stand up for the little guy without actually derailing growth in both the economy and the stock market that he so covets. Rather than watch trade negotiations languish in committee for years on end with no resolution, he skips the diplomacy and instills a sense of urgency with the stroke of a pen and some tough language. Likewise, rather than quietly cajole Jeff Bezos to pay higher shipping rates, he tries to humiliate him into submission. Remember his tough talk to Russia and North Korea about his willingness to engage in a nuclear arms race that we would 'easily win'? Sounds a lot like his tariff talk today. We know that Canada and Mexico have already gotten reprieves, given that they have shown good faith in renegotiating NAFTA. Then, the EU was also excluded, and the announcement came that countries could apply for relief from the new duties. Of note, the Mexican peso has been the strongest performing currency in the world so far this year. In any case, we are too deeply in debt to engage in a full-blown trade war, with $22 trillion in total federal debt and a newly jacked-up budget deficit to boot. In fact, the whole world is too indebted for it. After initially announcing a small retaliatory response, South Korea agreed to revise its 6-year-old bilateral trade deal, and China is opting for a conciliatory approach, as well, despite the mild retaliatory moves the press is hyping. After all, the US has a $375 billion trade deficit with China, which puts us in the stronger position. China cannot afford any impediments to its aggressive growth targets. It is already on a path to liberalizing foreign investment - by necessity. Given that its rapidly growing status as an economic power is eroding its ability to continue to leverage low labor costs in a (largely subsidized) manufacturing economy and dump cheap goods on the rest of the world, China knows that it must encourage consumption from its growing middle class and allow more foreign capital to flow into the country. Chinese bonds soon will be added to the Bloomberg Barclays Global Aggregate Index, which is widely followed by fund managers, andJPMorgan is considering adding Chinese bonds to its Government Bond Index.This will attract passive flows (e.g., ETFs) of global capital into China's bond market - estimated by Goldman Sachs to perhaps exceed $250 billion. Furthermore, MSCI is adding mainland-China stocks to its emerging markets index, which could result in $500 billion in passive flows. So, as its current account surplus falls, its capital and financial account deficits will also fall, offsetting the impact. A rotation out of the narrow list of mega-cap Tech and into a broader group of market segments (including other big-Tech names outside of the FAANG gang) seems to be unfolding. I think this is healthy broadening behavior, and I think the actual impact on these companies' bottom lines is being way overblown such that they will find interested buyers soon enough. But Jim Paulsen, the chief investment strategist at Leuthold Group, tracks the ratio of Technology versus Utilities stocks, which is rolling over in a pattern that he thinks resembles the dot-com crash, as momentum darlings are suddenly shunned. But let's make sure we are comparing apples to apples here. Valuations, cash flows, and cash balances today are so much healthier than they were 20 years ago, and there has been no artificial demand for technology upgrades today as was seen in advance of the Y2K scare. State Street Global Advisors reports that aggregate US-listed ETFs saw consecutive monthly outflows for the first time since 2008, although Q1 overall (with a big January of inflows) still saw the 'second-best start to a year ever.' During Monday's selloff, the S...00 retested its intraday peak (1/26/2018) to trough (2/9/2018) drawdown of -11.7%, although the recovery this time around didn't quite recover the 200-day simple moving average. S...ow Jones Indices reported that the Dow Jones Industrial Average broke a string of nine straight positive quarters with a loss of -2.49% during 1Q2018. Also, the quarter witnessed a continuation of the factor performance themes of 2017, with Growth and Momentum factors dominating at the expense of Value, Quality, and Low-volatility, while rising short-term rates lessened the appeal of dividend payers. However, they noted signs of a reversal late in the quarter, and the Momentum factor's risk profile is most concentrated 'toward large cap, high beta, and technology stocks,' leaving it vulnerable to 'higher drawdown risk compared to other strategies.' Furthermore, the firm reported an interesting observation that small-cap Healthcare was up an impressive +13% during Q1. No other market segments were even close, with mid-cap Healthcare (+6%), mid-cap Tech (+4%) as distant runners-up. Despite the worrisome market action, nothing has changed in the fundamental picture of synchronized global economic expansion, impressive US economic reports, strong US corporate cash flow and earnings, as well as high cash balances. Unemployment remains near 1960 lows. Inflation is modest. Interest rates remain low. Deregulation has freed up the resources of companies, which is especially helpful to small- and mid-caps. And of course, the biggest tax overhaul in a generation is just starting to gain traction - incentivizing capital investment, expansion, onshoring of offshore operations, and hiring, as well as higher dividends, continued share buybacks, and additional M...They might even pay down some debt. Let's talk about the latest economic reports. Weekly jobless claims fell to a 45-year low. The Conference Board's LEI is strong and rising. Housing and mortgage reports are solid. Retail and wholesale inventories rose nicely. Consumer Confidence and Investor Confidence remain quite strong, with a broad-based demand for equities among global institutional investors. The BEA's third estimate of real GDP in 4Q17 was increased to 2.9%, reflecting 'a downturn in private inventory investment that was partly offset by accelerations in PCE, exports, state and local government spending, nonresidential fixed investment, and federal government spending, and an upturn in residential fixed investment.' For 1Q18, the Atlanta Fed's GDPNow model was just updated Monday morning with a higher forecast of 2.8% (due to higher expected consumer spending and private fixed investment), while the New York Fed's Nowcast model projects 2.7% for 1Q18 and 2.9% for 2Q18. After the quarter-point rate hike in March, the current target fed funds rate is 1.50-1.75%, and the Fed \"dot plot\" still projects two more rate hikes this year, which would bring the target rate to a 2.00-2.25% range by year end. CME fed funds futures currently place the odds of rate hike #2 coming at the June meeting at 81%, and by September there is a 53% chance of the third rate hike. By the December meeting, there is a 73% chance of a third hike, 30% probability of a fourth quarter-point rate hike, and a small 4.3% chance of a fifth hike - but also a significant 27% chance that the fed funds rate will remain at 1.75%-2.00% (i.e., only two rate hikes this year). After briefly spiking on inflation fears before finding resistance at the 3.0% level, the 10-year Treasury continues to catch a bid. It closed Tuesday at 2.78%, while the 2-year closed at 2.28%. The closely-watched 2-10 spread continues to flatten and is now at 50 bps - well under the 100 bps 'normalcy threshold,' causing many Fed-watchers to worry that the new Fed chair Jerome Powell is more concerned with normalizing short-term rates than he is about supporting the economy with the 'Fed Put.' But I think Powell is just trying to exude confidence in the economy, and he certainly will act as necessary to prevent the yield curve from inverting or the economy from falling into recession. DataTrek has pointed out that the markets seem to be watching the breakeven rate between Treasury yields and Treasury inflation-protected securities (TIPS) of the same term, and the differential for both 5-year and 10-year terms currently implies future inflation right around the Fed's 2% target rate. In other words, no runaway inflation. After last year's talk about a 'new normal' of lower volatility, the market is now coming to terms with the notion that elevated volatility is here to stay - at least this year given the uncertainties of tariffs and mid-term elections. DataTrek observed that the S...00 registered 23 daily returns of +/- 1% (or more) during Q1, compared to only 8 during all of last year. The CBOE Market Volatility Index (VIX), aka 'fear gauge,' closed Q1 at 19.97 - right at the 'panic threshold' of 20, and this elevated volatility has led to elevated sector correlations and some risk-on/risk-off behavior. VIX closed Monday at 23.62 (after spiking above 25), but then closed rebound Tuesday at 21.10. All things considered, I see equity valuations as being quite attractive right now. The forward next-12-months (NTM) P/E on the S...00 is around 16.5x, so flipping it upside down equates to an earnings yield of 6.0%. Compared to the 10-year Treasury yield of 2.78%, that's an equity risk/inflation premium of about 3.2%. And with robust EPS growth firmly in the pipeline, I expect the S...00 to see a double-digit return by year-end, even as share price growth falls back in better alignment with earnings growth (where it belongs). Let's throw around some numbers. If the forward P/E at the end of 2018 is 17.5x (6% higher than the current forward P/E but still lower than the 18.5x at the beginning of the year, reflecting the multiple compression I have expected for this year) and earnings are projected to grow by 10% in 2019, then the S...00 would finish the year roughly 16% higher than it is now - or around 3,030 - which would indicate a price return for 2018 of around 13% and a total return (including dividends) of nearly 15%. If instead the forward P/E compresses to 17x by year-end, that would imply a price return of about 10% and total return of nearly 12%. And I am not alone. JPMorgan's U.S. equity strategist Dubravko Lakos-Bujas just reiterated his year-end 3,000 target for the S...00, opining last week that the selling has been largely technical, trend-following, and/or options hedging (in response to all the negative news headlines), 'and as such represents a buying opportunity for fundamental investors' and that 'strong macro and fundamentals will continue to prevail.' Of course, 12-15% total return for the year on the S...00 is not bad at all. But I think a well-selected portfolio of attractive 'growth at a reasonable price' (GARP) stocks has the potential to perform even better. This is what Sabrient seeks to do with our various GARP portfolios, including our monthly all-cap Baker's Dozen. (Note: We also publish other GARP-oriented portfolios focused on market segments like small caps, dividend income, stocks for a rising interest-rate environment, and defensive equity.) In particular, I still see small caps as a good bet, especially given that they stand to benefit the most from lower tax rates, deregulation, and M...ctivity. Moreover, I think this year will see heightened focus on fundamentally sound companies across all caps, as well as the Value and Quality factors, targeting market segments with attractive GARP characteristics that cannot be ignored any longer. Let me finish my commentary today with a simple plea. I think the key to diminishing our country's extreme political polarity and restoring unity and cooperation can be found in one simple exhortation. It is actually Habit 5 of Stephen Covey's 7 Habits of Highly Effective People: 'Seek first to understand, then to be understood.' It sounds so simple, so logical, so easy. But it is not, particularly in such a toxic political climate. Rather than dismissing the other side as either cruel or nave, unfeeling or unthinking, strident or hypocritical, instead seek to truly understand the full nature and backdrop of the other viewpoint. Then and only then, should you articulate your own. Notably, the old Roseanne TV comedy show has returned with the same cast and huge ratings right out of the gateplus at least one stated objective of fostering a political climate of mutual respect for conflicting viewpoints. This is so different from the prevalent approach of cable news and social media of fomenting discord in order to boost ratings. Understanding and compromise have become dirty words in today's all-or-nothing politics. But it doesn't have to be so. SPY Chart Review: The SPDR S...00 ETF (SPY) closed 1Q2018 at 263.15, and then started Q2 with a thud on Monday before recovering some ground on Tuesday, closing at 260.73. However, I don't like to give too much credence to technical behavior on the first or last day of the quarter, given the manipulation and 'window dressing' commonly implemented by mutual funds. SPY closed the quarter right its 200-day simple moving average (around 259), and then lost support on Monday. But there was no confirmation of that lost support on Tuesday, as bulls returned to push up price just enough. Of concern, SPY has already made a 'lower high' versus its January high, and now the start of Q2 has given us the first 'lower low' that may be confirming an imminent downtrend. After successfully testing support at its 200-day simple moving average (SMA) in February and then stair-stepping its way back up, it found resistance at 280 and turned back down in ominous fashion, potentially in the process of forming a bearish descending triangle. A confirmed breakdown below the 200-day SMA would be undesirable, but a confirmed breakdown below double-bottom support at 253 would be quite bearish and suggest the beginning of a bigger correction. However, keep in mind that descending triangles sometimes turn out to be quite bullish, fueled by both dip buying and short covering. A confirmed breakout above the upper downtrend line would be quite bullish, taking price up to fill the gap at 270, at a minimum. Oscillators RSI, MACD, and Slow Stochastic all are pointing up from oversold territory and look poised to cycle further upwards.  Latest Sector Rankings:  Relative sector rankings are based on our proprietary SectorCast model, which builds a composite profile of each of over 600 equity ETFs based on bottom-up aggregate scoring of the constituent stocks. The Outlook Score employs a forward-looking, fundamentals-based multifactor algorithm considering forward valuation, historical and projected earnings growth, the dynamics of Wall Street analysts' consensus earnings estimates and recent revisions (up or down), quality and sustainability of reported earnings, and various return ratios. It helps us predict relative performance over the next 1-3 months. In addition, SectorCast computes a Bull Score and Bear Score for each ETF based on recent price behavior of the constituent stocks on particularly strong and weak market days. A high Bull score indicates that stocks within the ETF recently have tended toward relative outperformance when the market is strong, while a high Bear score indicates that stocks within the ETF have tended to hold up relatively well (i.e., safe havens) when the market is weak. Outlook score is forward-looking while Bull and Bear are backward-looking. As a group, these three scores can be helpful for positioning a portfolio for a given set of anticipated market conditions. Of course, each ETF holds a unique portfolio of stocks and position weights, so the sectors represented will score differently depending upon which set of ETFs is used. We use the iShares that represent the ten major U.S. business sectors: Financial (IYF), Technology (IYW), Industrial (IYJ), Healthcare (IYH), Consumer Goods (IYK), Consumer Services (IYC), Energy (IYE), Basic Materials (IYM), Telecommunications (IYZ), and Utilities (IDU). Whereas the Select Sector SPDRs only contain stocks from the S...00 large cap index, I prefer the iShares for their larger universe and broader diversity.  Here are some of my observations on this week's scores: 1. Basic Materials retains the top spot in the rankings with a strong Outlook score of 83. The sector continues to see solid sell-side analyst sentiment (net positive revisions to EPS estimates), a low forward P/E (15.2x, after a steep selloff related to tariff worries), good insider sentiment (net open market buying), and the highest return ratios. The forward PEG (ratio of forward P/E to forward EPS growth rate) is a favorable 1.25. Technology again takes the second spot with an Outlook score of 74, as it boasts the best sell-side analyst sentiment, the second highest projected year-over-year EPS growth rate (15.9%), a low forward PEG of 1.05, and strong return ratios. Financial comes in a distant third at 61, with a low forward P/E of 15.2x and a forward PEG of 1.11. Rounding out the top five are Healthcare and Consumer Goods (Staples/Noncyclical), all having Outlook scores above 50. Not surprisingly, most of the forward PEG ratios are much more attractive after the selloff, with the lowest (best) forward PEG going to Energy (0.53) and the highest (worst) going to Utilities (3.14). 2. Energy continues to sit at the bottom of the Outlook rankings with a score of 12 despite its strong projected year-over-year EPS growth rate of 36.9% and low forward PEG. Telecom has risen noticeably out of the bottom two, replaced by Consumer Services (Discretionary/Cyclical) with a score of 34. 3. Looking at the Bull scores, Technology enjoys the top score of 71, as stocks within this sector have displayed relative strength on strong market days, while Utilities scores the lowest at 46. The top-bottom spread is 25 points, which reflects low sector correlations on strong market days. It is desirable in a healthy market to see low correlations reflected in a top-bottom spread of at least 20 points, which indicates that investors have clear preferences in the market segments and stocks they want to hold (rather than broad risk-on behavior). 4. Looking at the Bear scores, we find Utilities at the top with a score of 64, which means that stocks within this defensive sector have been the preferred safe havens lately on weak market days. Technology has the lowest score of 40, as investors have fled during recent market weakness. The top-bottom spread is 24 points, which reflects low sector correlations on weak market days. Ideally, certain sectors will hold up relatively well while others are selling off (rather than broad risk-off behavior), so it is desirable in a healthy market to see low correlations reflected in a top-bottom spread of at least 20 points. 5. Technology displays the best all-around combination of Outlook/Bull/Bear scores, followed closely by Materials, while Energy is the worst. Looking at just the Bull/Bear combination, Technology is still the best, followed closely by Utilities, indicating superior relative performance (on average) in extreme market conditions (whether bullish or bearish), while Healthcare scores the worst, as investors have generally avoided the sector lately. However, Consumer Goods (Staples/Noncyclical) seems to display the best balance between Bull and Bear scores, or the best all-round appeal. 6. This week's fundamentals-based Outlook rankings continue to reflect a bullish bias, given that the top four sectors are economically-sensitive, and all four score above 50. Keep in mind, the Outlook Rank does not include timing, momentum, or relative strength factors, but rather reflects the consensus fundamental expectations at a given point in time for individual stocks, aggregated by sector. ETF Trading Ideas: Our Sector Rotation model, which appropriately weights Outlook, Bull, and Bear scores in accordance with the overall market's prevailing trend (bullish, neutral, or defensive), displays a neutral bias and suggests holding Basic Materials (IYM), Technology (IYW), and Financial (IYF), in that order. (Note: In this model, we consider the bias to be neutral from a rules-based trend-following standpoint when SPY is between its 50-day and 200-day simple moving averages.) Besides iShares' IYM, IYW, and IYF, other highly-ranked ETFs in our SectorCast model (which scores nearly 650 US-listed equity ETFs) from the Basic Materials, Technology, and Financial sectors include PowerShares DWA Basic Materials Momentum (PYZ), PowerShares Dynamic Semiconductors (PSI), and First Trust NASDAQ Bank ETF (FTXO). If you prefer a bullish bias, the Sector Rotation model suggests holding Technology, Basic Materials, and Financial, in that order. On the other hand, if you are more comfortable with a defensive stance on the market, the model suggests holding traditionally defensive sectors Utilities, Telecom, and Consumer Goods (Staples/Noncyclical), in that order. An assortment of other interesting ETFs that are scoring well in our latest rankings include Alpha Architect US Quantitative Value (QVAL), First Trust Materials AlphaDEX (FXZ), SPDR S...egional Banking (KRE), Direxion All Cap Insider Sentiment (KNOW, which licenses and tracks a Sabrient index), Pacer US Cash Cows 100 (COWZ), iShares US Home Construction (ITB), John Hancock Multifactor Materials (JHMA), SPDR MFS Systematic Value Equity (SYV), and Elkhorn Lunt Low-Vol High-Beta Tactical (LVHB). IMPORTANT NOTE: I post this information periodically as a free look inside some of our institutional research and as a source of some trading ideas for your own further investigation. It is not intended to be traded directly as a rules-based strategy in a real money portfolio. I am simply showing what a sector rotation model might suggest if a given portfolio was due for a rebalance, and I do not update the information on a regular schedule or on technical triggers. There are many ways for a client to trade such a strategy, including monthly or quarterly rebalancing, perhaps with interim adjustments to the bullish/neutral/defensive bias when warranted, but not necessarily on the days that I happen to post this article. The enhanced strategy seeks higher returns by employing individual stocks (or stock options) that are also highly ranked, but this introduces greater risks and volatility. I do not track performance of the ideas mentioned here as a managed portfolio. Disclosure: The author has no positions in stocks or ETFs mentioned.

Likewise, inflows into U.S.-listed exchange-traded funds continued to reach heights never before seen, with the total AUM in the three primary S...00 ETFs offered by the three biggest issuers BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street (IVV, VOO, SPY) having pushed above\u00a0$750 billion. On the other hand, discussion on Monday of a potential 'phase-in' period for lowering tax rates has had some adverse impact on small caps this week, given that they would stand to benefit the most. Nevertheless, I still see a healthy broadening of the market in process, with expectation of some rotation out of the mega-cap Tech leaders (despite their incredible surge last Friday) and into attractively-valued mid and small caps. </p><p>But that dynamic has suddenly taken a backseat (once again) to those amazingly disruptive Tech juggernauts, who simply refuse to give up the limelight. Turns out, elevated valuations, unsustainable momentum, and the 'law of large numbers' (hindering their extraordinary growth rates) don't seem to apply to these companies, at least not quite yet. Their ability to disrupt, innovate, take existing market share, and create new demand seems to know no bounds, with infinite possibilities ahead for the Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, Big Data, virtual reality, cloud computing, ecommerce, mobile apps, 5G wireless, smart cars, smart homes, driverless transportation, and so on. Still, the awe-inspiring performance and possibilities of these mega-cap Techs notwithstanding, longer term I remain positive on mid and small caps. Keep in mind, in many cases the growth opportunities of these up-and-comers are largely tied to supplying the voracious appetites of the mega-caps. So, it is a way to leverage the continued good fortunes of the big guys, who eventually will have to pass the baton to other market segments that display more attractive forward valuation multiples. In this periodic update, I give my view of the current market environment, offer a technical analysis of the S...00 chart, review Sabrient's latest fundamentals-based SectorCast rankings of the ten US business sectors, and then offer up some actionable ETF trading ideas. In summary, our sector rankings still look bullish, while the sector rotation model also maintains its bullish bias. A steady and improving global growth outlook continues to foster low volatility and an appetite for risk assets, while low interest rates should persist. Notably, BlackRock recently posted a market outlook with the view that the US economic growth cycle may continue for years to come, and I agree - so long as the worldwide credit bubble doesn't suddenly spring a leak and upset the global economic applecart. Read on....[1] Market overview: Stocks just seem to go up almost every day while volatility remains low, so as MAD Magazine's Alfred E. Neuman always used to say, 'What, me worry?' Rather than being concerned about their investments, Americans have been free to focus on other pastimes, like the MLB World Series. Here in Santa Barbara, which is not too far from Los Angeles, there has been a lot of excitement about the Dodgers playing for the title. Of course, it would have been a huge financial boon for TV if the Yankees had won their Game 7 ALCS against the Astros: NY vs. LA, the two biggest cities, East Coast vs. West Coast, Wall Street vs. Hollywood, the classic rivalry between two storied franchises for the first time since 1981. But alas, it was not to be, and we are all happy for Houston to make the series - and to actually win it last night! - especially after its epic flooding disaster. Ultimately, the Astros would not be denied, pulling off another Game 7 win. Although I now live near LA, I actually started my career in Houston in the oil industry as a structural engineer for Gulf Oil in the early '80s. In fact, I was just visiting Houston about five weeks ago, shortly after the floods, and I must say I was amazed at how quickly the city has returned to business-as-usual. Houston Strong, no doubt about it. And speaking of Gulf Oil, the company was acquired a few years after I joined them by Standard Oil of California for $13 billion in the largest takeover in corporate history at the time, and the combined entity was renamed Chevron Corp. Back then, you could buy a major oil company with an abundance of real assets in the ground for $13 billion, but today that much money can't even buy a 55-person company like What's App, a free mobile messaging app that sold to Facebook for $19 billion a few years ago. Yes indeed, the stock market is quite a bit higher now than in 1985. I often write about the Federal Reserve's monetary policies of ZIRP and QE creating financial asset inflation.But as usual I digress. Although breadth has been generally good and performance dispersion wide, which is healthy for the sustainability of the bull advance, last Friday was all about those mega-cap Tech names, especially FAAMG - Facebook (FB), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Google (GOOGL) - led by Amazon's +13% jump after its incredible earnings report and Apple's selling out of iPhone X within minutes of accepting orders. In sum, the five FAAMG stocks added a combined $181 billion in market cap on that single day (with Jeff Bezos personally adding $10 billion in net worth to become the world's richest person), and all five hit new highs. After stocks had pulled back in worried anticipation of those big-Tech earnings reports, the end result was a big relief rally. While the S...00 was +0.81% for the day and the Russell 2000 +0.72%, the Nasdaq Composite crushed it, up +2.2%, and the more concentrated Nasdaq 100 was up an incredible +2.9% for its biggest single-day gain in two years, driven by the dominant market-cap-weighting of FAAMG. So, is there anything wrong with this dominance of a few juggernauts, while the likes of JC Penney (JCP) continue to get creamed in the marketplace? Perhaps not in the short term, but their supreme dominance certainly discourages new entrants, and there is a growing risk of a populist and protectionist-leaning movement pushing for anti-monopolistic measures. Remember the 2001 anti-trust case brought against Microsoft (MSFT)? 2017 has been a year for Growth and Momentum over Value and Quality. But after the market pulled back in mid-August, its initial recovery rally seemed to suggest a budding rotation into neglected market segments, including mids and smalls, as well as factors like Value, Low-volatility, and Quality. But then the Momentum factor started to kick back into gear, and Friday's mega-cap Tech rocket ride put Growth and Momentum back to the forefront. Still, I firmly believe that a broadening into other market segments is required if this bull market is going to remain sustainable. I have talked in previous articles about equity valuations being elevated but justified, given the climate of structurally low interest rates, stable global economic growth, and solid (and improving) corporate earnings trends here at home. When you consider that the implied earnings yield of a 20x P/E ratio on the S...00 is 5%, stocks still look quite attractive compared to the 10-year Treasury yield at only 2.4%. Moreover, the dividend payout ratio for the S...00 (based on trailing operating earnings) is a fairly safe 40%. And Sabrient can find lots of compelling valuations in individual stocks flying under the radar, sporting attractive forward P/Es with strong expected year-over-year growth. The CBOE Market Volatility Index (VIX), aka fear gauge, closed October at 10.18. Although investors are still wary that there hasn't been a significant stock market correction since February 2016, complacency reigns supreme. Even during August's brief spike in volatility, VIX peaked at 17.28 and has not approached the 20 panic level in a long time. Last Wednesday's brief market pullback only pushed VIX to 13.20. But it is comforting to see the broadening participation across market segments, and in fact low volatility is the historical norm when economic growth is stable. Performance dispersion among sectors has been higher, while correlations have been relatively low, which should continue to put downward pressure on the VIX. And absent a systemic financial threat, low volatility should persist. Can another flash crash occur? Well, nothing is impossible, especially with all the algorithmic trading going on. But in the wake of 1987's Black Monday crash (when S...00 fell 23%), the SEC instituted 'circuit breakers' to halt trading at three separate levels of selloffs (7%, 13%, and 20%), and President Reagan established what today is euphemistically called the Plunge Protection Team (PPT) to stabilize markets in a crisis. And in the middle of the 2008-9 Financial Crisis, mark-to-market accounting requirement was changed, allowing for the use of orderly-market pricing rather than in forced-liquidation pricing. These measures lessen the risks of a crash significantly. October proved to be yet another solid month. According to S...ow Jones Indices, the Dow Industrials blue chips gaining +4.4% and the S...00 large caps +2.3%, while the S...idCap 400 and the S...mallCap 600 gained +2.2% and +1.0%, respectively. Technology once again led among sectors, surging nearly +8% (and up +37% YTD), while Telecom fell nearly -8% as the worst performer. The S...00 Equal Weight (RSP) was up 1.1% in October, but the market-cap-weighted SPDR S...00 (SPY) was up 2.2% over the same period, due to the FAAMG group. Strong economic data (particularly the leading indicators), rising corporate earnings, low inflation, a still-accommodative Fed (guarding against causing disruptive financial shocks), low interest rates, an upsloping yield curve, persistent investor caution (especially among institutions and hedge funds), and some optimism about real tax reform all suggest no recession on the horizon and a favorable climate for equities. The so-called corporate 'profit recession' ended in 2H2016, and profit growth is expected to persist at a double-digit pace into 2018 (and beyond). Moreover, the 'capex recession' may be coming to an end, further helping corporate earnings to grow. Although tax reform would certainly be expected to ignite further capex, businesses in any case likely are ready to invest to improve the productivity of the workers they already employ, substitute for the workers they need but can't find, and replace aging PP#38;E. Chicago PMI rose from 65.2 to 66.2, with a 43-year high in backlog. Consumer Sentiment printed an impressive 100.7, while Consumer Confidence soared from 119.8 to 125.9 (a 17-year high). The Dallas Fed Manufacturing Survey jumped from 21.3 to 27.6 (a 10-year high). Q2 GDP was revised up to 3.1%, and the advance estimate from the BEA for final Q3 GDP is 3.0%. But the big news comes from the Atlanta Fed's GDPNow model. On Monday, it was forecasting Q4 to come in at 2.9%. Then on Wednesday, its prediction jumped all the way up to 4.5%! Say what?! According to their website, 'The forecasts of real consumer spending growth and real private fixed investment growth increased from 2.8 percent and 4.4 percent, respectively, to 4.1 percent and 8.8 percent, respectively, after this morning's Manufacturing ISM Report on Business from the Institute for Supply Management. The model's estimate of the dynamic factor for October - normalized to have mean 0 and standard deviation 1 and used to forecast the yet-to-be released monthly GDP source data - increased from 0.04 to 1.43 after the ISM report.' These were very impressive reports. Furthermore, the global economy is expected to grow in the 3-4% range by year end. In fact, all 45 countries tracked by the OECD are on course to post positive GDP growth this year, 33 of which (including the entire eurozone) should see higher growth rates than what they posted in 2016 - which would be the largest number of countries seeing an acceleration in growth since 2010. As recently as one month ago, CME fed funds futures placed the odds of the next rate hike coming in December at 73%, but after all the strong economic and earnings news, futures now place the odds of a rate hike at or before the December meeting at 98%. The Fed has already begun unwinding its $4.5 trillion balance sheet as planned, but their slow rate of unwinding is intended to only gradually nudge up the longer end of the curve without harming borrowers or the mortgage market. The 10-year Treasury closed October at 2.38%, with the 2-year at 1.60%. So, the closely-watched 2-10 term spread closed October at only 78 bps, which is little changed over the past several months (and actually trending slightly lower) and still well under the 100 bps threshold of 'normalcy,' the 101 bps on Election Day, and the 136 bps spread achieved after the November election. In addition, credit spreads have been quite tight, with little reward to investors for taking on the higher risk in, for instance, high-yield 'junk' bonds. Notably, some junk bond traders have turned to buying equities instead of bonds. And Morgan Stanley thinks spreads between Treasuries and residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) are due to widen, so they have proposed a pair trade involving a short-sell on RMBS and a long-position on 5- and 10-year Treasuries. I have been saying for quite some time that global dynamics should keep Treasury yields in check, so long as the Fed remains slow and cautious in their path toward normalization. Drivers like global QE, the 'carry trade' from ultra-low rate countries, aging demographics in developed countries, and capital inflows into fixed income funds (largely from 401k and IRA accounts for formulaic strategic allocations) are all perpetuating the demand for bonds, which is why I haven't expected to see the 10-year yield rise to 3.0% anytime soon. My observation has been that 2.6% is a yield that has attracted a strong bid, such as last December and March. Likewise, I read that Gary Pollack, head of fixed-income trading at Deutsche Bank Private Wealth Management, said last week that the 2.6% level would entice him to buy, and BMO Capital Markets strategists wrote in a client report, 'Anything between 2.5% and 2.6%...is a fairly strong buy level.' Furthermore, Research Affiliates recently published an article[2] saying, 'the empirical evidence shows that low Treasury yields do not necessarily imply expensive bonds. Indeed, our research shows that macro fundamentals are major drivers of real interest rates and largely explain the historically low yield environmentwe should not mistake a new normal of expected lower returns for a bond bubble.A substantial share of this low yield can be explained by a secular downward trend in the rate of inflation and potential real GDP growth of the US economy.Bonds have displayed a very valuable negative relationship with the US stock market, and thus have been an excellent hedge against macroeconomic risk. All in all, bonds are not as unattractive as a simple historical comparison of their yields may suggest.' On the other hand, if corporate earnings keep up their strong trajectory and inflation picks up, some believe that rates could start to move above technical resistance levels, especially if an inflationary tax reform package passes - and the odds have indeed improved with the passage of the budget resolution by both the Senate and House, allowing a tax bill to be approved through the 'reconciliation' process with just a simple majority in the Senate. However, when total (public and private) debt-to-GDP expands like it has (currently estimated to be near 330%, comprising federal debt at 100% and corporate, household, and financial at 230%), there may be a limit to how far interest rates can rise without triggering defaults, given the financial leverage in our economy. Business defaults and bankruptcies in turn would lead to job losses and higher unemployment. And when you add to our total public and private debt all the other non-capitalized liabilities like public and private pensions and public entitlements (including Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, welfare, food stamps, unemployment comp, etc.), that 300% number actually may be 2 or 3 times higher in good times, and even higher in a slow-growth or recessionary environment. Furthermore, rising rates would be expected to slow the M2 money supply growth rate, ultimately slowing GDP growth. On the one hand, strong growth leading to inflation and higher interest rates should increase investment returns, but on the other hand, higher rates could torpedo our highly-leveraged economy. So, from the Federal Reserve's standpoint, they must strike a delicate balance because upsetting the economic applecart through tighter monetary policy (i.e., overly-hawkish interest rate hikes or asset sales) is not an option. But I don't think anyone knows for sure how high that rate threshold is. The US economy has been growing at a rate of about 2% a year for the last 10 years, which computes to total cumulative growth of about 22%. But over the same timeframe, US government debt has risen about 100%, and U.S. stock prices are up around 200%. Some economists say that this is no big deal at all, while others say that we are simply kicking the day of reckoning down the road toward an ever-worsening disaster. No one really knows the end game for this - although some would argue that our liabilities matter less than our net worth (assets minus liabilities), and it is encouraging that our asset base in the US is quite strong. In Europe, ECB president Mario Draghi continues to keep priming the pump, announcing a continuation of QE and keeping rates ultra-low such that Europe's riskiest corporate bonds yield less than 10-year U.S. Treasuries, which are the safest. In developed markets like Germany, Switzerland, Holland, Japan, government bonds of 7-year term or less are still paying negative rates. In total, something like $8 trillion reside in sovereign bonds paying negative interest rates. The game plan has been to print more money while keeping interest rates ultra-low (or even negative) to encourage borrowing, spending, and investing, rather than saving. In Japan, Prime Minister Abe was reelected, and the Nikkei index has gone parabolic the past couple of months, hitting a new 21-year high, even though Japan's average age keeps rising due to low birthrates and low immigration while government debt has risen to 240% of GDP. Yes, Alfred E. Neuman lives in Japan, too. 'What, me worry?' In any case, it is pretty clear that the world is in the midst of an unprecedented global credit growth - leading many to worry about a massive bubble, the unwinding of which is rife with uncertainty. You may have heard mention recently of a potential 'Minsky moment.' During the late twentieth century, American economist Hyman Minsky warned of a sudden collapse of asset prices following a long period of growth, sparked by debt or currency pressures. He identified three types of financing: 1) hedged financing, in which cash flows paid back principal and interest, 2) speculative financing, in which cash flows paid back interest only, necessitating a rolling over of maturing debt, and 3) Ponzi financing, which depended upon rising asset prices to remain solvent. As Fed chair Janet Yellen said in a 2009 speech, 'One of the critical features of Minsky's world view is that borrowers, lenders, and regulators are lulled into complacency as asset prices rise.' As I often discuss, our sole reliance in the US on the Federal Reserve's monetary stimulus without complementary fiscal policies (tax and regulatory reform) has resulted in huge asset inflation with little in the way of wage inflation, leading to society's widening wealth gap. However, my biggest concern is not a debt bubble here at home or in Europe or Japan, but rather in China. Despite its opacity and authoritarian government, there is no denying that China has become the primary driver of global GDP growth. We got an indication of the impact China can have on global markets back in the summer of 2015 when they warned of slower growth and some rotation from a manufacturing emphasis to services and devalued the yuan. In the face of capital flight, China had to burn through reserves to keep the currency from falling further than their target. But the country quickly reversed the tide through strict capital controls (reducing pressure on its currency) and an explosion of new credit. As the country's total debt-to-GDP continues to rise while ROI continues to fall, its economy requires accelerating credit growth just to maintain its GDP growth rate. Since summer of 2015, total debt - public and private - has expanded by something like $8 trillion, growing three times faster than the economy. Moreover, every aspect of the economy is tightly controlled. Businesses are rarely allowed to fail, as a true market-based economy would allow. Instead, the government bails out virtually all of them (and yes, I remember our own massive bailouts of the 'too big to fail' banks). Nevertheless, although an investor would be hard-pressed to identify more than a handful of attractive Chinese companies for investment, global capital continues to flow into China - much of it via passive allocations to global markets, emerging markets, and BRIC. Unlike Western capitalist economies that target monetary and fiscal policies to stimulate growth, which may or may not lead to GDP growth, China targets a GDP growth rate and does whatever it takes to hit it - including building shiny new factories that are seldom used and vast new cities that no one lives in. So, the assets they create don't always produce an ROI. Thus, its leaders have deemed it necessary to raise interest rates and tighten capital controls, which will likely reduce economic growth to some extent. In addition, their protectionist policies continue to restrict foreign manufacturers who wish to target the massive Chinese consumer base, forcing them either to take a local partner (and thus sharing profits and intellectual property, which has led to rampant IP theft) or to build manufacturing in the Shanghai 'free trade' zone (which comes with a hefty tariff). In 2010, China's government pledged to double the size of the economy by 2020, and to do so has relied upon an explosion in non-financial sector debt. Although the country's opacity and strict autocratic control makes its true situation hard to assess, there is no doubt that corporate debt has skyrocketed since the government launched a massive stimulus program in response to the global financial crisis. GDP now stands around $12 trillion while rapid credit growth that has driven the country's 'official' total (public + private) from 100% debt-to-GDP to something like 400% in less than 20 years, and is likely much higher. In its annual health check report, the IMF wrote, 'International experience suggests that China's credit growth is on a dangerous trajectory, with increasing risks of a disruptive adjustment and/or a marked growth slowdown,' and called for 'decisive action,' which of course China refutes. Similarly, the Bank for International Settlements has forecasted that excessive debt growth would lead to a banking crisis within the next three years, while S...nd Moody's both downgraded China's sovereign credit rating. Why would China work so aggressively to create such a situation? Well, perhaps it was all in preparation for a triumphant showing at its 19th Communist Party Congress, in which President Xi Jinping's name was just approved to be added to their Communist Party constitution, firmly ensconcing him as China's most powerful leader since Mao Zedong. 'What, me worry?' Nevertheless, China has shown an amazing ability to manage its peculiar form of 'bureaucratic capitalism' to keep the 'China Miracle' in gear, and it could continue as long as the government keeps up its capital controls, central bank liquidity injections when needed, and support for state-owned enterprises. Falling productivity has been a problem for all economies, but particularly for China's heavily subsidized system, so they will need to figure out how to reverse it. But history has shown that betting against this enigmatic country has been a losing proposition. According to FlexShares, China is launching an ambitious economic transformation to become a leading exporter of high-tech and capital, such as its proposed $900 billion 'One Belt, One Road' (aka OBOR) strategy to revive the historic 'Silk Road' connecting Asia, Africa, Middle East, and Europe by launching a massive infrastructure project of roads and railways, impacting 65 countries and 40% of global GDP, seeking to create deep economic and diplomatic relationships across four continents. So, the ultimate outcome of the unprecedented global credit bubble is hard to predict and even harder to time, particularly with all the governments and central banks working hard to keep the gravy train moving ahead. There is a lot of potential upside to miss out on if an investor were to hunker down exclusively in cash (or cryptocurrency). And when you also consider the unprecedented explosion of technological innovation, consumer optimism, improving corporate capex, low interest rates, and low volatility, the coast seems clear for the foreseeable future for US and global equities - including a likely continuation of the healthy broadening and market rotation we have begun to see. SPY chart review: The SPDR S...00 ETF (SPY) closed Wednesday, November 1, at 257.49. The convincing breakout above the 250 level (corresponding to 2,500 on the S...00) at the end of September continued into early October, forming what appears to have been a bull flag continuation pattern (to catch its breath). The flag had an eager-looking upslope to it, then a slight pullback ahead of the earnings reports from some big tech bellwethers, and now the appearance of an important breakout. The 2-month uptrend line coincides with the 20-day simple moving average. Oscillators RSI, MACD, and Slow Stochastic are each in a position where they might either cycle a bit lower to gather steam or simply plow further ahead from here. Support comes at the 20-day SMA (approaching 256), then the breakout level at 255, followed by the 50-day SMA (near 252) that has been providing pretty solid support all year, then a prior breakout at 250, the 100-day (near 248), prior resistance-turned-support at 245, and the critical 200-day SMA (approaching 243). SPY still hasn't tested its 200-day SMA since the election. I expect the bullish sentiment and technical breakout to hold at least through year end, unless some form of major unwanted ('Black Swan') news event sends investors running for cover. Note that the Dow Industrials, which is price-weighted, has suddenly outperformed the other indexes since early September on the backs of a handful of high-price stocks. So, some technicians are suggesting a pair trade of shorting the Dow and going long the S...00.  Latest sector rankings:  Relative sector rankings are based on our proprietary SectorCast model, which builds a composite profile of each of over 600 equity ETFs based on bottom-up aggregate scoring of the constituent stocks. The Outlook Score employs a forward-looking, fundamentals-based multifactor algorithm considering forward valuation, historical and projected earnings growth, the dynamics of Wall Street analysts' consensus earnings estimates and recent revisions (up or down), quality and sustainability of reported earnings, and various return ratios. It helps us predict relative performance over the next 1-3 months. In addition, SectorCast computes a Bull Score and Bear Score for each ETF based on recent price behavior of the constituent stocks on particularly strong and weak market days. High Bull score indicates that stocks within the ETF recently have tended toward relative outperformance when the market is strong, while a high Bear score indicates that stocks within the ETF have tended to hold up relatively well (i.e., safe havens) when the market is weak. Outlook score is forward-looking while Bull and Bear are backward-looking. As a group, these three scores can be helpful for positioning a portfolio for a given set of anticipated market conditions. Of course, each ETF holds a unique portfolio of stocks and position weights, so the sectors represented will score differently depending upon which set of ETFs is used. We use the iShares that represent the ten major U.S. business sectors: Financial (IYF), Technology (IYW), Industrial (IYJ), Healthcare (IYH), Consumer Goods (IYK), Consumer Services (IYC), Energy (IYE), Basic Materials (IYM), Telecommunications (IYZ), and Utilities (IDU). Whereas the Select Sector SPDRs only contain stocks from the S...00, I prefer the iShares for their larger universe and broader diversity.   Here are some of my observations on this week's scores: 1. Technology remains in the top spot with an Outlook score of 83, followed by Basic Materials with a score of 75. Tech displays a strong projected EPS year-over-year growth rate of 15.4%, the best Wall Street sell-side analyst sentiment (i.e., net positive revisions to EPS estimates), the highest return ratios, and a low forward PEG of 1.20 (ratio of forward P/E to forward EPS growth rate). Basic Materials boasts strong sentiment from sell-side analysts, along with solid return ratios. Financial and Healthcare come in third and fourth, primarily due to having the lowest forward P/Es of 17.6x and 16.7x, respectively. Rounding out the top six are Consumer Goods (Staples/Noncyclical) and Industrial. Then there is a gap down to Utilities. Given the market's continued strength, it might be surprising to point out that many of the sector forward P/Es are actually lower than they were last month, as EPS expectations have been lifted (for example, Healthcare has fallen from 17.5x to 16.7x). 2. Telecom and Energy continue to be the bottom dwellers with Outlook scores of 5 and 9, respectively. Both display generally weak scores across the board, including the highest forward P/Es (around 23x-26x). However, Energy notably displays by far the best projected EPS year-over-year growth rate of 29.8%, and the lowest forward PEG of 0.86. 3. Looking at the Bull scores, Technology and Financial share the top score of 56, as both have displayed relative strength on strong market days, while Utilities is the lowest at 38. The top-bottom spread is 18 points, which reflects low sector correlations on strong market days, which is favorable for stock picking. It is desirable in a healthy market to see low correlations reflected in a top-bottom spread of at least 20 points, which indicates that investors have clear preferences in the market segments and stocks they want to hold (rather than broad risk-on behavior). 4. Looking at the Bear scores, we find Utilities at the top with a score of 63, followed by Industrial at 58, which means that stocks within these sectors have been the preferred safe havens lately on weak market days. Telecom and Consumer Services (Discretionary/Cyclicals) share the lowest score of 48, as investors have fled during market weakness. The top-bottom spread is 15 points, which reflects relatively low sector correlations on weak market days, which is favorable for stock picking. Ideally, certain sectors will hold up relatively well while others are selling off (rather than broad risk-off behavior), so it is desirable in a healthy market to see low correlations reflected in a top-bottom spread of at least 20 points. 5. Technology displays by far the best all-around combination of Outlook/Bull/Bear scores, while Telecom is by far the worst. Looking at just the Bull/Bear combination, Financial and Industrial are the best, followed by Technology, indicating superior relative performance (on average) in extreme market conditions (whether bullish or bearish), while Telecom scores the worst, as investors have generally avoided the sector. 6. This week's fundamentals-based Outlook rankings reflect an increasingly bullish bias, given that five of the top six sectors are economically-sensitive or all-weather (Technology, Materials, Financial, Healthcare, Industrial). Keep in mind, the Outlook Rank does not include timing, momentum, or relative strength factors, but rather reflects the consensus fundamental expectations at a given point in time for individual stocks, aggregated by sector. ETF Trading Ideas: Our Sector Rotation model, which appropriately weights Outlook, Bull, and Bear scores in accordance with the overall market's prevailing trend (bullish, neutral, or defensive), displays a bullish bias and suggests holding Technology (IYW), Financial (IYF), and Materials (IYM), in that order. (Note: In this model, we consider the bias to be bullish from a rules-based trend-following standpoint when SPY is above both its 50-day and 200-day simple moving averages.) Besides iShares' IYW, IYF, and IYM, other highly-ranked ETFs in our SectorCast model (which scores nearly 700 US-listed equity ETFs) from the Technology, Financial, Materials sectors include PowerShares Dynamic Semiconductors Portfolio (PSI), iShares Edge MSCI Multifactor Financials (FNCF), and VanEck Vectors Steel ETF (SLX). If you prefer a neutral bias, the Sector Rotation model suggests holding Technology, Basic Materials, and Financial, in that order. On the other hand, if you are more comfortable with a defensive stance on the market, the model suggests holding Utilities, Industrial, and Basic Materials, in that order. An assortment of other interesting ETFs that are scoring well in our latest rankings include iShares US Home Construction (ITB), AlphaMark Actively Managed Small Cap (SMCP), Direxion iBillionaire Index (IBLN), Arrow QVM Equity Factor ETF (QVM), WBI Tactical SMG Shares (WBIA), ALPS Buzz US Sentiment Leaders (BUZ), Guggenheim Invest S...00 Equal Weight Technology (RYT), First Trust NASDAQ-100 Tech Sector Index Fund (QTEC), VanEck Vectors BDC Income ETF (BIZD), PowerShares Contrarian Opportunities Portfolio (CNTR), ALPS Barrons 400 (BFOR), SPDR S...etals ...ning (XME), and First Trust NASDAQ Smartphone Index Fund (FONE). IMPORTANT NOTE: I post this information periodically as a free look inside some of our institutional research and as a source of some trading ideas for your own further investigation. It is not intended to be traded directly as a rules-based strategy in a real money portfolio. I am simply showing what a sector rotation model might suggest if a given portfolio was due for a rebalance, and I may or may not update the information on a regular schedule. There are many ways for a client to trade such a strategy, including monthly or quarterly rebalancing, perhaps with interim adjustments to the bullish/neutral/defensive bias when warranted, but not necessarily on the days that I happen to post this article. The enhanced strategy seeks higher returns by employing individual stocks (or stock options) that are also highly ranked, but this introduces greater risks and volatility. I do not track performance of the ideas mentioned here as a managed portfolio. Disclosure: The author has no positions in stocks or ETFs mentioned.

The index was +6.3% higher than its pre-COVID high on 2/19/20 and +56.2% higher than its COVID selloff low on 3/23/20. But any market technician would tell you that the further the market rises without a pause, the more severe the inevitable pullback. And indeed, along came the traditionally challenging month of September and a nasty bout of profit-taking mixed with capital preservation - and exacerbated by the standoff on new fiscal stimulus, an uptick in COVID cases hindering global economic reopening, and the potential for a SCOTUS nomination firestorm. Many of the investor darlings from among the disruptive, secular-growth Technology companies that had been surging so strongly have suddenly fallen hard, with the S&amp;#38;P 500 (SPY) pulling back -10.3% from its 9/2/20 intraday high to its 9/21/20 intraday low and the tech-laden Nasdaq 100 (QQQ) falling -14.3%. After giving back all of August's strong gains, perhaps Monday was the capitulation day from which the market can recover anew. </p><p>Q3 earnings reporting season starts in a couple of weeks, so it will be important to get a read on the trajectory of earnings recovery and forward guidance. I have written often about the stark market bifurcation that has developed over the past few years, beginning with the unwinding of the 'Trump Bump' reflation trade in light of the emerging trade wars. It led to historic extremes in Growth over Value and Large over Small caps, with the broad-market, cap-weighted indexes hitting new highs as investment capital has favored mega-cap, secular-growth Tech and passive, market-cap-weighted ETFs. But today, although I think it is unlikely that investors are giving up on Technology names, their high relative valuations as the economy enters what I see as an early-stage expansionary cycle appear to be opening the door for greater market breadth and some capital rotation into value, cyclicals, and smaller caps. My expectation is that, as the historic imbalances in Value/Growth and Small/Large performance ratios gradually revert and market leadership broadens, strategic beta ETFs, active selection, and equal weighting should thrive once again. This should be favorable for value, growth-at-a-reasonable-price (GARP), and quality-oriented strategies like Sabrient's, although not to the exclusion of secular growth industries. In other words, an investor should be positioned for both cyclical and secular growth. This is why, rather than continuing to wait around for the value/growth performance gap to converge, we chose to introduce new enhancements to our GARP stock selection process to better balance value-oriented cyclical growers with consistent secular growers while also reducing relative volatility versus the benchmark. Moreover, we have leveraged our full suite of 7 core quantitative models to create 11 new strategic-beta, passive indexes. You will be hearing more about these in the near future. In this periodic update, I provide a comprehensive market commentary, offer my technical analysis of the S&amp;#38;P 500 chart, review Sabrient's latest fundamentals-based SectorCast rankings of the ten US business sectors, and serve up some actionable ETF trading ideas. In summary, while I still have a favorable long-term view on stocks, there will be plenty of volatility ahead. In addition, our sector rankings have a moderately defensive bias (given that the near-term outlook in our fundamentals-based model is muddled and the Outlook scores are tightly bunched), the technical picture looks might be setting up for a bullish reversal, and our sector rotation model sits in a neutral posture. As a reminder, you can find my latest Baker's Dozen slide deck and commentary on terminating portfolios at <url normalizedValue=\"http://bakersdozen.sabrient.com/bakers-dozen-marketing-materials\">http://bakersdozen.sabrient.com/bakers-dozen-marketing-materials</url>[1]. Read on....[2] Market Commentary: The speed of the recovery rally from the pandemic lows was historic, but in retrospect, it makes sense. With a robust economy suddenly shut down from no fault of its own, and with an apparent light at the end of the pandemic tunnel, a gradual reopening of the economy underway, an expectation of historic economic reacceleration no matter who wins the impending election, and massive monetary and fiscal stimulus putting risk capital in the hands of big hedge funds, corporate chieftains, idled salespeople, and furloughed waiters alike, it's little wonder that much of that capital found its way into stocks. Investors across the board seem to be mimicking MAD Magazine's Alfred E. Neuman's slogan, 'What, me worry?' But if you looked under the hood, the dispersion was huge, with big winners and big losers, largely influenced by their industries - e.g., work-from-home (WFH) technology thrived while travel &amp;#38; leisure was in a depression.No doubt, the economy in general and those highly impacted industries in particular still face a long list of obstacles including an unyielding pandemic, extreme political polarization (like different planets), intractable social unrest, an existential confrontation with China, massive destruction from historic fires, hurricanes, and rioting, and poor visibility in corporate earnings. So, yes, it was inevitable that stocks would need to pullback after going almost straight up for two months, capped off by a 'blow-off top' on the first two days of September. The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) held well below the 20 handle throughout all of 2019 until late February this year, before the coronavirus sent it surging to new all-time highs. And despite a robust market recovery, it has remained above 20 ever since, which I think is another indication that the market isn't truly healthy, given narrow leadership, big losers across a wide swath of the market, and total neglect of the cyclical sectors that typically thrive in a strong economy. Another contributor to the elevated volatility is the increase in algorithmic trading. As algorithms feed off one another, price movements are exaggerated and volatility increases, which reduces liquidity as market makers are forced to reduce the inventory their firms allow them to carry. Without liquidity, price movements are further exaggerated, and the vicious cycle feeds on itself until the big institutional money comes in to put a bid under the market and restore confidence. In addition, a WSJ article earlier this month uncovered what likely created August's unusual options activity and massive runup in the Nasdaq Composite Index by outlining how the mega investment firm/incubator SoftBank Group (STFBY) apparently launched a trading arm to buy $4 billion of shares in the mega-cap Tech stocks and leveraged it further through call options to control $50 billion worth of those stocks. Both the algo trading and SoftBank's manipulation are just more signs of the times. Tech dominance and valuations: Despite the pullback, concentration in the S&amp;#38;P 500 remains near its highest in decades, and the five dominant mega-cap FAAAM stocks - Facebook (FB), Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Microsoft (MSFT) - compose over $6.5 trillion in market capitalization (although down from over $7 trillion). They account for about 25% of the total market cap of the S&amp;#38;P 500 (versus 16% last year) and about 50% of the Nasdaq 100. Led by YTD returns of +60.2% in AMZN and +51.0% in AAPL (through Monday 9/21/20), FAAAM have returned an average of +33.7% so far this year and contributed +8.1% to the cap-weighted S&amp;#38;P 500 return of only +3.1%, which means the other 500 stocks in the benchmark in aggregate lost -5.0%. Further illustrating the narrow market leadership, the equal-weight S&amp;#38;P 500 is down -6.6% and the equal-weight S&amp;#38;P SmallCap 600 Index is down -15.8% YTD. And amazingly, the market cap of AAPL exceeded $2.0 trillion before the pullback, and it still sits at nearly $1.9 trillion, which all by itself exceeds the total market capitalization of the entire Russell 2000 small cap index! The growing dominance of a few juggernauts is troublesome for a few reasons. One is an apparent lack of confidence in the broader economic recovery. Another is the apparent preference for passive indexing (particularly the broad, cap-weighted indexes). But perhaps the main reason is their extreme influence over our economy, the marketplace, privacy, free speech, and indeed our very way of life. They have the power to control the narrative. They can either acquire or crush any new entrants into their domains. All of this has contributed to rising societal discord, rising cases of depression, disinflation, wealth inequality, populism, and protectionism - leading to growing calls to rein them in with anti-monopolistic measures. On the other hand, as I have discussed in previous articles, the Technology sector may be able to justify elevated valuations given its leadership in high-growth secular trends that are revolutionizing the way we work and live, as well as high operating leverage, reliable earnings, strong cash flow generation, large cash positions, pristine balance sheets, and independence from any underlying commodity price that characterize so many of the dominant players in the space. These, along with today's ultra-low cost of capital, combine to justify higher valuations than many long-time investors might be comfortable with. Indeed, today's Tech sector is far different than 1999. Moreover, they have seen rapid improvement in their already-strong businesses during the pandemic crisis due to work-from-home (WFH) and e-commerce dynamics. And again, we have all that market liquidity creating demand for these names that far outstrips the limited supply of shares. For investors, stocks and options in big Tech companies are highly liquid, which makes them attractive to hold, and for institutional portfolio managers who find themselves underperforming benchmarks this year due to the historically elevated valuations in the space, they may find it necessary to chase these names higher into the end of Q3 - and likely into the end of the year. DataTrek pointed out another interesting observation. The high multiple on the S&amp;#38;P 500 is not solely due to Big Tech: 'Proctor &amp;#38; Gamble, Home Depot, Coke and Walmart all trade for 24x earnings, right on top of Google and Facebook. Disney actually goes for 50x 2021 numbers. Bottom line: big multiples are (almost) as much a function of competitive position and potential cyclical upside as they are simply 'tech premiums.'' And even at an historically elevated forward P/E of 21.5x on the S&amp;#38;P 500, it provides a dividend yield of around 1.85%, which is so much more attractive than 0.69% on the 10-year Treasury, and it provides greater capital appreciation potential as well. Flip the P/E upside down and you get an earnings yield of 4.65%, which also compares quite favorably to the Treasury yield. And this doesn't consider the benefit to the stockholder of share buybacks, which are way down this year in reaction to a combination of holding cash to weather pandemic uncertainties, certain market segments needing federal financial support, and the negative perception of using cash to buy back shares (which only benefits the shareholder) rather than maintaining employment levels, new hiring, or capital spending on business growth. In addition, gold tends to do well when the equity risk premium (earnings yield minus 10-yr Treasury yield) is high or rising. A nascent rotation to value and smaller caps? The divergences in Growth/Value and Large/Small has been stark, as illustrated by the 5-year chart below of the Invesco S&amp;#38;P LargeCap 500 Pure Growth ETF (RPG) vs. Invesco S&amp;#38;P SmallCap 600 Pure Value ETF (RZV). You can see that the RZV got a brief pop following the 2016 election before falling back in line with RPG, but then RPG began to outperform starting in 2H2018, with a massive bifurcation in 2019 and most of 2020.  With current inflation and future expectations so low, it offers some explanation as to why value stocks have continued to underperform growth for most of the year. Historically, there is usually a strong correlation between inflation expectations and the Value/Growth ratio, but the recovery in inflation expectations during the COVID recovery has not followed suit, at least so far. However, even if the pullback in mega-cap Tech fails to recover quickly, it does not necessarily imply a new bear market. Rather, as the economy recovers, capital is likely to broaden its destination from a sole focus on Tech firms that thrive during lockdowns and WFH into some of the lagging industries that offer much more attractive valuations. In fact, it already may be underway, as we have seen some rotation of institutional money out of the winners and into some of the lagging value-oriented and cyclical sectors like Industrial and Financial. The continued tightening in corporate credit spreads has been supportive of this 'risk-on' rotation. The chart below compares RPG and RZV against the SPDR S&amp;#38;P 500 (SPY), Technology Select Sector SPDR (XLK), and the cyclical Industrial Select Sector SPDR (XLI). You can see that RZV and XLI were greatly outperforming over the past couple of months (prior to Monday's broad selloff).  Expansionary monetary policy and economic recoveries have historically been beneficial to smaller caps as well as to value stocks. Moreover, the Price/Book (P/B) for Growth stocks versus Value stocks overall is at a record high. And as ProShares recently pointed out, it has been 20 years since the Price/Book (P/B) for the S&amp;#38;P MidCap 400 versus the S&amp;#38;P 500 was this low. For Value to continue outperforming in earnest, we likely will need to see more incentive for money growth (i.e., a steeper yield curve) and gradually rising inflation expectations - including confirmation of economic growth from industrial metals like silver and copper. Despite little movement in Energy stocks, the oil market has been showing signs of strength over the past few weeks. Voluntary oil supply cuts from OPEC and shut-in production in the US and elsewhere, coupled with some increase in global oil demand are drawing down the previously swollen inventories. Some oil observers expect this trend to continue into year-end. In addition, manufacturing and services activity have both rebounded noticeably. Housing is worth a mention, as well, as exodus from the big cities is driving demand for new construction, remodeling, and second homes, and the associated 'deurbanization' is expected to drive a second wave of satellite office development, new distribution centers, and data centers. Speculators and momentum traders have been dealt some September pain in their profits from the 'fast and furious' recovery rally. So, with market valuations - particularly among the popular secular-growth Tech names - still at elevated levels, and with value, cyclicals, and smaller caps seemingly positioned for improved relative performance, I think it is likely that Quality metrics will come back into favor as forward earnings visibility improves. Those metrics should include the following: - Strong sales growth - Strong free cash flow - Consistent margin expansion - Consistent &amp;#38; reliable earnings growth - Positive analyst revisions - Good ROE - Sustainable earnings quality (positive trends in accruals and cash flow) - Strong balance sheet - Manageable debt load - Attractive valuation Inflation and Federal Reserve monetary policy: It was interesting to see the blockbuster M&amp;#38;A deals that were announced last week, including NVIDIA's (NVDA) $40 billion purchase from Softbank of ARM Holdings for its widely-used (including in Apple and Samsung phones) low-power, high-performance semiconductors, as well as Gilead's (GILD) move to beef up its cancer drug lineup with a $21 billion acquisition of Immunomedics (IMMU), a clinical-stage biopharma focused on cancer treatments that has never come close to profitability. Such numbers often lead me to harken back to the start of my career in the oil industry as a structural engineer for Gulf Oil in Houston in the early 1980's, when Gulf was bought by Standard Oil of California for $13 billion in what was the largest acquisition in corporate history at the time, and the combined entity was renamed Chevron Corp (CVX). Back then, you could buy a major oil company with abundant real assets in the ground worldwide and extensive physical infrastructure to transport, refine, and sell essential products for far less than it costs today for a clinical-stage biopharma. But then again, the dollar buys far less and the stock market is far higher now than in 1985. Speaking of inflation, as I have often discussed through the years, our economy's dependence upon unlimited Fed monetary stimulus has resulted in stunning asset inflation with little in the way of wage inflation. When combined with the big increase in productivity, leading to strong bottom-line growth with much less top-line growth, it has widened society's wealth gap, as those with the greatest access to capital (the 'haves,' aka 'job creators') have benefited far more than those without access (the 'have-nots,' aka 'job seekers'). The same holds true with other major economies around the world and their central banks. This puts central banks in a difficult spot, as both a rising economy and a rising stock market have become dependent upon government handouts. So, the Federal Reserve is bound and determined to juice inflation. The Fed first announced its current 2% inflation target back in 2012, but core Personal Consumption Expenditures price index (PCE) has averaged only 1.4%.Thus, the Fed has adjusted its strategy from a balance between inflation and employment to instead prioritize increasing employment, even to the detriment of controlling inflation if necessary. It will hold the federal funds rate near zero until two challenging goals are achieved: 1) its preferred inflation indicator, the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index (PCE), averages above 2% over time in what is called flexible average inflation targeting (FAIT), and 2) the unemployment rate returns to about 4.0%. The 5-year TIPS breakeven inflation rate (the expected average inflation rate over the next 5 years) rose quickly and steadily (along with stocks) since the market selloff and now sits at 1.58% as of 9/18/20 (vs. 0.14 selloff low). However, its rise has stalled while still below the long-term historical average, below the 1.65% reading from the pre-COVID stock market peak on 2/19/20, and below the trailing 5-year peak of 2.16% on 5/17/18 (when rhetoric was escalating in the China trade war. So, it appears that investors assume this inflation target is unlikely to be met any time soon. And at last week's FOMC meeting, the Fed itself seemed to agree, so it committed to keeping interest rates low through at least 2023. You can watch for early signs of an impending rise in inflation, which would include a falling dollar (versus other major currencies), a continued rise in gold price, and a rising TIPS breakeven rate. Unlimited Fed liquidity and government deficit spending have been crucial to keeping our government solvent and averting a total economic meltdown, which in days of yore would have been a surefire path to inflation. The CBO expects the deficit to hit 13% of GDP by 2050. Fed monetary policy has included zero interest rate policy (ZIRP), de facto yield curve control (YCC), open-ended quantitative easing (QE), and the buying of corporate bonds (including junk bonds and fixed-income ETFs. They might even start buying equity ETFs at some point if the stock market falters, as well as 'bailout bonds' to fund the greatly underfunded pension liabilities of states and municipalities (primarily among the blue states). Of course, the Fed's stated purpose is price stability and support for businesses to lower unemployment. But it also has resulted in a de facto 'Fed put' (an analogy to an equity put option) that has placed a perceived floor under the market and induced a speculative fervor, FOMO ('Fear of Missing Out'), and a TINA ('There is No Alternative!') mindset for equities. The power of the Fed put is evidenced by the record level of the ratio of stock market capitalization to GDP. The Fed and other major central banks around the world appear poised to keep interest rates low for years to come, which supports equity valuations in three primary ways: 1) discounting of future earnings streams at a low discount rate computes a higher present value, 2) lower cost of capital boosts EPS, and 3) bonds as an investment alternative present much less upside for capital appreciation and lower yields for income - and in fact, they offer little diversification benefit toward achieving a pension fund or endowment's total return objective. Recall the formula: Nominal GDP = Quantity of Money x Velocity of Money. So, the Fed has been flooding the economy with historic liquidity to boost the Quantity of Money and stoke a rise in inflation - both to shore up an economy paralyzed by the pandemic and to 'inflate away' massive levels of federal debt. Stimulating the Velocity of Money has been a challenge, as the St. Louis Fed shows that it has been in a downtrend since 1981 (when it measured about 3.5) and has just fallen off a cliff (with the COVID lockdown) to less than 1.0 (as shown in the chart below) - which means there is no multiplier effect at all on the money being injected into the economy. Boosting it will entail reopening the economy, ongoing fiscal stimulus (e.g., low or modest tax rates, business incentives, deregulation, infrastructure spending), a steepening yield curve to incentivize lending, falling credit spreads, and resurgent corporate capital expenditures.  Globally, the amount of central bank stimulus is much larger than what took place during the Financial Crisis. The total global fiscal and monetary stimulus this year amounts to about 28% of global GDP. M2 money supply has been growing fast, with much of it going primarily into investment assets -- stocks, bonds and real estate -- rather than goods and services, which has held down both inflation and the velocity of money. Furthermore, the Fed has cited low oil prices and weak overall demand restraining consumer price inflation. However, the pandemic has hastened the onshoring of manufacturing and supply chains for which President Trump has been pushing hard for the past few years. And then of course, many commentators have lamented that globalization, monopolistic mega-caps suppressing wages and squeezing out competitors through low prices, unenforced antitrust laws, and the rapid adoption of productivity-enhancing technology all have been deflationary - but now each of these is suddenly under intense scrutiny. Such trends are expected to help the Fed's efforts to stoke inflation. Final thoughts: No matter which party wins the November elections, I expect investors will once again look ahead to an economic recovery driven by continued Fed liquidity and massive federal deficit spending. I also expect elevated volatility, as typically the big institutional money lightens up in advance and then floods back in shortly after election day - although not necessarily into the same stocks. Winning industries and companies might vary. Of course, a Democrat sweep would be expected to reinstitute regulations and introduce sweeping policies related to taxation, climate change, social justice, healthcare, international trade, and wealth redistribution. Either way, it appears that Modern Monetary Theory (MMT) has arrived, ironically under a Republican administration and Senate. As Eric Peters of One River Asset Management opined, 'MMT proponents assumed the newly issued government bonds bought by the central bank would create the investment capital to transform America into a green economy, boost education, build affordable housing, expand healthcare, narrow inequality, and other noble causes. But there's nothing to prevent MMT from being used for any purpose; tax cuts, kleptocracy, war.' It is truly a Pandora's Box. Nevertheless, looking ahead, the Fed has committed to remain dovish for the foreseeable future, which is negative for the dollar and long-term yields but positive for stocks. This will encourage more risk-taking and capital misallocation (like Nikola), leading to further multiple expansion and quite likely a post-COVID economic surge for 2021 (and beyond). Regarding a weak dollar, its fall will be tempered by other central banks intervening to prevent their local currencies from becoming too strong (which hurts exports) in what may become a global synchronized currency devaluation versus hard assets like gold, silver, and real estate - to essentially 'inflate away' the debt by paying it back with ever-cheaper dollars. This is why I think this correction in gold and silver is a long-term buying opportunity. I continue to believe that we are in the early stages of a new expansionary economic phase and bull market that could run for several years. It would be driven by an upswing in manufacturing activity, infrastructure spending, and new technologies like 5G cellular, the Internet of Things (IoT), e-commerce, cloud computing, AI/ML, autonomous technology, robotics, 3-D printing, clean energy, blockchain, quantum computing, nanotechnology, genomics, precision medicine, and even space travel. Moreover, my expectation is that as the economy continues its gradual reopening from its COVID shutdown, supported by an imminent vaccine and/or an effective treatment (or both), the stock market advance will broaden out to include value stocks, cyclical sectors, and smaller caps. And because passive flows into the broad market indexes primarily benefit the largest companies, investors will show renewed interest in strategic beta ETFs and old-fashioned active selection. On that note, let me reiterate that Sabrient has leveraged its full suite of seven core quantitative models - GARP, Earnings Quality Rank (EQR), Growth Quality Rank (GQR), Defensive Equity, Insider Sentiment, Valuation, and Price Momentum - to create 11 new strategic-beta, passive indexes. You will be hearing more about these new indexes in the near future. As a reminder, Sabrient's enhancements to our Baker's Dozen portfolio selection approach have helped our new portfolios strike a better balance between cyclical and secular growers as well as cap sizes. Thus, we expect our new process enhancements to boost all-weather performance by: 1) reducing relative volatility versus the benchmark, 2) improving the likelihood that our selected stocks will meet earnings estimates, and 3) creating a better balance between secular-growth and cyclical-growth companies and across large/mid/small cap sizes. SPY Chart Review: After a powerful, monotonic rise in August, the SPDR S&amp;#38;P 500 ETF (SPY) gave back all of August's gains, sinking below 322 on Monday 9/21/20 before closing at 326.97. Monday's low was about -10.3% below its all-time intraday high of 358.75 from 9/2/20. Yes, it's been a tough month. SPY lost support from the uptrend line, the 20-day simple moving average (SMA) and the 50-day SMA. And then on Monday it successfully tested support at convergence of the minor support line of 320 and the 100-day SMA before bouncing strongly to form a bullish hammer pattern. The September pullback is looking like a bullish flag pattern as well, and oscillators RSI, MACD, and Slow Stochastic are all in oversold territory. So, let's see if this was a capitulation day for the pullback and the start of new uptrend.  Latest Sector Rankings:  Relative sector rankings are based on our proprietary SectorCast model, which builds a composite profile of each of nearly 500 equity ETFs based on bottom-up aggregate scoring of the constituent stocks. The Outlook Score employs a forward-looking, fundamentals-based multifactor algorithm considering forward valuation, historical and projected earnings growth, the dynamics of Wall Street analysts' consensus earnings estimates and recent revisions (up or down), quality and sustainability of reported earnings, and various return ratios. It helps us predict relative performance over the next 2-6 months. In addition, SectorCast computes a Bull Score and Bear Score for each ETF based on recent price behavior of the constituent stocks on particularly strong and weak market days. A high Bull score indicates that stocks within the ETF recently have tended toward relative outperformance when the market is strong, while a high Bear score indicates that stocks within the ETF have tended to hold up relatively well (i.e., safe havens) when the market is weak. Outlook score is forward-looking while Bull and Bear are backward-looking. As a group, these three scores can be helpful for positioning a portfolio for a given set of anticipated market conditions. Of course, each ETF holds a unique portfolio of stocks and position weights, so the sectors represented will score differently depending upon which set of ETFs is used. We use the iShares that represent the ten major U.S. business sectors: Financial (IYF), Technology (IYW), Industrial (IYJ), Healthcare (IYH), Consumer Goods (IYK), Consumer Services (IYC), Energy (IYE), Basic Materials (IYM), Telecommunications (IYZ), and Utilities (IDU). Whereas the Select Sector SPDRs only contain stocks from the S&amp;#38;P 500 large cap index, I prefer the iShares for their larger universe and broader diversity.  Here are some of my observations on this week's scores: 1. The scores are notable bunched together, which speaks to the underlying uncertainty. Technology has taken the top spot with a relatively modest Outlook score of only 62. The sector displays good sell-side analyst sentiment (positive net revisions to EPS estimates), the best return ratios, and the best projected year-over-year EPS growth rate. Although it has a high (less attractive) forward P/E of 27.2x, it has the second lowest (more attractive) forward PEG (forward P/E divided by projected EPS growth rate) of 1.89. Healthcare takes the second spot with an Outlook score of 54. Rounding out the top five are defensive sectors Utilities, Consumer Goods (Staples/Noncyclical), and Telecom. 2. The bottom five sectors are all cyclicals: Energy with an Outlook score of 3, Industrial at 32, Consumer Services (Discretionary/Cyclicals) at 32, Basic Materials at 33, and Financial at 39, which generally reflects the uncertainty (and pulled guidance) for many companies in these cyclical sectors. 3. Looking at the Bull scores, Technology displays the top score of 68, followed by Basic Materials at 65, as stocks within these sectors have displayed relative strength on strong market days. Energy, somewhat surprisingly, scores the lowest at 46. The top-bottom spread of 22 points reflects low sector correlations on strong market days. It is desirable in a healthy market to see low correlations reflected in a top-bottom spread of at least 20 points, which indicates that investors have clear preferences in the market segments and stocks they want to hold (rather than broad risk-on behavior). 4. Looking at the Bear scores, defensive sectors Utilities and Consumer Goods (Staples/Noncyclical) share the top spot with a score of 55, as stocks within these sectors have been the preferred safe havens lately on weak market days. Energy displays the lowest score of 41, as investors have fled during recent market weakness. The top-bottom spread is only 14 points, which reflects high sector correlations on weak market days. Ideally, certain sectors will hold up relatively well while others are selling off (rather than broad risk-off behavior), so it is desirable in a healthy market to see low correlations reflected in a top-bottom spread of at least 20 points. 5. Technology displays the best all-around combination of Outlook/Bull/Bear scores, while Energy is by far the worst. Looking at just the Bull/Bear combination, Basic Materials is the best, followed by Consumer Goods (Staples/Noncyclical), indicating superior relative performance (on average) in extreme market conditions (whether bullish or bearish), while Energy again has been the worst. 6. This week's fundamentals-based Outlook rankings have a moderately defensive bias, given that the bottom five are all cyclicals sectors while three the top five are dominated by defensive sectors. However, in this unprecedented climate, it is not surprising that the near-term outlook in our fundamentals-based model is muddled and the Outlook scores are tightly bunched. Equity investors seem to be positioning in anticipation of a better future, i.e., they are essentially predicting a bullish turn both in earnings projections and in our rankings over the next few months. Keep in mind, the Outlook Rank does not include timing, momentum, or relative strength factors, but rather reflects the consensus fundamental expectations at a given point in time for individual stocks, aggregated by sector. ETF Trading Ideas: Our Sector Rotation model, which appropriately weights Outlook, Bull, and Bear scores in accordance with the overall market's prevailing trend (bullish, neutral, or defensive), moved to a neutral bias and suggests holding Technology (IYW), Healthcare (IYH), and Utilities (IDU), in that order. (Note: In this model, we consider the bias to be neutral from a rules-based trend-following standpoint when SPY is between its 50-day and 200-day simple moving averages.) If you prefer a bullish bias, the Sector Rotation model suggests holding Technology, Basic Materials, and Industrial, in that order. On the other hand, if you are more comfortable with a defensive stance on the market, the model also suggests holding Utilities, Consumer Goods (Staples/Noncylicals), and Healthcare, in that order. An assortment of other interesting ETFs that are scoring well in our latest rankings include SPDR S&amp;#38;P Homebuilders (XHB), Fidelity Stocks for Inflation (FCPI), VanEck Vectors Pharmaceutical (PPH), ETFMG Treatments Testing and Advancements (GERM), Direxion Work From Home (WFH), Invesco Dynamic Building &amp;#38; Construction (PKB), SPDR MFS Systematic Core Equity (SYE), Pacer US Small Cap Cash Cows 100 (CALF), VanEck Vectors Semiconductor (SMH), VictoryShares US Multi-Factor Minimum Volatility (VSMV), WBI BullBear Rising Income 3000 (WBIE), Cambria Value and Momentum (VAMO), First Trust Nasdaq Retail (FTXD), ProShares S&amp;#38;P Technology Dividend Aristocrats (TDV), Invesco S&amp;#38;P SmallCap Value with Momentum (XSVM), VanEck Vectors Junior Gold Miners (GDXJ), and Innovator IBD 50 (FFTY). As always, I welcome your thoughts on this article! Please email me anytime. Any and all feedback is appreciated! IMPORTANT NOTE: I post this information periodically as a free look inside some of our institutional research and as a source of some trading ideas for your own further investigation. It is not intended to be traded directly as a rules-based strategy in a real money portfolio. I am simply showing what a sector rotation model might suggest if a given portfolio was due for a rebalance, and I do not update the information on a regular schedule or on technical triggers. There are many ways for a client to trade such a strategy, including monthly or quarterly rebalancing, perhaps with interim adjustments to the bullish/neutral/defensive bias when warranted, but not necessarily on the days that I happen to post this article. The enhanced strategy seeks higher returns by employing individual stocks (or stock options) that are also highly ranked, but this introduces greater risks and volatility. I do not track performance of the ideas mentioned here as a managed portfolio. Disclosure: At the time of this writing, among the securities mentioned, the author held long positions in SPY and AAPL.

However, Wall Street rallied despite all odds as global central banks continued being dovish with China (the epicenter of coronavirus) rolling out fiscal and monetary stimulus to keep the economy as well as the market upsurge going.U.S. equity funds likeSPDR S...00 ETF TrustSPY[1],Invesco QQQ Trust(QQQ) andSPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF TrustDIA[2] have advanced about 3.7%, 8.6% and 1.5%, respectively, in the period. U.S. stocks stayed quite steady amid coronavirus-induced safety trades. Particularly, big tech names with solid cash cushion have gained a lot despite the troubled times (read: Are U.S. Assets Acting as Safe Havens?</p><p> ETFs in Focus[3]).Against this backdrop, below we highlight the top and the flop sector ETFs so far this quarter.Top-PerformersAlternative Energy Alternative energy as a whole has been in a safe spot. Among the bunch, solar stocks are on a stupendous rally. Per Deloitte, there has been a decline in wind and solar construction costs as in weighted project costs dropped 13% and 37%[4], respectively, between 2013 and 2017. This is a good reason for expansion in the industry.Further, a rebound in global solar demand is noticed. The sector has every reason to gain this election year as most democrat candidates including Bloomberg are pledging to end the fossil-fuel era, going completely against President Donald Trump's call. Electric car maker Tesla's solar venture is another positive for the space.Evidently, Invesco Solar ETF TAN[5] (up 21.8%), Invesco WilderHill Clean Energy ETF PBW[6] (up 20.2%) and First Trust NASDAQ Clean Edge Green Energy ETF QCLN[7] (up 16.8%)have been winners so far this year (read: 2 ETF Areas to Gain From Michael Bloomberg's Campaign[8]).TechnologyTechnology stocks have mainly been driving the broader market of late. The phase-one U.S.-China trade deal and increasing demand for emerging technology have been acting as the tailwind. Cloud computing and AI are two areas that are consistently ruling the technology sector currently (read: These 4 Sector ETFs Look Attractive in February[9]).ARK Next Generation Internet ETF ARKW[10] (up 21.6%), WisdomTree Cloud Computing ETF WCLD[11] (up 15.8%) and MicroSectors FANG+ ETN FNGS[12] (up 20.3%) are some of the winners (read: Sign In to Social Media ETFs as Twitter Rallies on User Growth[13]).Homebuilding The housing sector appears in good shape if we go by the recently-released earnings reports.Not only earnings, the recent volley of data points also paints a rosy picture about the industry. Existing-home sales in the United States (which makes up the main part of the whole industry) jumped in December to the best clip since early 2018. Low mortgage rates have also been aiding the space. iShares U.S. Home Construction ETF ITB[14] added about 12.3% this year (read: Housing ETFs Soar on Upbeat Earnings With More Room to Run[15]).Worst PerformersEnergyChina is the world's second-largest oil consumer. Needless to say, the virus outbreak softened travel demand and shook the oil market. Traveling is affected globally too as is evident from the dropin jet and diesel fuel demand[16].Consequently,United States Oil Fund, LP USO[17]has lost 14.5% this year. Worst-performing energy ETFs were Invesco S...mallCap Energy ETF PSCE[18] (down 24.2%), SPDR S...il ...s Exploration ...oduction ETF XOP[19] (down 20.8%) and iShares U.S. Oil Equipment ...rvices ETF (IEZ) (down 15.2%) are the losers (read: Virus Scare Weighs on Oil ETFs: Go Short for the Near Term[20]).Metals ...ningChina is a huge consumerof the material. Since several cities are on lockdown following the epidemic, factories have been closed for long. Understandably, demand for materials and metals was dented.. SPDR S...etals ...ning ETF XME[21] has lost 12.5% in the year-to-date frame (read: Wining ...sing ETF Areas on Coronavirus Outbreak[22]).CannabisIt's been a volatile journey for marijuana stocks in the past year. Earnings weakness, regulatory issues, 'longer-than-anticipated product rollouts[23]and overly enthusiastic forward estimates' hit the space hard. Global X Cannabis ETF POTX[24] (down 7.4%) and Amplify Seymour Cannabis ETF CNBS[25] (down 5.2%) were some of the worst-hit marijuana ETFs.Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?Zacks' free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week.

Per the asset management company DWS, there is a 60% probability of Democratic candidate Biden winning the Presidency[1] and a 42% chance for Democrats winning the Presidency and both Houses of Congress.'So, investors must be interested in Biden's political strategy and its impact on the investment world. Amid many other proposals and agenda, Biden's $4-trillion-tax plan has been the most talked-about lately. Against this backdrop, below we highlight a few sector ETFs that are likely to gain/lose amid a sweeping blue wave. </p><p>Wining SectorsAlternative Energy The alternative energy space has always been supported by the Democratic leaders. If Democrats rule the Congress and the White House again, the stocks and ETFs in the space will get a boost. Biden is forming a plan \u2014 a Clean Energy Revolution \u2014 to address the issue of climate emergency. He sees America becoming a100% clean energy economy and net-zero emissions[2]no later than 2050. The move could further benefit ETFs likeInvesco Solar ETF(TAN) andiShares Global Clean Energy ETFICLN[3]. Consumer Staples Biden proposes to maintain the tax cuts[4] that Trump signed in 2017 for households making less than $400,000, including the larger standard deduction and child tax credit. However, Biden is likely to start the tax again at wages above $400,000, per a Wall Street Journal article. Overall, benefits for the low-income group means no tensions for consumer stocks, especially the staple ones. So, ETFs like iShares U.S. Consumer Services ETF (IYC) and Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR Fund XLP[5] should remain steady. Housing The Wall Street Journal article said that Biden would offer targeted tax credits for middle-income households, including proposals aimed at boosting retirement savings, child care and first-time home purchases. This should be beneficial for homebuilding ETFs like SPDR S&amp;#38;P Homebuilders ETF XHB[6]. A low-rate environment is another boost for the housing stocks. Manufacturing &amp;#38; Infrastructure While tax hike is a negative for Wall Street, Biden's push for tax incentives will encourage domestic manufacturing. Biden proposed a $1.3-trillion infrastructure overhaul last year. The Democratic presidential candidate's campaign aims to invest in restoring highways, roads and bridges, changing water pipes, building out rural broadband access, and updating schools among other works.The proposals should boost ETFs like iShares U.S. Infrastructure ETF (IFRA) and Invesco Dynamic Building &amp;#38; Construction ETF (PKB) and First Trust RBA American Industrial Renaissance ETF AIRR[7]. Technology Biden's foreign policy appears to be more liberal than Trump's. So, pro-immigrant hiring policies (technology companies are highly immigrant-reliant) and moderate antitrust scrutiny would likely boost Amazon.com Inc. and other Big Tech companies in the Biden era, per many policy analysts,as quoted on S&amp;#38;P Global[8]. This along with better relations with China will provide another tailwind to tech shares.Amazon has a solid exposure to funds likeFidelity MSCI Consumer Discretionary Index ETF(FDIS) while tech funds likeTechnology Select Sector SPDR FundXLK[9] are heavy on Microsoft and Apple. Losing SectorsBanks Banks were a key beneficiary in the lower-tax environment. Big U.S. banks have enjoyed an average 13% increase to earnings per share from the lower rate,per Goldman Sachs[10]. Banks also enjoyed easing of regulatory stringencies in recent years.However, under Biden's plan of tax hike, the 10 largest U.S. banks may see their combined annual net income decline by more than $7 billion,according to an S&amp;#38;P Global Market Intelligence analysis[11]. Moreover, the tax hike may also cause a volatile market and a decline in long-term interest rates due to safe-haven trades. This would further shrink net margins and lower banks' profits.SPDR S&amp;#38;P Regional Banking ETF (KRE[12])should be watched closely in the coming months. Healthcare Healthcare services was also one of the most-taxed industries before. According to MUFG Securities, tax reform probably has boosted managed care companies' earnings by 30%. In the absence of this,SPDR S&amp;#38;P Health Care Services ETFXHS[13] could lose ahead.Reuters noted[14]that domestically geared healthcare companies that were also winners of the tax reform may now feel the pressure.Invesco S&amp;#38;P SmallCap Health Care Portfolio (PSCH)could thus be a loser. Moreover, pharma stocks have long been accused of price-gouging by some democrat leaders. Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?

( OTCQX: WEYL ) are benefiting.According to onerecent report , \"Indonesia's fintech industry is in the midst of a period of significant growth. P2P lending recorded a triple-digit increase in 2018, while e-payment services have grown more than six-fold since 2012, prompting a surge of new foreign investment into a vibrant and increasingly diverse start-up community.\"A recent article fromFinTechNewsreported on the growth of the Fintech industry in Indonesia, with specific focus on one of the major players in the industry, the private company Gojek.\"Jakarta, Indonesia, is home to Gojek, one of Southeast Asia's leading on-demand multi-service platform and digital payment technology group. Gojek is the first Indonesian unicorn company, and also thefirst \"decacorn\" companyin Indonesia that's worth more than US$10 billion. Gojek operates Indonesia's fourth biggest e-wallet service Go-Pay, and from its headquarters in Jakarta, has expanded across the region to markets including Vietnam, Thailand, Singapore and the Philippines.\" </p><p>Weyland Tech, Inc. ( OTCQX: WEYL ) is also aiming to seize a part of this giant opportunity. Weyland is a growing global provider of m-Commerce and fintech business enablement solutions with its CreateApp\u2122 Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) across three continents and 10 countries, including some of the fastest-growing emerging markets in Southeast Asia, Theyrecently reportedselected preliminary unaudited financial results for the third quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2019.The company's subsidiary, Weyland Indonesia Perkasa (WIP), operates AtozPay and AtozGo. The AtozPay mobile payments platform serves the burgeoning m-Commerce and e-Payment markets in Indonesia, the world's fourth most populous country. AtozGo is a fast-growing short-distance food delivery service in Jakarta, Indonesia.For the third quarter 2019, the company expects record revenue of approximately $9.0 million, which would represent an increase of 6.6% compared to the third quarter of 2018. For the first nine months of 2019, the company expects record revenue of approximately $24.6 million, which would represent an increase of 42.6% versus the same year-ago period. The company also expects to turn adjusted EBITDA positive in the third quarter.\"These anticipated record results reflect the accelerating growth in our recurring revenue from CreateApp subscription fees,\" said Brent Suen, CEO of Weyland Tech. \"While we expect to generate positive adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter, we plan to continue to reinvest in efforts designed to gain customers and market share.\"\"The growth in recurring revenue was largely due to greater adoption of CreateApp by SMBs in our existing markets as driven by our highly-productive channel partners,\" continued Suen. \"The increased adoption included new customers as well as existing customers subscribing to additional features and modules. This momentum has continued into the fourth quarter, keeping us on track for another year of record growth.\"Offered in 14 languages with more than 70 integrated modules, Weyland enables SMBs to create and deploy native mobile applications for Apple iOS and Google Android without technical knowledge or background. The technology empowers SMBs to increase sales, reach more customers, manage logistics, and promote their products and services in an easy, affordable and highly efficient way.Gojek was mostrecently in the newsas Gojek CEO and co-Founder, Nadiem Makarim announced on Monday that he had resigned to join Indonesia's new cabinet. The ride-hailing and payments company said two senior executives would jointly take over running operations of the $10 billion firm.\"We will make an announcement on what this news means for Gojek within the next few days,\" the Company said, referring to Makarim, who has been the face of the tech startup.The Indonesian company, valued at $10 billion, raised over $1 billion earlier this year from backers including Alphabet's Google ( NASDAQ: GOOG ) ( NASDAQ: GOOGL ) and Chinese tech giants Tencent and JD .Google, which has invested $500 million in Gojek, declined to comment on Makarim's departure, while Tencent and JD did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Boku Inc ( LSE: BOKU ), alsorecently announceda partnership with GoPay, the digital payments platform of Gojek, the largest on-demand multi-service provider in Southeast Asia. Today, GoPay is the largest consumer digital payments platform in Indonesia, processing about 50% of transactions made on the Gojek platform.Through the partnership, Boku's merchant customers in Indonesia will be able to introduce GoPay as an additional payment method, enabling ease of payments for a greater pool of end-users. The partnership reflects the growing popularity of e-wallets as the primary payment mechanism for multiple use cases like transportation, recurring entertainment subscriptions, and in-app and in-game micro-purchases.\"Boku's mission is to make mobile transactions more simple and this partnership with GoPay is a big step towards accomplishing that mission,\" said Jon Prideaux, CEO of Boku Inc. \"We look forward to continuing our collaboration with GoPay to bring cashless payments to more consumers in Indonesia and to bring greater customer acquisition to global businesses operating in Indonesia.\"\"As Indonesia continues to move towards digital payments and embraces a mobile-first society, GoPay and Boku share the same vision of providing convenience and greater opportunities to both consumers and businesses,\" said Timothius Martin, SVP Digital Product, GoPay. \"With Boku's leading network of global merchants, we can immediately help traditionally underserved Indonesian consumers participate in the global digital economy.\" Ant Financial, an affiliate company of Alibaba Holdings Group Limited ( NYSE: BABA ) is looking outside of Gojek, havingrecently given $40 million in fundingto Akulaku , a Fintech lending company.The funding gives Akulaku, which does most of its business in Indonesia but recently expanded into Vietnam and the Philippines, a $450 million valuation, according toDeal Street Asia . Just a few days earlier, the outlet cited anonymous sources who said the startup wasplanningto raise $100 million in a Series D funding round.The Jakarta-based company raised $70-million in a Series C round over three months ago, led by Chinese financial technology company FinUp with participation from Sequoia India, Australia's Blue Sky and Qiming Venture Partners. A Series A round of funding took place in early 2016, raising $5 million led by DCM Ventures, followed by another $30 million from Qiming, Legend Capital, Shunwei Capital, and existing shareholders, including IDG, Arbor Ventures, DCM, Arbor Venture Fund, and Wecapital.\"Ant Financial, from day one, we are positioned as a tech company. But previously we just wanted to make sure we are really using the tech to be innovative, to create examples, to redefine financial services that people can feel, can touch,\" Ant Financial Chief Executive, Eric Jingsaidback in November.As we continue to see this trend of big tech companies willing to invest such large sums into this expanding market, Indonesia looks to remain a hub for the Fintech industry moving forward, for both large scale investors and startups looking to expand the revenue models and get in early on this rapidly growing market.

However, many companies do not see why they should protect their users by moving away from passwords; they do not see customer security as a sales point nor a part of their business practice. Meanwhile, regulators see strong authentication as a business to business practice and not as a &amp;#x2018;must have&amp;#x2019; in the consumer market.</p><p>As a result of a shift in awareness, regulations, and motivation in 2018 alone, we have more evidence than ever to believe this change will finally be implemented in the coming year, with many companies standing to benefit from its advantages.&amp;#xA0;</p><p>Shift in awareness</p><p>There was an endless cycle of credential related breaches in 2018, from HSBC to Twitter and most notably Facebook, which resulted in an increase in both business and consumer awareness for weak single factor authentication.&amp;#xA0;</p><p>Shift in regulations</p><p>With regulatory officials like HIPPA and PCI-DSS supporting multi-factor authentication and its three factor types: something you know, something you have and something you are, this mode of verification is here to stay. &amp;#xA0;</p><p>Shift in liability</p><p>With the implementation of The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) this year, the liability has shifted from the end user to the data handler and data processor, leaving the company legally liable for any breach of customer privacy and information. This change in liability hits organizations where it hurts &amp;#x2013; profits &amp;#x2013; giving them an incentive to provide better authentication processes to employees and customers alike.</p><p>These shifts have been predicted, however in the last few months we have seen an interesting shift in the least expected place: the US government. Sen. Richard Blumenthal tweeted that &amp;#x201C;we must set clear customer data protection standards for all companies &amp;#x2014; whether they&amp;#x2019;re hotel chains, online retailers, or big tech &amp;#x2014; and severe penalties for those who fall short.&amp;#x201D;</p><p>The public, regulators, and government are each aware of the dangers of passwords. In 2019 we will start to see companies which already utilize multi-factor authentication, present it as a unique sales value. Companies that don&amp;#x2019;t already use it will begin to support multi-factor authentication and use their newfound security to attract customers.&amp;#xA0;</p><p>User experience and cost are two other components we believe will also soon adapt. An attractive business model is to offer a less expensive option for identity security that is both easier and more secure. According to Gartner&amp;#x2019;s 2018 Market Guide for User Authentication:</p><p>&amp;#x201C;By 2022, 60% of large and global enterprises, and 90% of midsize enterprises (MSEs), will implement passwordless methods in more than 50% of use cases, which is an increase from fewer than 5% today.&amp;#x201D;</p><p>Passwordless authentication is more secure, requires less maintenance (password resets, employee downtime) and the overall experience is simpler and easier, creating a superior user experience and a higher conversion of sales. Although over a decade too early, Bill Gates got it right in 2004 as we will see the masses move away from passwords in 2019. &amp;#xA0;&amp;#xA0;&amp;#xA0;</p><p>Raz Rafaeli, CEO and Co-founder of Secret Double Octopus&amp;#xA0;</p><p>We've also highlighted the best free password managers<br/>Future Publishing Limited Quay House, The Ambury, Bath BA1 1UA.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TBREAK-134208862</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TBREAK2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5V38-20H1-JDJN-625W-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">381179</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-12-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"654\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 TBREAK MEDIA Provided by Syndigate Media Inc.

Could this mark the end of traditional passwords?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">At RSA s 2004 security conference, Bill Gates predicted,  There is no doubt that over time, people are going to rely less and less on passwords,  adding that passwords  just don t meet the challenge for anything you really want to secure.  </p><p>A pertinent truth that is often forgotten when discussing the importance of authentication is that passwords should have been removed from the equation a long time ago. However, many companies do not see why they should protect their users by moving away from passwords; they do not see customer security as a sales point nor a part of their business practice. Meanwhile, regulators see strong authentication as a business to business practice and not as a  must have  in the consumer market.</p><p>As a result of a shift in awareness, regulations, and motivation in 2018 alone, we have more evidence than ever to believe this change will finally be implemented in the coming year, with many companies standing to benefit from its advantages. </p><h>Shift in awareness</h><p>There was an endless cycle of credential related breaches in 2018, from HSBC to Twitter and most notably Facebook, which resulted in an increase in both business and consumer awareness for weak single factor authentication. </p><h>Shift in regulations</h><p>With regulatory officials like <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.hipaajournal.com/hipaa-password-requirements/\">HIPPA</url> and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://doubleoctopus.com/security-wiki/regulations/payment-card-industry-data-security-standard/\">PCI-DSS</url> supporting multi-factor authentication and its three factor types: something you know, something you have and something you are, this mode of verification is here to stay.  </p><h>Shift in liability</h><p>With the implementation of The General Data Protection Regulation (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/what-is-gdpr-everything-you-need-to-know\">GDPR</url>) this year, the liability has shifted from the end user to the data handler and data processor, leaving the company legally liable for any breach of customer privacy and information. This change in liability hits organizations where it hurts   profits   giving them an incentive to provide better authentication processes to employees and customers alike.</p><p>These shifts have been predicted, however in the last few months we have seen an interesting shift in the least expected place: the US government. Sen. Richard Blumenthal tweeted that  we must set clear customer data protection standards for all companies   whether they re hotel chains, online retailers, or big tech   and severe penalties for those who fall short. </p><p>The public, regulators, and government are each aware of the dangers of passwords. In 2019 we will start to see companies which already utilize multi-factor authentication, present it as a unique sales value. Companies that don t already use it will begin to support multi-factor authentication and use their newfound security to attract customers. </p><p>User experience and cost are two other components we believe will also soon adapt. An attractive business model is to offer a less expensive option for identity security that is both easier and more secure. According to Gartner s 2018 Market Guide for User Authentication:</p><p> By 2022, 60% of large and global enterprises, and 90% of midsize enterprises (MSEs), will implement passwordless methods in more than 50% of use cases, which is an increase from fewer than 5% today. </p><p>Passwordless authentication is more secure, requires less maintenance (password resets, employee downtime) and the overall experience is simpler and easier, creating a superior user experience and a higher conversion of sales. Although over a decade too early, Bill Gates got it right in 2004 as we will see the masses move away from passwords in 2019.    </p><p>Tags: <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">See Campaign:</emphasis><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/secure-and-easy-authentication-will-become-a-business-advantage-in-2019\">https://www.techradar.com/news/secure-and-easy-authentication-will-become-a-business-advantage-in-2019</url><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Contact Information:</emphasis><br/>Raz Rafaeli<br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tags:</emphasis><br/>,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://icrowdnewswire.com/category/news-category/wire/\">Wire</url>,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://icrowdnewswire.com/category/news-category/artificial-intelligence-newswire/\">Artificial Intelligence Newswire</url>,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://icrowdnewswire.com/category/global-regions/united-states/\">United States</url>,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://icrowdnewswire.com/category/language/english/\">English</url><br/><br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ICRWDE-httpicrowdnewswirecom20190101secureandeasyauthenticationwillbecomeabusinessadvantagein2019couldthismarktheendoftraditionalpasswords2</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ICRWDE2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5V3M-56T1-JCTB-F2K1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">433665</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-01-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"694\"/><timeReceived>5:34 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 iCrowdNewswire, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>iCrowdNewswire (English)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"30185\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"01\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>January 1, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

While the internet brings us more than its fair share of misinformation, the cure for this is more and better information. That's why protecting an open internet is so crucial.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Big broadband providers and Big Tech gatekeepers should not have the ability to manipulate how we get our information online in order to fatten their profits by blocking competitors or driving consumers to their favored products and services. Protecting consumers through smart legislation is the only way to achieve this.</p><p> I am the COO of a small ISP in Helena, Montana, and my business partners and I vocally opposed the Federal Communications Commission's (FCC's) attempts to remove net neutrality in 2017. We continue to fight for keeping and open and unrestricted internet.</p><p> In 2018, we were one of only a handful of ISPs who supported Gov. Bullock's executive order making net neutrality a requirement of contracting with the state of Montana. We appreciate his leadership on this issue and continue to be amazed at the shortsightedness of critics who fight against common-sense regulation.</p><p> But this approach \u2013 a patchwork quilt, state-by-state mishmash of various requirements and sometimes weird conflicts, isn't helpful either. It's pretty easy for our company to comply for now, as we only serve customers in Montana \u2013 but that won't be the case forever, and there are other small ISPs who cross state lines and are faced with competing regulations that make it harder to serve customers well. It's not efficient, and it's just plain stupid.</p><p> Without net neutrality protections, consumers risk being forced to pay additional fees for services like streaming (on top of the fees the streaming services charge) or social media (on top of being the product for those companies) and many other sites. Imagine being told that you can't go to the website for your local bookstore because Amazon worked a deal with Verizon or Google to drive all the book site requests to Amazon's online store. Net neutrality prevents this from happening, and it's why we need a nationwide law, today.</p><p> For more than a decade, progressives have led the fight in D.C. for net neutrality rules from the FCC. Instead, we've gotten the usual Beltway two-step: every step-forward effort has been followed by a loss in the courts or a reversal by a successive Republican administration. Last October, a federal court affirmed the FCC's most recent repeal of open internet rules. This continued fight \u2013 with a win here and a loss there \u2013 is good business for lobbyists, but it's exhausting and ridiculous for the rest of us.</p><p> The only way to permanently protect the open internet for all Americans is through bipartisan legislation.</p><p> House Democrats passed a bill last year to do this, but of course, it stalled in the Senate. That bill definitely gave very strong protections to consumers, which is needed \u2013 but it also reclassified broadband providers under the rules and regulations of 1930s telephone laws. And let's be clear \u2013 your internet is not the same as your great-grandfather's phone.</p><p> This well-intentioned but not well-thought-out approach means that even our company, a tiny ISP that upholds net neutrality and is just trying to provide our customers great internet service, would face significant new hurdles before we could offer new services or change our network management technologies. We would face a massive pile of new reporting, red tape, and money to lawyers and consultants, all of which diverts us from expanding into new areas and serving more customers, which is a negative all around. That bill is basically a case study in unintended consequences combined with overzealous advocacy.</p><p> The current situation is that net neutrality is caught in the valley of death between the two political parties. The conservatives claim that any regulation will impede business, while the progressives see the need for a bill but have embraced an approach that is dead on arrival in the Senate. In the end, consumers are the ones who lose, because we don't have these protections.</p><p> It's time for members of both parties, in both the House and the Senate, to put down their battle-axes and instead start hammering out a new piece of legislation. Democrats must insist on clear, enforceable rules against the blocking, throttling or preferences to any and all internet traffic by ISPs, Big Tech giants, or any other entity. No exception. No loopholes. And so long as this is included, they should be pragmatic enough to get it passed. Protecting net neutrality should be the law of the land.</p><p> Most importantly, it can be passed and enforced as its own thing, without the ridiculous rules and regulations developed for telephones and railroads in the early part of the last century. In fact, majorities on both sides support this \u2013 it's just the foolish posturing and purity tests that are blocking a solution.</p><p>Montana has a long legacy of leading on issues like this, and our senators, Jon Tester and Steve Daines, have an opportunity to offer bipartisan leadership. Our senators should work to break the gridlock and finally secure permanent, nationwide protections for the open internet.</p><p> Kev Hamm is the chief operating officer for Treasure State Internet and Telegraph in Helena.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKMT-bad9a88f24ffd5c0f72ce11d13fea43c255ad7e</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F289A062C31942B NWBKMT2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YJR-HK91-JBCN-43B3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409146</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"892\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Lee Enterprises, Inc.<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

In an exclusive interview with Binary District, Daniel Gasteiger, the co-founder of Procivis, an electronic ID solutions company built on integrated e-government platform eID+; and Patrick McCorry, a Research Associate at University College London (UCL), discussed the potential of blockchain technology in e-governance and the limitations that may restrict its applicability. Potential applications of blockchain technology in e-governanceOver the last two years, several governments, including those of Brazil and Georgia,have utilized blockchain technology[2]to manage electoral votes, land registry and digital identities. While many countries have fallen behind Brazil and Georgia in the adoption of blockchain technology, the governments of Japan, South Korea, and the US have vowed to continue exploring the value of the technology in e-governance. </p><p>As a data processing technology, blockchain is largely applicable to many of government's functions and services. Gasteiger explained that blockchain technology could replace existing infrastructures and methods, such as electoral votes and the digitization of ownership. 'The blockchain further allows governments to digitize their registries, for instance, land registry, commercial registry or marriage registry, and it can facilitate the secure allocation and distribution of social benefits. By implementing these applications, governments can foster public trust and increase citizens' engagement,' said Gasteiger. The application of blockchain technology in e-voting and the real estate registry would see governments processing millions of transactions on a public blockchain network daily. This could, in turn, increase the potential and facilitate the adoption of blockchain commercially. Gasteiger further reiterated the importance of the immutability and decentralization. These two characteristics give blockchain a significant edge over existing technologies because it ensures that information is readily accessible and allows both the government and the public to verify that it has been unaltered. Moreover, this is all recorded in a transparent ledger without the fear of hacks or security breaches. 'The blockchain's characteristics of immutability and decentralization offer two crucial advantages. First, the validity of any official document stored on the blockchain can be reliably verified at any time. Second, the decentralized nature of the blockchain allows governments to digitize their services without the need to create a central storage for sensitive data, sometimes called a honeypot, which would represent an attractive target to hackers,' added Gasteiger. However, immutability and decentralization come with huge costs and tradeoffs \u2014 namely scalability. While public blockchains are extremely secure and virtually impervious to security breaches because they are distributed and don't have a single point of failure, they struggle to process large amounts of data at fast speeds. In order for data to be sent and received on a blockchain network, every node on the network must synchronize to ensure that each piece of information is verified and confirmed. By eliminating miners and processing information within the network through stakeholders, the migration from the proof-of-work (PoW) consensus protocol to theproof-of-stake (PoS) consensus protocol algorithm[3]could ease the burden on nodes and users. In a PoW-based system, miners use electricity and computing power to solve blocks and process information. In a PoS-based system, miners are nonexistent and those holding that cryptocurrency can process data without the need for electricity and computing power. The principle of PoS is based on the idea that stakeholders or holders of the cryptocurrency will not deliberately make negative decisions for the network. On this issue, Gasteiger noted that the migration of public blockchains, like Ethereum, to PoS could improve scalability 'There are still key aspects of the blockchain value proposition that the current technology doesn't yet deliver on. For instance, the move from proof of work to proof of stake is still outstanding, a step that should increase performance and scalability. In addition, I believe the right equilibrium between a fully-decentralized and a more centralized development paradigm for public blockchains still has to be found.'Blockchain technology \u2014 impractical for e-governance?Despite the wide range of applications blockchain technology could power, UCL researcher Patrick McCorry has stated that scalability is still the primary issue for any public blockchain. Ethereum remains the most flexible and scalable blockchain network in the global cryptocurrency market, settling more than1.3 million transactions a day[4]according to Etherscan. As such, it has a daily transaction volume larger than that of all cryptocurrencies in existence combined, including bitcoin. Even with Ethereum's flexible blockchain network, it doesn't have the capacity or efficiency to fit hundreds of millions of votes on the blockchain. At this time, public blockchains can only handle around a million transactions a day. For instance, if the Brazilian government was to process its popular petitions on the Ethereum blockchain, which it plans to do in the future, only around 500,000 votes could be processed a day. Given its obvious inefficiencies, governments have begun exploring methods which could enable blockchains to process large amounts of information outside of the main blockchain network and then simply send a compilation of information to the blockchain. In the recent testing of its Ethereum-based electoral system, theBrazilian government utilized a system called hashing[5]to combine all daily votes into a single transaction and broadcast it to the Ethereum blockchain network. Systems like hashing allow blockchains to process large amounts of information in chunks, compile it into one transaction and, ultimately, process it much more efficiently and at a lower cost. McCorry, however, maintains that the system employed by the Brazilian government only solves the specific issue of time-stamping. He emphasized that it does not solve the problem of scalability as a whole. 'This is mostly to do with time-stamping and committing to a set of votes in such a way that the Brazilian government cannot remove or add votes in the future. I think it is honorable that they have attempted to add further integrity to their electoral system using the Ethereum blockchain, but it only solves this one issue. It does not help solve ballot stuffing or authenticating voters. That depends on the voting protocol being used by Brazil,' said McCorry. He asserted that he is not convinced of the applicability of blockchain technology in e-governance or why it is better than traditional database replication techniques in the management of votes, land registry and digital identifications. 'It can provide some benefits in terms of proving to the general public that data has not changed over time (i.e. by time-stamping and committing to data). However, I'd be wary of the government collecting information about the general public and storing it in the blockchain. I've not really been convinced why this type of data needs to be stored on a blockchain or why it is suitable for this purpose compared to traditional database replication techniques.' Henrique Costa, a law professor at Universidade de Braslia, who is currently an advisor to the Brazilian government on the testing of Ethereum blockchain network in processing electoral votes, gave a contrasting opinion. In regions like Brazil where corruption remains a serious issue, Costa said that the blockchain could bring legitimacy to the country's electoral system by processing information transparently. Costa added that, in Brazil, there is no secure method of gathering votes and signatures from the people when processing popular petitions. In this system, a regulatory proposal can be heard in Congress if the signatures of 1 percent of Brazil's population are obtained. The blockchain could be used to manage these popular petitions along with other important aspects of the country's electoral system. While McCorry believes that e-governance is a compelling use case for blockchain technology, he still holds that, for now, blockchain has 'very little' advantage over existing technologies. 'It really depends on the application and sometimes it takes great imagination, intuition or experience within the sector to find a compelling use case,' explained McCorry. 'A smart contract (and blockchain) works best when there are two or more mutually distrustful parties that wish to perform some shared computation. It works great for financial applications such as trading assets or currencies. So far, for e-voting and e-governance, it seems only useful for proving that data hasn't been changed (i.e. time-stamping) or providing a consistent view to all voters.' Ultimately, there are no compelling use cases for blockchain technology that are better or more efficient than existing technologies. Nevertheless, as scalability improves, second-layer scaling solutions are implemented and blockchain is adopted by the e-governance sector, more convincing use cases of blockchain technology will likely emerge.

That everyone knows. Structured data. Unstructured data. Data analytics. Data monetization. But when it comes to social media, which is also rich in personal data, many other questions are thrown up. What about data privacy? What about data security? What about data sovereignty?<br/><br/>All these issues have come to a head in 2020. First up, the biggest story is that India has banned dozens of Chinese apps and the world has not only taken note; but followed suit. It's not just about a global rivalry or the skirmishes at the border. If Chinese apps are storing data in Chinese servers and the government there has access, then it serves as a major security breach. In fact for the Indian soldiers at the border, the ban list was expanded to even include American apps. This is also one of the reasons that Huawei came under the scanner: National security.</p><p>Data localization is a big issue. Ideally we should have enough data centres across the country, both private and government, and data that relates to the citizens of India should never leave its shores. We need strong legislation on those grounds. However our utter dependence on US and Chinese apps has to do with the fact that Indian apps have not at all been successful. Look at all the popular means of communication. Facebook. Instagram. WhatsApp. TikTok. LinkedIn. Twitter. Zoom... you won't find a single name in the global list. Till Indian IT makes the pivot from services to apps, such issues will persist. India also set up a committee last year to look into sharing non-personal data<br/><br/>In the US, President Donald Trump has taken on TikTok head on. The Chinese company will now have to sell off its US operations if it has to survive there. Trump had taken on Huawei and has come out with a Clean Network Policy: Clean Carrier, Clean Store, Clean Apps, Clean Cloud &amp; Clean Cable. Silicon Valley doesn't have just Trump to worry about. The US Congress has also taken on Big Tech. Amazon's Jeff Bezos, Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg, Apple's Tim Cook and Google's Sundar Pichai all had to testify in the anti-trust case. What do we call it? Data monopoly? He who controls the data controls the world and now governments of the world are waking up to that fact. Continuing with the US, more than half of the State Attorney Generals there are looking into anti-trust violations by Big Tech. Data woes continue as a data transfer arrangement between the US and EU set in 2016 has faced recent legal troubles.<br/><br/>Zuckerberg has been summoned by the Parliaments of both UK and Canada. He didn't go to testify. The Canadian government has summoned him with a subpoena and he could be technically arrested if he sets foot in Canada and doesn't testify. Such a thing won't happen, but these collisions show that governments are finally waking up to the power of big social media.<br/><br/>China is a unique case where the Internet there is dominated by Chinese companies and the likes of Google Search and Facebook don't have a role. All their data pipes are virtually closed to the world. Russia wants to separate its Internet from the global Internet. Is this the way forward where countries will maintain their own data silos?<br/><br/>Maybe the maximum action has happened in the European Union. They came out with the General Data Protection Regulation which set the pace for most of the world. They are planning a comprehensive ePrivacy Regulation (ePR). The EU had begun a competition investigation against Google way back in 2010. While the EU have levied massive fines against Big Tech companies, the latter seem to have generally gotten their way in the way they do business.<br/><br/>Recently the EU has tried to change rules to make data unlocking much easier for them, but that's easier said than done. They are coming out with a Data Act in 2021 that should increase the sharing of data between governments and businesses. It is also bringing in things such as data generated from IoTs (Internet of Things) in industries (key for 4.0). Today we have more IoTs than people and the absolute upper limit for IoTs by 2030 is 500 billion. One can't even comprehend the amount of data that will be coming out.<br/><br/>Things are getting more and more complicated and it's not just about the volume of data. There is so much data that humans cannot handle it. Algorithms will sift through the data ocean. When Artificial Intelligence takes over (along with Machine Learning and Deep Learning) for management of data, who will be held responsible if something goes wrong?<br/><br/>The 2020s will see a lot of data questions asked and maybe not all of them will be answered.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CIOL-0054323150</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CIOL2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60RR-PD51-JB5M-W3V8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">365403</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"765\"/><timeReceived>6:30 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 CIOL, distributed by Contify.com All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>CIOL</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"31\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 31, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"81\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>NAICS423430 COMPUTER &amp;

Underpinning this was the impact of data management and analytics and of course GDPR. Vinod Ganesan Country Manager India, Cloudera, looks back over the year and looks at the key tech areas for 2019:</p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">IoT</emphasis></p></bodyText></listItem></list><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In 2019, security has to be the number one focus point for organisations to ensure the safety and efficacy of edge devices and networks accordingly. There are too many vulnerabilities and gaps in the security posture for IoT devices -  organisations must take a proactive approach to secure devices. Organizations must use the data, metadata, device logs - treating IoT devices like any other network device to predict and accurately respond to the available signals.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Context is the next major frontier in IoT</p><p>More data islands have been created with IoT, we are now starting to bridge the islands but we don't speak the same collective language. The ability to acquire data from disparate systems and align it on common ontologies so we can trust and utilize the data.  The clock speed for decision-making is increasing, while information expands exponentially underneath our feet. As AI and machine learning evolve, allowing these capabilities to organize the data, attribute it from a universe of observations, and produce auto-didactic insights, will give us opportunities not yet imagined.  Lineage - \"what did we know and when did we know it\" will be a key capability that allows organizations to use data optimally.</p><p>Next year we will see further use cases of IoT in home spaces, smart cities and more industrial use cases in automation or autonomous vehicles. Technology ecosystems are forming so a holistic view of data across the cloud to the edge is important to maximise the benefit of the data used across these ecosystems.</p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GDPR</emphasis></p></bodyText></listItem></list><p>The fines associated with non-compliance of the regulation are significant: up to 4% of annual global turnover or $20 million, whichever is greatest. Even if an organisation would not flinch at those kinds of numbers, the impact on their reputation would certainly get them to care about complying. GDPR to a large extent is about showing your customers and employees you are careful with their data, that it is used for the right purpose and that, ultimately, they have control. With that control also comes trust. And any organisation care about that.</p><p>Companies made personally accountable for how they treat privacy and personal data</p><p>Yes, it is true companies are now personally accountable for GDPR regulated data across the complete data flow, including partners that they need to exchange information with. That also makes it crucial for smaller organisations, suppliers to larger ones, to achieve and maintain their GDPR compliance as it becomes a competitive differentiator.</p><p>Big fines ahead for big tech and companies that fail to have adequate security</p><p>Data security is but part of GDPR, though an important one: organisations now have the obligation to notify the regulator within 72h of a data breach being discovered. The complete post-breach process including informing the affected individuals is now well defined and following it part of compliance requirements. Under Article 25, data protection must be implemented by design and by default; security forms a natural part.</p><p>The effects on cloud computing</p><p>The effect of cloud computing is such that for organisations, it is important to ensure that the cloud services they use are compliant and that the systems and applications they design do not expose risk.</p><p>Do you think GDPR will expand and become a global regulation in 2019?</p><p>Expanding GDPR to become a global regulation is a certainly a potential further evolution. Already Cloudera customers and organisations that would not be subject to the regulation are taking it as their starting point for their own personal data privacy and protection guidelines. For it to become a truly global regulation though, it will first need to prove its worth in its current form; once that has progressed well and has proven workable, the chances of it influencing international practice will be much higher.</p><p>What organisations subject to GDPR are already realising though is that May 2018 was not the end of the process, the complete opposite. Creating compliance is one thing, but living compliance at scale quite another. What's more, GDPR in its current form may and likely will also evolve further. Organisations that build a solid foundation now, will be able to maintain compliance with less effort as the regulation evolves.</p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Data Warehousing</emphasis></p></bodyText></listItem></list><p>Data Management goes Cloud?</p><p>As more organizations continue to see the economic and ease of use advantages of the cloud we expect to see increased investment in data management in the cloud.  Data analytics use cases continue to lead the charge, especially for self-service, transient workloads, and short-term workloads. Yet with new technologies that allow us to share data context (security models, metadata, source, and transformation definitions) we will see many organizations grow in use of cloud data management as more than just a compliment to on-premise models, as well as moving to private and hybrid cloud deployments, with greater confidence.  New data types will continue to be required to satisfy business analytics, including social media and Internet of Things (IoT), driving the need for inexpensive, flexible storage best served by data management in the cloud. The cloud will also support emerging and new use cases such as exploration (iteratively performing ad-hoc queries into data sets to gain insights through discovering patterns) and machine learning without increasing IT resource demands, fueling further adoption.</p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Machine Learning</emphasis></p></bodyText></listItem></list><p>We are just at the beginning of the enterprise machine learning transformation. In 2019, we'll see a new step in maturity, as companies advance from PoCs to production capabilities.</p><p>Enterprise machine learning (ML) adoption will continue as businesses look to automate pattern detection, prediction and decision making to drive transformational efficiency improvement, competitive differentiation and growth.  As early adopters advance from proofs-of-concept to production deployment of multiple use-cases, we'll continue to see an emergence of technologies and best practices aimed at helping operationalize, scale and ultimately industrialize these capabilities to achieve full transformational value.</p><p>Infrastructure and tooling will continue to evolve around efforts to streamline and automate the process of building and deploying ML apps at enterprise scale.   In particular, ML workload containerization and Kubernetes orchestration will provide organizations with a direct path to efficiently building, deploying and scaling ML apps in public and private clouds.  We'll see continued growth in the automated machine learning (AutoML) tools ecosystem, as vendors capitalize on opportunities to speed-up time-consuming, repeatable chunks of the ML workflow, from data prep and feature engineering to model lifecycle management.  Streamlining and scaling ML workflows from research to production will also drive new requirements for DevOps as well as corporate IT, Security and Compliance, as data science teams place increasing demands on infrastructure, continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines, cross-team collaboration capabilities, and corporate security and compliance to govern hundreds of ML models, not just one or five, deployed in production.</p><p>Beyond technology, we'll see continuing demand for expert guidance and best practice approaches to scaling organizational strategy, skills and continuous learning in order to achieve the long-term goal of embedding ML in every business product, process and service.  Visionary adopters will seek to build an investment portfolio of differentiated ML capabilities and optimize their people, skills and technology capabilities to best support it.</p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Cloud</emphasis></p></bodyText></listItem></list><p>As companies understand the value of cloud to their existing infrastructure and applications, the choice will become increasingly important. The choice to have a mix of public cloud and on-prem as well as multi-cloud provides companies with the flexibility to choose a solution that best fits their needs.  Any vendor that only offers one option and \"locks in\" a company will find their customers will be at a disadvantage. With this choice of deployment options, the need for a consistent framework that ensures security, governance, and metadata management will become even more important. This will simplify the development and deployment of applications, regardless of where data is stored and applications are run.  This framework will also ensure that companies can use a variety of machine learning and analytic capabilities, working in concert with data from different sources into a single coherent picture, without the associated complexity.</p><p>These options are part of a larger move to a hybrid cloud model, which will have workloads and data running in the private cloud and/or public cloud based on the needs of the company.  Bursting, especially with large amounts of data, is time-consuming and not an optimal use of the hybrid cloud. Instead, specific use cases such as running transient workloads in the public cloud and persistent workloads in private cloud provide a \"best of both worlds\" deployment.  The hybrid model is a challenge for the public cloud as well as a private cloud only vendors. To prepare, vendors are making acquisitions for this scenario, most recently the acquisition of Red Hat by IBM.

The digital networks that have become an integral part of our lives are increasingly becoming our greatest point of vulnerability to fraud and theft. The latest indication of that vulnerability came when the BBC  reported  that U.S. authorities busted a international gang that managed to hack the computer systems of several major retailers, stealing more than 40 million debit and credit card numbers and then selling the information. </p><p>According to the Department of Justice, the scam resulted in widespread losses for retailers, banks and consumers. Among the companies hacked were fashion retailer TJ Maxx and bookstore Barnes &amp; Noble (NYSE: BKS ).While this might just be sort of thing that causes sleepless nights for many a corporate  chief information officer , for network security software providers like Symantec (Nasdaq: SYMC ) and McAfee (NYSE: MFE ), its just further confirmation that demand for their products is growing.International Growth Protects Against Tech Spending SlumpJudging by the latest results for both companies, the increasing need for data and network security around the globe appears to have made this business nearly recession-proof. For its fiscal first quarter ending July 4, 2008, Symantecreported earnings per share of 22 cents compared with 10 cents for the same period a year earlier. Excluding special items, EPS for the latest quarter would have been 40 cents, well clear of the 35 cents analysts had forecast. International sales growth was about 19% during the quarter, which was enough of a positive impact to more than offset the slowdown in U.S. information-technology spending growth, which is expected to slow to 5% this year, down from 7% in 2007.Rival McAfee also beat expectations, producing second quarter profits of 52 cents per share compared to the 45-cent-per-share  consensus estimate  of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Corporate sales climbed 32%, while revenue from consumer products rose 18%.The company also delivered a sales forecast that topped projections.Symantec-McAfee Rivalry FierceWhile both companies appear to be exceeding Wall Street's growth expectations, competition between them remains intense in the main battleground of corporations, government agencies and institutions that spent $2.15 billion on antivirus software last year, according to information technology consultant Gartner Inc. Given that markets are now mature and saturated, aggressive price cutting to \"rip-and-replace\" a competitor's product is the order of the day.While McAfee has been gaining market share points from Symantecof late, Symantechas responded with aggressive discounts. The entry of new players to the game like Microsoft (Nasdaq: MSFT ) which started selling its own line of security software last year, and a major defection by General Electric (NYSE: GE ) from Symantecto UK-based Sophos plc, suggests that competition could get even more intense going forward, which will shrink margins for all involved. Incidentally, Sophos recently announced that it was planning to take a second shot at doing a US-based  IPO  after pulling a plug on an earlier attempt.Tax Issue UncertaintyAnother potential headwind facing not only Symantec, but other big tech names like Microsoft and Google (Nasdaq: GOOG ), is the ongoing litigation by U.S. regulators to block the widely employed practice of using transfer pricing to reduce U.S. tax liabilities by shifting intellectual property abroad. Recently Symantecwon a favorable ruling from a judge who agreed to have the public record sealed on the matter, a decision that will likely impede a better understanding of the transfer pricing issue at the heart of the government's case. However, the sizable tax losses seen by the U.S. government as a result of this practice suggest that the IRS's lawyers won't be throwing in the towel on this one anytime soon.The Bottom LineFor the moment strong international growth, and the essential nature of their products, should help companies like Symantecand McAfee avoid most of the recession-induced downside in sales experienced by other companies in the tech sector. On that basis, the recent jump in the shares of these two companies appears justified.For related reading, check out From  Beads To Binary: The History Of Computing .

Yet the outcome of Bowman vs. Monsanto, a case before the U.S. Supreme Court, could be crucial to the way software companies fight for their patents.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Justices last week heard arguments from farmer Vernon Hugh Bowman and seed-making giant Monsanto over whether Bowman had rightfully used the company's genetically modified and pesticide-resistant seeds, which are patent-protected. Bowman bought second-generation seeds from a third party selling them as feed, but instead used them to grow soybeans. Essentially, Monsanto argues that Bowman infringed its patents by using copied versions of its seeds, and a U.S. circuit court has agreed. </p><p>The impact of the justices' decision will surely extend beyond farming and into the wider biotech industry. And, depending on exactly how the court rules, it could reach into the tumultuous battleground of software patents. </p><h>Tech firms' support</h><p>Many computing giants took notice of the case and filed an amicus brief in support of Monsanto through the Software Alliance, an advocacy group. </p><p>\"Although the patent law issues in this case arise in the context of agricultural seeds, this Court's resolution of those issues could have a significant effect on other parts of the economy, particularly technology companies,\" reads the brief, cautioning that since computer software could be considered \"self-replicating\" - like seeds - the court could \"facilitate software piracy on a broad scale\" with a ruling that eliminates patent protection for Monsanto's seeds. </p><p>Adobe, Apple, AVG, Dell, IBM, Microsoft, Oracle, Rosetta Stone and Symantec were the major tech giants listed as supporters of the brief.</p><p>Michael Sacksteder, a San Francisco technology patent litigator at Fenwick &amp; West, echoed the group's concerns and said he hopes the court will end up ruling narrowly enough that the verdict is restricted to seed use. </p><p>\"People in the patent world get nervous when the Supreme Court takes a patent case,\" he says, noting that the high court rarely hears arguments on the topic. Most heavily appealed patent disputes end at the federal Circuit Court of Appeals level.</p><p>Companies across Silicon Valley are increasingly bringing one another to court over patent infringement. More than 5,600 patent-infringement lawsuits were filed in the U.S. in 2012 and more than 12 percent of them were filed by just 10 companies over software, according to Bloomberg Law data. Apple, Microsoft, Oracle, Google and Samsung are among the giants embroiled in lawsuits. </p><h>Like software?</h><p>In the Bowman vs. Monsanto case, Monsanto argues that seeds, at a very basic level, are a lot - though not exactly - like software. </p><p>Today, most software is technically licensed instead of sold, points out Edward Naughton, an intellectual property lawyer at Brown Rudnick in Boston. That allows the software makers to get around regulations that say a seller loses its right to a product's patent after it sells it to a buyer. For instance, Apple licenses iPhone software to the consumer; the consumer does not own it.</p><p>Monsanto uses a similar strategy with its seeds. Farmers license their use; technically, they don't buy them. </p><p>\"The case is part of a general trend of IP intellectual property owners trying to exert downstream control and a system where you don't really own what you buy,\" said Daniel Nazer, a staff attorney and policy analyst at the Electronic Frontier Foundation.</p><p>The dispute between Bowman and Monsanto comes as Congress is considering reforms to existing patent laws, which many consider outdated due to the changing pace of technology.</p><p>\"What makes this case weird is that farmer Bowman bought some seeds, planted them and now he's infringing someone's patents. From a layperson's standpoint, that seems weird and wrong,\" Naughton said. \"But the law just isn't on his side.\"</p><p>As elected officials have taken up the issue, big tech companies have voiced their opinions on Capitol Hill. </p><p>\"My biggest concern, and the concern of many other software companies, is that there's going to be a move to somehow reduce or diminish protection for software,\" Oracle general counsel Dorian Daley said in an interview with Bloomberg. </p><h>Patent overhaul</h><p>In June the EFF launched Defend Innovation, a campaign to overhaul the U.S. patent system. Such reforms would include shortening the term of patents on software to five years and requiring the loser of a patent litigation case to cover all legal fees, a measure designed to combat \"trolls,\" firms that buy patents to extract settlement from other companies without making any products of their own. </p><p>EFF attorney Julie Samuels said it is time to fix the problem. \"Patents are supposed to help promote new inventions and ideas, but software patents are chronically misused to limit competition, quash new tools and products, and shake down companies big and small,\" she said.</p><p>One of the critical questions in the Bowman case is whether Monsanto loses - or \"exhausts,\" in legal parlance - its right to a patent after it sells the product. Mark Walters, who argued on behalf of Bowman, said that patent protections for seeds and software are entirely different. </p><p>\"The only way to use the invention is to plant it and to grow more seeds,\" he said before the nine justices. \"So if you don't apply the exhaustion doctrine and allow someone to use it, you're choosing patent rights over personal property rights, and that's never been done in 150 years of this Court's exhaustion cases.\"</p><h>Dispute over similarity</h><p>The \"exhaustion\" question was already considered in a case involving tech: Quanta Computer Inc. et al vs. LG Electronics Inc.</p><p>In 2006, LG sued a group of computer makers after they used hardware with LG microchips. Intel had a licensing agreement with LG and sold these computer makers the chips. The computer makers did not have the right license with LG. Yet the Supreme Court unanimously agreed LG did not have the right to seek royalties for any downstream sales of its patent-protected products, since it \"exhausted\" its rights with the sale.</p><p>U.S. Assistant Solicitor General Melissa Arbus Sherry, who argued for Monsanto, tried to shed light on the question of whether software was like this case of Monsanto's seeds. </p><p>\"I can purchase software. One reasonable use would be to make a dozen other copies to give to my friends or sell on eBay,\" she argued. \"It's a reasonable use, but it's an infringing one.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SFCHRN-7G1SP6LQ</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SFCHRN2013</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:57TK-Y851-DYRG-W1SX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8172</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2016-08-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1078\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2013 San Francisco Chronicle All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The San Francisco Chronicle (California)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"4092\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>FINAL Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"02\" year=\"2013\"><dateText>February 24, 2013 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC00022B5</classCode><className>MONSANTO CO</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC000236R</classCode><className>SYMANTEC CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC000A4GH</classCode><className>FENWICK &amp;

The challenge for e-money now is 'where next?', given so much current regulation coming in is based on the broad EU area.</p><p>\"Particularly given the UK is the leading issuer of e-money licences and the largest issuer of prepaid cards, what impact will this have?</p><p><br/><br/>Craig James, CEO, Neopay:</p><p>\"e-money and payment services may also be affected, hindering the usual smooth and quick transactions. Will these businesses have to apply for new licences in order to operate? Or will they need to set up a business and gain a licence in a different EU state?</p><p>\"Given the fact that so many of these businesses are based in the UK, that will be a lot of paperwork, time and money.<br/>Currently firms expanding into the UK are gaining access to the largest single market in the world.

Brexit will endanger the currently booming payments industry. 'Ppassporting'' of EU rules, which allows payments companies authorised in the UK to conduct business across the EU, will no longer be possible [if Brexit occurs]. Payment and money transfer companies will no longer be able to provide services in the EU unless they get a separate EU license via an office abroad, effectively driving down London's appeal to Fintech companies worldwide.\"</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Simon Black, CEO, PPRO Group spoke of the \"inevitable exit of the [estimated 500] fintech companies in the UK\".</p><p>\"They will immediately begin forming plans to relocate at least some of their operations, and the majority of new jobs will be outside of the UK. The likely fintech winners would be Amsterdam, Dublin and Luxemburg; all cities that already boast a progressive regulatory environment, significant tax advantages, and international talent pools. Dublin would probably benefit most within Europe: It has a big tech scene, taxes are particularly low with a 12% corporate rate and major FinTech companies such as MasterCard, Apple, PayPal and First Data already have significant operations there providing critical mass.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WMINEW-4932702</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WMINEW2016</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5K32-VH31-JBFD-G0CX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">399660</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">1901-11-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"709\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2016 World Market Intelligence Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>WMI Company News</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"11950\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"06\" year=\"2016\"><dateText>June 24, 2016 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>News</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Europe</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Regulation</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Strategy</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Payments</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST00632417</classCode><className>FINANCIAL TECHNOLOGY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000571</classCode><className>ELECTRONIC COMMERCE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST00097CY</classCode><className>REFERENDUMS</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6M0Y2REExMDg3NTBBNDJDNDk0MzcwNDc1RTNEMUIyQTM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Q0M3QUYzNjlBN0UzNEVBMDk4OEIyMzdBMDlGQzA2RjI</classCode><className>Initiative &amp;

Policymakers around the world as well as in India are looking into making fairer rules and changing the system</p></bodyText></highlight></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Last month, a study by Virginia-headquartered industry association for newspapers, the News Media Alliance, estimated that Google may have earned approximately $4.7 billion in 2018 in search advertising revenue through links to news content.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">That number was significant. It brought into sharper focus questions on internet giants' business practices, not just in the US and Europe, but also Australia and India.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">At the heart of the tension between publishers and Big Tech \u2014 a term used to describe large technology companies such as Google, Facebook and Amazon, among others \u2014 is control over content, including news, distribution and monetisation, especially through the advertising technology (ad tech) stacks Big Tech currently owns.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Google, some publishers say, owns the entire supply (and demand) chain for ad tech and structures it in a way that disincentivises companies from working with any third-party products.</p><p>The Big Tech player disagrees. \u201cThere is a significant amount of technology disruption right now,\u201d says Kate Beddoe, Google's head of news partnerships in Asia-Pacific, in a telephonic interaction with ET. \u201cOur own products are better when there is a vibrant, healthy and thriving ecosystem, and that's why we launched our Digital News Initiative. We structure our relationship in a way that we do better when news does better. We make money and grow when news makes money and grows.\u201d</p><p>She adds, \u201cThere is a lot of complexity (in Google's advertising practices), but the fundamentals haven't changed. There is a marketplace or an exchange that happens between advertisers and audiences. Our role is really as a technology provider to facilitate that in a digital environment.\u201d Facebook did not respond to ET's questions.</p><p>These practices, publishers say, are central to Big Tech cornering a lion's share \u2014 52.1% in 2019, according to an estimate by market research company eMarketer \u2014 of the $130-billion digital advertising business in the US, and its similar dominance elsewhere.</p><p>In India, the 'duopoly' of digital advertising \u2014 Google and Facebook \u2014 has a combined market share of 68%, as per a 2018 SeekingAlpha report. Indian digital advertising business, a January 2019 report by Dentsu Aegis Network says, will reach $3.6 billion (?24,920 crore) by 2021, growing at a CAGR of 31.96%.</p><p>\u201cNever before in the world \u2014 through no company, government or group of governments \u2014 has power and control been concentrated in the hands of a single company\u2026 (No one) has control over the world as Google has,\u201d says Anant Goenka, executive director, Indian Express Group. Goenka is also in charge of the company's digital division. \u201cThey not just control the demand and supply, but also the marketplace. Today, no matter which business you are in, you have to build your business keeping Google in mind,\u201d he says.</p><p>The Economic Times competes with The Financial Express, also part of the Indian Express Group.</p><p>The end result is the sheer dominance of two companies \u2014 more Google than Facebook \u2014 in the search and advertising market, partly due to network effects that, in turn, create high entry barriers, as the European Commission noted. While announcing a \u20ac4.2-billion fine on Google in 2018 for abusing its dominant position in the search engine market, the European Commission wrote, \u201cThe more consumers use a search engine, the more attractive it becomes to advertisers. Profits generated can then be used to attract even more consumers. Similarly, data a search engine gathers about consumers can, in turn, be used to improve results.\u201d</p><p>Two questions are critical. How does this dominance work? What can be done to create a fairer market?</p><p>Understanding Google's ad tech stack is a complex exercise. There are three areas of concern on Google's control of this supply chain, according to various publishers ET spoke to as part of research for this story. They requested strict anonymity, as they are not authorised to speak to the media.</p><p>First, attribution. In order to target ads with Google (and the same applies to Facebook), an app must use their software development kits.When an advertiser measures performance, Google and Facebook analytics tools will tell them how many 'conversions' (or, instals) come from ads on Big Tech platforms.</p><p>However, in case a user clicks on more than one ad before converting, Google counts that as its own conversion alone, as per its policies.</p><p>For instance, a user sees an ad from Google to download a streaming app. He clicks on it but doesn't download it. Two weeks later, the user sees another ad, say, on a newspaper website, which says \u201cWatch IPL\u201d on this streaming app. If the user now clicks and downloads the app, Google's ad tools, used by most advertising buyers, credit the conversion to Google and not the newspaper.</p><p>\u201cGoogle and Facebook have built their attribution tools in a way that favours their own ad platforms,\u201d says a publisher aware of how Google's ad stack works. The publisher explains, \u201cAttribution is the means through which money earned from the advertiser is fairly and judiciously shared between various advertising platforms that have contributed to the sale or advertiser's goal. Unfortunately, in the ad tech ecosystem, there have been systematic efforts from Google (and Facebook) to almost disable attribution, that is, nobody else can attribute other than them.\u201d</p><p>Naveen Tewari, cofounder and chief executive, InMobi Group, says, \u201cFrom the advertisers' point of view, the industry thrives because of them. They are the ones who write the cheque, which becomes revenue for downstream industry participants. Advertisers spend their money not only on walled gardens such as Google or Facebook but also on other platforms such as InMobi.\u201d</p><p>He adds, \u201cHowever, despite fuelling the industry, advertisers don't have a complete and accurate view of the customer because of a lack of access to data. This is mainly because walled gardens are able to use their scale and control of data, to attribute the success of the platform to themselves.\u201d In a way, Tewari explains, this is similar to football, where the goalkeeper could have made the initial move in a goal-scoring effort with many players in between, but it is the striker who gets the credit. \u201cOnly when one has a view of the complete move, does one get the accurate picture,\u201d he adds.</p><p>The second area of concern is interconnectivity of Google's ad tech products. In the ad tech ecosystem, the advertising buyer and publisher are represented by publisher-side and demandside platforms. The market dynamics between them essentially dictates how open and free the market is.</p><p>However, Google, publishers say, supplies both sides of the spectrum. DoubleClick (the server that manages the process of delivering ads to websites or apps) and integrated AdX (Google's programmatic ad exchange where people bid for ads) are tools for publishers to run ads and monetise their inventory.</p><p>This fact was incidentally noted by News Corp in its submissions to Australia's competition commission in March. It wrote, \u201cSince Google's integrated ad tech services operate along the entire ad tech supply chain and on both advertiser and publisher sides of the market, it creates the potential for anti-competitive conduct. For example, there have been allegations that Google is manipulating DoubleClick to favour its own ad intermediation services.\u201d</p><p>All third parties, in essence, are dependent on Google, as the entire chain \u2014 analytics, search and ad platforms \u2014 is owned by Google.</p><p>The publisher quoted earlier in the story adds, \u201cCurrently, there exists opacity and bias in how publisher-side solutions (provided by Google) operate with Google's advertiser-side platforms. This is inherently anti-competitive, as it does not allow third-party solution providers to have the same ease of integration and efficiency with publishers who use Google's advertising ecosystem.\u201d</p><p>Equally, third-party advertising networks get secondary access to inventory on AdX. In effect, as the publisher explains, Google tells publishers to \u201cdeploy the AdX unit to get revenues and while it allows you to intermediate other networks, AdX takes the best inventory and gives secondary inventory to other companies.\u201d TIL also owns and runs Columbia, a leading ad network in Asia-Pacific.</p><p>Google, Tewari feels, has to open its stack up to create a level playing field. \u201cEvery publisher ends up having their stack and therefore, there are challenges because it is not open and also, the dominance they're doing from so many different directions is a challenge,\u201d he says, before adding, \u201cIt's not just us. The publishers face it, the advertisers face it, and platforms like us are facing it.\u201d</p><p>The fundamental issue, those from the platform side such as Tewari feel, is around data. \u201cBasically, that means they don't let the data leave them. They're not letting you become smarter as much as you should \u2014 it's like what happened on your platform is with them (Google and Facebook) and not with you. So, you are not able to utilise all of it.\u201d</p><p>PUBLISHER OR NOT?</p><p>Third, Google is also one of the largest publishers online, though it refuses to call itself one.</p><p>It has sites like Google.com, YouTube and Gmail, all of which sell banner ads. But the question is if these Google-owned sites get preferential access or \u201cself-preference\u201d to its advertising solutions over other exchanges and sell-side platforms, given the size of these sites and the market share of the advertising solutions.</p><p>The publisher quoted above says, \u201cThis preferred access to Googleowned sites gives an unfair advantage to advertising solutions as they now have much larger scales and user understanding, as these solutions track their behaviour on these large sites.\u201d</p><p>The company is even slowly controlling the demand chain for content, especially in India, where they're publishing content themselves \u2014 election results, cricket scores and stock market updates. \u201cGoogle needs to stop getting into every avenue available,\u201d says Goenka, before adding, \u201cNow having learnt user behaviour, it is becoming a publisher and competing by selling its own ads, ending up controlling who gets to see those ads. It's the last piece in their puzzle.\u201d</p><p>Google's Bedoe, however, says that first and foremost, Google is a technology company, \u201cand most importantly, a very user-centric technology company.\u201d</p><p>She adds, \u201cOur job is to make sure users get the answers to the questions they have from the most trusted and authoritative sources, as quickly as possible. There are quick, fact-based answers to some questions \u2014 like \u201cWhat is the temperature?\u201d or \u201cWhat is the score?\u201d but the news is not just quick fact-based answers but about who, what, why and how \u2014 and that is what makes one trust a news organisation over another.\u201d</p><p>In a statement, a spokesperson for TIL said, \u201cInnovation is at the heart of the digital economy and our ecosystem thrives most in an environment that encourages competition. As digital advertising becomes a critical form of marketing, there should be transparency and neutrality on the platforms that connect buyers and sellers, so the best offerings get a fair chance of succeeding.\u201d</p><p>REGULATION OF DIGITAL ADVERTISING?</p><p>Executives from the digital advertising industry say the time has come for regulation on the lines of traditional advertising, with a monitoring mechanism in place.</p><p>\u201cDigital advertising is run using old rules. India has not done much around digital ad regulation and that's not helping the industry at large,\u201d said Jessie Paul, chief executive, Paul Writer Strategic Advisory, a Bengaluru-based marketing advisory firm.</p><p>Tewari of InMobi group adds, \u201cWalled gardens thrive because they are not only able to control the data they generate but are able to do it at scale. However, this data really belongs to consumers. I firmly believe regulators need to step in and provide a framework that lets consumers own their data and be in control of who, meaning platforms, they want to share the data with.\u201d</p><p>Besides, those like Tarun Wadhwa, chief executive of strategy and advisory firm Day One Insights, feel there is also a need for Google to be more transparent. \u201cGoogle has massive tentacles across the Web. Google and Facebook store user data. They have advantages and they are years ahead,\u201d he says, before adding, \u201cHow Google ranks pages, information, connects with users and gets ads is done via an opaque algorithm. They extract power and money from their software tools.\u201d</p><p>Paul adds, \u201cThere's no transparent way to verify you are getting what you were promised. Most advertising is based on platform providers' tools and these are not shared; neither do they encourage third-party tools. There's a need for a strong mechanism to monitor advertising.\u201d</p><p>But beyond calls for the regulation of digital advertising, publishers such as The Indian Express' Goenka feel that if nothing else, Google should \u201cincrease the proportion of revenue that goes to the end publisher.\u201d Equally, he believes Google must pay for all data that the publisher is giving the Google marketplace. \u201cFor instance, I have a price comparison story on Express Drive, saying which car to buy \u2014 a Hyundai i10 or a Maruti Swift \u2014 the Google ad network serves him ads of both cars wherever he goes. That is based on user behaviour on the publisher's end. Why should they not pay us for the data generated by us?\u201d</p><p>The fact of the matter, Goenka adds, is that Google was just \u201csmarter than anyone else in investing resources in building a digital advertising ecosystem, but it also stands to lose if the publisher ecosystem diminishes.\u201d</p><p>He says, \u201cAs publishers, we create content that has engagement. With the sheer volume of content the top 5 publishers in India create \u2014 around 800 URLs a day each (4,200 new URLs/day collectively) \u2014 even if half the number is duplicated, nearly 2,000-2,500 new pieces of content are being created every day by publishers who control 50% of the market.\u201d</p><p>Realistically, publishers say they are merely seeking a \u201clevel playing field\u201d so the digital advertising ecosystem doesn't end up becoming a monopoly.</p><p>The publisher quoted earlier feels there is a need for both Google and Facebook to expose impression-level data or smart data (how many times the ad has been served and seen, who saw the ads, etc) to third-party platforms and decouple it from the Google stack, besides making it available for all players in the ad tech ecosystem. \u201cCurrently, this is clearly an unfair environment for other players to exist. Without other options, this could lead to the global advertising industry quickly becoming a single option monopoly,\u201d he says, adding that Google must also ensure all privileges it provides to its own products and platforms are equally provided to other advertising solutions.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ECOTEP-0_4_24072019004001</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ECOTEP2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WMX-HDK1-JB3N-T3RN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382887</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2456\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Bennett Coleman &amp; Co.

The push to reformif not outright eliminateSection 230 of the Communications Decency Act began last year, after Capitol Hill successfully carved out a piece of the tech industrys cherished liability shield and held platforms legally responsible for sex-trafficking content posted by their users. But the last few weeks have seen a bipartisan effort to tie Section 230s liability exemption to all types of policy problems, from the opioid crisis, to antitrust, to privacy and the perils of digitally altered videos.  On Monday a spokesperson for Sen. </p><p>Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican and one of Silicon Valleys most vehement critics, confirmed that the senator is planning to introduce a bill to reform Section 230 sometime this week. But while the details of that specific effort are scarce, its hard to ignore the groundswell of congressional interest in altering or eliminating Section 230 as a way to solve the most intractable tech-policy issues. [Section] 230 turns out to be so central to how these companies do business, and to the entire ecosystem, Hawley said. So its not surprisinga lot of what you talk about privacy, youre talking about speech, you run into 230 at almost every turn. And that says something about the centrality of it.  Sen. Brian Schatz, a Democrat on the Senate Commerce Committee, told National Journal his office was in the middle of a deep dive on Section 230 and is starting to look hard at reform. Most experts on Section 230 agree that the provision is the linchpin of the tech-industry ecosystem. But they also say Capitol Hills urge to blame the tech industrys problems on the legal exemption is both short-sighted and counterproductive.  Its actually just misdirected rage, said Eric Goldman, a professor of law and codirector of the High Tech Law Institute at Santa Clara University. Its the belief that, 'Google and Facebook are evil and theyve benefited from this law, so if we take away the law, well stick it to them.' Rage-driven policymaking rarely leads to a good result, Goldman added. If lawmakers have truly found their hammer in Section 230 reform, most tech-policy issues theyre confronted with now look like nails. And the list of issues Congress hopes to solve through a rework of Section 230 seems to grow by the day.  Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin sought last fall to hold the tech platforms accountable for hosting or facilitating the sale of opioids. Some lawmakers have raised Section 230 in the context of this years debate on data privacy, suggesting that the threat of losing their legal protections would cause tech platforms to handle user data more carefully. And for well over a year, several right-wing lawmakers have griped that Section 230 gives the platforms carte blanche to censor conservative content online. But last week saw the introduction of two new lines of attack on Section 230. On Tuesday, Democratic Rep. David Cicilline kicked off his subcommittees sprawling review of antitrust law and the digital economy with the suggestion that Section 230 reform could curb the growing market power of Google, Facebook, Amazon, and Apple. Its essentially an antitrust exemption to traditional liability, as a result of that section, for the digital platforms, Cicilline told National Journal. I think one of the things that the committee will look atare there some conditions that might be imposed to avail yourself of that exemption? Cicillines insertion of Section 230 into the ballooning debate on tech and antitrust was appreciated by Rep. Matt Gaetz, a populist Republican whos deeply critical of Silicon Valley. Until [last Tuesday], I had not seen the connectivity expressed in public hearing between Section 230 reform and enforcement of antitrust laws, Gaetz said. So I think now that gives Mr. Cicilline an eye, a hook into 230 reform as a mechanism to achieve our broader antitrust goals. Section 230 was referenced again just two days later, this time at a House Intelligence Committee hearing on the threat of deepfakes, digitally altered videos of politicians or celebrities designed to mislead viewers. Chairman Adam Schiff floated a rework of Section 230 as a potential fix to the problem. It would be very hard to legislate all of the sort of rules and propriety, what the community standard of care should be, Schiff told National Journal. I dont know whether that should be governments role. But if the companies dont adopt adequate standards on their own, then theres little case for a continued enjoyment of an immunity that was intended to facilitate the development of the industry when it was in its nascent form. Goldman views Schiffs argument on regulating deepfakes as an indicator of Capitol Hills broader mind-set on Section 230.  Its what I call the magic-wand way of regulating, he said. The government doesnt know how to solve the problem ... [but] all the internet companies have to do is wave the magic wand, and their smart engineers will nerd harder and figure it out. Jeff Kosseff, an assistant professor of cybersecurity law at the United States Naval Academy and the author of a book on Section 230, said he understands why lawmakers feel vindictive towards some of the largest tech firms. I dont want to paint too broad of a brush, but many tech companies have been so arrogant for so long, Kosseff said. And Section 230 is a very attractive option for policymakers to punish the tech companies. But if the debate begins and ends at how to best browbeat big tech into submission, Kosseff worries that the very real concerns posed by Silicon Valley may go unsolved. I know a lot of people who are legitimately frustrated about political censorship, he said. Thats a very legitimate question for them to ask. If you get rid of Section 230, I dont know that that solves that problem. Because if you get rid of Section 230, then the platforms just might not allow any points of view. We have to look at this, I think, with a bit more nuance, he said. Its tempting to say well be able to solve all this by getting rid of Section 230. But I dont think we necessarily will.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNGDLY-679588</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNGDLY2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WC9-K6G1-JBNW-34G7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8371</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1038\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The National Journal Group, Inc.

But healthcare experts say the reaction likely has less to do with Ascension sharing patient data, and more to do with the partner they chose.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"The truth of the matter is patient data gets used by the healthcare institutions that they have visited-often,\" said Michael Abrams, managing partner at consultancy Numerof &amp; Associates.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The deal is a \"giant nothingburger,\" tweeted Niall Brennan, CEO of the Health Care Cost Institute and former chief data officer at the CMS.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"This type of health information data exchange occurs thousands, tens of thousands, millions of times, all day, every day, across the healthcare system,\" Brennan said in an interview, adding that it's just like a provider sharing patient data with a vendor like IBM or Optum.</p><p>Still, the reaction to the Ascension/Google partnership should serve as a warning for providers, which are seeking tech partners for analytics and cloud computing services. \"The reaction illustrates the seething mistrust that many Americans have with big tech's track record for their personal privacy,\" Brennan said.</p><p>Google has a messy history in this regard. The tech giant in September agreed to pay a record $170 million fine to settle allegations by the Federal Trade Commission and the New York attorney general that its subsidiary, YouTube, had illegally collected data from children without their parents' consent. The company last year announced plans to shut down its social network, Google+, after discovering a bug had exposed data on hundreds of thousands of users' profiles.</p><p>\"The amount of ink that missteps by Facebook, Google and others have gotten, the investigations, and so on, have really raised the profile of this kind of event,\" Abrams said.</p><p>Google's healthcare ambitions</p><p>This isn't Google's first patient-data partnership and it's not the first time it's raised eyebrows.</p><p>Rochester, Minn.-based Mayo Clinic in September announced a 10-year deal to have Google Cloud store its clinical data. Google also has partnered with the health systems of Stanford University, the University of Chicago and the University of California at San Francisco.</p><p>This summer a former UChicago Medicine patient sued the health system over its sharing thousands of medical records with Google for a research project, claiming that the health system did not de-identify patient information. Google and UChicago Medicine have maintained that they followed regulations and UChicago Medicine filed a motion asking the court to dismiss the case.</p><p>One area of concern over Google's partnership with Ascension is that the health system is reportedly sharing names and dates of birth, alongside lab results, medications and diagnoses. That would be millions of patient records since St. Louis-based Ascension is one of the nation's largest health systems, spanning 20 states and Washington, D.C.</p><p>Ascension and Google launched their collaboration last year. Ascension is moving patient data from on-premises data centers to Google's cloud-computing system, and is working to consolidate clinical data in one location. Ascension officials said they are also in early alpha testing of a user interface that would sit on top of that data, allowing clinicians to more easily search for specific patient records and search for details within a record.</p><p>Projects like these are \"critical to our efforts to move from fee-for-service to fee-for-value,\" Joseph Impicciche, Ascension's CEO, wrote in an email to employees last week. Improving healthcare practices will \"require the integration of new care models delivered through digital platforms, applications and data,\" he wrote.</p><p>A component of the partnership that drew significant public interest when the Wall Street Journal first reported on it involved analyzing patient data in an effort to develop a system that would recommend changes to a patient's care, such as different treatment plans, diagnostic tests or additional physicians, as well as to flag unexpected deviations in care.</p><p>Ascension's Google partnership doesn't include any system to suggest care changes, an Ascension spokesperson said.</p><p>The HIPAA question</p><p>Ascension and Google have maintained that their work complies with HIPAA, as Google signed a business associate agreement with the system.</p><p>\"This is standard practice in healthcare, as patient data is frequently managed in electronic systems that nurses and doctors widely use to deliver patient care,\" Eduardo Conrado, Ascension's executive vice president of strategy and innovations, wrote in a blog post.</p><p>That's what HHS' Office for Civil Rights, the federal agency that enforces HIPAA, plans to investigate as part of its probe into the partnership, office Director Roger Severino said.</p><p>\"We are happy to cooperate with any questions about the project,\" Tariq Shaukat, Google Cloud's president of industry products and solutions, wrote in a blog post.</p><p>A federal probe doesn't suggest wrongdoing, said Lucia Savage, chief privacy and regulatory officer at digital therapeutics company Omada Health and former chief privacy officer at HHS' Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology. \"OCR has publicly said on many, many occasions that they investigate every single complaint that gets filed,\" she said.</p><p>Based on what's been reported about Ascension and Google's partnership, it appears that it wouldn't violate HIPAA, Savage added. She correlated the deal to that of an electronic health record vendor. Under HIPAA, a health system can share data with a business partner if that information is used \"only to help the covered entity carry out its healthcare functions-not for the business associate's independent use or purposes,\" according to HHS.</p><p>Trust issues</p><p>Confusion over the financial details of the deal (Ascension is not paying for Google's work developing the EHR search) may fuel questions into what Google gains, said Ray D'Onofrio, principal data architect at digital technology consultancy SPR. \"HIPAA really says you only get data-and you should only use data-for the purposes of providing care,\" D'Onofrio said. So even if Google is following the \"letter of the law\" when it comes to HIPAA, there are other questions worth asking.</p><p>\"Is this just a deal for Google to be paid to do the analytics?\" he offered, as an example. \"Is this Google looking to learn stuff and then sell that back to the health community?\"</p><p>Ascension and Google have said that patient data shared won't be combined with Google's consumer data, and, under the business associate agreement, Google can't use it for marketing.</p><p>But \"the law just sets a minimum,\" said Lois Shepherd, a professor of law and bioethics at the University of Virginia School of Medicine's Center for Health Humanities and Ethics.</p><p>Google hasn't disclosed how many employees at the company can access the patient data.</p><p>That perceived lack of control is likely what's driving patient concerns, D'Onofrio said. That doesn't necessarily point to an aversion to big tech. Apple's health records feature, which allows patients with iPhones to corral health information from their providers' portals into the Health app, wasn't hit with as many concerns about privacy.</p><p>Health systems interested in partnering with tech giants that are new to the healthcare ecosystem will have to grapple with how to ensure the companies understand, not just legally, but also \"culturally (their) obligations related to HIPAA and patient privacy,\" Brennan said.</p><p>THE TAKEAWAY</p><p>Ascension and Google maintain that they followed HIPAA before sharing any patient data, but that may not be enough to gain consumer trust.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MHC-4973950</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MHC2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XJK-MF11-DYFH-V0XN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8291</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1270\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Crain Communications All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Modern Healthcare</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"23764\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><volume>Vol. 49</volume><edition>Print Version</edition><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"11\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>November 18, 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Scientific Materials</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>LL0009VDU</classCode><className>FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The explosion of innovative products many predicted would result from this has not yet materialised, and the banks have so far avoided the challenge of losing their direct customer relationships to intermediaries. However, this may change as more fintechs develop products that demonstrate real customer benefit and consumers become more comfortable with being able to access their information and control their accounts in this way.</p><p>The retail banks do not just face an intermediation challenge. Start-ups, such as the challenger banks Monzo, Atom and Starling and payment provider Revolut, have focused on delivering an excellent customer experience and (simply) not being a traditional bank, and are winning a growing number of younger customers as a result. However, customer acquisition costs have been high for these challengers.</p><p>The next stage of their development will be to capitalise on the brands and tech platforms they have built to distribute third-party products to their customers. The ability to successfully curate products in this way will play a large part in the success or failure of some of the current crop of disruptors.</p><p>Banks and financial institutions have responded to the challenges posed by fintechs by collaborating with them. This is partly a result of their recognition of the risks that their internal cultures pose to the more entrepreneurial culture of fintechs. As a result, there has been less M&amp;A activity than might have been expected (RBS's acquisition of the accounting software provider FreeAgent is a notable exception).</p><p>Collaborations can take the form of acceleration programmes for fintechs, commercial collaborations for the development and use of technology solutions in their business, joint ventures and consortia formed with fintechs and other institutions to develop solutions to sector-wide problems. Some institutions also have dedicated venture capital (VC) funds through which they provide equity funding.</p><p>Many expect the big tech platforms to make a notable impact on the fintech landscape. The Chinese tech giant Alibaba's Ant Financial is reportedly the most valuable fintech globally. It is now entering the more regulated Western markets, and recently acquired WorldFirst, a UK payments provider. Amazon is in the process taking advantage of the opportunities provided by PSD2 to allow its customers to easily pay for goods bought through its platform by direct bank transfers, so reducing the interchange fees it is required to pay to card providers. Apple is also capitalising on its ApplePay platform by launching a credit card product.</p><p>IPO activity within the fintech sector has been limited, although exceptions in the UK last year included the peer-to-peer lender Funding Circle and Scotland's Nucleus Financial, a financial advisory platform provider. The significant VC and private equity funding currently available to later stage fintechs, combined with muted equity capital markets, mean fintechs can stay private for longer and thereby avoid the increased regulatory and administrative burden of a listing.</p><p>While London is seen as a global centre of gravity for fintechs, the Scottish Government's ambition is for Scotland to become a top 10 global centre by 2021. This ambition is to be achieved by focusing on Scotland's world-class reputation for data-driven innovation, anchored by the work of its universities and their graduates, and the benefits of a smaller but still significant financial services community that is well supported by government. The early success is encouraging - nearly 100 fintechs are now operating in Scotland, including some that have taken the decision to locate here instead of London or have chosen to focus their UK expansion in Scotland to take advantage of our talent pool.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SCBUSI-148770798</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SCBUSI2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W29-65D1-DYTY-C18G-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">340558</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"734\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 MGN Limited All Right Reserved All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Scottish Business Insider</publicationName><edition>Edition 1, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"05\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>May 7, 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>National Edition</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Banking Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QjQyMUFCOUJBNURBNEFDREE3MTNCNDk5QkQ4NUM3RjI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Automated Clearing House Fraud</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NkVFREE3NjM1MEM4NDMxMTg5QUNDNEZGODE2OTU0RkY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MkI0QzVCODMxOEMwNEQ2OTgzNkVDNEEyNTBCQjg4NUI</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>STX000569</classCode><className>ELECTRONIC BANKING</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTk5RDIyOTlFMEQzNEIxMjlBQkIyQTA4RDY2Q0QzM0U7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MDJDQjg1RTk0N0RFNEQ3MkJGRTk2OUZDMEZBN0QzOTA</classCode><className>External Audits</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST00632417</classCode><className>FINANCIAL TECHNOLOGY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000958</classCode><className>INTERNET BANKING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000916T</classCode><className>CUSTOMER RELATIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOQM</classCode><className>DIGITAL ONLY BANKS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009Y45</classCode><className>EQUITY FINANCING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000629</classCode><className>ENTREPRENEURSHIP</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX000072</classCode><className>ALLIANCES &amp;

Angkanya tak main-main, jumlahnyanya sekitar US$ 17 miliar atau setara Rp 249,9 triliun jika dikalikan kurs saat ini Rp 14.700.   Lalu apa yang membuat India begitu menarik bagi mereka?   Melansir CNN, Minggu (19/7/2020), Amazon diketahui berkomitmen investasi US$ 1 miliar pada Januari, Facebook (FB) menginvestasikan hampir US$ 6 miliar pada akhir April lalu dan Google berinvestasi paling besar pada minggu lalu yakni sebesar Rp 10 miliar.    Ketiga perusahaan teknologi itu adalah bagian dari gelombang investasi ke industri teknologi India tahun ini yang sekarang mencapai lebih dari US$ 20 miliar. Sebagian besar berasal dari Amerika Serikat.   Jika melihat angka investasi jumbo itu sepertinya tidak mungkin jika mereka investasi tanpa alasan yang pasti. Tapi yang jelas para regulator di India beberapa bulan lalu memberikan perhatian yang besar terhadap para perusahaan teknologi.   Tapi banyak yang telah berubah sejak saat itu. Pandemi virus Corona telah merobek ekonomi global dan pemukul India sangat keras.   Belum lagi gesekan diplomatik India dengan China kian memanas dan telah meluas ke teknologi, yang membuat Presiden AS Donald Trump semakin tak suka dengan perusahaan teknologi China. Sementara India selalu menjadi daya tarik besar bagi perusahaan teknologi AS.   Banjir investasi ini juga menjadi jawaban tentang potensi ekonomi digital yang besar di India. Ada lebih dari 700 juta pengguna internet di India dan sekitar setengah miliar belum online. Hal itu tentu peluang yang terlalu besar bagi Big Tech untuk diabaikan begitu lama.   \"Orang-orang memiliki keyakinan bahwa, dalam jangka panjang, India akan menjadi pasar yang baik, dalam jangka panjang, kebijakannya akan cukup adil dan transparan,\" kata Jay Gullish, yang mengepalai kebijakan teknologi di kelompok advokasi US-India Business.

More than a smidgen of politics because from the government's perspective the Conservatives want to be able to say we will be short of the sport fairly soon so why would we want to send a commissioner and they can hide behind testing and theatre is a political appointment and it would be wrong to send out a political appointee because we might lose the election and it would be up to the next government to decide what to do. </p><p>Boris Johnson is that we will never send a commissioner so politically he wants to start to that. The Cabinet guidelines say in black and white really clearly the UK role say we shouldn't do it during an election period and as I understand that other countries have made a similar decision in years gone by so what I don't get is why it took so long either for the UK to find that convenient will offer the EU to say OK. I don't really know other than both sides wanted to have a bit of a rather about it. It is actually only 11 days. I think maybe it suits both sides to continue having a bit of a spat about it. But it is interesting. It takes YouTube which is more important, the UK law that says you can't do this by UK Government legislation or the EU law? Haven't we heard that before? It is the EU law because that is what the EU treaties say. I know, I was teasing. I was taking it very literally. We have no humoured the Brussels cried. Don't you know that? A commissioner embarrassed anyway. It is not just the UK are delayed in taking their position. There has been all sorts of complications around different countries including France so I think there is an element of theatre and the commission would be able to work without the UK and the Lisbon Treaty looked at narrowing down the number of commissioners generated two thirds although I will not go into the low abide by that is not relevant. I have a quick important point to make about big fell. He is going to be the Commissioner for trade and the incoming connection. He is very outspoken, seen as a tough guy. He said something to RTA that on the one hand helped Boris Johnson and on the other didn't. He said we could definitely start free trade negotiations by St Patrick's Day and yes it could be conducted really quickly because we have so much in common already with our rules and regulations so a big tech for Boris Johnson. Less good he added because of course the UK would be signing up to EU norms and regulations because UK voters wouldn't want to reduce their right to everything, so of course that's not necessarily what Boris Johnson wants to do because remember that talk about level playing fields and so on. You cannot do a quick trade deal when the devil will be on all the details realistically. Let's do that traditional thing of looking ahead. We have lost Laura. Laura, I think we have lost you. I think I have lost myself! But I will be back next week. It is manifesto week next week, a big one. This is like the equivalent of Strictly when they say next week it is Halloween week. Blackpool, yeah. It should be good getting into the detail and underlining bets. Other things happening in the future, on Saturday will see the European Commission's negotiating team become the UK task force focused on the negotiations for the future relationship, starting on a Saturday. Later getting together to nail down what is in their manifesto. It could be interesting to hear the noise from there. That is the clause five meeting it is caused. Get yesterday's domestic politics. Anything else? We may find that that Jean-Claude Juncker will see they get write letters rather than handing over to the new connection with the new UK commissioner or not. It has already been extended. It was supposed to have started on the 1st</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBCPAR-55ac42587e3749b5a1aa11580fb33b57</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBCPAR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XH8-WK81-DY08-33P3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402041</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"684\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

We are doing an audit as to what is already available. To give you an idea, Ofcom did a report on people's attitude to digital media and found over half of internet users say they consider some of the factual information online to be true, but only some of factual information they find online to be true and we want to get to a position where we not only have the ability to be able to make sure we are able to remove harms online, but the people consuming online content have the resilience and technical know-how, literacy, to be able to question facts and not take everything as red. Considering you said effectively more needs to be done by social media companies to tackle this information, do social media companies have a problem with democratic scrutiny?</p><p> You have seen in my own committee they would not answer the most basic questions concerning this and we had Mark Zuckerberg in contempt of Parliament. Do they have a difficulty with democratic scrutiny and how does it inform your approach to regulation? Can they be trusted? I do not have enough evidence to make a decision as to whether they have an issue with democratic scrutiny... They are in contempt of Parliament, Mark Zuckerberg is in contempt of Parliament, and last week they came in front of us not being able to answer questions. If they cannot do that, how are they going to inspect and regulate? I am not here to defend big tech companies which is the last thing I want to do. It is a difficult balance between creating an environment where tech companies can grow, we are the tech capital of Europe and they are growing six times the rate of the rest of the economy, but I have responsibilities to freedom of speech and protecting vulnerable people online. I do not want to look at a family and say I wasn't doing everything I could to protect vulnerable people. And to be able to allow the sector work in as free and easy way as possible. What we need to acknowledge is this is not just work happening here. The eyes of the world are on us and the online harms work we are doing is globally leading, but that is not to say everyone else is not looking at what we are doing with a view to doing more of the same. Others have implemented changes which have been piecemeal. This work is the most comprehensive system of changes and will bring about radical reforms to the way we do this. Companies have to face up to this because it is coming down the track. Around the world, countries are looking at how we are implementing this. They need to engage with democracy and regulations that are coming. The Secretary of State eulogised about the UK being a centre of data. Is the price of that ensuring the legislative architecture of the social media companies is light touch? This is not easy. This will never be an easy balance to strike. We want to make the UK the safest place in the world to be online and we have said that on a number of occasions. However, we want the UK to be the best place in the world to start and grow a tech company. We rely on the tech industry in the economy and in 2018, it contributed #149 billion to our economy. The two are not mutually exclusive and if we can build consumer trust and transparency, that will be adding power to their elbow in terms of their ability to be able to communicate with people. People need to be able to trust them. There is no rowing back on the online harms. There is no massive delay to it either. Clearly there have been some slight impediments in the fact we have the Covid-19 crisis. Which will have eaten up some of the Parliamentary time that would have been available, but the Home Office</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBCPAR-ecfb7a31efa64216b9a3e5a8be52c882</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBCPAR2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YWM-TX11-DY08-30G1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402041</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"641\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 TVEyes, Inc.

Thank you. Baroness Williams if you want coming on that?</p><p> I just wanted to make a very brief point that there is that which is opposite the illegal and that which is CSP's terms of use. It is that the latter element, particularly in the area of extremism, that we have really tried to engage with CSP is to get them to be more proactive on. Diane Abbott. I'd like to thank both Ministers to come to the committee. I've noticed that both Ministers kept referring to freedom of speech. That is very much the mantra of the big tech companies that these four Twitter and so on. These are US -based tech companies who are very conscious of what they would describe as their first Amendment rights. What say to people that argue that a willingness by government to defer to big US tech companies has constrained its ability to move against online harms? Thank you, Diane. As I've said, this is always going to be a very finely balanced concern, the whole issue around online harms. On one hand, and this is why we have the legislation coming down the track, the online harms legislation because I think that will make things a lot clearer for companies and users and there will be a regulator. So on one hand we want the UK to be the safest place in the world, as I've said, to be online. We want to encourage tech companies. It is really important for our economy. As I said previously, before the Covid-19 crisis they were great six times faster than the rest of the economy. They're really important employers for us. At the same time, it's vital for us to protect the safety and security of our citizens who are going online. Meanwhile, you know, we do have a thriving democracy in our country, it's one of the cornerstones of our country. It's a country where pluralism and freedom of expression has always been protected. So it's not an Americanism, it's just a fact that we need to always balance those, sometimes conflicting challenges. In order to bring forward some sort of legislation which will establish a new duty of care on platforms that will improve Internet safety for everybody and that will be overseen by an independent regulator that will have the best interests of our citizens at the very heart. And we believe that this could be potentially world leading and could lead to a brand-new kind of global approach for online safety that supports our democratic values and promotes a free and open and secure Internet. Could I come back on that? Yeah. I believe in Parliamentary democracy. I've been an MP for 32 years. I wouldn't have done it for 32 years if I didn't believe the democratic process but some people would argue, and I would argue, that the difference between freedom of speech exercised in your own name, there's a difference between freedom of speech at a public meeting or even somebody coming up to you in the street or writing a letter. And freedom of speech affects anonymity. And what I've seen in 32 years in politics is there's always been abuse but anonymous, the ability to abuse people anonymously using these online platforms has increased the volume of abuse 100 fold. So do you accept it is one thing to exercise your freedom of speech publicly and in your own name, there is another thing to exercise your freedom of speech in on anonymous online platform? Absolutely, Diane, you've hit the nail on the head and I bow to your Parliamentary experience. Online abuse is, you know, totally unacceptable and far too prevalent. Ofcom data says that close to half</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBCPAR-68c397ad5fb34437b3f5039b655b03c3</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBCPAR2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YWM-TX11-DY08-30DW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402041</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"660\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 TVEyes, Inc.

And I just wondered how the codes of practice and the enforcement of the codes of practice will apply to all online services in the United Kingdom. Would you like me to come in on this? Please. </p><p>There will be scenarios where companies will be absolutely expected to report illegal content and of course I'll go back again to CSEA and terrorist content on the Internet. There will of course be other scenarios where the balance is fine, the sort of legal but harmful, that is a more difficult area. But of course there is also the terms of use, which we expect CSP is to abide by. And in terms of the regulations, presumably they will apply to all content that is visibly available in united is that correct? Yes. OK. And then in terms of the appeal, there is a provision suggested in the White Paper that providers can appeal decisions through judicial review. What happens to that online content in the meantime? Because if the regulator deems it to be harmful but clearly the provider doesn't, is that taken down until the judicial review is heard or does it remain online? I'm going to defer to Caroline. But my initial thoughts on that, Andrew, would be we don't want to promote vexatious reviews. But at the same time if something is harmful we want it removed. But Caroline come over to you. Yes, my thinking is that it would have to stay down until any kind of judicial review was concluded. The only basic comparison I have at the moment is where the social media companies for example take down content because we've asked them to of they concluded that it is against their own regulations. At the moment, the people who put that content up can appeal that decision but until that appeal or review is done, that piece of harmful content remains off-line. And is it judicial and enforceable if the content is physically located abroad? So there's quite a lot around this in the online harms they can deliver legislation that were looking at. We made it very clear that the enforcement powers that were going to be bringing in will be designed to ensure a completely level playing field between companies, whether they're based in the UK are not. Now, quite a lot of big tech companies, even though they maybe formed overseas, they have a registration of some form in the UK. But regardless of whether they do or not, we want to make sure that the enforcement powers will cover anyway. Don an enormous amount of consulting on how we do that and what form or any sort of sanction should take as well. We are very clear that the regulator will have a range of enforcement powers enabling it to take a whole suite of actions, depending on the circumstances. I'm very conscious of time now and I know that Baroness Williams has other time pressures as well. We do have a few final issues that we just wanted to cover every can just test Ministers's patients slightly. Cather Ruth Edwards and then Diana and then Tim. Ruth. I just wanted to carry on on the issue of enforcement. Will there be criminal sanctions for noncompliance with the regulator or for repeated or serious breaches of the duty of care? My view would be that it depends on the what the activities. If the activities criminal than there would be criminal sanctions. If not, and of course you get into that grey area of legal but harmful. You get into also, I mean, just honing in on the area of CSEA. Stuff that is legal but potentially illegal. So some of the child sexual abuse images on for example Facebook may</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBCPAR-5fa4915661bc4e148b229db2a53c21b8</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBCPAR2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YWN-0951-DY08-30TS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402041</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"617\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 TVEyes, Inc.

When politicians warmed up to the concept at last, the idea got the ultimate, psychological equivalent of aerodynamic boost that in turn fired up the popular imagination, way beyond that of the faithful.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It was almost heralded as an well-oiled axle of the next Industrial Revolution, carving the shifting opinions asymmetrically in favour of pros, promising us the eventual driving experience that borders on ecstasy: arriving at the destination without moving an arm, while letting us do what we normally fancy doing while driving - drinking, eating, chatting and of course, scanning our smartphones every so often.</p><p>Since the outset of 2018, however, the trend has gone quiet, as if the gentle, near-inaudible murmur of self-driving cars had been quietened by the mighty roar of Elon Musk's Falcon Heavy Rocket or the next-generation BFR - Big F****** Rocket. Neither the big car manufacturers nor the tech giants that invested heavily on the project, seem to be keen on talking about it or giving us an exact year, if not a date, to see a fleet of them on a road near us.</p><p>Have they adopted a collective New Year resolution not to talk about the phenomenon in 2018?</p><p>Big tech giants emulating their rivals is nothing new; we have seen it in a variety of products, ranging from smart watches to smart balloons that reach stratosphere for making the internet available for the entire world. The combination of the fear of being dwarfed by the rivals and the pressure from the shareholders, perhaps, leaves the hierarchy of these companies with very little choice to make - stay ahead of the rivals or choose to be irrelevant in a few years.</p><p>For the past two years, the automakers have been trying to sell an aspiration rather than a real product as far as self-driving cars are concerned. They knew very well that the cars are not ready for the congested roads, clogged up by human drivers; driving a car in a geo-fenced space is not the same as driving on a real road, despite the availability of data through a range of sensors and software to analyse the data and make snap decisions.</p><p>Dr Sebastian Thrun, the German-born academic turned Googler, who is dubbed the Father of Self-Driving cars, said in 2016 that there was still 11.3% probability of an autonomous car involved in a crash despite the rapidly-evolving, advanced technology - a frighteningly significant figure.</p><p>On statistical front, the self-driving cars use Baysian probabilities to recognize patterns and then make decisions. It is a process of making an estimate and not an exact science, despite it being popular in many different fields.</p><p>Since the possibility of an accident remains fairly high, the automakers will not be able to get into mass production up until the value comes down at least to a single digit. Adding insult to injury, the perception of self-driving cars being powered by electricity, is not going to attract people to them en-masse at present; the number of electric cars in use still is below 5%.</p><p>The probability of an accident and the public perception of autonomous cars being electric, are not the only factors that raise the anxiety levels of would-be customers.</p><p>Security and safety issues remain very high at the moment too.

What are the levels, and who decides which systems qualify? The \"levels\" are taken from a framework established by SAE International, the professional association of automotive engineers, as a shorthand to describe how far a particular system goes in automating the task of driving a vehicle. The SAE's framework has been widely adopted by regulators, engineers, and automakers -- and by investors, too. </p><p>This article originally appeared[1] in the Motley Fool. The SAE's framework describes six levels of vehicle automation, ranging from no automation at all -- an old-school car -- to fully automated, meaning a system that can drive at least as well as a skilled human in any situation. It's very important for investors looking at companies in the self-driving space to understand what is meant by the various levels, who decides what level to assign to a given system, and the differences between the levels -- particularly as they get more advanced. (I'll tell you a secret up front: Sometimes, systems described as \"self-driving\" really aren't.) It hasn't always been easy to make sense of this framework. As you'd expect from a society of automotive engineers, the SAE's own descriptions of the levels are jargony and a little hard for nonexperts to parse. But for the most part, they make sense when explained in plain English -- and that's what you'll find below. What is autonomous driving? First and foremost, an \"autonomous driving\" system is one that allows a vehicle to drive safely on public roads without human involvement. Terms like \"automated driving,\" \"driverless vehicle,\" and \"self-driving car\" are all describing the same technology: A computer \"brain\" and sensors that can drive a vehicle in place of a human, at least under some circumstances. Here are a few key things to keep in mind as we dig into the world of automated driving systems: Advanced driver-assist and driverless systems rely on several types of sensors, including cameras, radar, andlidar[2](asensor that uses invisible laser beams to precisely measure distances)to help the vehicle's computer \"brain\" understand where the vehicle is relative to its surroundings. The number of sensors used, the amount of computing power required for the \"brain,\" and the overall cost of the system all typically increase as the level of automation increases. Self-driving systems are a form ofartificial intelligence[3]. They generally incorporatemachine learning[4], meaning algorithms that can adjust themselves and improve their effectiveness as more data is acquired. Fully driverless systems acquire vast amounts of data as they travel from place to place and encounter new traffic situations. The individual vehicles' systems typically share that data with a remote data center, which updates all of the vehicles using the system with lessons learned. This process is calledfleet learning.[5] There's one more thing to know, and it's very important to keep in mind as you assess claims about particular systems: The level assigned to any given system is assignedby its manufacturer. As of right now, there isnoindependent or government agency certifying a given system as Level 3 or Level 4 or whatever. Until that changes, the levels are best thought of as a manufacturer's claim: They might be a bit optimistic, so drive carefully. If you'd like to dig deeper, you'll find a comprehensive overview of driverless-vehicle systemshere[6], with links to even more in-depth information. But those five points are enough for us to get started. Data source: SAE International. Photo: The Motley Fool Level 0: No automation The SAE's framework begins with Level 0: No automation. The human driver is responsible for 100% of what the SAE refers to as \"the dynamic driving task,\" meaning the work of actually driving the vehicle on an ongoing basis. (Keep that word \"ongoing\" in your mind as you read on -- it's a key part of how the SAE defines automation.) Level 0 isn't that hard to understand, but even here there are some nuances. Probably the most important point is this: There are plenty of modern cars with driver-assistance features that still qualify as Level 0. For instance, antilock brakes don't count as automation because the human still has to step on the brake pedal. Even systems that automate a momentary task -- like the automatic emergency braking systems found on some new cars -- don't count as automation for our purposes, because they don't automate the \"dynamic driving task\" on -- you guessed it -- anongoingbasis. The takeaway: While your grandfather's old Buick is certainly a Level 0 vehicle, so are many modern cars that are equipped with what we think of as \"driver-assist\" features. Level 1: Some assistance for the human driver The SAE defines a Level 1 system as one that provideseithersteering control or acceleration-and-braking control on anongoingbasis -- but only under limited, specific circumstances. What does that mean? Here's an example using technology that's probably familiar to you. Aside from very basic entry-level models, most cars made in recent years have a cruise-control system. You've almost certainly used one, but if you haven't, the principle is simple: Accelerate to a desired speed, activate the cruise control, and the system will hold the vehicle at that speed, even up and down hills, after you take your foot off of the accelerator pedal. That doesn't count as \"automation\" in the SAE's framework, because thedynamicpart of the driving task isn't automated: The human still has to be ready to hit the brakes (and deactivate the system) if there's slower traffic ahead. In recent years, automakers have begun offering more advanced cruise-control systems, so-called adaptive cruise control. Adaptive cruise control systems are smarter: They use radar to keep your car at a safe distance behind the vehicle ahead. If the car ahead slows, the system automatically slows your car as well in an effort to maintain a safe distance. With adaptive cruise control, one part of the dynamic driving task -- controlling acceleration and brakes --isautomated. Of course, it's only automated under specific circumstances, namely when you turn the system on while driving on the highway. But that's sufficient to lift an adaptive cruise-control system into Level 1. Level 2: Limited help with steering and braking Level 2 is \"partial automation.\" It's for driver-assistance systems that providebothsteering and acceleration-and-braking control, but again, only under limited circumstances. If the human driver has to intervene regularly -- for instance, when the car is exiting a highway -- then it's probably a Level 2 system. Importantly, it'snot\"self-driving,\" even if it kinda-sorta seems like the vehicle is driving itself. That can make understanding Level 2 a little tricky. Let's take a closer look. Level 2 can sometimes seem like self-driving, but it isn't Tesla's(NASDAQ[7]:TSLA[8])Autopilot andGeneral Motors'(NYSE[9]:GM[10])Super Cruise, both of which can accelerate, brake, and steer under many (butnotall) circumstances, can certainly deliver an experience thatseemslike \"self-driving.\" But there's a reason that GM and (usually) Tesla are very careful not to describe them as full self-driving systems in their current forms: With both, the human driver needs to be alert and ready to take over the driving task on very short notice -- more or less instantly. That's a critical distinction. If a human driver is needed on short notice, then a system shouldn't be described as \"self-driving.\" Instead, it's properly referred to as an advanced driver-assist system (ADAS). That may sound like splitting hairs, but it's a big deal because the expectations around a given system can affect how safe it is in practice.A Tesla Model S equipped with an early version of Autopilot was involved in afatal accident in May 2016when the car's system failed to recognize a tractor-trailer crossing the road -- and the human driver apparently didn't intervene to hit the brakes. ZMP Inc's RoboCar MiniVan, a self-driving taxi based on a Toyota Estima Hybrid car, operated by Hinomaru Kotsu Co, is seen at the start of its services proving test in Tokyo, Japan, Aug. 27, 2018. Photo: REUTERS/Toru Hanai That was the first known fatal accident involving anything close to a self-driving system, and it emphasized that these systems needed to do a better job of ensuring that human drivers were alert and ready to take control on short notice. That in turn led to considerable discussion within the industry: How could a system ensure that a human driver was alert without excessively annoying the human? The challenge: How to keep the driver alert, but not annoyed? Annoyance may seem like a trivial consideration when we're talking about avoiding fatal accidents. But consider this: If the system is too annoying to use, it won't get used. The current version of Tesla's Autopilot warns drivers not to take their hands off of the steering wheel while the system is in use. To enforce that, the system has sensors thataim to detect whether the driver's hands are on the wheel. If the driver's hands aren't on the wheel, the system gives a visual reminder after 30 seconds, followed by an audible warning after 45 seconds. After a minute with no intervention by the driver, the Autopilot system shuts off and can't be turned back on until the car is restarted. It's not a bad system, but reviews have suggested that it's easy to fool -- drivers can just nudge the wheel when the lights come on to reset the warning cycle, while otherwise driving hands-free. GM's Super Cruise incorporates an elegant solution GM's solution allows for hands-free driving. Instead of detecting steering-wheel motions, it uses a camera to track the driver's head position. If the system detects that the driver's eyes aren't on the road, it begins a series of prompts to try to get the driver's attention back on the road. Similar to Tesla's alerts, Super Cruise's prompts progress from a flashing light in the steering wheel's rim, to a beeping sound and seat vibrations, to a voice command -- at which point the Super Cruise system disengages. But GM goes further than Tesla: If the driver still doesn't take control at that point, the system will gradually bring the vehicle to a complete stop, activate the hazard warning flashers, and call for help (using GM's OnStar system.) GM also built a slew of additional safeguards into Super Cruise to try to ensure that it's only used in circumstances it can safely handle. For starters, if the vehicle isn't on a highway, the road's lane markings aren't clearly visible, or the system thinks that the driver isn't fully attentive -- it won't even switch on. That may sound like a recipe for constant annoyance, but it's all elegantly implemented. Most reviewers have agreed that Super Cruise is a pleasure to use. The thing to remember: \"Hands-free\" isn't necessarily self-driving To sum up, a Level 2 system is an advanced driver-assist system thatcanallow for hands-free driving under limited circumstances. But the human driver has to remain alert and ready to take over the \"dynamic driving task\" on short notice, and the leading systems attempt to ensure that the driver remains alert while the systems are in use. Level 3: A little closer to self-driving The SAE defines Level 3 as \"conditional automation.\" The difference between Level 2 and Level 3 is a matter of degree. In practice, it depends on the answer to this question: How alert does the human in the vehicle's driver's seat have to be? With a Level 2 system, the driver needs to be very alert, ready to take over the driving task right away right away if the system encounters something it can't handle. With Level 3, the expectation is that the system can handle the driving as long as it's within its \"operational design domain,\" meaning that the human's role is to be a \"fallback.\" Here's how the SAE puts it:The sustained and [operational design domain]-specific performance by an [automated driving system] of the entire [dynamic driving task] with the expectation that the [dynamic driving task] fallback-ready user is receptive to [automated driving system]-issued requests to intervene, as well as to [dynamic driving task] performance-relevant system failures in other vehicle systems, and will respond appropriately.Got that? If you're thinking that it's only a vague difference from Level 2, you're not alone. Why many automakers are steering clear of Level 3 The difficulty in defining (and explaining) a difference between Level 2 and Level 3 is the problem with Level 3 in practice. It's easy for us to understand that a Level 2 system isn't true self-driving, while (as we'll see below) Level 4isself-driving, and it's fairly easy to explain that difference to users. But Level 3 seems to exist in between. It's self-driving, except when it isn't. That presents a challenge for engineers charged with developing a system. In a presentation in 2016,Ford Motor Company's(NYSE[11]:F[12])former global product chief, Raj Nair, explained why Ford's road map for self-driving technologyskips Level 3 entirely[13]:We found we couldn't safely get through scenarios that really concerned us without adding technology like LiDAR and like high-definition 3D maps. Once you go to that point, you're really at the solution for Level 4. So we changed our direction from walking up driver assist technologies, the camera-based and radar-based technologies increasing at percentage, et cetera, to all the way leapfrogging into what does it take to get to Level 4, what does it take to get rid of the driver, what does it take to get rid of the steering wheel, the pedals, and then working on that technology problem.Put simply: Once Ford engineers had added all of the technology needed to make their prototype Level 3 system meet their safety standards, they were essentially at Level 4. Given that, they reasoned, why plan to offer Level 3 at all? But a few Level 3 systems are headed to market A lot of other automakers have reached the same conclusion about Level 3, but not all. There's another point of view, namely that Level 3 could be interpreted as a nicer implementation of the concepts behind Level 2 systems like Super Cruise. That'sAudi's view. Audi will launch a Level 3 system it calls \"Traffic Jam Pilot\" on its 2019 A8 sedan. Audi's pitch for the system effectively captures what it sees as the distinction between Level 2 and Level 3:With Traffic Jam Pilot engaged, drivers no longer need to continuously monitor the vehicle and the road. They must merely stay alert and capable of taking over the task of driving when the system prompts them to do so.But note: While Audi will offer this system in Germany, which recently passed laws making this type of system explicitly legal, Audi won't bring it to the United States -- at least, not yet -- because of concerns about liability and regulatory exposure. It's not hard to see why. Even in Audi's own words, the distinction is still vague. The idea seems to be that Audi's system will give the human a bit more time to take over than a Level 2 system would. But still: Does the human in the driver's seat need to be paying attention, or not? Fortunately, the next level doesn't require such hair-splitting to understand. Level 4: True self-driving, but with limits The SAE says that Level 4 is \"high driving automation\": The system doesn't need a human backup at all, as long as it's operating within its \"operational design domain.\" Put another way, a Level 4 system still has limits, but as long as it's within those limits, no human intervention will be needed -- it's real self-driving. Here's what that means in practice Most of the \"self-driving\" systems under development today depend on highly detailed 3-D maps to help the vehicle's \"brain\" knowexactlywhere it's located, down to a few centimeters (or less). These systems generally use several lidar unitsto \"map\" the vehicle's surroundings from moment to moment. The lidar images are then compared to a stored 3D map. Some of the systems under development use the lidar-and-maps method as a primary method of locating the vehicle, while others use it as a backup. (One of the principles of full self-driving systems, like autopilot systems in aviation, is that all critical subsystems should have backups in case something fails.) A Level 4 system is true self-driving as long as the system is operating within its limits. It doesn't matter whether the human sitting in the driver's seat is distracted, asleep, or not even present -- a Level 4 system will get the vehicle safely to its destination, as long as it's operating within its intended limits. True Level 4 vehicles are beginning to arrive Level 4 vehicles are coming soon -- in fact, they're already here. Waymo, theAlphabet(NASDAQ[14]:GOOGL[15])(NASDAQ[16]:GOOG[17])subsidiary formerly known as the Google Self-Driving Car Project, begandeploying Level 4 vehiclesin a pilot ride-hailing service in Chandler, Arizona, earlier this year.General Motors(NYSE[18]:GM[19])has said that its own self-driving subsidiary, GM Cruise, expects to deploy a fleet of \"thousands\" of Level 4 taxis in dense urban environments in the U.S.starting in 2019[20]. Others will follow over the next few years. But note that Waymo and GM aren't choosing locations at random. Waymo spent months \"training\" its prototype vehicles on the roads and traffic conditions in and around the Chandler area; GM Cruise has been doing the same with its Chevrolet Bolt-based vehicles in San Francisco. For now, those vehicles are limited to the areas with which their systems are most familiar, all of which have been very carefully mapped. Those limits are what make the systems Level 4. For instance, no matter how the maps are used, if the vehicle is dependent on a map, that means it's limited, because it can't go anywhere that isn't yet mapped. Of course, a Level 4 system could have other limits; it may not switch on if it detects heavy snow, for instance. Long story short: If a system offers full automated driving within limits, the limits are what makes it Level 4. Level 5: Full unconditional automated driving Level 5 is the dream:Unconditional(that is, no-limits) automated driving, with no expectation that a human driver will ever have to intervene. Put another way, a Level 5 system should be able to go anywhere a skilled human driver could go, under any conditions a skilled human driver could handle, entirely on its own. Needless to say, there aren't any Level 5 systems available now. A few automakers, including Tesla and BMW, have claimed that they will have Level 5 systems within a few years -- but many experts believe that true Level 5 autonomy will take years to develop, if it ever happens at all. It's possible that Level 5 systems will be the eventual result after lots of connected Level 4 vehicles are deployed and learning. Remember what I said about machine learning and fleet learning above? Systems that are deployed in thousands of vehicles operating every day will amass huge amounts of data and encounter lots of new situations -- both of which mean they'll advance quickly on their own. Between this ongoing fleet learning and the expansion of well-mapped areas, the most widely deployed systems will effectively become Level 5 -- eventually. Maybe. It's also possible that a true Level 5 system -- a single system that can safely drive in a Montana snowstorm, a Shanghai traffic jam, and anywhere else a skilled human driver might be able to go -- won't come into being for many, many years (notwithstanding the bold promises made by certain CEOs). Why full self-driving might still be years away Full self-driving is anincrediblydifficult problem to solve. Consider that even Waymo -- which began way back in 2009 as the Google Self-Driving Car Project and has some of the best and most experienced engineers in the field -- is still having trouble getting its vehicles to safely navigate some routine traffic situations in suburban Chandler, where the situations are all known and the area is carefully mapped. How do you think they'd fare in a completely unfamiliar environment -- downtown Mumbai, for instance? A capable human driver from suburban Arizona would probably be able to navigate Mumbai pretty well with a smartphone and a bit of familiarization. But at least right now in 2018, it looks like it could be many years before a self-driving system will be able to do the same -- and that means that true \"full self-driving\" won't arrive anytime soon.

What are the levels, and who decides which systems qualify?</p><p>The \"levels\" are taken from a framework established by SAE International, the professional association of automotive engineers, as a shorthand to describe how far a particular system goes in automating the task of driving a vehicle. The SAE's framework has been widely adopted by regulators, engineers, and automakers -- and by investors, too.</p><p>This article (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fool.com/investing/2018/09/06/self-driving-cars-understanding-6-autonomous-level.aspx\">https://www.fool.com/investing/2018/09/06/self-driving-cars-understanding-6-autonomous-level.aspx</url>) originally appeared in the Motley Fool.</p><p>The SAE's framework describes six levels of vehicle automation, ranging from no automation at all -- an old-school car -- to fully automated, meaning a system that can drive at least as well as a skilled human in any situation.</p><p>It's very important for investors looking at companies in the self-driving space to understand what is meant by the various levels, who decides what level to assign to a given system, and the differences between the levels -- particularly as they get more advanced. (I'll tell you a secret up front: Sometimes, systems described as \"self-driving\" really aren't.)</p><p>It hasn't always been easy to make sense of this framework. As you'd expect from a society of automotive engineers, the SAE's own descriptions of the levels are jargony and a little hard for nonexperts to parse. But for the most part, they make sense when explained in plain English -- and that's what you'll find below.</p><p>What is autonomous driving?</p><p>First and foremost, an \"autonomous driving\" system is one that allows a vehicle to drive safely on public roads without human involvement. Terms like \"automated driving,\" \"driverless vehicle,\" and \"self-driving car\" are all describing the same technology: A computer \"brain\" and sensors that can drive a vehicle in place of a human, at least under some circumstances.</p><p>Here are a few key things to keep in mind as we dig into the world of automated driving systems:</p><p>Advanced driver-assist and driverless systems rely on several types of sensors, including cameras, radar, and (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fool.com/investing/2017/10/10/3-essential-technologies-for-the-next-10-years.aspx\">https://www.fool.com/investing/2017/10/10/3-essential-technologies-for-the-next-10-years.aspx</url>) lidar  (a sensor that uses invisible laser beams to precisely measure distances) to help the vehicle's computer \"brain\" understand where the vehicle is relative to its surroundings.</p><p>The number of sensors used, the amount of computing power required for the \"brain,\" and the overall cost of the system all typically increase as the level of automation increases.</p><p>Self-driving systems are a form of (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fool.com/investing/2018/04/09/artificial-intelligence-is-driving-big-tech.aspx\">https://www.fool.com/investing/2018/04/09/artificial-intelligence-is-driving-big-tech.aspx</url>) artificial intelligence . They generally incorporate (      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fool.com/investing/2018/01/10/machine-learning-101.aspx\">https://www.fool.com/investing/2018/01/10/machine-learning-101.aspx</url>) machine learning , meaning algorithms that can adjust themselves and improve their effectiveness as more data is acquired.</p><p>Fully driverless systems acquire vast amounts of data as they travel from place to place and encounter new traffic situations. The individual vehicles' systems typically share that data with a remote data center, which updates all of the vehicles using the system with lessons learned. This process is called (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fool.com/investing/general/2015/10/15/tesla-motors-inc-flexes-fleet-learning-technology.aspx\">https://www.fool.com/investing/general/2015/10/15/tesla-motors-inc-flexes-fleet-learning-technology.aspx</url>) fleet learning.</p><p>There's one more thing to know, and it's very important to keep in mind as you assess claims about particular systems:</p><p>The level assigned to any given system is assigned by its manufacturer. As of right now, there is no independent or government agency certifying a given system as Level 3 or Level 4 or whatever. Until that changes, the levels are best thought of as a manufacturer's claim: They might be a bit optimistic, so drive carefully.</p><p>If you'd like to dig deeper, you'll find a comprehensive overview of driverless-vehicle systems (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fool.com/investing/2018/06/14/what-investors-need-to-know-about-driverless-cars.aspx\">https://www.fool.com/investing/2018/06/14/what-investors-need-to-know-about-driverless-cars.aspx</url>) here , with links to even more in-depth information. But those five points are enough for us to get started.</p><p>Level 0: No automation</p><p>The SAE's framework begins with Level 0: No automation. The human driver is responsible for 100% of what the SAE refers to as \"the dynamic driving task,\" meaning the work of actually driving the vehicle on an ongoing basis. (Keep that word \"ongoing\" in your mind as you read on -- it's a key part of how the SAE defines automation.)</p><p>Level 0 isn't that hard to understand, but even here there are some nuances. Probably the most important point is this: There are plenty of modern cars with driver-assistance features that still qualify as Level 0.</p><p>For instance, antilock brakes don't count as automation because the human still has to step on the brake pedal. Even systems that automate a momentary task -- like the automatic emergency braking systems found on some new cars -- don't count as automation for our purposes, because they don't automate the \"dynamic driving task\" on -- you guessed it -- an ongoing basis.</p><p>The takeaway: While your grandfather's old Buick is certainly a Level 0 vehicle, so are many modern cars that are equipped with what we think of as \"driver-assist\" features.</p><p>Level 1: Some assistance for the human driver</p><p>The SAE defines a Level 1 system as one that provides either steering control or acceleration-and-braking control on an ongoing basis -- but only under limited, specific circumstances.</p><p>What does that mean? Here's an example using technology that's probably familiar to you.</p><p>Aside from very basic entry-level models, most cars made in recent years have a cruise-control system. You've almost certainly used one, but if you haven't, the principle is simple: Accelerate to a desired speed, activate the cruise control, and the system will hold the vehicle at that speed, even up and down hills, after you take your foot off of the accelerator pedal.</p><p>That doesn't count as \"automation\" in the SAE's framework, because the dynamic part of the driving task isn't automated: The human still has to be ready to hit the brakes (and deactivate the system) if there's slower traffic ahead.</p><p>In recent years, automakers have begun offering more advanced cruise-control systems, so-called adaptive cruise control. Adaptive cruise control systems are smarter: They use radar to keep your car at a safe distance behind the vehicle ahead. If the car ahead slows, the system automatically slows your car as well in an effort to maintain a safe distance.</p><p>With adaptive cruise control, one part of the dynamic driving task -- controlling acceleration and brakes -- is automated. Of course, it's only automated under specific circumstances, namely when you turn the system on while driving on the highway. But that's sufficient to lift an adaptive cruise-control system into Level 1.</p><p>Level 2: Limited help with steering and braking</p><p>Level 2 is \"partial automation.\" It's for driver-assistance systems that provide both steering and acceleration-and-braking control, but again, only under limited circumstances. If the human driver has to intervene regularly -- for instance, when the car is exiting a highway -- then it's probably a Level 2 system. Importantly, it's not \"self-driving,\" even if it kinda-sorta seems like the vehicle is driving itself.</p><p>That can make understanding Level 2 a little tricky. Let's take a closer look.</p><p>Level 2 can sometimes seem like self-driving, but it isn't</p><p>Tesla's ((<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fool.com/quote/nasdaq/tesla/tsla\">https://www.fool.com/quote/nasdaq/tesla/tsla</url>) NASDAQ (      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fool.com/quote/nasdaq/tesla/tsla\">https://www.fool.com/quote/nasdaq/tesla/tsla</url>) :TSLA ) Autopilot and General Motors' ((      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fool.com/quote/nyse/general-motors/gm\">https://www.fool.com/quote/nyse/general-motors/gm</url>) NYSE (      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fool.com/quote/nyse/general-motors/gm\">https://www.fool.com/quote/nyse/general-motors/gm</url>) :GM ) Super Cruise, both of which can accelerate, brake, and steer under many (but not all) circumstances, can certainly deliver an experience that seems like \"self-driving.\" But there's a reason that GM and (usually) Tesla are very careful not to describe them as full self-driving systems in their current forms: With both, the human driver needs to be alert and ready to take over the driving task on very short notice -- more or less instantly.</p><p>That's a critical distinction. If a human driver is needed on short notice, then a system shouldn't be described as \"self-driving.\" Instead, it's properly referred to as an advanced driver-assist system (ADAS).</p><p>That may sound like splitting hairs, but it's a big deal because the expectations around a given system can affect how safe it is in practice. A Tesla Model S equipped with an early version of Autopilot was involved in a fatal accident in May 2016 when the car's system failed to recognize a tractor-trailer crossing the road -- and the human driver apparently didn't intervene to hit the brakes.</p><p>That was the first known fatal accident involving anything close to a self-driving system, and it emphasized that these systems needed to do a better job of ensuring that human drivers were alert and ready to take control on short notice.</p><p>That in turn led to considerable discussion within the industry: How could a system ensure that a human driver was alert without excessively annoying the human?</p><p>The challenge: How to keep the driver alert, but not annoyed?</p><p>Annoyance may seem like a trivial consideration when we're talking about avoiding fatal accidents. But consider this: If the system is too annoying to use, it won't get used.</p><p>The current version of Tesla's Autopilot warns drivers not to take their hands off of the steering wheel while the system is in use. To enforce that, the system has sensors that aim to detect whether the driver's hands are on the wheel.</p><p>If the driver's hands aren't on the wheel, the system gives a visual reminder after 30 seconds, followed by an audible warning after 45 seconds. After a minute with no intervention by the driver, the Autopilot system shuts off and can't be turned back on until the car is restarted.</p><p>It's not a bad system, but reviews have suggested that it's easy to fool -- drivers can just nudge the wheel when the lights come on to reset the warning cycle, while otherwise driving hands-free.</p><p>GM's Super Cruise incorporates an elegant solution</p><p>GM's solution allows for hands-free driving. Instead of detecting steering-wheel motions, it uses a camera to track the driver's head position. If the system detects that the driver's eyes aren't on the road, it begins a series of prompts to try to get the driver's attention back on the road.</p><p>Similar to Tesla's alerts, Super Cruise's prompts progress from a flashing light in the steering wheel's rim, to a beeping sound and seat vibrations, to a voice command -- at which point the Super Cruise system disengages. But GM goes further than Tesla: If the driver still doesn't take control at that point, the system will gradually bring the vehicle to a complete stop, activate the hazard warning flashers, and call for help (using GM's OnStar system.)</p><p>GM also built a slew of additional safeguards into Super Cruise to try to ensure that it's only used in circumstances it can safely handle. For starters, if the vehicle isn't on a highway, the road's lane markings aren't clearly visible, or the system thinks that the driver isn't fully attentive -- it won't even switch on. That may sound like a recipe for constant annoyance, but it's all elegantly implemented. Most reviewers have agreed that Super Cruise is a pleasure to use.</p><p>The thing to remember: \"Hands-free\" isn't necessarily self-driving</p><p>To sum up, a Level 2 system is an advanced driver-assist system that can allow for hands-free driving under limited circumstances. But the human driver has to remain alert and ready to take over the \"dynamic driving task\" on short notice, and the leading systems attempt to ensure that the driver remains alert while the systems are in use.</p><p>Level 3: A little closer to self-driving</p><p>The SAE defines Level 3 as \"conditional automation.\" The difference between Level 2 and Level 3 is a matter of degree. In practice, it depends on the answer to this question: How alert does the human in the vehicle's driver's seat have to be?</p><p>With a Level 2 system, the driver needs to be very alert, ready to take over the driving task right away right away if the system encounters something it can't handle. With Level 3, the expectation is that the system can handle the driving as long as it's within its \"operational design domain,\" meaning that the human's role is to be a \"fallback.\"</p><p>Here's how the SAE puts it:</p><p>The sustained and [operational design domain]-specific performance by an [automated driving system] of the entire [dynamic driving task] with the expectation that the [dynamic driving task] fallback-ready user is receptive to [automated driving system]-issued requests to intervene, as well as to [dynamic driving task] performance-relevant system failures in other vehicle systems, and will respond appropriately.</p><p>Got that? If you're thinking that it's only a vague difference from Level 2, you're not alone.</p><p>Why many automakers are steering clear of Level 3</p><p>The difficulty in defining (and explaining) a difference between Level 2 and Level 3 is the problem with Level 3 in practice. It's easy for us to understand that a Level 2 system isn't true self-driving, while (as we'll see below) Level 4 is self-driving, and it's fairly easy to explain that difference to users. But Level 3 seems to exist in between. It's self-driving, except when it isn't.</p><p>That presents a challenge for engineers charged with developing a system. In a presentation in 2016, Ford Motor Company's ((<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fool.com/quote/nyse/ford/f\">https://www.fool.com/quote/nyse/ford/f</url>) NYSE (      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fool.com/quote/nyse/ford/f\">https://www.fool.com/quote/nyse/ford/f</url>) :F ) former global product chief, Raj Nair, explained why Ford's road map for self-driving technology skips Level 3 (      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fool.com/investing/2016/09/27/why-ford-is-taking-the-slow-road-to-self-driving-t.aspx\">https://www.fool.com/investing/2016/09/27/why-ford-is-taking-the-slow-road-to-self-driving-t.aspx</url>) entirely :</p><p>We found we couldn't safely get through scenarios that really concerned us without adding technology like LiDAR and like high-definition 3D maps. Once you go to that point, you're really at the solution for Level 4. So we changed our direction from walking up driver assist technologies, the camera-based and radar-based technologies increasing at percentage, et cetera, to all the way leapfrogging into what does it take to get to Level 4, what does it take to get rid of the driver, what does it take to get rid of the steering wheel, the pedals, and then working on that technology problem.</p><p>Put simply: Once Ford engineers had added all of the technology needed to make their prototype Level 3 system meet their safety standards, they were essentially at Level 4. Given that, they reasoned, why plan to offer Level 3 at all?</p><p>But a few Level 3 systems are headed to market</p><p>A lot of other automakers have reached the same conclusion about Level 3, but not all. There's another point of view, namely that Level 3 could be interpreted as a nicer implementation of the concepts behind Level 2 systems like Super Cruise.</p><p>That's Audi's view. Audi will launch a Level 3 system it calls \"Traffic Jam Pilot\" on its 2019 A8 sedan. Audi's pitch for the system effectively captures what it sees as the distinction between Level 2 and Level 3:</p><p>With Traffic Jam Pilot engaged, drivers no longer need to continuously monitor the vehicle and the road. They must merely stay alert and capable of taking over the task of driving when the system prompts them to do so.</p><p>But note: While Audi will offer this system in Germany, which recently passed laws making this type of system explicitly legal, Audi won't bring it to the United States -- at least, not yet -- because of concerns about liability and regulatory exposure.</p><p>It's not hard to see why. Even in Audi's own words, the distinction is still vague. The idea seems to be that Audi's system will give the human a bit more time to take over than a Level 2 system would. But still: Does the human in the driver's seat need to be paying attention, or not?</p><p>Fortunately, the next level doesn't require such hair-splitting to understand.</p><p>Level 4: True self-driving, but with limits</p><p>The SAE says that Level 4 is \"high driving automation\": The system doesn't need a human backup at all, as long as it's operating within its \"operational design domain.\" Put another way, a Level 4 system still has limits, but as long as it's within those limits, no human intervention will be needed -- it's real self-driving.</p><p>Here's what that means in practice</p><p>Most of the \"self-driving\" systems under development today depend on highly detailed 3-D maps to help the vehicle's \"brain\" know exactly where it's located, down to a few centimeters (or less). These systems generally use several lidar units to \"map\" the vehicle's surroundings from moment to moment. The lidar images are then compared to a stored 3D map.</p><p>Some of the systems under development use the lidar-and-maps method as a primary method of locating the vehicle, while others use it as a backup. (One of the principles of full self-driving systems, like autopilot systems in aviation, is that all critical subsystems should have backups in case something fails.)</p><p>A Level 4 system is true self-driving as long as the system is operating within its limits. It doesn't matter whether the human sitting in the driver's seat is distracted, asleep, or not even present -- a Level 4 system will get the vehicle safely to its destination, as long as it's operating within its intended limits.</p><p>True Level 4 vehicles are beginning to arrive</p><p>Level 4 vehicles are coming soon -- in fact, they're already here. Waymo, the Alphabet ((<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fool.com/quote/nasdaq/alphabet-a-shares/googl\">https://www.fool.com/quote/nasdaq/alphabet-a-shares/googl</url>) NASDAQ (      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fool.com/quote/nasdaq/alphabet-a-shares/googl\">https://www.fool.com/quote/nasdaq/alphabet-a-shares/googl</url>) :GOOGL ) ((      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fool.com/quote/nasdaq/alphabet-c-shares/goog\">https://www.fool.com/quote/nasdaq/alphabet-c-shares/goog</url>) NASDAQ (      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fool.com/quote/nasdaq/alphabet-c-shares/goog\">https://www.fool.com/quote/nasdaq/alphabet-c-shares/goog</url>) :GOOG ) subsidiary formerly known as the Google Self-Driving Car Project, began deploying Level 4 vehicles in a pilot ride-hailing service in Chandler, Arizona, earlier this year. General Motors ((      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fool.com/quote/nyse/general-motors/gm\">https://www.fool.com/quote/nyse/general-motors/gm</url>) NYSE (      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fool.com/quote/nyse/general-motors/gm\">https://www.fool.com/quote/nyse/general-motors/gm</url>) :GM ) has said that its own self-driving subsidiary, GM Cruise, expects to deploy a fleet of \"thousands\" of Level 4 taxis in dense urban environments in the U.S. (      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fool.com/investing/2018/01/12/one-photo-that-proves-general-motors-is-a-self-dri.aspx\">https://www.fool.com/investing/2018/01/12/one-photo-that-proves-general-motors-is-a-self-dri.aspx</url>) starting in 2019 . Others will follow over the next few years.</p><p>But note that Waymo and GM aren't choosing locations at random. Waymo spent months \"training\" its prototype vehicles on the roads and traffic conditions in and around the Chandler area; GM Cruise has been doing the same with its Chevrolet Bolt-based vehicles in San Francisco. For now, those vehicles are limited to the areas with which their systems are most familiar, all of which have been very carefully mapped.</p><p>Those limits are what make the systems Level 4. For instance, no matter how the maps are used, if the vehicle is dependent on a map, that means it's limited, because it can't go anywhere that isn't yet mapped. Of course, a Level 4 system could have other limits; it may not switch on if it detects heavy snow, for instance.</p><p>Long story short: If a system offers full automated driving within limits, the limits are what makes it Level 4.</p><p>Level 5: Full unconditional automated driving</p><p>Level 5 is the dream: Unconditional (that is, no-limits) automated driving, with no expectation that a human driver will ever have to intervene.</p><p>Put another way, a Level 5 system should be able to go anywhere a skilled human driver could go, under any conditions a skilled human driver could handle, entirely on its own.</p><p>Needless to say, there aren't any Level 5 systems available now. A few automakers, including Tesla and BMW, have claimed that they will have Level 5 systems within a few years -- but many experts believe that true Level 5 autonomy will take years to develop, if it ever happens at all.</p><p>It's possible that Level 5 systems will be the eventual result after lots of connected Level 4 vehicles are deployed and learning. Remember what I said about machine learning and fleet learning above? Systems that are deployed in thousands of vehicles operating every day will amass huge amounts of data and encounter lots of new situations -- both of which mean they'll advance quickly on their own. Between this ongoing fleet learning and the expansion of well-mapped areas, the most widely deployed systems will effectively become Level 5 -- eventually.</p><p>Maybe.</p><p>It's also possible that a true Level 5 system -- a single system that can safely drive in a Montana snowstorm, a Shanghai traffic jam, and anywhere else a skilled human driver might be able to go -- won't come into being for many, many years (notwithstanding the bold promises made by certain CEOs).</p><p>Why full self-driving might still be years away</p><p>Full self-driving is an incredibly difficult problem to solve. Consider that even Waymo -- which began way back in 2009 as the Google Self-Driving Car Project and has some of the best and most experienced engineers in the field -- is still having trouble getting its vehicles to safely navigate some routine traffic situations in suburban Chandler, where the situations are all known and the area is carefully mapped. How do you think they'd fare in a completely unfamiliar environment -- downtown Mumbai, for instance?</p><p>A capable human driver from suburban Arizona would probably be able to navigate Mumbai pretty well with a smartphone and a bit of familiarization. But at least right now in 2018, it looks like it could be many years before a self-driving system will be able to do the same -- and that means that true \"full self-driving\" won't arrive anytime soon.</p><p>Suzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

It accuses Amazon of \"tying\" its marketplace and logistics services together, an antitrust violation in which a company uses dominance in one market to give itself an advantage in another market where it's less established. The letter refers to previous Supreme Court rulings on tying, including one against Kodak in 1992 that said the photocopier manufacturer violated antitrust laws by forcing customers who bought its machines to also use its parts and repair services.</p><p>\"When it comes to Amazon's dealings with third-party merchants, some of the conduct actually does lend itself to antitrust scrutiny,\" said Hal Singer, an antitrust expert and Georgetown University adjunct professor retained by the merchant to work on the analysis. \"If you can connect the conduct to some measurable harm, in this case increased prices, that gets you into the antitrust ballpark.\"</p><p>Amazon, in an emailed statement, disputed many of the merchant's allegations, saying its logistics prices are competitive and its sellers aren't penalized for using other delivery options. \"Amazon has invested tens of billions of dollars in developing a world-class fulfillment network and we offer that network to sellers at highly competitive fees when compared to other options available to sellers. In fact, our research shows other comparable options available to sellers are approximately 50-80% more expensive\" than Amazon services, the company said.</p><p>The accusations are potentially a significant development in various government inquiries into Amazon's business practices. The House Judiciary Committee's antitrust panel hosted a hearing in July during which Chairman David Cicilline (D-R.I.) grilled an Amazon attorney about its practices. As part of that investigation, the committee sent surveys to customers of big tech platforms, asking about the state of competition in digital markets and the adequacy of existing enforcement.</p><p>The merchant, who received that survey, says he can't pursue an antitrust case himself because he agreed to binding arbitration when he began selling products on Amazon. But he hopes the Federal Trade Commission, which is already interviewing merchants, will investigate or that a logistics company that believes it is losing business because of Amazon's practices will file suit. The merchant, who said he has paid Amazon tens of millions of dollars in fees in recent years, requested anonymity out of fear of losing business.</p><p>A spokesman for the House Judiciary's antitrust subcommittee declined to comment.</p><p>The merchant's letter says Amazon raised logistics fees by 20% over the last four years until they cost as much as 35% more than competing services. The merchant alleges Amazon pushed him to continue using its logistics or risk being suspended from selling on its platform or seeing his products marginalized on the site. He says using Amazon's service forced him to boost prices by as much as 12% on more than 100 products he's been selling on Amazon for years.</p><p>The allegations directly challenge Amazon's testimony that search algorithms determining which products are most prominently displayed are designed to best serve customers, not favor Amazon.</p><p>The merchant alleges he could offer the same products on Amazon at lower prices and with faster, more reliable delivery if he could handle logistics himself without being penalized for late deliveries. Merchants using Amazon's logistics services don't face penalties for delivery mishaps, the letter states.</p><p>More than half of all goods sold on Amazon come from independent merchants who pay Amazon a commission on each sale. Amazon controls more than 70% of all online marketplace sales in the U.S., more than triple its closest online marketplace competitor EBay Inc., according to Digital Commerce 360.</p><p>How regulators define Amazon's market is a key step in any antitrust investigation. Amazon maintains it should be considered in the broadest possible terms, a retailer that attracts about 4% of spending in the U.S. The allegations propose narrowly defining Amazon as the dominant online marketplace with few competitors, which makes its merchant customers more susceptible to its demands.</p><p>The letter alleges Amazon uses its marketplace to push its logistics services called Fulfillment by Amazon. Merchants ship their products to Amazon warehouses around the country and pay the fees for storage, packing and delivery. Amazon's online store, where U.S. shoppers will spend $221 billion this year, according to EMarketer Inc., gives it a big platform from which to build its logistics business. If Amazon can use its marketplace might to build up its logistics business, it wins an advantage over rival services offered by UPS, FedEx and smaller logistics providers.</p><p>--</p><p>Soper writes for Bloomberg.

The president has given TikTok until 15 September to sell its US operations to a US company. If TikTok doesn't complete a sales deal by this date, it will be banned in America. </p><p>'It'll close down on September 15 unless Microsoft or somebody else is able to buy it and work out a deal, an appropriate deal, so the Treasury of the United States gets a lot of money,' Trump said according to Bloomberg[1]. 'TheUnited States should get a very large percentage of that price, because we're making it possible,' he said. However, this statement has raised eyebrows for some. Axios' Dan Primack[2] has even gone so far as to say that this stance skates'very close to announcing extortion'. ByteDance, a Chinese company, currently owns TikTok. White House officials and Trump cite concerns that US citizens' data could end up with the Chinese government. At the same time, some reports view it as an economic and political retaliation to China. TikTok, along with many other Chinese apps, was banned in India[3]. While the Indian government also cited national security concerns, India and China are in the midst of a border dispute.TikTok vows transparency amid concernsWhile there are legitimate concerns about how much information TikTok gathers from users, the company denies sharing this data with governments. Privacy and data harvesting concerns don't only extend to Chinese apps, however. For example, multiple issues emerged during the rise of the US video conferencing service Zoom. Facebook has also faced scrutiny for privacy and cybersecurity breaches over the years. TikTok CEO Kevin Mayer said that the company is under greater scrutiny due to its Chinese ownership. 'The entire industry has received scrutiny, and rightly so. Yet, we have received even more scrutiny due to the company's Chinese origins,' Mayer said in a statement[4] on 29 July. 'We accept this and embrace the challenge of giving peace of mind through greater transparency and accountability. We believe it is essential to show users, advertisers, creators, and regulators that we are responsible and committed members of the American community that follows US laws.' Meanwhile, the company has also committed to making its moderation policies and algorithm public. It also encoured other tech companies to do the same. However, Mayer said that US rivals are targeting TikTok to stifle competition. He specifically named Facebook. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg testified before the US Congress last week as part of an antitrust hearing into US Big Tech[5]. Congress' subcommittee accused Facebook of anti-competitive behaviour. Mayer echoed this sentiment. 'Let's focus our energies on fair and open competition in service of our consumers, rather than maligning attacks by our competitor - namely Facebook - disguised as patriotism and designed to put an end to our very presence in the US,' he said. Mayer said that the closure of TikTok would result in American advertisers having fewer choices.Microsoft in talks to buy TikTokMicrosoft has reportedly been in talks with TikTok about an acquisition over several weeks. But Microsoft confirmed this on 2 August after the threat of a TikTok ban. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella spoke with Trump regarding the deal. This meeting resulted in Trump's move from a ban to a 'sell-or-else' scenario. 'Microsoft will move quickly to pursue discussions with TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, in a matter of weeks, and in any event completing these discussions no later than September 15, 2020,' Microsoft said in a statement. 'During this process, Microsoft looks forward to continuing dialogue with the United States Government, including with the President.'

Al Franken cast doubts on the big tech companies' ability to police their sites. At congressional hearings last week looking into how Russian-linked groups used Google, Facebook, and Twitter to spread propaganda, the big tech companies promised to do a better job of blocking such efforts. </p><p>Franken called for regulators to step in to further investigate and oversee how those sites are being used and abused. In the wake or revelations that groups linked to Russia used their sites to influence last year's election, Facebook, Google, and Twitter have tried to reassure public policymakers that they can be trusted to police their services.\u00a0 Color Sen. Al Franken dubious.\u00a0 In a speech on Wednesday, Franken\u00a0offered up a damning critique of the companies, charging them with having unchecked influence that even they don't know how to control.\u00a0 \"These companies may not be up to the challenge that they've created for themselves,\" he said.\u00a0 The business model of Facebook in particular is predicated on amassing \"massive troves of information\" about its users, Franken said. That's given the company untold power.\u00a0 \"We are not their customers, we are their product,\" he said in his speech to the\u00a0Open Markets\u00a0Institute in Washington. Instead of simply trusting the big tech companies to police how their services are being used and abused, Franken suggested that regulators need to step in.\u00a0Lawmakers should take a closer look at the influence technology plays in the everyday lives of Americans by conducting \"vigorous oversight in the form of investigations and hearings to fully understand current practices and the potential for harm,\" the Minnesota senator said. \"I'm hopeful that recent events will encourage regulators, as well as a broader contingent of my colleagues\u00a0\u2014 on both sides of the aisle\u00a0\u2014 to give this issue the attention it deserves,\" he said. Franken's speech comes little more than a week after representatives of Facebook, Google, and Twitter testified at congressional hearings[1] looking into Russia's alleged use of their sites to influence the election. At those hearings, the companies' representatives promised to do a better job of regulating themselves. This\u00a0isn't the first time Franken has expressed doubts about Silicon Valley's products.\u00a0In September, he wrote a letter to Apple CEO Tim Cook[2],\u00a0raising questions about the privacy implications of the iPhone X's new facial recognition feature as well as whether that feature might be tainted by racial bias.

She has been pushing on big tech for regulation and she joins me now. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Good morning. Thank you for being here. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SEN. AMY KLOBUCHAR (D), MINNESOTA: Thanks, Poppy. </p><p>HARLOW: Look, the Senate Judiciary Committee invited Google and other big tech CEOs to testify in April. We only saw FaceBook come forward. There was that sort of famous empty chair moment before the Senate Intel Committee where we saw Google choose not to testify. And I wonder if you were before him today asking questions of the Google CEO, what would be the first question, the most important question that you would ask him? </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: Well, first of all, thanks for the opportunity to put those questions out there. I hope my House colleagues will hear them because I think it is really important. Yes, these are great companies. But Google is one that has not supported the Honest Ads Act. And while they have done some self-reporting, they haven't even done issue ads. And this is a bill that I put forward with Senator Warner and former Senator McCain, who we miss very much. </p><p>And I would like to ask him why they would not come out and strongly support a bill that we can get done, I think eventually here in the House and Senate, that says, come on, you've got to disclose these political ads and have disclaimers. So that's number one. </p><p>The second is privacy. And the fact that they have had their own bug in their system, which Senator Cortez Masto and I sent a letter way back this fall and now it's gotten worse. I think it's an example of why you want to have notification of users when there's a breach within 72 hours.</p><p>HARLOW: Right.</p><p>KLOBUCHAR: And that's a bill I have with Senator Kennedy. </p><p>So I think while I know some of our Republican colleagues in the House want to focus on this partisan issue, which I just haven't seen proof of in terms of their search engine being biased. I think we've got to find the common ground on this, which is privacy rules that protect all Americans and then doing something about these fake political ads and ads coming in from places like Russia. </p><p>HARLOW: So I spoke to a very high ranking Google executive just this morning, minutes before our show started, who told me I think they, being lawmakers, will be pleasantly surprised at how thoughtful he is and his willingness to work with D.C., roll up his sleeves and work with them. </p><p>So when it comes to your proposed legislation of the Honest Ads Act, it's basically for transparency so that all of these social media sites, big tech, has to put out there who bought this ad, who paid for it, et cetera, in the wake of Russia's election meddling in the 2016 election. You say Google is not supportive of it at this point in time. You also tweeted in March that you were surprised to hear Mark Zuckerberg's interview and FaceBook's change position on it. It sounds like FaceBook is now supportive of it. What is the last thing you heard from Google on this front? Is there no way that they're getting behind it? </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: Oh, we just simply don't have their support yet. Twitter is also supporting the bill. </p><p>And just to make this clear, when a political ad runs on CNN, or you've got something on radio, my little radio station in Thief River Falls, Minnesota, they have got to disclose those ads, and they have to have disclaimers. $1.4 billion was spent in the last presidential race in online ads. The same kind of ads you see on TV. There's absolutely no reason we should let dark money hide behind a veil and pay for ads and then we don't know who paid for them. </p><p>HARLOW: So, senator, you tweeted just yesterday, this is part of what you tweeted, quote, we must give people power over their data. Does the United States need even more than the Honest Ads Act? Does the United States need something akin to GDPR in Europe where it forces all of these big tech companies, if you or I or any American were to ask them, show me everything you have on me, they would have to hand over that data. Do we need that much? </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: We don't have to do exactly what Europe did. But we sure need to do something. And the first thing would be, as you point out, transparency in the data that's collected. The second would be making sure you can opt out of your data being collected if you want to. And the third is to have a notice if you have a breach, just like other companies do. </p><p>We love these companies. They're uniquely American companies. But they can't be on a castle in a hill, OK? They have got to realize that they are part of a major consumer force here and consumers need to be protected. </p><p>HARLOW: You wrote a letter to Mark Zuckerberg just last month, and I'll read part of it. You said, all of what we've learned from \"The New York Times\" exclusive reporting on FaceBook, for example, quote, raises concern that the company could improperly or illegally use its vast financial and data resources against government officials and critics seeking to protect the public and our democracy. That was a letter to Mark Zuckerberg of FaceBook. </p><p>Did you hear back from him? It's a letter that you penned with other Democratic senators. </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: We have not heard back any extensive answer here from them, and Definers (ph), the company that they had hired and then had terminated. And that was, of course, this issue that we found out that they had hired this company to do oppo research. OK, people can do research. But then we found out that charts were issued that were to journalists that basically undermined elected officials before a hearing. We found out that they had gone after their critics, like George Soros, and used their own platform to spread it as far as we can see. So we're just trying to get to the bottom of this to determine if there were any campaign financial violations or any SEC violations. </p><p>This is serious stuff. Companies can do research, but they better be careful of what they're doing if they start crossing the line legally. </p><p>HARLOW: Yes. So no extensive response from Mark Zuckerberg or FaceBook on that. </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: No, we're awaiting that. </p><p>HARLOW: Just one final point on FaceBook after \"The New York Times\" investigative reporting; Part of it, as you know, included what they say was a tense conversation between you and FaceBook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg, who called you to complain about your attacks on FaceBook. </p><p>Did Sheryl Sandberg ask you to dial down your public criticism, senator, of FaceBook? </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: This was a discussion and -- where there were other staff people on the phone as well. I wouldn't have called it heated. But what I would say is that we had a vigorous discussion about this issue ad piece because at the time, and now I want to make clear, FaceBook since did support the bill and since supported, including issues ad, because at the time they weren't supporting it. They said it was hard to figure out what were issues ads. And I said, well, you know what, these are the kinds of ads that are really being used by other countries like Russia to divide America, whether it's in the civil liberty areas or energy. And, guess what, TV, radio, little newspapers, they're somehow able to figure it out because that's federal law. </p><p>So that was our discussion. We didn't change the bill. And then, sure enough, during the hearing when Mark Zuckerberg testified, he came out in support of the bill a few months later. </p><p>And so I just think we need to have this bill passed because it's not just FaceBook and Twitter and Google. It is all these major platforms. And they're all doing different things and claiming their voluntarily disclosing, which we appreciate very much, but you have to have a law, like you do for everything else, or you're going to have a repeat of the same thing in the next presidential. </p><p>HARLOW: Senator Amy Klobuchar, please keep us posted on what you do hear back from all these big, powerful tech companies on this front.</p><p>KLOBUCHAR: I will, Poppy.</p><p>HARLOW: And thank you for your time this morning. </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: Thank you. Always good to be on a Minnesotan's show. Thank you, Poppy.</p><p>HARLOW: Thank you, senator. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FEDNEW-582609</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FEDNEW2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TY4-GG61-JBSW-73P7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8104</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-12-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1378\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Federal News Service, Inc.

Last month, the House approved the revised agreement by a similarly wide margin, after months of negotiations between Democrats and the White House produced pro-labor revisions and jettisoned drug-exclusivity language sought by the pharmaceutical industry. The 12 million-member AFL-CIO was closely involved in negotiating the changes and backed the agreement, along with some other major unions.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Speaking on the Senate floor Wednesday, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) called passage of the deal \"a major win for Kentucky and all 50 states, a major win for our country, a major win for the Trump administration.\"</p><p>Passage of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement hands Trump a key victory at a moment of political peril, with the Senate poised to begin his impeachment trial after the House delivered its articles of impeachment Wednesday evening. Trump made his opposition to the 25-year-old North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA, a centerpiece of his campaign for president in 2016. He can now boast of delivering a new trade deal that includes major new protections for American workers, even though many of those were negotiated by House Democrats over the objection of Senate Republicans.</p><p>Trump must still sign the revised North American trade deal, something he suggested he will probably do next week.</p><p>Senate Republicans had little influence in the process, because Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) held a make-or-break role in deciding whether to bring the deal up on the floor of the House, which by law had to act first on the agreement. The role played by House Democrats and their allies in labor angered some Republicans, including Sen. Patrick J. Toomey (R-Pa.), the deal's most outspoken opponent, who complained that the Senate got \"rolled\" in the process.</p><p>But supporters including Senate Finance Committee Chairman Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa) said they had no choice but to support the deal that was before them. They called it good news for the U.S. economy and workers, pointing to initial projections from the International Trade Commission that it will add 176,000 U.S. jobs - although that amounts to increasing employment by just 0.12 percent, a modest impact on the nearly $21 trillion U.S. economy.</p><p>One provision, allowing Mexican workers to lodge complaints about working conditions that could result in punitive action by the United States, was included at the insistence of Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), a leading trade protectionist who announced his support for the USMCA after opposing all previous free-trade agreements.</p><p>The deal created divisions in the Democratic presidential primary field. In a debate Tuesday night, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) predicted that the agreement would lead to the continued outsourcing of U.S. jobs. \"We could do much better than a Trump-led trade deal,\" he said. But other leading candidates, including former vice president Joe Biden and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), support the deal. Warren called it a \"modest improvement\" that will deliver needed relief to farmers and workers hurt by Trump's trade policies.</p><p>Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) voted against the USMCA, saying that while the deal does include labor provisions, \"it does not address climate change, the greatest threat facing the planet.\" In a statement, Schumer said that the Trump administration is giving incentives for manufacturers to move businesses and jobs from the United States to Mexico, which has weaker regulations for clean air and water.</p><p>\"The Trump administration also included handouts for the oil and gas industry, such as lifting tariffs on tar sands, and refused to include any mention of the climate crisis in the agreement,\" Schumer said.</p><p>Thursday's vote came a day after Trump signed a partial economic deal with China, nearly two years into a protracted trade war with Beijing. As part of the deal, China committed to purchasing an additional $200 billion in American exports above previous levels. With the USMCA vote, Trump has back-to-back victories on trade that may calm the waters after the president has ramped up trade tensions around the world and leveled tariffs on friends and foes.</p><p>The USMCA was signed more than a year ago by Trump and the leaders of Mexico and Canada but had to be approved by the legislatures in all three nations. Mexico has already acted, and Canada's Parliament is expected to follow the United States and approve the deal in the next several months. After some additional procedural steps, the deal is expected to take effect later this year.</p><p>House Democrats called for substantial changes to the initial draft of the USMCA and worked directly with U.S. Trade Representative Robert E. Lighthizer in months of secretive talks that stayed largely on track even as the House moved forward to impeach the president.</p><p>House Democrats pointed to wins on stronger environmental and enforcement language, the protections for workers in Mexico and the killing of the provision sought by pharmaceutical companies that would have guaranteed 10 years of market exclusivity for a costly class of drugs called biologics. Many labor unions were also encouraged by the deal, which could help keep American and Canadian jobs from going to lower-paying markets in Mexico or Asia. Under the deal, at least 30 percent of cars (and 40 percent by 2023) must be made by workers earning $16 an hour, which is about three times the manufacturing wage in Mexico.</p><p>The USMCA also gives American dairy farmers more access to the Canadian market, especially for \"Class 7\" milk products such as milk powder and milk proteins. The deal puts some restrictions on how much dairy Canada can export, which could help American dairy farmers edge into foreign markets.</p><p>The USMCA also includes new rules for digital trade, something that barely existed when NAFTA was written. Among these, however, is a provision that provides protections to big tech companies by giving legal immunity to Internet platforms over content posted by users. Pelosi opposed the provision but was unsuccessful in keeping it out of the deal in the final stages of talks last month. She cited it as her one disappointment in how the deal turned out.</p><p>Economists also worry that the USMCA will spur a spike in car prices, especially on smaller cars that used to be produced in Mexico but may be subject to duties at the border. U.S. tariffs on Canadian steel are also still in place.</p><p>And while tensions have now cooled between Washington and Beijing after nearly two years of trade escalation, there are few details about what the second phase of a U.S.-China trade agreement will look like - even as many American sectors and businesses say they are still pinned under tariffs that remain in place.          </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPBLOG-02d3279b7a3c43c089366005be90a34b</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPBLOG2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y0J-2SM1-JB4M-V3DW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1178\"/><timeReceived>5:00 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washington Post Blogs <br/></publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5072\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 16, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>International Trade Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTRDNDkyQ0UwRkRGNEQ0MjgwNzM2NzI3NjlGODE0ODk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>Federal Legislation</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RjUxRjAxOUQxNDM3NDQ0MEI2QzA4MzUwMjNENjgwNzI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTJGMUQ1NkM5MjFFNDZCQjg5NjNFM0U1NkUwM0I1REU</classCode></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Labor Provisions</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjM2REZGRTc4MTg3NDM2REFBOTk5ODRFNUM2MTE5QjA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RkMzNkQyQzU0NEIxNDQ2MUE1MTlEQTA4MjFEQ0UyQzA</classCode></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><className>Trade Agreements</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RkMzNkQyQzU0NEIxNDQ2MUE1MTlEQTA4MjFEQ0UyQzA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTRDNDkyQ0UwRkRGNEQ0MjgwNzM2NzI3NjlGODE0ODk</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Transportation Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTYzRTk5RDVBQkQ2NDcwQzk2NTU3ODQ5OEE3NDlBNzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>GATT &amp;

Bair, ex-chair of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., at a hearing entitled \"Facilitating Faster Payments in the U.S.\":</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Thank you for the opportunity to testify today to present my personal views on the need to facilitate faster payments in the U.S. I applaud the Federal Reserve Board's recently announced plans to build \"FedNow\" --an interbank settlement system to support real time payments. This initiative by the Fed will provide the foundation upon which to build the next generation of instantaneous payment services, in partnership with the private sector. At the same time, the Fed's operational involvement will ensure that the payments system of the future is resilient, safe, and broadly accessible on fair and equitable terms.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Payments are the lifeblood of an economy. Any major disruption in the ability of households and businesses to transfer funds in payment of goods and services would have catastrophic results. As such, our payments system is an essential public utility and like other public utilities, cannot be left solely in the hands of private enterprise. This is why the Federal Reserve has long played a core role in payment services, typically operating alongside and in support of private sector systems.</p><p>\"The current payments system is fraught with frictions and inefficiencies. When we send money, the withdrawals from our bank accounts are usually immediate. However, it can take days for the money to go from our banks to recipients' banks where the funds can be accessed. The wait creates costs and hardships, particularly for households and small businesses on tight budgets- for the house keeper waiting for her clients' check to clear before she can pay her rent, or the small business waiting for a customer's check to clear before it can pay its workers. These delays in payments can lead to a cascade of negative consequences, including forcing households and businesses to rely on expensive forms of credit to tide them over, such as overdraft protection or payday loans.</p><p>\"A handful of financial technology startups have tried to provide real time payment services, but they are limited networks, typically working only if both the sender and recipient are subscribers and/or have accounts at participating banks. Moreover, they still rely on legacy systems to settle funds between banks. This results in a buildup of obligations between sending and receiving banks, as the actual transfer of payments between banks can take several days. If allowed to grow, this complex of IOUs among banks is a potential source of fragility in our payments infrastructure that could present significant risks in times of stress.</p><p>\"In 2017, a group of large banks under the auspices of The Clearing House or TCH launched a real time payments platform called the RTP Network. This network aspires to achieve the ubiquity lacking with fintech initiatives. It requires participating banks to pre-fund a joint account that stands behind payment transfers. Debits and credits are tracked in a centralized ledger maintained by TCH. As yet, RTP has failed to gain significant traction, with relatively low volumes and few banks participating beyond mostly the big ones which own TCH. Importantly, its safety and resilience is heavily reliant on the larges banks which built and back it.</p><p>\"What's needed- but what the private sector has yet to deliver-- is a trusted and universally available infrastructure that would allow banks and credit unions of all sizes to send and receive money in \"real time\". After years of study and public outreach, the Fed has now decided to develop and launch such a system: FedNow. The Fed is already connected to virtually every depository institution in the country and thus is well-positioned to provide the basic infrastructure to move money quickly between banks.</p><p>\"Not surprisingly , the Fed's decision has been widely applauded by smaller institutions and fintechs, but roundly criticized by TCH and its advocates, who argue that FedNow will unnecessarily compete with the RTP Network and stifle innovation.</p><p>\"History has shown the folly of exclusively relying on big Wall Street banks for financial infrastructure. Indeed, one political catalyst for Congress creating the Federal Reserve System in 1913 was the inability of midwestern farmers to access funds during planting season. The large New York institutions rural banks then relied upon to keep their reserve deposits had a bad habit of lending those funds to securities speculators, instead of keeping them safe and readily accessible. Currently, nearly all major payments systems -including those for processing checks, facilitating direct deposits, and wire transfers -- depend on both private and Fed systems.</p><p>\"Smaller depository institutions and fintechs are understandably wary of a system controlled by big bank competitors. For now the TCH has promised its system will be accessible to all on fair and equitable terms, but will those promises hold in the future if they achieve market dominance? Until recently, the TCH website acknowledged its pricing could change if it has to \"react competitively\". The Federal Reserve lacks regulatory authority to require TCH to make its system accessible to everyone or regulate its fees to prevent anti-competitive pricing.</p><p>\"FedNow will promote competition, not stifle it, by protecting against potential anti-competitive behavior by TCH or any other dominant private actor of the future. The Fed wants private sector innovation. Indeed, it worked closely with TCH to set up the joint account which underpins the RTP Network. And it is exploring making its current wire and net settlement services available on a 24x7x365 basis to support private initiatives to provide faster payments around the clock. But the Fed wants multiple players in this space, competing on fair terms. With FedNow, it will give all depository institutions and their fintech partners a ubiquitous infrastructure upon which they can build their own platforms and services.</p><p>\"Some critics have scoffed at the notion that \"government bureaucrats\" at the Fed could come up with an innovative new system, and point to the fact that FedNow is not expected to launch until 2023 or 2024. Given the Fed's long history in payments, the expertise of the Fed's staff is unparalleled, while private sector innovation in this space has been sluggish. Work on the TCH system started in 2014. It did not go live until 3 years later, and TCH acknowledges that it will not be easily available to all depository institutions until the end of 2020. The widely used ACH system, which facilitates direct deposits, took 6 years to develop during the late 1960's and early 1970's, and even longer after it was developed to mature in its current widely used form. Four to five years does not seem like an inordinate amount of time to build FedNow, particularly given the Fed's commitment to work with all industry stakeholders and fully explore use of new technologies to construct the system.</p><p>\"Perhaps most importantly, FedNow will promote financial system resiliency. As we discovered in 2008, big banks can fail. The Fed cannot. The TCH has tried to construct a system that comes close to replicating central bank settlement, but it is not the Federal Reserve. We hope that post-crisis reforms will prevent the failure of large, systemic institutions in the future, but we cannot be sure. Only the Fed has the institutional capability and proven track record to operate under the most highly stressed conditions.</p><p>\"Without a backup system, a failure to fund RTP's joint account by a major bank could impact continuity in payment services for millions of Americans.</p><p>\"This could leave taxpayers with a conundrum similar to the one they faced in 2008: bail the banks out or expose households and businesses to disruptions in essential payment services. If the big banks were truly interested in the resiliency of the financial system--and rebuilding trust with the public-- they would be applauding FedNow as a parallel system that could serve as a backup to their own. FedNow would also serve as an important backstop to potential operational breakdowns in the RTP system, including compromise of its centralized ledger.</p><p>\"Finally, while I strongly support the Fed's decision to build \"FedNow\" let me also express the hope that the Fed fully explores the use of digital currency, including a cryptocurrency based on distributed ledger technology (DLT), in effectuating real-time settlement between banks. As I have written in the past, the Fed should consider development of a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) that could eventually be used by members of the public to transfer money directly between each other without the need for bank intermediation and its attendant costly fees. If based on DLT, such a system promises to be more secure, efficient and less costly than intermediated systems that rely on centralized ledgers and master accounts. Given the permanence and immutability of DLT, it could also provide important law enforcement benefits. In moving toward such a system, using DLT to support settlement between banks might be a good place to start.</p><p>\"Importantly, major private sector proposals, such as Facebook's recent proposal to create a new global cryptocurrency called \"Libra\" rely on DLT. Libra faces many roadblocks. However, even if the Facebook initiative fails, it certainly won't be the last private sector attempt to leverage DLT to dominate global payments. If the Fed does not stay ahead of this rapidly maturing technology, I fear private sector efforts to eclipse fiat monetary systems will get ahead of them, with potential disruptions to our banking system and in a worst case scenario, loss of control of our own currency.</p><p>\"Since leaving the FDIC, I have become involved as a board member or advisor to a number of financial technology startups developing use cases for DLT ranging from securities to mortgages to gold to a stable coin tied to the dollar.</p><p>\"While the promise of such technology is great, I am convinced that when it comes to payments, the Federal Reserve is in the best position to utilize it in a way that maximizes the public good.</p><p>\"Whether the threat comes from big banks or big tech, private interests should not dominate payments services so crucial to the financial well-being of the public. They should have the right to compete, but not monopolize, how we move our money. Only the Fed has the resources, expertise, and public mandate to build a payments system infrastructure that can capture the benefits of private innovation while ensuring a competitive playing field and most importantly, a stable system that will serve the public during good times and bad.</p><p>\"For the Committee's information, I have attached some of my previous writings on Facebook's Libra and the need for a CBDC.</p><p>\"I would be happy to answer the Committee's questions.\"</p><p>View attachment at <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.banking.senate.gov/download/bair-testimony-9-25-19\">https://www.banking.senate.gov/download/bair-testimony-9-25-19</url></p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-6869346 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR6869346</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X4M-1VT1-JC11-13J5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1855\"/><timeReceived>8:21 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 26, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Since leaving the FDIC, I have become involved as a board member or advisor to a number of financial technology startups developing use cases for DLT ranging from securities to mortgages to gold to a stable coin tied to the dollar.While the promise of such technology is great, I am convinced that when it comes to payments, the Federal Reserve is in the best position to utilize it in a way that maximizes the public good.</p><p>Whether the threat comes from big banks or big tech, private interests should not dominate payments services so crucial to the financial well-being of thepublic. They should have the right to compete, but not monopolize, how we move our money. Only the Fed has the resources, expertise, and public mandate to build a payments system infrastructure that can capture the benefits of private innovation while ensuring a competitive playing field andmost importantly, a stable system that will serve the public during good times and bad.</p><p>For the Committee's information, I have attached some of my previous writings on Facebook's Libra and the need for a CBDC.</p><p>I would be happy to answer the Committee's questions.</p><p>Read this original document at: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.banking.senate.gov/download/bair-testimony-9-25-19anddownload=1\">https://www.banking.senate.gov/download/bair-testimony-9-25-19anddownload=1</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GOVPUB-COSSC925918K592599</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CO2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XSY-V3W1-DYVR-P130-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">468349</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1819\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Federal Information and News Dispatch, Inc.</copyright><publicationName>Congressional Documents and Publications</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 25, 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Report</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Statistics</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC0001V1J</classCode><className>FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>NAICS524128 OTHER DIRECT INSURANCE (EXCEPT LIFE, HEALTH &amp;

The committee today will have will -- the committee hearing today is entitled An Overview of the Credit Bureaus and the Fair Credit Reporting Act. Credit bureaus play a valuable role in our financial system by helping financial institutions assess a consumer's ability to meet financial obligations and also facilitating access to beneficial financial products and services. </p><p>      Given this role, they have a lot of valuable personal information on consumers and therefore are targets of cyberattacks. Last year, Equifax experienced an unprecedented cybersecurity incident which compromised the personal data of over 145 million people. Following that event, the banking committee held two oversight hearings on the breach and consumer data protection at credit bureaus. The first hearing with the former Equifax CEO examine details surrounding the breach, while the second hearing with outside experts examined what improvements might be made surrounding credit reporting agencies and data security. </p><p>      This committee also recently held a hearing on cybersecurity and risks to the financial services industry. These hearings demonstrated bipartisan concern about the Equifax data breach and the protection of consumers personally identifiable information, as well as support for specific legislative measures to address such concerns. Some of these were addressed in Senate Bill 2155, the Economic Growth Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act, which included meaningful consumer protections for consumers who become victims of fraud. </p><p>      For example, it provides consumers unlimited free credit freezes and unfreezes per year. It allows parents to turn on and off credit reporting for children under 18 and provides important protections for veterans and seniors. Last month, a New York Times article commenting on the bill noted that one helpful change will allow consumers to freeze their credit files at the three major credit reporting bureaus without charge. Consumers can also thaw their files temporarily or permanently without a fee. </p><p>      Susan Grant, director of Consumer Protection and Privacy at the Consumer Federation of America expressed support for these measures calling them a good thing. </p><p>      Paul Stevens, director of policy and advocacy of the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse similarly noted that the freeze provision has the potential to save consumers a lot of money. But there is still an opportunity to see whether more should be done and today's hearing will help inform this committee in that regard. </p><p>      Today, I look forward to hearing about -- more from the witnesses about the scope of the Fair Credit Reporting Act and other relevant laws and regulations as they pertain to credit bureaus, the extent to which the Bureau of consumer financial protection and the FTC, whom the two witnesses represent today oversee credit Bureau data security and accuracy. </p><p>      The current state of data security, data accuracy, data breach policy and the dispute resolution processes at the credit bureaus and what if any improvements could be made. States have begun to react in their own ways to various aspects of the public debate on privacy, data security, and the Equifax data breach. </p><p>      Two weeks ago, California enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act which will take effect on January 20 -- January 1, 2020. The act which applies to certain organizations conducting business in California establishes a new privacy framework by creating new data privacy rights imposing special rules for the collection of minors consumer data and creating damages frameworks for violations and businesses failing to implement reasonable security procedures. Many members are interested in learning more about what California and other states are doing on this front. </p><p>      Additionally, two weeks ago, eight state banking Commissioners jointly took action against Equifax in a consent order requiring the company to take various actions regarding risk assessment and information security. </p><p>      I've long been concerned about data collection and data privacy protections by the government and the private sector. Given Americans' increased reliance on the use of technology where information can be shared by the swipe of a finger, we should be careful to ensure that companies and government entities who have such information use it responsibly and keep it safe. Senator Brown? </p><p>      BROWN:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thanks very much to our witnesses. Thanks for holding this hearing today, I hope that my colleagues would excuse me and particularly welcome Ms. Twohig to our committee. She is from the consumer protection bureau, grew up in Fairview Park, a Westside suburb of Cleveland, she graduated from Ohio State, she worked for the Cleveland Foundation, the preeminent community foundation in the United States of America. She has a long career as a public servant with FTC, the Treasury Department, and was an early employee of this terrific agency, the Consumer Protection -- Financial Protection Bureau. </p><p>      So thank you both to leave you out -- but thank you both for joining us. The consumer credit reporting system is stacked against Americans, a bad credit report can keep you on the job and can put you on a list you'll be targeted with expensive credit cards or high-cost loans, you are almost powerless to do anything about it. </p><p>      Americans have basically no control over these reports, it can dictate their lives and their families plans for the future, they often don't know whether they're accurate or whether they're inaccurate. Six years ago I chaired a subcommittee hearing where consumer activists and some consumer advocates in the CFPB identified problems in the credit reporting industry, we've had several hearings in this committee over the last year on credit reporting companies and on data privacy. </p><p>      In the meantime breach after breach has occurred. Last year as we know, 148 million Americans had their sensitive data stolen as hackers exploited a known security flaw that Equifax did not fix. Millions more been affected by breaches at banks like J.P. Morgan Chase, stores like Target, Whole Foods, even Trump Hotels. </p><p>      Congressional efforts including provisions included in S2155 haven't done anything meaningful to address accuracy of credit reports to fix privacy concerns or to give consumers controls over their own personal data. </p><p>      At the same time, big tech companies continually add more and more of our personal information to their digital warehouses, their financial and personal details about hundreds of millions of Americans, they see the potential for a big payday and selling that data to credit reporting companies. </p><p>      These companies are amassing more and more of our data, but they still seem totally unprepared to deal with cyberattacks, they are building virtual -- shall we say silver platters for hackers. People want and deserve a lot more control over their personal information, credit reporting presents a unique problem because often Americans don't even know these corporations collect their data in the first place. </p><p>      Right now consumers can't vote as my money and my colleagues like to say can't simply vote with their feet when a company doesn't treat them well, when a credit Bureau fails to protect their privacy, Congress passed the Fair Credit Reporting Act in the first place to rein in credit bureaus that originally function as unsupervised by agencies collecting personal information that we would be appalled to see in someone's credit report today. After scandals at Facebook, people are rightfully worried about big companies once again compiling and selling files a personal data on every American without her knowledge out of our control or our consent. </p><p>      More Americans would be surprised at how lenders are putting this data to use. Last week the Washington Post ran a story about a company called Mariner Finance that uses a loop on the SCRA to look at people's credit records without their permission and then targets them with scams. Mariner sends checks for thousands of dollars to struggling families that can be cashed the day they are plucked from the mail but the checks are really just expensive loans waiting to trap the consumer who cashes them. </p><p>      Now Mariner will tell you they are increasing access to credit, their terms, but that's exactly what we're told about subprime loans, some will say including a potentially, your boss at the CFPB, that the market will take care of that. Well, the market clearly hasn't. The fact is that Mariner is weaponizing people's credit history to target them with an expensive loan and making huge profits for the hedge fund that owns it. </p><p>      Your credit report can be used to force you into court rightly or wrongly to settle debts but what if your credit card company or your cable provider erroneously reports a missed payment or default of the account? </p><p>      They are protected, you can't take them to court at all and that's just absolutely outrageous. It turns out that's a big problem, CFPB paper found last year that credit reporting companies haven't been doing enough to ensure the information they get is accurate. They are protected and consumers aren't in part because of behavior of this United States Senate and because of a court Supreme Court that moves more and more to protect corporate interest. </p><p>      What incentive do these companies have? The people they hurt won't be able to have their day in court. We have heard all of this before, the credit reporting system is backward like so much of our economy, it works for big corporations, it works for people with privilege, it doesn't work for regular Americans. </p><p>      The Fair Credit Reporting Act is 50 years old the amount and type of information collected, they would've been unthinkable when it was created, it's time for a serious overhaul that puts Americans in control of their own data. I've introduced bills and saw many of my colleagues that would do just that. I hope the committee will not only listen to the advice we get today but will also take action to give people control over what should be their personal information. </p><p>      CRAPO:  Thank you, Senator Brown. </p><p>      And we will now move our witnesses and their testimony. First we will hear from Ms. Peggy Twohig who currently serves as the assistant director for supervision policy and the division of supervision enforcement and fair lending at the Bureau of Consumer financial protection. The office of supervision is responsible for developing strategy across bank and non-bank markets and ensuring that policy decisions are consistent across markets, charters, and regions. </p><p>      After that we will hear from Ms. Maneesha Mithal, did I pronounce that right? </p><p>      MITHAL:  Mithal. </p><p>      CRAPO:  Mithal. All right. Ms. Maneesha Mithal who serves as the associate director for the division of privacy and identity protection in the Bureau of consumer protection at the Federal Trade Commission. In this capacity she supervises the work in the area of data security, identity theft, credit reporting and behavioral advertising and general privacy. </p><p>      We appreciate both of you joining us today and we will proceed in the order that you were introduced. Ms Twohig. </p><p>      TWOHIG:  Good morning, Chairman Crapo, Ranking Member Brown and thank you for that special introduction, I'm very proud of my Cleveland roots, and thank you for the opportunity to testify today about the work of the Bureau of consumer financial protection to address consumer protections in the credit reporting market. </p><p>      My name is Peggy Twohig and I'm assistant director for subversion policy at the bureau. Credit reporting plays a critical role in consumer financial services and has enormous reach and impact. Over 200 million Americans have credit files with trade lines furnished voluntarily by over 10,000 providers. This information is used by creditors and other types of businesses to make decisions about individual transactions with consumers. </p><p>      In particular, creditors rely on this information to decide whether to approve loans and what terms to offer. Accurate credit reporting is important to creditors and other businesses to make good business decisions. For an individual consumer, an accurate credit report can be even more important given the significant impact that information can have on that consumers ability to obtain financial and other products and services. </p><p>      Because of the importance of accuracy to businesses and consumers? The structure of the fair credit reporting act creates interrelated legal standards and requirements to support the policy goal of accurate credit reporting. These requirements anticipate that all reports will not be perfect. Instead the FCRA requires that consumer reporting agencies or CRA's have a reasonable procedures to assure maximum possible accuracy of reports. </p><p>      It also imposes certain accuracy obligations on furnishers of credit report information and the FCRA has a dispute and investigation framework with obligations on both CRA's and furnishers to ensure that potential errors are investigated and errors are corrected promptly. </p><p>      The written testimony of the Bureau reviews the legal authority of the Bureau, to supervisor enforced and enforce the federal consumer financial laws applicable to CRAs. </p><p>      I will focus here on the work the bureau has done exercising these authorities. In both its supervision and enforcement work, the bureau has focused on credit reporting accuracy and dispute handling by both CRAs and furnishers. </p><p>      As discussed in a special edition of supervisory highlights published last year, the Bureau of supervisory work has prioritized reviews of key elements underpinning accuracy. As a result of these reviews, the bureau directed specific improvements in data accuracy and dispute resolution at one or more CRA including improving oversight of incoming data from the furnishers, instituting quality-control programs of compiled Consumer Reports. Monitoring furnisher dispute metrics to identify and correct root causes. Improved investigations of consumer disputes including a review of relevant information provided by consumers, and improving communication to consumers of dispute results. </p><p>      In supervising bank and non-bank furnishers, the bureau has found furnishers that were not complying with their FCRA obligations and directed them to comply including developing reasonable written policies and procedures regarding the accuracy of the information they furnish, taking corrective action when they furnish information they determine to be inaccurate, and bringing their dispute handling practices into compliance. </p><p>The Bureau has also brought enforcement actions and entered into a number of settlements related to violations of the FCRA's accuracy and dispute investigation requirements. </p><p>      Turning to data security, CRAs hold a tremendous amount of sensitive information about consumers. If CRAs do not protect this data, it may lead to data breaches creating the risk of substantial harm to consumers including the risk of identity theft. Since the Equifax breach, the Bureau has increased its attention to data security issues in our supervisory and enforcement work. </p><p>The Bureau has the authority to conduct data security investigations and to conduct examinations at certain non-banks including larger CRAs. This authority includes assessing the facts and circumstances to determine whether a CRAs data security practices constitute violations of federal consumer financial law including the prohibition against unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts and practices, or the FCRA. </p><p>      Our supervisory enforcement and consumer education efforts will continue in this important area. Consumers should have confidence in their credit report that their credit reports are secure and comply with all applicable legal requirements. Thank you again for the opportunity to testify today at this important hearing, and we would be happy to answer your questions about the Bureau's work-related credit reporting. </p><p>      CRAPO:  Thank you very much. Ms. Mithal. </p><p>      MITHAL:  Thank you. Chairman Crapo, Ranking Member Brown and members of the committee. My name is Maneesha Mithal and I'm the associate director at the Division of Privacy and Identity Protection at the Federal Trade Commission. I appreciate the opportunity to appear before you today to discuss the fair credit reporting act, credit bureaus, and data security. </p><p>      As you know, the FCRA is intended help consumers in three-way. First, it helps consumers prevent and misuse of sensitive consumer report information by limiting recipients to those who have a legitimate need for it. Second, it works to improve the accuracy and integrity of the consumer reporting system. And third, it promotes the efficiency of the nation's banking and consumer credit systems. </p><p>      Now the commission has played a key role in the implementation enforcement and interpretation of the FCRA since its enactment. Let me mention three key examples. </p><p>      First, in 2012, the commission published a study of credit report accuracy. According to the study findings, one in four consumers identified errors on their credit reports that might affect their credit scores. Four out of five consumers who filed disputes experienced some modification to their credit report, and 5 percent of consumers experienced a change in their credit score that could impact their credit risk classification. </p><p>      The second activity that the FTC engages in is enforcement. Enforcement continues to be a top priority for the commission. Since 2011, the Bureau has been examining the nationwide credit bureaus. As a result, the FTC has focused its FCRA law enforcement efforts on other entities in the credit reporting area and other aspects of the consumer reporting industry more broadly. </p><p>      One example is enforcing a law against furnishers that aren't supervised by the Bureau. The FTC has settled cases against data furnishers that allegedly had inadequate policies and procedures for reporting accurate information to CRAs. </p><p>      Another example is employment background screening CRAs. For instance, in the InfoTrack case, the commission alleged that a background screening CRA failed to have reasonable procedures to ensure maximum possible accuracy of the consumer reports it provided, and as a result, it provided inaccurate information suggesting that job applicant may have been registered sex offenders when they were in fact, not. </p><p>      Third, the commission continues to educate consumers and businesses on their consumer reporting rights and obligations under the FCRA. One example is their publication, credit, and your consumer rights which provides an overview of credit for consumers, explains consumers legal rights, and offers practical tips to help solve credit problems. </p><p>      Now, let me close by mentioning the importance of credit bureaus maintaining reasonable security of the consumer information that is entrusted to them. Since 2001, the commission has undertaken substantial efforts to promote data security in this and other sectors. </p><p>      We enforced several laws requiring companies to maintain reasonable security including the FTC act, the Gramm Leach Bliley safeguards rule, and certain provisions of the FCRA. The commission has brought over 60 law enforcement actions against companies that allegedly engaged in unreasonable data security practices. </p><p>      Last year the commission took the unusual step of publicly confirming its investigation into the Equifax data breach due to scale of the public interest in the matter. And although we aggressively enforced our data security laws, I believe there are some gaps in our authority. </p><p>      For example we cannot seek civil penalties for violations of most data security laws. To fill in these gaps, the commission has supported federal data security legislation on a bipartisan basis for over a decade. My written testimony discusses these issues in further detail and I'm happy to answer any questions you might have. </p><p>      CRAPO:  Thank you Ms. Mithal. And my first question is for you, this is primarily just sort of the housekeeping item but as I indicated in my opening statement, the economic growth regulatory relief and consumer protection act has some significant provisions in it in this arena in terms of protecting the consumers with the ability to place security freezes on their credit files with the credit bureaus. </p><p>      This provision will empower consumers to protect their credit in the event of future data breaches or incidents of identity theft, I'm just seeking your commitment that you and the FTC will move expeditiously to implement these credit bureau provisions in Senate Bill 2155. </p><p>      MITHAL:  Absolutely, you have our commitment to expeditiously and we have already begun, we issued a consumer blog post and we began our rulemaking process. So thank you. </p><p>      CRAPO:  Thank you. And Ms. Twohig, credit bureaus, well let me put it this way, I have long been concerned about the ever increasing amounts of big data that are being collected both in the private sector and in the public sector by the government. </p><p>      And as you know, one of the agencies that I've been worried about is the consumer financial protection bureau. Are credit bureaus required to provide data to the bureau? </p><p>      TWOHIG:  Mr. Senator, thank you for that question. In our supervisory work, they are required to respond to our requests when we are conducting an examination and the requests that we make of the credit bureaus are similar to the request we make of other financial service providers that we oversee through our examination authority. </p><p>      So that would be we request information such as how they are complying with the law and their compliance management systems, so for example their board and management oversight, their policies and procedures, they are monitoring their training on what audits they're doing so all the elements that go into compliance management system we asked for that general information and then more specifically, we asked for more specific information when were determining particular compliance with particular provisions of the law. </p><p>      So for example we may need specific information about consumer files when we're doing transaction testings to ensure for example that they were complying with the law in following up on a consumers dispute? </p><p>      CRAPO:  And my understanding is that the agency is seeking to collect specific credit card transactional data on hundreds of millions of the accounts, is that not correct? </p><p>      MITHAL:  My understanding, senator, is that a separate part of the Bureau, it's research arm, collects in a credit panel the identified information on consumers for research purposes. </p><p>      CRAPO:  But you're not in a position to describe exactly what they are collecting? </p><p>      MITHAL:  Correct, we need to follow up with you and get you the details on that. </p><p>      CRAPO:  All right. Do you know -- well, let me go back again to the information that you are familiar with. Is the data that you are requiring provided by mandate or is it purchased? </p><p>      MITHAL:  So on their -- the area that I work in, supervision, the legal requirement under Dodd Frank is that they are required to respond to supervisory request for the information we need to... </p><p>      (CROSSTALK) </p><p>      CRAPO:  All right. And are there other private sector entities that are required to provide that in addition to the credit bureaus, and what are they? For example credit card companies, banks, others? </p><p>      TWOHIG:  So there's various provisions of different kinds of law that do require reporting to the Bureau. I believe for example under the Card Act, credit card issuers are required to provide their agreements that the bureau posts on the website, I'm not familiar sitting here right now with all the different provisions that might require reporting to the Bureau but there's a number of different requirements that would come into play. </p><p>      CRAPO:  All right, I appreciate that and just quickly, I only got about a minute left so if you can just give me about a 30-second answer sort of a high-level answer as to what have we learned from the Equifax data breach about what we need to do from here. </p><p>      TWOHIG:  So Senator, I can tell you that even though the bureau's investigations are not public, in this instance, it is a matter of public record that the bureau is investigating Equifax, we are coordinating with the FTC on that investigation so that's in process. So I think it's premature to really answer that question. </p><p>      CRAPO:  All right. Ms Mithal? </p><p>      MITHAL:  So like Ms Twohig, I can't comment on the specifics, but what I can say is two things. One is that credit, we learned that credit bureaus do hold the most sensitive information about consumers available in the marketplace and it is incumbent on these credit bureaus to protect that information. </p><p>      And second, I think that in terms of the big data breaches, I think the FTC could use more authority to seek civil penalties against companies that don't -- that violates the laws that we enforce. </p><p>      CRAPO:  All right, thank you. </p><p>      And Senator Brown has indicated that he wants to yield his first slot to Senator Schatz, so Senator Schatz, please go ahead. </p><p>      SCHATZ:  Thank you, Chairman, and thank you to the Ranking Member Brown, and I promise I won't make a habit out of this. I appreciate it very much, thank you very much for your testimony. </p><p>      Ms. Twohig, I wanted to follow up on something that Ms Mithal described, there was an FTC report that found that 5 percent of credit reports contain confirmed material errors. </p><p>      So these are confirmed material errors that there are more errors than that, but even if it's just 5 percent, that is the bare minimum of confirmed material errors, you are talking about 10 million people and worse than that, two years later, 84 percent of those errors remain on the credit reports. </p><p>      Can you tell me a little bit about what your supervisory work is entailing and what you found as it relates to the accuracy and dispute resolution? </p><p>      TWOHIG:  Thank you for that question, Senator. I'd be happy to talk about that. </p><p>      As I said, because of the concerns about credit report accuracy, the Bureau did its first rule to identify what larger participants in the marketplace was going to establish a non-bank supervision program for that wasn't already in the statute with respect to credit bureaus, consumer reporting agencies, because of the priority that the Bureau gave to look into that market and to be able to apply first ever supervisory authority on that industry. </p><p>      So they had never been before the Bureau, been examined by any federal or state regulator. And we prioritize that and we have been conducting that work and so we've been very focused on looking at their compliance with the accuracy in the dispute resolution provisions of the FCRA. </p><p>      SCHATZ:  And what have you found? </p><p>      TWOHIG:  And we found that in general, as a big picture matter, supervision is an attempt to get companies to have a preventive -- to prevent law violations, to have a proactive approach to compliance to make sure that they had their compliance house in order so that violations don't occur in the first place. </p><p>      We think we've made progress in shifting their attitude and culture toward more of a proactive compliance posture, but we have found problems with their compliance with the law and we have given them directives to improve where we found they have fallen short and we have seen improvements over time. But that's not to say there isn't more work to do, Senator. </p><p>      SCHATZ:  Thank you. Ms. Mithal, Senator Kennedy and I have a bill that would give consumers more tools to manage their credit reports and I think it's really important for this committee especially for Republicans on this committee to recognize that we all know that we can't blow up the system, that although there are consumer problems related to these credit bureaus, we still need some measure of credit worthiness and were not intending to be so disruptive as to create problems in lending. </p><p>      But there are some basic things that we can do to empower consumers and I want to make sure that they're not customers, they have not enlisted, people, generally speaking, do not sign up with these credit bureaus, but they are consumers. And our bill tries to empower consumers to for instance know what the credit bureaus know, to be able to see those same lines and to have an online portal that is not so labyrinthed in that allows a person to resolve any dispute in a straightforward manner. </p><p>      Is it fair to say, Ms. Mithal, that you support the goals of this legislation? </p><p>      MITHAL:  Absolutely. I think credit report accuracy -- inaccuracy issues continue to harm those consumers that are affected by it, not only is it that on the lack of credit in the future, it's the time and expense it takes to clear up their credit reports so I think the tool you're aiming to provide consumers through your bill, those are the types of tools that are absolutely worth considering. </p><p>      SCHATZ:  Can you talk a little bit about the importance of an online portal? </p><p>      MITHAL:  Sure, so I think one of the problems for consumers is that it's very difficult to know how to navigate the credit reporting system. And so I think the easier we can make it for consumers the more tools we could provide for them, the more one-stop shop we can provide for them, I think that's very consistent with as you said, the kind of free flow of credit information through this. </p><p>      SCHATZ:  One final question which I think I will take for the record for both of you, it's sort of twofold. First, we should draw a distinction between breaches which create credit score problems and credit inaccuracies and the endemic problem of these credit bureaus basically getting it wrong anywhere from 5 percent to 15 percent of the time but at least 5 percent of the time in a material way. </p><p>      So although the Equifax breach caused us to think about these bureaus and focus on that question, this is not a cybersecurity question exclusively, it's also a basic consumer rights question so my question for the record is what specifically are the pain points for consumers as they go about trying to resolve these questions and I've run out of time and I appreciate indulgence of the chair and the ranking member. </p><p>      CRAPO:  Thank you. Senator Scott? </p><p>      SCOTT:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman and thank you to the witnesses for being here today. I've worked for the last six or seven years on something called the opportunity agenda, trying to find a way to empower those folks living in distressed communities as you probably both know, we have about 50 million Americans today who live in those distressed communities and as I think about ways to empower those folks living in distressed communities, the access to credit issue jumps out very clearly. </p><p>      The BCFP has found that 26 million Americans are credit invisible, another 19 million Americans are unscorable because their information is either insufficient and/or just too old. It should come as no surprise that there is a strong correlation between your income and whether you have a credit score or credit record. </p><p>      Almost 30 percent of Americans living in low income areas are credit invisible, an additional 15 percent of Americans living in those areas are unscorable. In South Carolina when you combine those two numbers together, that means about one -- nearly one out of every four South Carolina adults are in that category. </p><p>      A solution to bring credit invisibles out of the shadows is S3040, the Credit Access and Inclusion Act. </p><p>      Credit invisible's regularly make payments for their rent, gas, water, electricity, and cell phones. New credit scoring models recognize these payments are payments that are predictive of your actual credit risk. Unfortunately the FCRA ensures that missed payments and collection are reported to the credit bureaus but not necessarily the ones you make on time. </p><p>      The Brookings Institution states that the consideration of this payment data will lead to a 21 percent increase to prime credit for those earning less than $20,000 a year and a 15 percent increase to prime credit for those earning between $20,000 and $30,000 a year, that will make a huge difference for credit worthy folks trying to climb the economic ladder, and my bill helps us get there. </p><p>      Ms. Twohig, what is the impact on the consumer of being credit invisible when it comes to interest rates, applying for job or finding an apartment? </p><p>      TWOHIG:  Senator, first of all, I want to say that the Bureau shares your concern about access to credit, in fact, one of the Bureau's strategic goals is to ensure that all consumers have access to consumer financial services. </p><p>      With respect to the particular impact, the particular impact will vary for each consumer and what they're applying for and what they're trying to do in the particular credit or other markets, but I think it is fair to say that if the consumer does not have credit filed with one of the national credit reporting companies or if it doesn't have enough in that file to score, then that consumer is basically shut out of the mainstream credit markets. </p><p>      SCOTT:  Well, that kind of relates to my second question, the BCFP has suggested that more of this information at the credit bureaus will help credit invisibles access mainstream credit sources, sounds like you would concur that that would be accurate. </p><p>      TWOHIG:  So alternative data of the type you're discussing is also something that the Bureau is interested in learning more about and is monitoring. In fact, the Bureau issued last year a request for information from the public to get information about different kinds of alternative data and the aspects of that alternative data and how it could help consumers and access to credit. We received over 100 comments, we're currently monitoring that information and studying that information and learning more about it, but I think also it's fair to say that if that information is accurate and predictive, then that could be part of the solution to increase access to credit. </p><p>      SCOTT:  Thank you. I will just say to my Chairman and the Ranking Member who I know both have a passion for finding ways of bringing those folks who are today credit invisible out of the shadows and into a place where they can rely on a strong credit score to be able to have lower interest rates, greater access to better jobs, and certainly be able to find places to live in higher quality communities and all that is anchored in how your credit score and not being credit invisible. </p><p>      So hopefully, S3040 will be on the top of the docket both of you. Thank you both. </p><p>      CRAPO:  Thank you, Senator Scott. </p><p>      Senator Menendez. </p><p>      MENENDEZ:  Thank you. </p><p>      Ms. Twohig and Ms. Mithal, let me start off by asking you each to give me the last four digits of your Social Security number? </p><p>      TWOHIG:  Senator, I really don't want to do that in a public forum. </p><p>      MITHAL:  I have the same reaction. </p><p>      MENENDEZ:  All right, how about telling me which stores you opened the credit cards with?</p><p>      TWOHIG:  Which stores? </p><p>      MENENDEZ:  Yes. </p><p>      TWOHIG:  I don't think I have opened any credit card with a store lately. </p><p>      MITHAL:  That is not something I would be willing to share in a public forum. </p><p>      MENENDEZ:  Or maybe can you tell us the outstanding balance in your home mortgage loans? </p><p>      TWOHIG:  Senator, I'd prefer not to say that kind of information either. </p><p>      MITHAL:  The same. </p><p>      MENENDEZ:  I'm not surprised but that information which I'm sure you would want to be shared or sold without your permission, and yet under current law, consumer reporting agencies like Equifax can share and sell your information, where you live, where you pay your bills and whether you pay it on time, what you filed for, whether you filed for bankruptcy without ever having to get your consent. Isn't that right? </p><p>      TWOHIG:  That is correct, although there are certain limitations on how they can use the data. </p><p>      MENENDEZ:  Now, America consumers are at the mercy of three mega companies who control the security and safety of their personal information, that makes no sense, consumers should have the ability to control when how and to whom their data is shared just like you want to control it here in this public forum. </p><p>      Last year, a massive Equifax data breach laid bare the systemic problems with the credit reporting industry. Its failure to guard sensitive data left 145.5 million Americans exposed to identity theft and fraud. Ms. Mithal, Equifax waited an inexplicable six weeks to disclose the breach that had occurred, worse over months after the breach millions of consumers were still unaware of the breach in part because there's no national requirement to alert consumers. </p><p>      My bill, S2188 the Consumer Data Protection Act would require consumer reporting agency to quickly notify the Federal Trade Commission, the CFPB law enforcement and consumers of a breach while keeping intact existing strong state consumer protection laws. Generally speaking, does the FTC support the idea of requiring companies to provide notification to consumers where there is a data security breach? </p><p>      MITHAL:  Absolutely, and the commission has done so for almost a for over a decade and a bipartisan basis. </p><p>      MENENDEZ:  Now let me ask you another issue we need to address here is the ability to hold consumer reporting agencies accountable when there is a breach, when they have failed, clearly failed to protect consumers personal data, my legislation also provides FTC the authority to pursue fines against a consumer reporting agency such as Equifax that negligently, knowingly, or willingly causes a data breach. In your view, would the institution of a monetary penalty framework, incentivize consumer reporting agencies to better secure consumer data? </p><p>      MITHAL:  Yes. </p><p>      MENENDEZ:  Let me ask another question for both witnesses, given the unique and varied nature of consumer harm that results from a data breach at a consumer reporting agency which includes everything from identity theft to difficulty purchasing a home or securing employment, would it be helpful to have a comprehensive study analyzing both the immediate and long-term costs and damages to individuals affected by data breaches at consumer reporting agencies? </p><p>      MITHAL:  So I think that there's no question that there's tremendous harm to consumers from data breaches of their sensitive information I think it would be worth considering a study to quantify that harm. </p><p>      MENENDEZ:  Ms. Twohig? </p><p>      TWOHIG:  I would agree with Ms. Mithal and to the extent the Bureau can be helpful providing technical expertise in analyzing that topic, we would be happy to do so. </p><p>      MENENDEZ:  Well, thank you. I really didn't want to know your social security number or your balances on your mortgage which I hope is virtually nil, but this is the very essence of what we're talking about as we deal with this issue here today. </p><p>      Thank you, Mr. Chairman. </p><p>      CRAPO:  Senator Kennedy. </p><p>      KENNEDY:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Ms. Mithal, can we agree that the work of the CRAs facilitates commerce in America? </p><p>      MITHAL:  Absolutely. </p><p>      KENNEDY:  Do you agree with that to, Ms. Twohig? </p><p>      TWOHIG:  Yes. </p><p>      KENNEDY:  And I think we can also agree can we not that that's a good thing... </p><p>      MITHAL:  Yes. </p><p>      KENNEDY:  In our free enterprise system? </p><p>      MITHAL:  Yes. </p><p>      KENNEDY:  When the CRA's gather information about me, do they ask my permission? </p><p>      TWOHIG:  No. </p><p>      MITHAL:  No. </p><p>      KENNEDY:  Do they pay me the information? </p><p>      TWOHIG:  No. </p><p>      MITHAL:  No. </p><p>      KENNEDY:  They gather this information and they assign me a score basically make an evaluation, a judgment about me whether I'm credit worthy person or not. Is that correct? </p><p>      MITHAL:  Correct. </p><p>      KENNEDY:  And in 5 percent to 10 percent of the cases they get it wrong, they have some bad data, is that correct? </p><p>      MITHAL:  Yes. </p><p>      KENNEDY:  If they have bad data and I call them up and say hey you got bad data on me, you didn't talk to me first, I could have fixed this upfront but you didn't talk to me but you got some bad data on it on me and it's affecting my life and my family's life. And the credit, the CRA says okay will get back to you and they never get back to me or they get back to me and say we disagree. What is my recourse? </p><p>      MITHAL:  So under the FCRA, there's a dispute process where the credit reporting agency is required to respond within a particular amount of time and on the let the end of the day when the credit bureau says that no, you in fact, owe this debt, the consumer owes the debt. </p><p>      TWOHIG:  That is right, the consumer can put a statement on their credit report if they are not satisfied with the results, the dispute... </p><p>      KENNEDY:  How long does that take? </p><p>      MITHAL:  I believe under the FCRA, the investigation process is 30 to 45 days. </p><p>      TWOHIG:  That is right. </p><p>      KENNEDY:  I have to fill out a bunch of forms, do I? </p><p>      TWOHIG:  Yes. </p><p>      KENNEDY:  Okay, how long do you think it takes to fill out all those forms and make the phone calls and say, hey, you got my information wrong? </p><p>      TWOHIG:  So I think there is certainly some time it takes on the part of the consumer to kind of understand the dispute process, to go through the dispute process and implement it. </p><p>      KENNEDY:  And if I got a day job I can't do that at work, right? </p><p>      TWOHIG:  Yes, it's certainly a lot of time to expense to dispute... </p><p>      KENNEDY:  Can I do it at night or weekend, can I call them up on the weekends? Do the CRA work in the weekend, do you know?</p><p>      TWOHIG:  I believe to have an online portal that you can file a dispute online and submit documents now, you can submit, the consumers can submit documents in support of their dispute online. </p><p>      KENNEDY:  Okay, and let's suppose at the end of the process, they come back to me and they say no, we're not changing anything or I know this doesn't happen very often but you get somebody having a bad day and they say, we are not changing anything and by the way we don't care, because we don't have to, you are not my cousin. </p><p>      What would I do? </p><p>      TWOHIG:  So, I think, speaking for the... </p><p>      KENNEDY:  Do I file a complaint with the FTC? </p><p>      TWOHIG:  Sure, you can file a complaint with the FTC? </p><p>      KENNEDY:  Do I need a lawyer? </p><p>      TWOHIG:  No, you don't need a lawyer? </p><p>      KENNEDY:  Does it take time, you got a fair -- I bet it's not a one page form, is it? </p><p>      TWOHIG:  Yes, it takes time. </p><p>      KENNEDY:  It's not a one-page form, is it? </p><p>      TWOHIG:  It's multiple pages. </p><p>      KENNEDY:  And how quickly would the FTC act? </p><p>      TWOHIG:  It would take a while. </p><p>      KENNEDY:  Like how long is a while? </p><p>      TWOHIG:  It could take -- so let me just clarify, we don't act on behalf of individual consumers... </p><p>      KENNEDY:  I understand, how long would it take. </p><p>      TWOHIG:  It would take several months to investigate probably... </p><p>      KENNEDY:  It could take a year, doesn't it? It could take two years sometimes, doesn't it? </p><p>      TWOHIG:  Sure. </p><p>      KENNEDY:  In the meantime, they got bad data about me. </p><p>      TWOHIG:  Yes. </p><p>      KENNEDY:  And they didn't pay me for it, they didn't even ask me. </p><p>      Now, I think CRAs perform an important service and do facilitate commerce but it seems to me that we ought to be smart enough particularly with technology to come up with the system that says, we are going to make it as easy as possible for the people with respect to whom the CRAs have bad information. So they can -- those people can get it fixed and they can get it fixed quickly and I can get it fixed efficiently and they can get it fixed inexpensively and they can get it fixed so they don't have to miss the kids' ballgames. </p><p>      Now, I'm like Senator Schatz, and I have a bill that will do that, what is wrong with that bill? </p><p>      I think it's a good bill, don't you? </p><p>      MITHAL:  I do think it's a good bill and I would support the goals of the legislation which is to, as you articulated, to make it a lot easier for consumers to file disputes of consumer reporting agencies. </p><p>      KENNEDY:  Ms Twohig? </p><p>      TWOHIG:  Senator, I would say that all the issues you just pointed out are the reason why we prioritized at the bureau, supervising both the CRAs and furnishers... </p><p>      KENNEDY:  Yes, ma'am, I know you are prioritizing, I'm not fuzzing at you, but you are still part of the bureaucracy, and it's pretty intimidating for the average American who didn't ask to be brought into this system, it's a good system, but it's pretty intimidating when the CRAs get it wrong. </p><p>      And we ought to make it as easy as possible for them to get it fixed. That is good for them, that is good for the companies, that is good for the free enterprise system, and I think we can do better. </p><p>      Thank you, Mr. Chairman. </p><p>      CRAPO:  Thank you. Senator Warner? </p><p>      WARNER:  Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman. </p><p>      First of all, thank you for holding this hearing, I think you're hearing bipartisan concern and I want to thank the ranking member for also yielding to us. I also want to point out though that Ms. Twohig and Ms. Mithal are longtime professionals, I think they would lean in to being willing to try to help us fix this problem, but they can't fix this problem on their own without Congress acting. </p><p>      So I want to reiterate what I think a lot of members have made -- I had to choice in Equifax having my data, Senator Menendez raised this, Senator Kennedy has, Senator Schatz has, to me as a former business guy, it is remarkable that a data breach based upon sloppy cybersecurity standards that took place over year ago, the public wasn't notified until 11 months ago that we still, and this is not your fault at this point, if Congress hasn't acted, if they had paid no penalty, (inaudible) took a little hit in the market, but they have almost recovered back because they don't expect Congress to do its job to give the FTC the ability to put a civil penalty process in place. </p><p>      Now Senator Warren and I have a very comprehensive bill that I'm sure she will speak to as well that would put a liability regime in place that would particularly in the event of negligent behavior, put a real incentive to make sure that credit reporting agencies up their game and let me, just again for the record, Ms. Mithal, the FTC at this point does not have the ability to put any civil penalty on a CRA based on performance, do they? </p><p>      MITHAL:  Not on the basis of data security violations generally, no. </p><p>      WARNER:  So unless the Congress acts, whether it's Senator Warren's bill, Senator Menendez' bill, Senator Kennedy's bill, Schatz' bill, you don't have the tool, as a matter of fact, if we go and look at the so called safeguards rule that we've heard from Ms. Twohig's testimony that CFPB does not have authority under the safeguards rule to examine or look at the practices of the CRA, Ms. Mithal, does the FTC have the authority under the safeguards rule to examine credit reporting agencies to ensure that rule is being followed? </p><p>      MITHAL:  So just to be clear, we don't have examination authority, but we can investigates CRA to make sure that they are following language (ph) by safeguard rules, but significantly as you pointed out, we do not have the authority to seek civil penalties under the safeguards rule. </p><p>      WARNER:  Right, and if memory serves, I'm sure Senator Kennedy remembers as well, FTC indicated they had opened an investigation into the Equifax breach but here we are over a year after the breach took place and at 11 months after the public was finally notified yet we still don't have a result in even if you come up with a result you don't have the ability to impose penalties because you have no liability regime in place. </p><p>      MITHAL:  Not under data security, yes. </p><p>      WARNER:  Mr. Chairman, I think this is an area because I can assure you that sitting from the intel side, this is a problem that is not going to go away, this is a problem that is going to only exponentially increase and Senator Menendez went down the path of would you be willing to offer your personal information, you wouldn't, but if somebody has hacked in and got that information from Equifax and contacts you with that personalized information and you combine that with the next realm of misinformation, disinformation and you suddenly have a live stream video of what appears to be the face of somebody you recognize popping up on your social media account asking you to do something, either invest in some company vote for some candidate, you put those two together and you have a potential crisis that goes well beyond just financial concerns. </p><p>      And if we don't act, I think we are going to be irresponsible in ensuring that kind of activity doesn't take place and because they -- I agree with Senator Kennedy, the incentives are not there at all for any CRA to clean up its act. </p><p>      There are no civil penalties, there's no liability regime, and I think we can do better and I think these professionals actually would want us to do better if we would give them the tools. And let me just in my last 30 seconds though, Senator Scott raised this question about some of the folks who were on bank (ph), I am concerned as well as we think through -- Ms. Mithal, this is for you, you know, as we start looking at the use of artificial intelligence, machine learning, there is going to be a lot of tools used particularly by non-bank financial institutions who may provide credit lending, how we make sure that we ensure fairness in this new regime. </p><p>      But at this moment in time, it's again I don't believe the FTC has the appropriate ability to look at non-bank financial institution whose using AI techniques to grant a loan under (FICRA), is that correct? </p><p>      MITHAL:  So we did do report on this issue a few years ago and we did mention that there are certain circumstances when companies use AI technology to make decisions about credit or housing employment eligibility that we would have authority to take action under the FCRA, but that is against a limited set of entities that are third party using the information. So there's some gaps there. </p><p>      WARNER:  And I would only say, Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member, that if we think what's happened with Equifax was something, wait until you see the non-bank financial start to use AI in the sophisticated way and if we don't get ahead of this in terms of -- we ought to be able to use the data and good information but if we don't put some rules in place, the Equifax breach will pale in comparison to what the next generation of the attacks will look like. </p><p>      Thank you, Mr. Chairman. </p><p>      CRAPO:  I share your concern, Senator Warner. </p><p>      Senator Warren. </p><p>      WARREN:  Thank you very much Mr. Chairman, thanks for holding this hearing, thank you Ranking Member Brown for letting us go ahead of you here. You know, I'm going to pick up on the same theme that my colleagues have been talking about. After Equifax disclosed its massive data breach last year, I sent letters to Equifax and the other large credit bureaus and federal regulators seeking information about the breach and the options for holding Equifax accountable. </p><p>      My staff compiled that information in an investigative report that my office issued in February and I'd like to submit a copy of that report for the record, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Chairman? Without objection. </p><p>      CRAPO:  Without objection. </p><p>      WARREN:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you. </p><p>      CRAPO:  What did I just agree to? </p><p>      WARREN:  We are done. </p><p>      So we put this report together, one of the key findings of this report is that federal agencies don't have the legal tools they need to stop data breaches at credit bureaus and hold credit bureaus accountable for compromising sensitive personal information. </p><p>      As Senator Warner was just pointing, out the FTC has some authority to oversee data security at credit bureaus but it currently has no authority to seek civil penalties against the bureaus for compromising consumer information. So let me just ask Ms. Mithal, do you think the FTC should have that authority?</p><p>      MITHAL:  Yes. </p><p>      WARREN:  Good. Thank you. </p><p>      In fact the response the FTC sent to my letter specifically requested legislation that would \"allow the FTC to seek civil penalties to help ensure effective deterrence of cyber security breaches\" so asking for it. Meanwhile CFPB has some supervisory authority over large credit bureaus but limited ability to issue rules on how the bureaus must safeguard sensitive consumer data. Is that right, Ms. Twohig? </p><p>      TWOHIG:  That is correct. </p><p>      WARREN:  Good. In other words, even if CFPB spots serious cyber security problems at the credit bureaus it supervises, it cannot issue new rules to try to address these problems, is that right? </p><p>      TWOHIG:  So we do not have the authority under the safeguards provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act or the safeguards rule. </p><p>      WARREN:  Okay so in response to my letter to the CFPB, then Director Cordray said that the agency supported new legislation because \"federal laws that are applicable to data security have not kept pace with technological and cyber security developments\" in other words, we want the authority to do this. </p><p>      So after receiving these responses, Senator Warner and I spent months working with each other and with experts in the field to develop the data breach prevention and compensation act, our bill would authorize the FTC to impose large and automatic penalties on any large credit bureau that allowed sensitive consumer information to be accessed. </p><p>      The way we see it, if credit bureaus collect our personal information without our permission, then they should have an absolute obligation to protect data from hackers and thieves. The bill would also create a new office of cyber security at the FTC with responsibility to establish cyber security standards at credit bureaus and supervise compliance with those standards. </p><p>      Ms. Mithal, do you think the FTC would be better equipped to oversee how credit bureaus protect sensitive information if Senator Warner's and my bill became law? </p><p>      MITHAL:  So I certainly I do think we had the expertise, I think it's a question of resources and so your law comes with resources, that would be welcome. </p><p>      WARREN:  Good, fair enough. Fair enough. </p><p>      But you got to have the authority you can't do anything. </p><p>      MITHAL:  Correct. </p><p>      WARREN:  So, thank you. Mr. Chairman, I know that you and many of your Republican colleagues on his committee are concerned about the lack of adequate protection of consumer data at credit bureaus and I hope you'll work with Senator Warner and with me to push this legislation forward. </p><p>      Our federal agencies have made it absolutely clear that they need more legal authority to protect consumers, we can't just cross our fingers and hope that another breach doesn't happen because another breach will happen and if we fail to act, then we bear some responsibility for that. </p><p>      More of our constituents will be harmed unless Congress acts so I urge you to join with Senator Warner and me and others on this committee to try to push our bill forward. </p><p>      Thank you, Mr. Chairman. </p><p>      CRAPO:  Thank you, Senator Warren. </p><p>      WARREN:  Thank you. </p><p>      CRAPO:  Senator Cortez Masto? </p><p>      CORTEZ MASTO:  Thank you. Thank you Mr. Chair and Ranking Member for, I agree, this important discussion and thank you to both of you for being here and all of the work that you do. </p><p>      I'm curious, last and I want to talk a little bit about exclusive contracts, last October right after the announcement of Equifax's massive data breach the New York Times ran an article about how Equifax and Freddie Mac have an exclusive relationship that harms both consumers and small businesses, I'm curious if either one of you are familiar with that article or familiar with this concept that there are exclusive contracts? </p><p>      MITHAL:  I'm not. </p><p>      TWOHIG:  I'm not familiar either. </p><p>      CORTEZ MASTO:  So this isn't something that either one of your organization is looking into is something that is harmful to individual consumers or small businesses. </p><p>      MITHAL:  I can only speak to privacy and cyber security issues and that is not something that is on our radar screen. </p><p>      TWOHIG:  And for the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection and as I said at the outset we can confirm that we're investigating Equifax's data security practices in coordination with the FTC, beyond that our investigations are not public. </p><p>      CORTEZ MASTO:  Yes, thank you very much. </p><p>      And Ms. Twohig, let me jump back then to the concept of -- and I agree with my colleagues that -- this concern that all this data is being collected on all of us individually and we had no control over it. </p><p>      So Ms. Twohig, let me start with you, as you well know, there is criticisms around the world had different standards for consumer control of their own privacy, for instance, the new privacy laws in the European Union provide more privacy options than we do here in the United States. In fact, Americans have really little say over what data can be aggregated by these credit bureaus. </p><p>      If an opt in system for credit bureaus was established, how would that impact people, our communities, and our economy? In other words also in and as you address that, what is the reaction we are seeing to the implementation of the general data protection regulations in the European Union. </p><p>      And the reason I bring this up is because we've all been talking about opt in, but there is this concern that somehow it is going to be -- have some -- an impact on our economy, on our businesses and so I'm curious if you have any insight into that either one of you, and let me start with you, Mr. Twohig. </p><p>      TWOHIG:  So at the outset, I would say that the Economic Growth and Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act provides additional important consumer protections in my view to allow consumers to get a free security freeze and so even though that's not exactly what... </p><p>      CORTEZ MASTO:  That is not an opt in. </p><p>      TWOHIG:  That is not an opt in, but it's one step toward more control if consumers choose to exercise it. </p><p>      CORTEZ MASTO:  But it's less than what the European Union requires? </p><p>      TWOHIG:  I believe so. </p><p>      CORTEZ MASTO:  Any other? </p><p>      MITHAL:  Yes, I guess I would say that I would have a bit of a concern about an across the board opt in. And I could see people who have a bad credit history or who have criminal records, or bankruptcy is not waning that infrastructure to be reported and is not opting into the system. </p><p>      And I think that could raise the credit across the board. So I do have some concerns about that, I agree with the general concept that consumers should have more control, but there are potential means of accomplishing that. </p><p>      CORTEZ MASTO:  Do you think some of the legislation you've heard today gives more of that control to consumers? </p><p>      MITHAL:  I think there are some very interesting options worth exploring through that legislation. </p><p>      CORTEZ MASTO:  Thank you, I appreciate that. </p><p>      And let me also then go back to this idea, I agree with my colleague, Senator Scott, and the concern about too many adults have credit invisible and unscorable credit, and I think that is harmful in so many different ways. </p><p>      But I also understand, Ms. Twohig, from what you said that you are studying the issue that the agency is studying the issue on alternative to data. </p><p>      Can you talk a little bit more about that and when you are going to anticipate completion of that study and what your intent is after your -- the study is completed? </p><p>      TWOHIG:  So I don't have a particular date and I'm not sure there is a particular study, it's just something that the bureau is very interested in and has requested information so we could learn more about that. </p><p>      I can tell you that the acting director has created an office of innovation with the goal of seeing what the bureau can do to spur innovation in all kinds of ways and that would include the use of alternative data and avenues for increasing access to credit. </p><p>      CORTEZ MASTO:  Okay, thank you. And then one final question, I know that a number of states just recently announced that a consent order last week with Equifax and I believe these states really took the lead on this and did their necessary investigation. </p><p>      One of the reasons why I have concerns that there needs to be more of this collaboration between states and the federal government in this area is because I have seen here as we have had these hearings that state oversight is ever more necessary now, what I have seen from Director Mulvaney and really the CFPB nominee, Kraninger have not shown any willingness to challenge financial services industry. </p><p>      So given what I know and what I have seen here, let me ask you this. There is a legislation in the house, that is HR3626, and it requires enhancing information sharing between federal and state regulators when conducting the TSP exams. Would that be something you would support and I'm asking both of you? </p><p>      TWOHIG:  So I can say as a general matter than, and I've been with the bureau since the beginning in the supervision program, we have placed a priority on developing relationships with state regulators and my (inaudible) colleague is the same for the state attorneys general, and so we have close and cooperative relationships with those regulators and the acting director has said he wants to improve that even more. </p><p>      CORTEZ MASTO:  That is wonderful to hear. Thank you. </p><p>      MITHAL:  And I would echo that sentiment and I just want to also say that I think we have been talking a lot about gaps in the FTC's authority but I do want to say whatever authority congress gives us, we exercise very aggressively. So we brought over 60 data security cases and we looked at a variety of sectors so I didn't want to make it sound like we were sitting on our hands. </p><p>      CORTEZ MASTO:  Thank you. And I notice my time is up. Thank you both. </p><p>      CRAPO:  Thank you. Senator Jones. </p><p>      JONES:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you for the witnesses for coming here today. I want to mention something about today, I want to go back to cybersecurity like so many others but from a little bit different angle. </p><p>      And I appreciate all of the colleagues on this committee concerned with the Equifaxes of the world and the holders of this information. But you know, I'm an old prosecutor, and when we have a bank robbery, we just didn't focus on what happened at the bank, we focused on who got the money and trying to catch those folks. </p><p>      So my question is and we heard a lot today about Equifax and CRAs, is law enforcement involved in that investigation, and if so, if they are not, I would like to know why, and if so, can we have an expectation at some point when these investigation is released that there has been an effort and we hopefully can find out who did this but I agree with Senator Warner, this problem is not going away and we need to focus on perpetrators as much as those holding the date. </p><p>      I will give that to both of you. </p><p>      MITHAL:  Do I don't think I can talk about this in the context of the specific nonpublic investigation but what I can't say that we work very closely with criminal authorities, I think it's a kind of a one-two punch type situation where we want make sure as a civil matter that agencies and companies that are entrusted in the consumer data are doing everything they can to protect it and at the same time, we work with criminal law enforcement authority to catch the bad guys and to try to share information to accomplish that. </p><p>      So I agree it's a very important part of the equation. </p><p>      TWOHIG:  And that would be the same for the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection in terms of coordinating with criminal law enforcement agencies. </p><p>      JONES:  When this investigation is public would you expect there to be some element of the report about the culprits in this particular Equifax matter? </p><p>      TWOHIG:  I really can't speak to that. </p><p>      JONES:  All right, that's fair enough. </p><p>      All right, the other thing I like to mention is that a recent study showed that Alabama, my state, ranked third from the bottom in terms of average credit score and I know there are a lot of things that impact credit scores but what seem clear is that there were also regional differences that remain kind of static and one of the CFPB and FTC both have tools to educate customers which I think is as important as anything in trying to get folks to get their scores up, I see TV ads all the time but that's not the same to try to get your free credit score is not the same as trying to say get your free credit score up. </p><p>      So could you both briefly describe some of the tools that your agencies have with regard to education and what you believe to be the most effective way to educate the public about how to maintain a good credit score? </p><p>      MITHAL:  So I can start with that. And so we have what I believe is a world-class Office Of Consumer Business Education and one of the things we do is we put out our financial literacy materials, materials about credit scores and how to check your credit reports. And I think what we recognize that -- is a lot of people not know the FTC and so they feel a lot more comfortable getting this information from their local communities, their churches, their schools, their libraries, and so we do not copyright our information, we put out there for the local communities to put out their own communities and we would be happy to work with your office to get our materials to you. </p><p>      We are also members of an interagency financial literacy task force. So again I think we are trying, I think I absolutely agree that education is a very important part of what we do and we need to get the word out to consumers so they can help protect themselves. </p><p>      JONES:  Great. Well, do you want to address that, Ms. Twohig? </p><p>      TWOHIG:  Same for the bureau, consumer education is a very important part of what we do and we have materials and educational materials about how to create a credit file so consumers can have access to mainstream credit. Our community affairs office is also doing active work in certain communities to try to help on the communities to understand what they can do locally to help consumers understand how they can create and build their credit files and positive credit history. </p><p>      JONES:  Great. Thank you both and my staff will reach out to you to try to so that we can do some affirmative things in Alabama. And the remaining moment I just like to follow back up with what Senator Scott said about the bill that he and I have introduced on the Credit Access Inclusion Act and Mr. Chairman and Senator Brown, I would also urge this committee to get involved and try to get that bill out, a companion bill that's I think identical, passed the house unanimously and in an era which the divide over Supreme Court nominations and things like that are about to get great greater, I don't want a bill that is a truly bipartisan bill to fall through the cracks like this and I would urge the committee to take some action let's get that done. </p><p>      So thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. </p><p>      CRAPO:  Thank you, Senator Jones. </p><p>      Senator Van Hollen. </p><p>      VAN HOLLEN:  Thank you Mr. Chairman and ranking member and thank you both for your testimony here today. </p><p>      We talked about a number things. Two of the categories we talked about, one how do we create more incentives to discourage or prevent, deter credit rating agencies from becoming victims of data breaches? Obviously no one has interest in having a big data breach but the cost-benefit analysis needs to be changed and that is what Senators Warner and Warren have been talking about. </p><p>      The other issue I would Senator Kennedy and Senator Schatz have been talking about is the accuracy of the information collected by the credit ratings agency and I want to focus on that for a moment because, yes, I absolutely agree that we should make it easier for consumers to try to get their complaints submitted and processed more quickly, but it still appears to me that when you look at the sort of incentives of the CRAs that when they get it wrong, other than making the consumer whole again or correcting the error, they don't seem to have any penalty applied. </p><p>      So let me know if there is a current penalty that can be applied when they get it wrong and we already know that in 5 percent of the cases, they get it wrong which represents millions and millions of Americans which can have a devastating impact on their lives. </p><p>      So it seems to me in addition to making it easier to remedy the situation from the point of your consumer, we should also create greater incentives for the CRAs to get right in the first place so that the burden is on them when they get it wrong, that there are some penalty to be paid for getting it wrong. Are there any penalties right now that either of you can apply when they -- when you just find that they're getting it wrong a lot? </p><p>      MITHAL:  So we do have the authority to seek civil policies for companies that don't have reasonable procedures to have maximum possible accuracy. So I have been clarifying that under the FCA (ph), we don't have the authority to get penalties under data security but for accuracy, we do, and we have gotten those civil penalties. But I just want to emphasize the statutory standard, there is reasonable procedures for accuracy so it is not that every accuracy or every inaccuracy in a credit report will get a civil penalty. </p><p>      VAN HOLLEN:  Right, would it would it make sense to think of those applying more of the penalty when people get it wrong, in other words as I understand it right now, if you're a consumer whose been -- believes you have bad information that's negatively affecting your credit report, you go to this long process, right? You get on the phone, you may be put on hold, you do what you said, it may take a couple of years, at the end of the day what you the FTC determines is whether or not the consumer's complaint was correct, right? </p><p>      MITHAL:  So we look to see whether the company's procedures were reasonable. you just look at the reasonable. </p><p>      VAN HOLLEN:  You just look at the reasonable nature of that and if you find that they were unreasonable, what do you do to the company? </p><p>      MITHAL:  So we have gotten civil penalties against several companies sell so one was a couple years ago against the company we had about $2.6 million civil penalty, there is another check authorization company, we got about a $3.5 million civil penalty. So again it depends on the facts and circumstances and we look at several statutory factors in determining the appropriate penalty amount. </p><p>      VAN HOLLEN:  Right. Would it be worth looking at greater sort of deterrent mechanisms so that there's more of a burden on the CRAs to get it right in the first place and if so what kind of suggestions would you have? </p><p>      MITHAL:  So I certainly kind of sympathize with the goal of making it easier for consumers to dispute credit reporting accuracy and also to make the whole process easier for consumers and I think that is a goal worth exploring and I would be happy to work with your staff and others on the committee to accomplish that goal. </p><p>      VAN HOLLEN:  All right. </p><p>      TWOHIG:  So Senator, similarly, the Bureau can get penalties where there's been noncompliance with the FCRA's reasonable procedures provision, in fact brought a case against a consumer reporting agency and got, I believe about 5 million in penalties for their failure to comply with that part of the law. More generally, I think I also sympathize with the problems you're pointing out and that's exactly why we've used this new supervisory authority that has never existed before until the Bureau was created to prioritize looking at the national credit reporting agencies and other consumer reporting agencies for to ensure that they are looking at all aspects of accuracy. There is very different components -- various different components of really what it takes to get a quality data control system, there's the incoming information, there's compiling it and there's monitoring any indications of problems after the fact. </p><p>      We've broken it down and looked at various aspects and worked through our supervisory authority to require improvements in each part of those pieces of the system. </p><p>      VAN HOLLEN:  Good because I think until your -- let's say you're a CRA, until you have to suffer -- right now as the consumer goes to this complaint process and the CRA the end of the okay, they got to make them whole, right, we made a mistake two years ago that's affected your life but there's no other penalty to be applied unless they somehow have a system of that you determine has met this -- that it's been shaky at and even with those systems today, as we know, 5 percent error rate which affects tens of millions of people. </p><p>      So anyway, I look forward to working with the Chairman, Ranking Member, and all of you. Thanks. </p><p>      BROWN:  Thank you, Senator Van Hollen. </p><p>      My questions are for both of you, I have a couple of questions. A lot of people as we know work hard every day, sometimes people working multiple jobs to keep up with their bills, if they're injured, if they fall ill we don't have many, many, many companies in this country on any kind of leave policy, some don't have good health insurance so when people are injured or fall ill, huge unexpected medical costs could haunt their credit report for years. Given this type of debt is generally out of a person's control they obviously didn't choose this, should we not pause medical debt reporting at least until more Americans have access to affordable insurance? I will start with you. </p><p>      TWOHIG:  So Senator, I think it is correct that medical debt is different than other kinds of debt, it can cause special problems for consumers, they can be subject to medical debt collection when they are just waiting for reimbursement and so I think it is a different kind of debt than regular debt. </p><p>      BROWN:  That is? Okay. Go ahead. </p><p>      MITHAL:  I agree with that, and I think the S2155 with an excellent start in at least excluding certain medical debt for veterans and I think this is an idea worth exploring... </p><p>      BROWN:  It should be broader than that. </p><p>      MITHAL:  I think that's an idea worth exploring, yes. </p><p>      BROCKMAN:  I mentioned partially a follow-up to Senator Cortez Masto, I mentioned Mariner Finance in my opening statements, a company that sends cashable checks to people who might be in financial trouble but the check is as we know it, a high-cost loan. Industry claims these prescreened offers that are the -- they are allowed by their by the FCRA to help borrowers get a better deal and it looks like shady lenders fundamentally are taking advantage of a loophole to target struggling families. Wouldn't consumers be better off and less likely to face predatory lending practices if they had to opt into these offers and to opt in rather than having to take steps to opt out? Let's start with you. </p><p>      MITHAL:  Sure so I also read the article and I was very troubled by the practices, I can't speak on any particular company but the types of practices that are described in the article were very troubling. </p><p>      So under the FCRA, prescreened offers are permitted if they are a firm offer of credit and so that is something that the statute specifically allows if congress were to determine the change that, we went we would enforce that requirement as well so that is something that the law currently requires, but again, we would be ready to work with congress in any potential changes in that? </p><p>      BROWN:  Mr. Twohig. </p><p>      TWOHIG:  I would agree with that, consumers now have a right to opt out, but as you suggest, Senator, that's different than having to default the other way and we would be happy to work with you to consider whether there is a policy determination do you think would be better for consumers. </p><p>      BROWN:  That is mostly yes. </p><p>      TWOHIG:  We would be happy to work with you to consider the pros and cons of going that direction. </p><p>      BROWN:  That is quite a yes. </p><p>      TWOHIG:  Not quite a -- yes. </p><p>      BROWN:  Fair Credit Reporting Act protects companies who provide information to credit bureaus, consumers can't take them to court to get fixed as we know that. we've all heard the horror stories of someone trying to fix inaccurate data on a credit report. </p><p>      If consumers were allowed to have their day in court, would providers be more careful ensuring the data they report to credit bureaus is accurate, Ms. Twohig? </p><p>      TWOHIG:  So there is a private right of action under the Fair Credit Reporting Act and there are private actions filed by consumers if they believe that their information is inaccurate. So I just want to make sure I understand what you're... </p><p>      BROWN:  There is a private right of action but that private right of action has been, to put it mildly, diluted by this Congress, and by decisions made by government, correct? </p><p>      TWOHIG:  I can't speak to that, what I can say is that we are well aware at the Bureau of our obligation to ensure compliance with the law which is indeed why we prioritized supervising and enforcement in that area. </p><p>      BROWN:  I know you do and I appreciate that and I appreciate your service over the years, but don't providers, the credit providers fundamentally know there's not a particularly effective private right of action, do they not know that? </p><p>      TWOHIG:  I can't speak to what they... </p><p>      BROWN:  Well, yes, you can, they know the credit -- the credit providers know about forced arbitration, the credit providers know how the laws have changed, the credit providers know where the power in the society resides, it's not with consumers, it's not with employees, it's with employers, it's with credit reporting companies. You've had a string of really important jobs, you are obviously a really bright woman, you do recognize that, correct?</p><p>      TWOHIG:  I recognize that it can be hard for an individual consumer and that's actually why I spent my career in public service trying to do what I can do...</p><p>      BROWN:  I get all that and thank you again for that, but you you're not willing to say that the providers would be more careful ensuring the data they report to credit bureaus is accurate if the laws were written to give consumers more power in the marketplace? </p><p>      TWOHIG:  They probably would be more careful if the laws were written that way. </p><p>      BROWN:  Would you like to respond to that too? </p><p>      MITHAL:  I agree with that Ms. Twohig said. </p><p>      BROWN:  Which part, the part of... </p><p>      MITHAL:  The part that companies... </p><p>      (CROSSTALK) </p><p>      BROWN:  ...question that part? </p><p>      (CROSSTALK) </p><p>      MITHAL:  The part where companies would be more likely to shore up their practices if consumers had more power. </p><p>      BROWN:  I guess I don't know why a simple yes isn't clear there when credit providers know that the law is mostly the power of the law is mostly on their side and not of the consumer side, you know, (inaudible) the majesty, the law, it prohibits rich people as well as poor people from sleeping under bridges, yeah it does, well, that tells you a lot about where the power in society is and the power more and more is residing with those with more and more power and influence, in privilege, and consumers have less and less of that, it's just so clear to me that they are that the credit providers act worse because they -- because the law so often is on their side and the power resides in them. </p><p>      Senator Donnelly. </p><p>      DONNELLY:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman and thank you to the witnesses. On May 24th, the Economic Recovery Regulatory Relief And Consumer Protection Act was signed into law. I negotiated and wrote that legislation along with Chairman Crapo and several of my colleagues here. This new law includes important new consumer protection related to the credit bureaus to benefit servicemembers, veterans and all Americans. </p><p>      The law provides free credit freezes, credit monitoring for servicemembers and protections for veterans from VA billing delays. I like to highlight these consumer friendly provisions and receive feedback and updates from you on efforts to oversee the implementation and enforcement. </p><p>      The new law includes a provision to provide free credit monitoring for active duty service members. The FTC was provided one year to complete a rulemaking which will help shape the credit monitoring services provided. Ms. Mithal, I expect the FTC to complete its rulemaking as soon as possible so troops can start receiving this important service. What is the FTC's expected timeline for the rulemaking? </p><p>      MITHAL:  So Senator, I can assure you we are working as expeditiously as possible to complete the rulemaking and I'm hoping that we would have a notice of proposed rulemaking out by hopefully at least the fall. I don't have complete control over that but that's what I am committing to. </p><p>      DONNELLY:  Obviously, the sooner, the better. </p><p>      MITHAL:  Absolutely. </p><p>      DONNELLY:  Section 301 of the new law includes a section I authored with Senator Purdue to allow every American to freeze and unfreeze their credit free of charge and set year-long fraud alerts. Additionally the FTC in the major credit bureaus have to set up webpages where consumers can easily freeze their credit, set a fraud alert and opt out of prescreened credit offers. These provisions allow Americans to take control of their credit files. The law requires compliance by September 21. These provisions will make things easier for consumers. Can you please speak about the provisions generally and your expectation for the level of communication and collaboration that will occur between your agencies and the credit bureaus during implementation to ensure consumers benefit as was intended. </p><p>      If you can each respond. </p><p>      TWOHIG:  So I can assure you Senator, that the Bureau is going to work expeditiously to update to implement on what it needs to do in the --in implementing the Economic Growth And Regulatory Relief And Consumer Protection Act, that would include updating the summary of rights that goes to consumers so that they when they get their credit report, they have the information about these important protections available to them as well as educating consumers, we work collaboratively with the FTC and share information about that kind of information as well as of course, overseeing the compliance with these new provisions. </p><p>      DONNELLY:  Ms. Mithal? </p><p>      MITHAL:  And I would say, first of all, I think these are very important rights and they give important tools to consumers so thank you for your work on that. So our implementation, we have put out some guidance to consumers informing them of the new updates to the law that will take place in September, and we have already begun discussions with the CRAs about creating an online portal to effectuate all those tools for consumers and so we're hoping to be ready, but we will be ready by September when the law goes into effect. </p><p>      DONNELLY:  Okay, section 302, the new law is based off the protecting veterans credit act which I introduced with Senator Rounds to ensure veterans are not wrongly penalized by medical bill payment delays at the Department of Veterans Affairs. Many veterans have their credit scores damaged when the VA was late to pay medical bills. That won't be a problem any longer due to this new law. Your agencies again have oversight and enforcement authority. </p><p>      Can you speak as to how this provision will ensure that veterans are not wrongly penalized for medical debt that is actually the VA's responsibility. Miss Twohig? </p><p>      TWOHIG:  Senator, you can be sure that we will be looking for compliance with those important new provisions. </p><p>      DANIEL:  Ms. Mithal. </p><p>      MITHAL:  And again I think that that provisions write very important new rights for veterans, I think there have been recent studies showing that lack of predictiveness of medical debt and so I think it's a very important provision and we will do everything we can to support it. </p><p>      DONNELLY:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. </p><p>      BROWN:  Thank you, Senator Donnelly. And I ask unanimous consent to enter into the record a letter from several consumer advocacy groups, without objection, whatever, thank you. Thanks for being the last guy standing. </p><p>      DONNELLY:  Ready to help anytime. </p><p>      BROWN:  That concludes the question for today, the questions for the record are due from Senators in one week by Thursday, July 19, we ask the two of you to respond to those questions as quickly as possible this -- thank you for joining us, this concludes the hearing.</p><p>

The committee today will have will -- the committee hearing today is entitled An Overview of the Credit Bureaus and the Fair Credit Reporting Act. Credit bureaus play a valuable role in our financial system by helping financial institutions assess a consumer's ability to meet financial obligations and also facilitating access to beneficial financial products and services.   </p><p>      Given this role, they have a lot of valuable personal information on consumers and therefore are targets of cyberattacks. Last year, Equifax experienced an unprecedented cybersecurity incident which compromised the personal data of over 145 million people. Following that event, the banking committee held two oversight hearings on the breach and consumer data protection at credit bureaus. The first hearing with the former Equifax CEO examine details surrounding the breach, while the second hearing with outside experts examined what improvements might be made surrounding credit reporting agencies and data security.   </p><p>      This committee also recently held a hearing on cybersecurity and risks to the financial services industry. These hearings demonstrated bipartisan concern about the Equifax data breach and the protection of consumers personally identifiable information, as well as support for specific legislative measures to address such concerns. Some of these were addressed in Senate Bill 2155, the Economic Growth Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act, which included meaningful consumer protections for consumers who become victims of fraud.   </p><p>      For example, it provides consumers unlimited free credit freezes and unfreezes per year. It allows parents to turn on and off credit reporting for children under 18 and provides important protections for veterans and seniors. Last month, a New York Times article commenting on the bill noted that one helpful change will allow consumers to freeze their credit files at the three major credit reporting bureaus without charge. Consumers can also thaw their files temporarily or permanently without a fee.   </p><p>      Susan Grant, director of Consumer Protection and Privacy at the Consumer Federation of America expressed support for these measures calling them a good thing.   </p><p>      Paul Stevens, director of policy and advocacy of the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse similarly noted that the freeze provision has the potential to save consumers a lot of money. But there is still an opportunity to see whether more should be done and today's hearing will help inform this committee in that regard.   </p><p>      Today, I look forward to hearing about -- more from the witnesses about the scope of the Fair Credit Reporting Act and other relevant laws and regulations as they pertain to credit bureaus, the extent to which the Bureau of consumer financial protection and the FTC, whom the two witnesses represent today oversee credit Bureau data security and accuracy.   </p><p>      The current state of data security, data accuracy, data breach policy and the dispute resolution processes at the credit bureaus and what if any improvements could be made. States have begun to react in their own ways to various aspects of the public debate on privacy, data security, and the Equifax data breach.   </p><p>      Two weeks ago, California enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act which will take effect on January 20 -- January 1, 2020. The act which applies to certain organizations conducting business in California establishes a new privacy framework by creating new data privacy rights imposing special rules for the collection of minors consumer data and creating damages frameworks for violations and businesses failing to implement reasonable security procedures. Many members are interested in learning more about what California and other states are doing on this front.   </p><p>      Additionally, two weeks ago, eight state banking Commissioners jointly took action against Equifax in a consent order requiring the company to take various actions regarding risk assessment and information security.   </p><p>      I've long been concerned about data collection and data privacy protections by the government and the private sector. Given Americans' increased reliance on the use of technology where information can be shared by the swipe of a finger, we should be careful to ensure that companies and government entities who have such information use it responsibly and keep it safe. Senator Brown?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BROWN</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thanks very much to our witnesses. Thanks for holding this hearing today, I hope that my colleagues would excuse me and particularly welcome Ms. Twohig to our committee. She is from the consumer protection bureau, grew up in Fairview Park, a Westside suburb of Cleveland, she graduated from Ohio State, she worked for the Cleveland Foundation, the preeminent community foundation in the United States of America. She has a long career as a public servant with FTC, the Treasury Department, and was an early employee of this terrific agency, the Consumer Protection -- Financial Protection Bureau.   </p><p>      So thank you both to leave you out -- but thank you both for joining us. The consumer credit reporting system is stacked against Americans, a bad credit report can keep you on the job and can put you on a list you'll be targeted with expensive credit cards or high-cost loans, you are almost powerless to do anything about it.   </p><p>      Americans have basically no control over these reports, it can dictate their lives and their families plans for the future, they often don't know whether they're accurate or whether they're inaccurate. Six years ago I chaired a subcommittee hearing where consumer activists and some consumer advocates in the CFPB identified problems in the credit reporting industry, we've had several hearings in this committee over the last year on credit reporting companies and on data privacy.   </p><p>      In the meantime breach after breach has occurred. Last year as we know, 148 million Americans had their sensitive data stolen as hackers exploited a known security flaw that Equifax did not fix. Millions more been affected by breaches at banks like J.P. Morgan Chase, stores like Target, Whole Foods, even Trump Hotels.   </p><p>      Congressional efforts including provisions included in S2155 haven't done anything meaningful to address accuracy of credit reports to fix privacy concerns or to give consumers controls over their own personal data.   </p><p>      At the same time, big tech companies continually add more and more of our personal information to their digital warehouses, their financial and personal details about hundreds of millions of Americans, they see the potential for a big payday and selling that data to credit reporting companies.   </p><p>      These companies are amassing more and more of our data, but they still seem totally unprepared to deal with cyberattacks, they are building virtual -- shall we say silver platters for hackers. People want and deserve a lot more control over their personal information, credit reporting presents a unique problem because often Americans don't even know these corporations collect their data in the first place.   </p><p>      Right now consumers can't vote as my money and my colleagues like to say can't simply vote with their feet when a company doesn't treat them well, when a credit Bureau fails to protect their privacy, Congress passed the Fair Credit Reporting Act in the first place to rein in credit bureaus that originally function as unsupervised by agencies collecting personal information that we would be appalled to see in someone's credit report today. After scandals at Facebook, people are rightfully worried about big companies once again compiling and selling files a personal data on every American without her knowledge out of our control or our consent.   </p><p>      More Americans would be surprised at how lenders are putting this data to use. Last week the Washington Post ran a story about a company called Mariner Finance that uses a loop on the SCRA to look at people's credit records without their permission and then targets them with scams. Mariner sends checks for thousands of dollars to struggling families that can be cashed the day they are plucked from the mail but the checks are really just expensive loans waiting to trap the consumer who cashes them.   </p><p>      Now Mariner will tell you they are increasing access to credit, their terms, but that's exactly what we're told about subprime loans, some will say including a potentially, your boss at the CFPB, that the market will take care of that. Well, the market clearly hasn't. The fact is that Mariner is weaponizing people's credit history to target them with an expensive loan and making huge profits for the hedge fund that owns it.   </p><p>      Your credit report can be used to force you into court rightly or wrongly to settle debts but what if your credit card company or your cable provider erroneously reports a missed payment or default of the account?   </p><p>      They are protected, you can't take them to court at all and that's just absolutely outrageous. It turns out that's a big problem, CFPB paper found last year that credit reporting companies haven't been doing enough to ensure the information they get is accurate. They are protected and consumers aren't in part because of behavior of this United States Senate and because of a court Supreme Court that moves more and more to protect corporate interest.   </p><p>      What incentive do these companies have? The people they hurt won't be able to have their day in court. We have heard all of this before, the credit reporting system is backward like so much of our economy, it works for big corporations, it works for people with privilege, it doesn't work for regular Americans.   </p><p>      The Fair Credit Reporting Act is 50 years old the amount and type of information collected, they would've been unthinkable when it was created, it's time for a serious overhaul that puts Americans in control of their own data. I've introduced bills and saw many of my colleagues that would do just that. I hope the committee will not only listen to the advice we get today but will also take action to give people control over what should be their personal information.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CRAPO</emphasis>:  Thank you, Senator Brown.   </p><p>      And we will now move our witnesses and their testimony. First we will hear from Ms. Peggy Twohig who currently serves as the assistant director for supervision policy and the division of supervision enforcement and fair lending at the Bureau of Consumer financial protection. The office of supervision is responsible for developing strategy across bank and non-bank markets and ensuring that policy decisions are consistent across markets, charters, and regions.   </p><p>      After that we will hear from Ms. Maneesha Mithal, did I pronounce that right?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MITHAL</emphasis>:  Mithal.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CRAPO</emphasis>:  Mithal. All right. Ms. Maneesha Mithal who serves as the associate director for the division of privacy and identity protection in the Bureau of consumer protection at the Federal Trade Commission. In this capacity she supervises the work in the area of data security, identity theft, credit reporting and behavioral advertising and general privacy.   </p><p>      We appreciate both of you joining us today and we will proceed in the order that you were introduced. Ms Twohig.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TWOHIG</emphasis>:  Good morning, Chairman Crapo, Ranking Member Brown and thank you for that special introduction, I'm very proud of my Cleveland roots, and thank you for the opportunity to testify today about the work of the Bureau of consumer financial protection to address consumer protections in the credit reporting market.   </p><p>      My name is Peggy Twohig and I'm assistant director for subversion policy at the bureau. Credit reporting plays a critical role in consumer financial services and has enormous reach and impact. Over 200 million Americans have credit files with trade lines furnished voluntarily by over 10,000 providers. This information is used by creditors and other types of businesses to make decisions about individual transactions with consumers.   </p><p>      In particular, creditors rely on this information to decide whether to approve loans and what terms to offer. Accurate credit reporting is important to creditors and other businesses to make good business decisions. For an individual consumer, an accurate credit report can be even more important given the significant impact that information can have on that consumers ability to obtain financial and other products and services.   </p><p>      Because of the importance of accuracy to businesses and consumers? The structure of the fair credit reporting act creates interrelated legal standards and requirements to support the policy goal of accurate credit reporting. These requirements anticipate that all reports will not be perfect. Instead the FCRA requires that consumer reporting agencies or CRA's have a reasonable procedures to assure maximum possible accuracy of reports.   </p><p>      It also imposes certain accuracy obligations on furnishers of credit report information and the FCRA has a dispute and investigation framework with obligations on both CRA's and furnishers to ensure that potential errors are investigated and errors are corrected promptly.   </p><p>      The written testimony of the Bureau reviews the legal authority of the Bureau, to supervisor enforced and enforce the federal consumer financial laws applicable to CRAs.   </p><p>      I will focus here on the work the bureau has done exercising these authorities. In both its supervision and enforcement work, the bureau has focused on credit reporting accuracy and dispute handling by both CRAs and furnishers.   </p><p>      As discussed in a special edition of supervisory highlights published last year, the Bureau of supervisory work has prioritized reviews of key elements underpinning accuracy. As a result of these reviews, the bureau directed specific improvements in data accuracy and dispute resolution at one or more CRA including improving oversight of incoming data from the furnishers, instituting quality-control programs of compiled Consumer Reports. Monitoring furnisher dispute metrics to identify and correct root causes. Improved investigations of consumer disputes including a review of relevant information provided by consumers, and improving communication to consumers of dispute results.   </p><p>      In supervising bank and non-bank furnishers, the bureau has found furnishers that were not complying with their FCRA obligations and directed them to comply including developing reasonable written policies and procedures regarding the accuracy of the information they furnish, taking corrective action when they furnish information they determine to be inaccurate, and bringing their dispute handling practices into compliance.   </p><p>      The Bureau has also brought enforcement actions and entered into a number of settlements related to violations of the FCRA's accuracy and dispute investigation requirements.   </p><p>      Turning to data security, CRAs hold a tremendous amount of sensitive information about consumers. If CRAs do not protect this data, it may lead to data breaches creating the risk of substantial harm to consumers including the risk of identity theft. Since the Equifax breach, the Bureau has increased its attention to data security issues in our supervisory and enforcement work.   </p><p>      The Bureau has the authority to conduct data security investigations and to conduct examinations at certain non-banks including larger CRAs. This authority includes assessing the facts and circumstances to determine whether a CRAs data security practices constitute violations of federal consumer financial law including the prohibition against unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts and practices, or the FCRA.   </p><p>      Our supervisory enforcement and consumer education efforts will continue in this important area. Consumers should have confidence in their credit report that their credit reports are secure and comply with all applicable legal requirements. Thank you again for the opportunity to testify today at this important hearing, and we would be happy to answer your questions about the Bureau's work-related credit reporting.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CRAPO</emphasis>:  Thank you very much. Ms. Mithal.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MITHAL</emphasis>:  Thank you. Chairman Crapo, Ranking Member Brown and members of the committee. My name is Maneesha Mithal and I'm the associate director at the Division of Privacy and Identity Protection at the Federal Trade Commission. I appreciate the opportunity to appear before you today to discuss the fair credit reporting act, credit bureaus, and data security.   </p><p>      As you know, the FCRA is intended help consumers in three-way. First, it helps consumers prevent and misuse of sensitive consumer report information by limiting recipients to those who have a legitimate need for it. Second, it works to improve the accuracy and integrity of the consumer reporting system. And third, it promotes the efficiency of the nation's banking and consumer credit systems.   </p><p>      Now the commission has played a key role in the implementation enforcement and interpretation of the FCRA since its enactment. Let me mention three key examples.   </p><p>      First, in 2012, the commission published a study of credit report accuracy. According to the study findings, one in four consumers identified errors on their credit reports that might affect their credit scores. Four out of five consumers who filed disputes experienced some modification to their credit report, and 5 percent of consumers experienced a change in their credit score that could impact their credit risk classification.   </p><p>      The second activity that the FTC engages in is enforcement. Enforcement continues to be a top priority for the commission. Since 2011, the Bureau has been examining the nationwide credit bureaus. As a result, the FTC has focused its FCRA law enforcement efforts on other entities in the credit reporting area and other aspects of the consumer reporting industry more broadly.   </p><p>      One example is enforcing a law against furnishers that aren't supervised by the Bureau. The FTC has settled cases against data furnishers that allegedly had inadequate policies and procedures for reporting accurate information to CRAs.   </p><p>      Another example is employment background screening CRAs. For instance, in the InfoTrack case, the commission alleged that a background screening CRA failed to have reasonable procedures to ensure maximum possible accuracy of the consumer reports it provided, and as a result, it provided inaccurate information suggesting that job applicant may have been registered sex offenders when they were in fact, not.   </p><p>      Third, the commission continues to educate consumers and businesses on their consumer reporting rights and obligations under the FCRA. One example is their publication, credit, and your consumer rights which provides an overview of credit for consumers, explains consumers legal rights, and offers practical tips to help solve credit problems.   </p><p>      Now, let me close by mentioning the importance of credit bureaus maintaining reasonable security of the consumer information that is entrusted to them. Since 2001, the commission has undertaken substantial efforts to promote data security in this and other sectors.   </p><p>      We enforced several laws requiring companies to maintain reasonable security including the FTC act, the Gramm Leach Bliley safeguards rule, and certain provisions of the FCRA. The commission has brought over 60 law enforcement actions against companies that allegedly engaged in unreasonable data security practices.   </p><p>      Last year the commission took the unusual step of publicly confirming its investigation into the Equifax data breach due to scale of the public interest in the matter. And although we aggressively enforced our data security laws, I believe there are some gaps in our authority.   </p><p>      For example we cannot seek civil penalties for violations of most data security laws. To fill in these gaps, the commission has supported federal data security legislation on a bipartisan basis for over a decade. My written testimony discusses these issues in further detail and I'm happy to answer any questions you might have.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CRAPO</emphasis>:  Thank you Ms. Mithal. And my first question is for you, this is primarily just sort of the housekeeping item but as I indicated in my opening statement, the economic growth regulatory relief and consumer protection act has some significant provisions in it in this arena in terms of protecting the consumers with the ability to place security freezes on their credit files with the credit bureaus.   </p><p>      This provision will empower consumers to protect their credit in the event of future data breaches or incidents of identity theft, I'm just seeking your commitment that you and the FTC will move expeditiously to implement these credit bureau provisions in Senate Bill 2155.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MITHAL</emphasis>:  Absolutely, you have our commitment to expeditiously and we have already begun, we issued a consumer blog post and we began our rulemaking process. So thank you.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CRAPO</emphasis>:  Thank you. And Ms. Twohig, credit bureaus, well let me put it this way, I have long been concerned about the ever increasing amounts of big data that are being collected both in the private sector and in the public sector by the government.   </p><p>      And as you know, one of the agencies that I've been worried about is the consumer financial protection bureau. Are credit bureaus required to provide data to the bureau?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TWOHIG</emphasis>:  Mr. Senator, thank you for that question. In our supervisory work, they are required to respond to our requests when we are conducting an examination and the requests that we make of the credit bureaus are similar to the request we make of other financial service providers that we oversee through our examination authority.   </p><p>      So that would be we request information such as how they are complying with the law and their compliance management systems, so for example their board and management oversight, their policies and procedures, they are monitoring their training on what audits they're doing so all the elements that go into compliance management system we asked for that general information and then more specifically, we asked for more specific information when were determining particular compliance with particular provisions of the law.   </p><p>      So for example we may need specific information about consumer files when we're doing transaction testings to ensure for example that they were complying with the law in following up on a consumers dispute?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CRAPO</emphasis>:  And my understanding is that the agency is seeking to collect specific credit card transactional data on hundreds of millions of the accounts, is that not correct?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MITHAL</emphasis>:  My understanding, senator, is that a separate part of the Bureau, it's research arm, collects in a credit panel the identified information on consumers for research purposes.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CRAPO</emphasis>:  But you're not in a position to describe exactly what they are collecting?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MITHAL</emphasis>:  Correct, we need to follow up with you and get you the details on that.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CRAPO</emphasis>:  All right. Do you know -- well, let me go back again to the information that you are familiar with. Is the data that you are requiring provided by mandate or is it purchased?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MITHAL</emphasis>:  So on their -- the area that I work in, supervision, the legal requirement under Dodd Frank is that they are required to respond to supervisory request for the information we need to...   </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CRAPO</emphasis>:  All right. And are there other private sector entities that are required to provide that in addition to the credit bureaus, and what are they? For example credit card companies, banks, others?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TWOHIG</emphasis>:  So there's various provisions of different kinds of law that do require reporting to the Bureau. I believe for example under the Card Act, credit card issuers are required to provide their agreements that the bureau posts on the website, I'm not familiar sitting here right now with all the different provisions that might require reporting to the Bureau but there's a number of different requirements that would come into play.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CRAPO</emphasis>:  All right, I appreciate that and just quickly, I only got about a minute left so if you can just give me about a 30-second answer sort of a high-level answer as to what have we learned from the Equifax data breach about what we need to do from here.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TWOHIG</emphasis>:  So Senator, I can tell you that even though the bureau's investigations are not public, in this instance, it is a matter of public record that the bureau is investigating Equifax, we are coordinating with the FTC on that investigation so that's in process. So I think it's premature to really answer that question.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CRAPO</emphasis>:  All right. Ms Mithal?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MITHAL</emphasis>:  So like Ms Twohig, I can't comment on the specifics, but what I can say is two things. One is that credit, we learned that credit bureaus do hold the most sensitive information about consumers available in the marketplace and it is incumbent on these credit bureaus to protect that information.   </p><p>      And second, I think that in terms of the big data breaches, I think the FTC could use more authority to seek civil penalties against companies that don't -- that violates the laws that we enforce.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CRAPO</emphasis>:  All right, thank you.   </p><p>      And Senator Brown has indicated that he wants to yield his first slot to Senator Schatz, so Senator Schatz, please go ahead.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCHATZ</emphasis>:  Thank you, Chairman, and thank you to the Ranking Member Brown, and I promise I won't make a habit out of this. I appreciate it very much, thank you very much for your testimony.   </p><p>      Ms. Twohig, I wanted to follow up on something that Ms Mithal described, there was an FTC report that found that 5 percent of credit reports contain confirmed material errors.   </p><p>      So these are confirmed material errors that there are more errors than that, but even if it's just 5 percent, that is the bare minimum of confirmed material errors, you are talking about 10 million people and worse than that, two years later, 84 percent of those errors remain on the credit reports.   </p><p>      Can you tell me a little bit about what your supervisory work is entailing and what you found as it relates to the accuracy and dispute resolution?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TWOHIG</emphasis>:  Thank you for that question, Senator. I'd be happy to talk about that.   </p><p>      As I said, because of the concerns about credit report accuracy, the Bureau did its first rule to identify what larger participants in the marketplace was going to establish a non-bank supervision program for that wasn't already in the statute with respect to credit bureaus, consumer reporting agencies, because of the priority that the Bureau gave to look into that market and to be able to apply first ever supervisory authority on that industry.   </p><p>      So they had never been before the Bureau, been examined by any federal or state regulator. And we prioritize that and we have been conducting that work and so we've been very focused on looking at their compliance with the accuracy in the dispute resolution provisions of the FCRA.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCHATZ</emphasis>:  And what have you found?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TWOHIG</emphasis>:  And we found that in general, as a big picture matter, supervision is an attempt to get companies to have a preventive -- to prevent law violations, to have a proactive approach to compliance to make sure that they had their compliance house in order so that violations don't occur in the first place.   </p><p>      We think we've made progress in shifting their attitude and culture toward more of a proactive compliance posture, but we have found problems with their compliance with the law and we have given them directives to improve where we found they have fallen short and we have seen improvements over time. But that's not to say there isn't more work to do, Senator.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCHATZ</emphasis>:  Thank you. Ms. Mithal, Senator Kennedy and I have a bill that would give consumers more tools to manage their credit reports and I think it's really important for this committee especially for Republicans on this committee to recognize that we all know that we can't blow up the system, that although there are consumer problems related to these credit bureaus, we still need some measure of credit worthiness and were not intending to be so disruptive as to create problems in lending.   </p><p>      But there are some basic things that we can do to empower consumers and I want to make sure that they're not customers, they have not enlisted, people, generally speaking, do not sign up with these credit bureaus, but they are consumers. And our bill tries to empower consumers to for instance know what the credit bureaus know, to be able to see those same lines and to have an online portal that is not so labyrinthed in that allows a person to resolve any dispute in a straightforward manner.   </p><p>      Is it fair to say, Ms. Mithal, that you support the goals of this legislation?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MITHAL</emphasis>:  Absolutely. I think credit report accuracy -- inaccuracy issues continue to harm those consumers that are affected by it, not only is it that on the lack of credit in the future, it's the time and expense it takes to clear up their credit reports so I think the tool you're aiming to provide consumers through your bill, those are the types of tools that are absolutely worth considering.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCHATZ</emphasis>:  Can you talk a little bit about the importance of an online portal?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MITHAL</emphasis>:  Sure, so I think one of the problems for consumers is that it's very difficult to know how to navigate the credit reporting system. And so I think the easier we can make it for consumers the more tools we could provide for them, the more one-stop shop we can provide for them, I think that's very consistent with as you said, the kind of free flow of credit information through this.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCHATZ</emphasis>:  One final question which I think I will take for the record for both of you, it's sort of twofold. First, we should draw a distinction between breaches which create credit score problems and credit inaccuracies and the endemic problem of these credit bureaus basically getting it wrong anywhere from 5 percent to 15 percent of the time but at least 5 percent of the time in a material way.   </p><p>      So although the Equifax breach caused us to think about these bureaus and focus on that question, this is not a cybersecurity question exclusively, it's also a basic consumer rights question so my question for the record is what specifically are the pain points for consumers as they go about trying to resolve these questions and I've run out of time and I appreciate indulgence of the chair and the ranking member.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CRAPO</emphasis>:  Thank you. Senator Scott?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCOTT</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman and thank you to the witnesses for being here today. I've worked for the last six or seven years on something called the opportunity agenda, trying to find a way to empower those folks living in distressed communities as you probably both know, we have about 50 million Americans today who live in those distressed communities and as I think about ways to empower those folks living in distressed communities, the access to credit issue jumps out very clearly.   </p><p>      The BCFP has found that 26 million Americans are credit invisible, another 19 million Americans are unscorable because their information is either insufficient and/or just too old. It should come as no surprise that there is a strong correlation between your income and whether you have a credit score or credit record.   </p><p>      Almost 30 percent of Americans living in low income areas are credit invisible, an additional 15 percent of Americans living in those areas are unscorable. In South Carolina when you combine those two numbers together, that means about one -- nearly one out of every four South Carolina adults are in that category.   </p><p>      A solution to bring credit invisibles out of the shadows is S3040, the Credit Access and Inclusion Act.   </p><p>      Credit invisible's regularly make payments for their rent, gas, water, electricity, and cell phones. New credit scoring models recognize these payments are payments that are predictive of your actual credit risk. Unfortunately the FCRA ensures that missed payments and collection are reported to the credit bureaus but not necessarily the ones you make on time.   </p><p>      The Brookings Institution states that the consideration of this payment data will lead to a 21 percent increase to prime credit for those earning less than $20,000 a year and a 15 percent increase to prime credit for those earning between $20,000 and $30,000 a year, that will make a huge difference for credit worthy folks trying to climb the economic ladder, and my bill helps us get there.   </p><p>      Ms. Twohig, what is the impact on the consumer of being credit invisible when it comes to interest rates, applying for job or finding an apartment?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TWOHIG</emphasis>:  Senator, first of all, I want to say that the Bureau shares your concern about access to credit, in fact, one of the Bureau's strategic goals is to ensure that all consumers have access to consumer financial services.   </p><p>      With respect to the particular impact, the particular impact will vary for each consumer and what they're applying for and what they're trying to do in the particular credit or other markets, but I think it is fair to say that if the consumer does not have credit filed with one of the national credit reporting companies or if it doesn't have enough in that file to score, then that consumer is basically shut out of the mainstream credit markets.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCOTT</emphasis>:  Well, that kind of relates to my second question, the BCFP has suggested that more of this information at the credit bureaus will help credit invisibles access mainstream credit sources, sounds like you would concur that that would be accurate.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TWOHIG</emphasis>:  So alternative data of the type you're discussing is also something that the Bureau is interested in learning more about and is monitoring. In fact, the Bureau issued last year a request for information from the public to get information about different kinds of alternative data and the aspects of that alternative data and how it could help consumers and access to credit. We received over 100 comments, we're currently monitoring that information and studying that information and learning more about it, but I think also it's fair to say that if that information is accurate and predictive, then that could be part of the solution to increase access to credit.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCOTT</emphasis>:  Thank you. I will just say to my Chairman and the Ranking Member who I know both have a passion for finding ways of bringing those folks who are today credit invisible out of the shadows and into a place where they can rely on a strong credit score to be able to have lower interest rates, greater access to better jobs, and certainly be able to find places to live in higher quality communities and all that is anchored in how your credit score and not being credit invisible.   </p><p>      So hopefully, S3040 will be on the top of the docket both of you. Thank you both.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CRAPO</emphasis>:  Thank you, Senator Scott.   </p><p>      Senator Menendez.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MENENDEZ</emphasis>:  Thank you.   </p><p>      Ms. Twohig and Ms. Mithal, let me start off by asking you each to give me the last four digits of your Social Security number?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TWOHIG</emphasis>:  Senator, I really don't want to do that in a public forum.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MITHAL</emphasis>:  I have the same reaction.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MENENDEZ</emphasis>:  All right, how about telling me which stores you opened the credit cards with?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TWOHIG</emphasis>:  Which stores?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MENENDEZ</emphasis>:  Yes.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TWOHIG</emphasis>:  I don't think I have opened any credit card with a store lately.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MITHAL</emphasis>:  That is not something I would be willing to share in a public forum.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MENENDEZ</emphasis>:  Or maybe can you tell us the outstanding balance in your home mortgage loans?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TWOHIG</emphasis>:  Senator, I'd prefer not to say that kind of information either.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MITHAL</emphasis>:  The same.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MENENDEZ</emphasis>:  I'm not surprised but that information which I'm sure you would want to be shared or sold without your permission, and yet under current law, consumer reporting agencies like Equifax can share and sell your information, where you live, where you pay your bills and whether you pay it on time, what you filed for, whether you filed for bankruptcy without ever having to get your consent. Isn't that right?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TWOHIG</emphasis>:  That is correct, although there are certain limitations on how they can use the data.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MENENDEZ</emphasis>:  Now, America consumers are at the mercy of three mega companies who control the security and safety of their personal information, that makes no sense, consumers should have the ability to control when how and to whom their data is shared just like you want to control it here in this public forum.   </p><p>      Last year, a massive Equifax data breach laid bare the systemic problems with the credit reporting industry. Its failure to guard sensitive data left 145.5 million Americans exposed to identity theft and fraud. Ms. Mithal, Equifax waited an inexplicable six weeks to disclose the breach that had occurred, worse over months after the breach millions of consumers were still unaware of the breach in part because there's no national requirement to alert consumers.   </p><p>      My bill, S2188 the Consumer Data Protection Act would require consumer reporting agency to quickly notify the Federal Trade Commission, the CFPB law enforcement and consumers of a breach while keeping intact existing strong state consumer protection laws. Generally speaking, does the FTC support the idea of requiring companies to provide notification to consumers where there is a data security breach?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MITHAL</emphasis>:  Absolutely, and the commission has done so for almost a for over a decade and a bipartisan basis.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MENENDEZ</emphasis>:  Now let me ask you another issue we need to address here is the ability to hold consumer reporting agencies accountable when there is a breach, when they have failed, clearly failed to protect consumers personal data, my legislation also provides FTC the authority to pursue fines against a consumer reporting agency such as Equifax that negligently, knowingly, or willingly causes a data breach. In your view, would the institution of a monetary penalty framework, incentivize consumer reporting agencies to better secure consumer data?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MITHAL</emphasis>:  Yes.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MENENDEZ</emphasis>:  Let me ask another question for both witnesses, given the unique and varied nature of consumer harm that results from a data breach at a consumer reporting agency which includes everything from identity theft to difficulty purchasing a home or securing employment, would it be helpful to have a comprehensive study analyzing both the immediate and long-term costs and damages to individuals affected by data breaches at consumer reporting agencies?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MITHAL</emphasis>:  So I think that there's no question that there's tremendous harm to consumers from data breaches of their sensitive information I think it would be worth considering a study to quantify that harm.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MENENDEZ</emphasis>:  Ms. Twohig?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TWOHIG</emphasis>:  I would agree with Ms. Mithal and to the extent the Bureau can be helpful providing technical expertise in analyzing that topic, we would be happy to do so.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MENENDEZ</emphasis>:  Well, thank you. I really didn't want to know your social security number or your balances on your mortgage which I hope is virtually nil, but this is the very essence of what we're talking about as we deal with this issue here today.   </p><p>      Thank you, Mr. Chairman.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CRAPO</emphasis>:  Senator Kennedy.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KENNEDY</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Ms. Mithal, can we agree that the work of the CRAs facilitates commerce in America?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MITHAL</emphasis>:  Absolutely.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KENNEDY</emphasis>:  Do you agree with that to, Ms. Twohig?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TWOHIG</emphasis>:  Yes.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KENNEDY</emphasis>:  And I think we can also agree can we not that that's a good thing...   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MITHAL</emphasis>:  Yes.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KENNEDY</emphasis>:  In our free enterprise system?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MITHAL</emphasis>:  Yes.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KENNEDY</emphasis>:  When the CRA's gather information about me, do they ask my permission?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TWOHIG</emphasis>:  No.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MITHAL</emphasis>:  No.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KENNEDY</emphasis>:  Do they pay me the information?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TWOHIG</emphasis>:  No.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MITHAL</emphasis>:  No.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KENNEDY</emphasis>:  They gather this information and they assign me a score basically make an evaluation, a judgment about me whether I'm credit worthy person or not. Is that correct?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MITHAL</emphasis>:  Correct.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KENNEDY</emphasis>:  And in 5 percent to 10 percent of the cases they get it wrong, they have some bad data, is that correct?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MITHAL</emphasis>:  Yes.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KENNEDY</emphasis>:  If they have bad data and I call them up and say hey you got bad data on me, you didn't talk to me first, I could have fixed this upfront but you didn't talk to me but you got some bad data on it on me and it's affecting my life and my family's life. And the credit, the CRA says okay will get back to you and they never get back to me or they get back to me and say we disagree. What is my recourse?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MITHAL</emphasis>:  So under the FCRA, there's a dispute process where the credit reporting agency is required to respond within a particular amount of time and on the let the end of the day when the credit bureau says that no, you in fact, owe this debt, the consumer owes the debt.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TWOHIG</emphasis>:  That is right, the consumer can put a statement on their credit report if they are not satisfied with the results, the dispute...   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KENNEDY</emphasis>:  How long does that take?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MITHAL</emphasis>:  I believe under the FCRA, the investigation process is 30 to 45 days.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TWOHIG</emphasis>:  That is right.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KENNEDY</emphasis>:  I have to fill out a bunch of forms, do I?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TWOHIG</emphasis>:  Yes.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KENNEDY</emphasis>:  Okay, how long do you think it takes to fill out all those forms and make the phone calls and say, hey, you got my information wrong?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TWOHIG</emphasis>:  So I think there is certainly some time it takes on the part of the consumer to kind of understand the dispute process, to go through the dispute process and implement it.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KENNEDY</emphasis>:  And if I got a day job I can't do that at work, right?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TWOHIG</emphasis>:  Yes, it's certainly a lot of time to expense to dispute...   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KENNEDY</emphasis>:  Can I do it at night or weekend, can I call them up on the weekends? Do the CRA work in the weekend, do you know?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TWOHIG</emphasis>:  I believe to have an online portal that you can file a dispute online and submit documents now, you can submit, the consumers can submit documents in support of their dispute online.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KENNEDY</emphasis>:  Okay, and let's suppose at the end of the process, they come back to me and they say no, we're not changing anything or I know this doesn't happen very often but you get somebody having a bad day and they say, we are not changing anything and by the way we don't care, because we don't have to, you are not my cousin.   </p><p>      What would I do?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TWOHIG</emphasis>:  So, I think, speaking for the...   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KENNEDY</emphasis>:  Do I file a complaint with the FTC?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TWOHIG</emphasis>:  Sure, you can file a complaint with the FTC?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KENNEDY</emphasis>:  Do I need a lawyer?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TWOHIG</emphasis>:  No, you don't need a lawyer?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KENNEDY</emphasis>:  Does it take time, you got a fair -- I bet it's not a one page form, is it?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TWOHIG</emphasis>:  Yes, it takes time.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KENNEDY</emphasis>:  It's not a one-page form, is it?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TWOHIG</emphasis>:  It's multiple pages.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KENNEDY</emphasis>:  And how quickly would the FTC act?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TWOHIG</emphasis>:  It would take a while.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KENNEDY</emphasis>:  Like how long is a while?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TWOHIG</emphasis>:  It could take -- so let me just clarify, we don't act on behalf of individual consumers...   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KENNEDY</emphasis>:  I understand, how long would it take.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TWOHIG</emphasis>:  It would take several months to investigate probably...   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KENNEDY</emphasis>:  It could take a year, doesn't it? It could take two years sometimes, doesn't it?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TWOHIG</emphasis>:  Sure.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KENNEDY</emphasis>:  In the meantime, they got bad data about me.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TWOHIG</emphasis>:  Yes.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KENNEDY</emphasis>:  And they didn't pay me for it, they didn't even ask me.   </p><p>      Now, I think CRAs perform an important service and do facilitate commerce but it seems to me that we ought to be smart enough particularly with technology to come up with the system that says, we are going to make it as easy as possible for the people with respect to whom the CRAs have bad information. So they can -- those people can get it fixed and they can get it fixed quickly and I can get it fixed efficiently and they can get it fixed inexpensively and they can get it fixed so they don't have to miss the kids' ballgames.   </p><p>      Now, I'm like Senator Schatz, and I have a bill that will do that, what is wrong with that bill?   </p><p>      I think it's a good bill, don't you?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MITHAL</emphasis>:  I do think it's a good bill and I would support the goals of the legislation which is to, as you articulated, to make it a lot easier for consumers to file disputes of consumer reporting agencies.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KENNEDY</emphasis>:  Ms Twohig?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TWOHIG</emphasis>:  Senator, I would say that all the issues you just pointed out are the reason why we prioritized at the bureau, supervising both the CRAs and furnishers...   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KENNEDY</emphasis>:  Yes, ma'am, I know you are prioritizing, I'm not fuzzing at you, but you are still part of the bureaucracy, and it's pretty intimidating for the average American who didn't ask to be brought into this system, it's a good system, but it's pretty intimidating when the CRAs get it wrong.   </p><p>      And we ought to make it as easy as possible for them to get it fixed. That is good for them, that is good for the companies, that is good for the free enterprise system, and I think we can do better.   </p><p>      Thank you, Mr. Chairman.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CRAPO</emphasis>:  Thank you. Senator Warner?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARNER</emphasis>:  Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman.   </p><p>      First of all, thank you for holding this hearing, I think you're hearing bipartisan concern and I want to thank the ranking member for also yielding to us. I also want to point out though that Ms. Twohig and Ms. Mithal are longtime professionals, I think they would lean in to being willing to try to help us fix this problem, but they can't fix this problem on their own without Congress acting.   </p><p>      So I want to reiterate what I think a lot of members have made -- I had to choice in Equifax having my data, Senator Menendez raised this, Senator Kennedy has, Senator Schatz has, to me as a former business guy, it is remarkable that a data breach based upon sloppy cybersecurity standards that took place over year ago, the public wasn't notified until 11 months ago that we still, and this is not your fault at this point, if Congress hasn't acted, if they had paid no penalty, (inaudible) took a little hit in the market, but they have almost recovered back because they don't expect Congress to do its job to give the FTC the ability to put a civil penalty process in place.   </p><p>      Now Senator Warren and I have a very comprehensive bill that I'm sure she will speak to as well that would put a liability regime in place that would particularly in the event of negligent behavior, put a real incentive to make sure that credit reporting agencies up their game and let me, just again for the record, Ms. Mithal, the FTC at this point does not have the ability to put any civil penalty on a CRA based on performance, do they?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MITHAL</emphasis>:  Not on the basis of data security violations generally, no.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARNER</emphasis>:  So unless the Congress acts, whether it's Senator Warren's bill, Senator Menendez' bill, Senator Kennedy's bill, Schatz' bill, you don't have the tool, as a matter of fact, if we go and look at the so called safeguards rule that we've heard from Ms. Twohig's testimony that CFPB does not have authority under the safeguards rule to examine or look at the practices of the CRA, Ms. Mithal, does the FTC have the authority under the safeguards rule to examine credit reporting agencies to ensure that rule is being followed?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MITHAL</emphasis>:  So just to be clear, we don't have examination authority, but we can investigates CRA to make sure that they are following language (ph) by safeguard rules, but significantly as you pointed out, we do not have the authority to seek civil penalties under the safeguards rule.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARNER</emphasis>:  Right, and if memory serves, I'm sure Senator Kennedy remembers as well, FTC indicated they had opened an investigation into the Equifax breach but here we are over a year after the breach took place and at 11 months after the public was finally notified yet we still don't have a result in even if you come up with a result you don't have the ability to impose penalties because you have no liability regime in place.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MITHAL</emphasis>:  Not under data security, yes.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARNER</emphasis>:  Mr. Chairman, I think this is an area because I can assure you that sitting from the intel side, this is a problem that is not going to go away, this is a problem that is going to only exponentially increase and Senator Menendez went down the path of would you be willing to offer your personal information, you wouldn't, but if somebody has hacked in and got that information from Equifax and contacts you with that personalized information and you combine that with the next realm of misinformation, disinformation and you suddenly have a live stream video of what appears to be the face of somebody you recognize popping up on your social media account asking you to do something, either invest in some company vote for some candidate, you put those two together and you have a potential crisis that goes well beyond just financial concerns.   </p><p>      And if we don't act, I think we are going to be irresponsible in ensuring that kind of activity doesn't take place and because they -- I agree with Senator Kennedy, the incentives are not there at all for any CRA to clean up its act.   </p><p>      There are no civil penalties, there's no liability regime, and I think we can do better and I think these professionals actually would want us to do better if we would give them the tools. And let me just in my last 30 seconds though, Senator Scott raised this question about some of the folks who were on bank (ph), I am concerned as well as we think through -- Ms. Mithal, this is for you, you know, as we start looking at the use of artificial intelligence, machine learning, there is going to be a lot of tools used particularly by non-bank financial institutions who may provide credit lending, how we make sure that we ensure fairness in this new regime.   </p><p>      But at this moment in time, it's again I don't believe the FTC has the appropriate ability to look at non-bank financial institution whose using AI techniques to grant a loan under (FICRA), is that correct?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MITHAL</emphasis>:  So we did do report on this issue a few years ago and we did mention that there are certain circumstances when companies use AI technology to make decisions about credit or housing employment eligibility that we would have authority to take action under the FCRA, but that is against a limited set of entities that are third party using the information. So there's some gaps there.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARNER</emphasis>:  And I would only say, Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member, that if we think what's happened with Equifax was something, wait until you see the non-bank financial start to use AI in the sophisticated way and if we don't get ahead of this in terms of -- we ought to be able to use the data and good information but if we don't put some rules in place, the Equifax breach will pale in comparison to what the next generation of the attacks will look like.   </p><p>      Thank you, Mr. Chairman.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CRAPO</emphasis>:  I share your concern, Senator Warner.   </p><p>      Senator Warren.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  Thank you very much Mr. Chairman, thanks for holding this hearing, thank you Ranking Member Brown for letting us go ahead of you here. You know, I'm going to pick up on the same theme that my colleagues have been talking about. After Equifax disclosed its massive data breach last year, I sent letters to Equifax and the other large credit bureaus and federal regulators seeking information about the breach and the options for holding Equifax accountable.   </p><p>      My staff compiled that information in an investigative report that my office issued in February and I'd like to submit a copy of that report for the record, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Chairman? Without objection.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CRAPO</emphasis>:  Without objection.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CRAPO</emphasis>:  What did I just agree to?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  We are done.   </p><p>      So we put this report together, one of the key findings of this report is that federal agencies don't have the legal tools they need to stop data breaches at credit bureaus and hold credit bureaus accountable for compromising sensitive personal information.   </p><p>      As Senator Warner was just pointing, out the FTC has some authority to oversee data security at credit bureaus but it currently has no authority to seek civil penalties against the bureaus for compromising consumer information. So let me just ask Ms. Mithal, do you think the FTC should have that authority?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MITHAL</emphasis>:  Yes.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  Good. Thank you.   </p><p>      In fact the response the FTC sent to my letter specifically requested legislation that would \"allow the FTC to seek civil penalties to help ensure effective deterrence of cyber security breaches\" so asking for it. Meanwhile CFPB has some supervisory authority over large credit bureaus but limited ability to issue rules on how the bureaus must safeguard sensitive consumer data. Is that right, Ms. Twohig?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TWOHIG</emphasis>:  That is correct.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  Good. In other words, even if CFPB spots serious cyber security problems at the credit bureaus it supervises, it cannot issue new rules to try to address these problems, is that right?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TWOHIG</emphasis>:  So we do not have the authority under the safeguards provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act or the safeguards rule.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  Okay so in response to my letter to the CFPB, then Director Cordray said that the agency supported new legislation because \"federal laws that are applicable to data security have not kept pace with technological and cyber security developments\" in other words, we want the authority to do this.   </p><p>      So after receiving these responses, Senator Warner and I spent months working with each other and with experts in the field to develop the data breach prevention and compensation act, our bill would authorize the FTC to impose large and automatic penalties on any large credit bureau that allowed sensitive consumer information to be accessed.   </p><p>      The way we see it, if credit bureaus collect our personal information without our permission, then they should have an absolute obligation to protect data from hackers and thieves. The bill would also create a new office of cyber security at the FTC with responsibility to establish cyber security standards at credit bureaus and supervise compliance with those standards.   </p><p>      Ms. Mithal, do you think the FTC would be better equipped to oversee how credit bureaus protect sensitive information if Senator Warner's and my bill became law?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MITHAL</emphasis>:  So I certainly I do think we had the expertise, I think it's a question of resources and so your law comes with resources, that would be welcome.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  Good, fair enough. Fair enough.   </p><p>      But you got to have the authority you can't do anything.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MITHAL</emphasis>:  Correct.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  So, thank you. Mr. Chairman, I know that you and many of your Republican colleagues on his committee are concerned about the lack of adequate protection of consumer data at credit bureaus and I hope you'll work with Senator Warner and with me to push this legislation forward.   </p><p>      Our federal agencies have made it absolutely clear that they need more legal authority to protect consumers, we can't just cross our fingers and hope that another breach doesn't happen because another breach will happen and if we fail to act, then we bear some responsibility for that.   </p><p>      More of our constituents will be harmed unless Congress acts so I urge you to join with Senator Warner and me and others on this committee to try to push our bill forward.   </p><p>      Thank you, Mr. Chairman.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CRAPO</emphasis>:  Thank you, Senator Warren.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  Thank you.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CRAPO</emphasis>:  Senator Cortez Masto?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CORTEZ MASTO</emphasis>:  Thank you. Thank you Mr. Chair and Ranking Member for, I agree, this important discussion and thank you to both of you for being here and all of the work that you do.   </p><p>      I'm curious, last and I want to talk a little bit about exclusive contracts, last October right after the announcement of Equifax's massive data breach the New York Times ran an article about how Equifax and Freddie Mac have an exclusive relationship that harms both consumers and small businesses, I'm curious if either one of you are familiar with that article or familiar with this concept that there are exclusive contracts?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MITHAL</emphasis>:  I'm not.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TWOHIG</emphasis>:  I'm not familiar either.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CORTEZ MASTO</emphasis>:  So this isn't something that either one of your organization is looking into is something that is harmful to individual consumers or small businesses.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MITHAL</emphasis>:  I can only speak to privacy and cyber security issues and that is not something that is on our radar screen.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TWOHIG</emphasis>:  And for the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection and as I said at the outset we can confirm that we're investigating Equifax's data security practices in coordination with the FTC, beyond that our investigations are not public.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CORTEZ MASTO</emphasis>:  Yes, thank you very much.   </p><p>      And Ms. Twohig, let me jump back then to the concept of -- and I agree with my colleagues that -- this concern that all this data is being collected on all of us individually and we had no control over it.   </p><p>      So Ms. Twohig, let me start with you, as you well know, there is criticisms around the world had different standards for consumer control of their own privacy, for instance, the new privacy laws in the European Union provide more privacy options than we do here in the United States. In fact, Americans have really little say over what data can be aggregated by these credit bureaus.   </p><p>      If an opt in system for credit bureaus was established, how would that impact people, our communities, and our economy? In other words also in and as you address that, what is the reaction we are seeing to the implementation of the general data protection regulations in the European Union.   </p><p>      And the reason I bring this up is because we've all been talking about opt in, but there is this concern that somehow it is going to be -- have some -- an impact on our economy, on our businesses and so I'm curious if you have any insight into that either one of you, and let me start with you, Mr. Twohig.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TWOHIG</emphasis>:  So at the outset, I would say that the Economic Growth and Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act provides additional important consumer protections in my view to allow consumers to get a free security freeze and so even though that's not exactly what...   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CORTEZ MASTO</emphasis>:  That is not an opt in.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TWOHIG</emphasis>:  That is not an opt in, but it's one step toward more control if consumers choose to exercise it.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CORTEZ MASTO</emphasis>:  But it's less than what the European Union requires?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TWOHIG</emphasis>:  I believe so.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CORTEZ MASTO</emphasis>:  Any other?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MITHAL</emphasis>:  Yes, I guess I would say that I would have a bit of a concern about an across the board opt in. And I could see people who have a bad credit history or who have criminal records, or bankruptcy is not waning that infrastructure to be reported and is not opting into the system.   </p><p>      And I think that could raise the credit across the board. So I do have some concerns about that, I agree with the general concept that consumers should have more control, but there are potential means of accomplishing that.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CORTEZ MASTO</emphasis>:  Do you think some of the legislation you've heard today gives more of that control to consumers?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MITHAL</emphasis>:  I think there are some very interesting options worth exploring through that legislation.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CORTEZ MASTO</emphasis>:  Thank you, I appreciate that.   </p><p>      And let me also then go back to this idea, I agree with my colleague, Senator Scott, and the concern about too many adults have credit invisible and unscorable credit, and I think that is harmful in so many different ways.   </p><p>      But I also understand, Ms. Twohig, from what you said that you are studying the issue that the agency is studying the issue on alternative to data.   </p><p>      Can you talk a little bit more about that and when you are going to anticipate completion of that study and what your intent is after your -- the study is completed?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TWOHIG</emphasis>:  So I don't have a particular date and I'm not sure there is a particular study, it's just something that the bureau is very interested in and has requested information so we could learn more about that.   </p><p>      I can tell you that the acting director has created an office of innovation with the goal of seeing what the bureau can do to spur innovation in all kinds of ways and that would include the use of alternative data and avenues for increasing access to credit.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CORTEZ MASTO</emphasis>:  Okay, thank you. And then one final question, I know that a number of states just recently announced that a consent order last week with Equifax and I believe these states really took the lead on this and did their necessary investigation.   </p><p>      One of the reasons why I have concerns that there needs to be more of this collaboration between states and the federal government in this area is because I have seen here as we have had these hearings that state oversight is ever more necessary now, what I have seen from Director Mulvaney and really the CFPB nominee, Kraninger have not shown any willingness to challenge financial services industry.   </p><p>      So given what I know and what I have seen here, let me ask you this. There is a legislation in the house, that is HR3626, and it requires enhancing information sharing between federal and state regulators when conducting the TSP exams. Would that be something you would support and I'm asking both of you?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TWOHIG</emphasis>:  So I can say as a general matter than, and I've been with the bureau since the beginning in the supervision program, we have placed a priority on developing relationships with state regulators and my (inaudible) colleague is the same for the state attorneys general, and so we have close and cooperative relationships with those regulators and the acting director has said he wants to improve that even more.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CORTEZ MASTO</emphasis>:  That is wonderful to hear. Thank you.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MITHAL</emphasis>:  And I would echo that sentiment and I just want to also say that I think we have been talking a lot about gaps in the FTC's authority but I do want to say whatever authority congress gives us, we exercise very aggressively. So we brought over 60 data security cases and we looked at a variety of sectors so I didn't want to make it sound like we were sitting on our hands.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CORTEZ MASTO</emphasis>:  Thank you. And I notice my time is up. Thank you both.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CRAPO</emphasis>:  Thank you. Senator Jones.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JONES</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you for the witnesses for coming here today. I want to mention something about today, I want to go back to cybersecurity like so many others but from a little bit different angle.   </p><p>      And I appreciate all of the colleagues on this committee concerned with the Equifaxes of the world and the holders of this information. But you know, I'm an old prosecutor, and when we have a bank robbery, we just didn't focus on what happened at the bank, we focused on who got the money and trying to catch those folks.   </p><p>      So my question is and we heard a lot today about Equifax and CRAs, is law enforcement involved in that investigation, and if so, if they are not, I would like to know why, and if so, can we have an expectation at some point when these investigation is released that there has been an effort and we hopefully can find out who did this but I agree with Senator Warner, this problem is not going away and we need to focus on perpetrators as much as those holding the date.   </p><p>      I will give that to both of you.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MITHAL</emphasis>:  Do I don't think I can talk about this in the context of the specific nonpublic investigation but what I can't say that we work very closely with criminal authorities, I think it's a kind of a one-two punch type situation where we want make sure as a civil matter that agencies and companies that are entrusted in the consumer data are doing everything they can to protect it and at the same time, we work with criminal law enforcement authority to catch the bad guys and to try to share information to accomplish that.   </p><p>      So I agree it's a very important part of the equation.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TWOHIG</emphasis>:  And that would be the same for the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection in terms of coordinating with criminal law enforcement agencies.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JONES</emphasis>:  When this investigation is public would you expect there to be some element of the report about the culprits in this particular Equifax matter?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TWOHIG</emphasis>:  I really can't speak to that.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JONES</emphasis>:  All right, that's fair enough.   </p><p>      All right, the other thing I like to mention is that a recent study showed that Alabama, my state, ranked third from the bottom in terms of average credit score and I know there are a lot of things that impact credit scores but what seem clear is that there were also regional differences that remain kind of static and one of the CFPB and FTC both have tools to educate customers which I think is as important as anything in trying to get folks to get their scores up, I see TV ads all the time but that's not the same to try to get your free credit score is not the same as trying to say get your free credit score up.   </p><p>      So could you both briefly describe some of the tools that your agencies have with regard to education and what you believe to be the most effective way to educate the public about how to maintain a good credit score?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MITHAL</emphasis>:  So I can start with that. And so we have what I believe is a world-class Office Of Consumer Business Education and one of the things we do is we put out our financial literacy materials, materials about credit scores and how to check your credit reports. And I think what we recognize that -- is a lot of people not know the FTC and so they feel a lot more comfortable getting this information from their local communities, their churches, their schools, their libraries, and so we do not copyright our information, we put out there for the local communities to put out their own communities and we would be happy to work with your office to get our materials to you.   </p><p>      We are also members of an interagency financial literacy task force. So again I think we are trying, I think I absolutely agree that education is a very important part of what we do and we need to get the word out to consumers so they can help protect themselves.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JONES</emphasis>:  Great. Well, do you want to address that, Ms. Twohig?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TWOHIG</emphasis>:  Same for the bureau, consumer education is a very important part of what we do and we have materials and educational materials about how to create a credit file so consumers can have access to mainstream credit. Our community affairs office is also doing active work in certain communities to try to help on the communities to understand what they can do locally to help consumers understand how they can create and build their credit files and positive credit history.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JONES</emphasis>:  Great. Thank you both and my staff will reach out to you to try to so that we can do some affirmative things in Alabama. And the remaining moment I just like to follow back up with what Senator Scott said about the bill that he and I have introduced on the Credit Access Inclusion Act and Mr. Chairman and Senator Brown, I would also urge this committee to get involved and try to get that bill out, a companion bill that's I think identical, passed the house unanimously and in an era which the divide over Supreme Court nominations and things like that are about to get great greater, I don't want a bill that is a truly bipartisan bill to fall through the cracks like this and I would urge the committee to take some action let's get that done.   </p><p>      So thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CRAPO</emphasis>:  Thank you, Senator Jones.   </p><p>      Senator Van Hollen.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">VAN HOLLEN</emphasis>:  Thank you Mr. Chairman and ranking member and thank you both for your testimony here today.   </p><p>      We talked about a number things. Two of the categories we talked about, one how do we create more incentives to discourage or prevent, deter credit rating agencies from becoming victims of data breaches? Obviously no one has interest in having a big data breach but the cost-benefit analysis needs to be changed and that is what Senators Warner and Warren have been talking about.   </p><p>      The other issue I would Senator Kennedy and Senator Schatz have been talking about is the accuracy of the information collected by the credit ratings agency and I want to focus on that for a moment because, yes, I absolutely agree that we should make it easier for consumers to try to get their complaints submitted and processed more quickly, but it still appears to me that when you look at the sort of incentives of the CRAs that when they get it wrong, other than making the consumer whole again or correcting the error, they don't seem to have any penalty applied.   </p><p>      So let me know if there is a current penalty that can be applied when they get it wrong and we already know that in 5 percent of the cases, they get it wrong which represents millions and millions of Americans which can have a devastating impact on their lives.   </p><p>      So it seems to me in addition to making it easier to remedy the situation from the point of your consumer, we should also create greater incentives for the CRAs to get right in the first place so that the burden is on them when they get it wrong, that there are some penalty to be paid for getting it wrong. Are there any penalties right now that either of you can apply when they -- when you just find that they're getting it wrong a lot?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MITHAL</emphasis>:  So we do have the authority to seek civil policies for companies that don't have reasonable procedures to have maximum possible accuracy. So I have been clarifying that under the FCA (ph), we don't have the authority to get penalties under data security but for accuracy, we do, and we have gotten those civil penalties. But I just want to emphasize the statutory standard, there is reasonable procedures for accuracy so it is not that every accuracy or every inaccuracy in a credit report will get a civil penalty.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">VAN HOLLEN</emphasis>:  Right, would it would it make sense to think of those applying more of the penalty when people get it wrong, in other words as I understand it right now, if you're a consumer whose been -- believes you have bad information that's negatively affecting your credit report, you go to this long process, right? You get on the phone, you may be put on hold, you do what you said, it may take a couple of years, at the end of the day what you the FTC determines is whether or not the consumer's complaint was correct, right?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MITHAL</emphasis>:  So we look to see whether the company's procedures were reasonable. you just look at the reasonable.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">VAN HOLLEN</emphasis>:  You just look at the reasonable nature of that and if you find that they were unreasonable, what do you do to the company?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MITHAL</emphasis>:  So we have gotten civil penalties against several companies sell so one was a couple years ago against the company we had about $2.6 million civil penalty, there is another check authorization company, we got about a $3.5 million civil penalty. So again it depends on the facts and circumstances and we look at several statutory factors in determining the appropriate penalty amount.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">VAN HOLLEN</emphasis>:  Right. Would it be worth looking at greater sort of deterrent mechanisms so that there's more of a burden on the CRAs to get it right in the first place and if so what kind of suggestions would you have?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MITHAL</emphasis>:  So I certainly kind of sympathize with the goal of making it easier for consumers to dispute credit reporting accuracy and also to make the whole process easier for consumers and I think that is a goal worth exploring and I would be happy to work with your staff and others on the committee to accomplish that goal.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">VAN HOLLEN</emphasis>:  All right.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TWOHIG</emphasis>:  So Senator, similarly, the Bureau can get penalties where there's been noncompliance with the FCRA's reasonable procedures provision, in fact brought a case against a consumer reporting agency and got, I believe about 5 million in penalties for their failure to comply with that part of the law. More generally, I think I also sympathize with the problems you're pointing out and that's exactly why we've used this new supervisory authority that has never existed before until the Bureau was created to prioritize looking at the national credit reporting agencies and other consumer reporting agencies for to ensure that they are looking at all aspects of accuracy. There is very different components -- various different components of really what it takes to get a quality data control system, there's the incoming information, there's compiling it and there's monitoring any indications of problems after the fact.   </p><p>      We've broken it down and looked at various aspects and worked through our supervisory authority to require improvements in each part of those pieces of the system.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">VAN HOLLEN</emphasis>:  Good because I think until your -- let's say you're a CRA, until you have to suffer -- right now as the consumer goes to this complaint process and the CRA the end of the okay, they got to make them whole, right, we made a mistake two years ago that's affected your life but there's no other penalty to be applied unless they somehow have a system of that you determine has met this -- that it's been shaky at and even with those systems today, as we know, 5 percent error rate which affects tens of millions of people.   </p><p>      So anyway, I look forward to working with the Chairman, Ranking Member, and all of you. Thanks.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BROWN</emphasis>:  Thank you, Senator Van Hollen.   </p><p>      My questions are for both of you, I have a couple of questions. A lot of people as we know work hard every day, sometimes people working multiple jobs to keep up with their bills, if they're injured, if they fall ill we don't have many, many, many companies in this country on any kind of leave policy, some don't have good health insurance so when people are injured or fall ill, huge unexpected medical costs could haunt their credit report for years. Given this type of debt is generally out of a person's control they obviously didn't choose this, should we not pause medical debt reporting at least until more Americans have access to affordable insurance? I will start with you.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TWOHIG</emphasis>:  So Senator, I think it is correct that medical debt is different than other kinds of debt, it can cause special problems for consumers, they can be subject to medical debt collection when they are just waiting for reimbursement and so I think it is a different kind of debt than regular debt.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BROWN</emphasis>:  That is? Okay. Go ahead.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MITHAL</emphasis>:  I agree with that, and I think the S2155 with an excellent start in at least excluding certain medical debt for veterans and I think this is an idea worth exploring...   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BROWN</emphasis>:  It should be broader than that.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MITHAL</emphasis>:  I think that's an idea worth exploring, yes.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BROCKMAN</emphasis>:  I mentioned partially a follow-up to Senator Cortez Masto, I mentioned Mariner Finance in my opening statements, a company that sends cashable checks to people who might be in financial trouble but the check is as we know it, a high-cost loan. Industry claims these prescreened offers that are the -- they are allowed by their by the FCRA to help borrowers get a better deal and it looks like shady lenders fundamentally are taking advantage of a loophole to target struggling families. Wouldn't consumers be better off and less likely to face predatory lending practices if they had to opt into these offers and to opt in rather than having to take steps to opt out? Let's start with you.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MITHAL</emphasis>:  Sure so I also read the article and I was very troubled by the practices, I can't speak on any particular company but the types of practices that are described in the article were very troubling.   </p><p>      So under the FCRA, prescreened offers are permitted if they are a firm offer of credit and so that is something that the statute specifically allows if congress were to determine the change that, we went we would enforce that requirement as well so that is something that the law currently requires, but again, we would be ready to work with congress in any potential changes in that?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BROWN</emphasis>:  Mr. Twohig.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TWOHIG</emphasis>:  I would agree with that, consumers now have a right to opt out, but as you suggest, Senator, that's different than having to default the other way and we would be happy to work with you to consider whether there is a policy determination do you think would be better for consumers.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BROWN</emphasis>:  That is mostly yes.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TWOHIG</emphasis>:  We would be happy to work with you to consider the pros and cons of going that direction.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BROWN</emphasis>:  That is quite a yes.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TWOHIG</emphasis>:  Not quite a -- yes.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BROWN</emphasis>:  Fair Credit Reporting Act protects companies who provide information to credit bureaus, consumers can't take them to court to get fixed as we know that. we've all heard the horror stories of someone trying to fix inaccurate data on a credit report.   </p><p>      If consumers were allowed to have their day in court, would providers be more careful ensuring the data they report to credit bureaus is accurate, Ms. Twohig?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TWOHIG</emphasis>:  So there is a private right of action under the Fair Credit Reporting Act and there are private actions filed by consumers if they believe that their information is inaccurate. So I just want to make sure I understand what you're...   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BROWN</emphasis>:  There is a private right of action but that private right of action has been, to put it mildly, diluted by this Congress, and by decisions made by government, correct?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TWOHIG</emphasis>:  I can't speak to that, what I can say is that we are well aware at the Bureau of our obligation to ensure compliance with the law which is indeed why we prioritized supervising and enforcement in that area.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BROWN</emphasis>:  I know you do and I appreciate that and I appreciate your service over the years, but don't providers, the credit providers fundamentally know there's not a particularly effective private right of action, do they not know that?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TWOHIG</emphasis>:  I can't speak to what they...   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BROWN</emphasis>:  Well, yes, you can, they know the credit -- the credit providers know about forced arbitration, the credit providers know how the laws have changed, the credit providers know where the power in the society resides, it's not with consumers, it's not with employees, it's with employers, it's with credit reporting companies. You've had a string of really important jobs, you are obviously a really bright woman, you do recognize that, correct?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TWOHIG</emphasis>:  I recognize that it can be hard for an individual consumer and that's actually why I spent my career in public service trying to do what I can do...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BROWN</emphasis>:  I get all that and thank you again for that, but you you're not willing to say that the providers would be more careful ensuring the data they report to credit bureaus is accurate if the laws were written to give consumers more power in the marketplace?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TWOHIG</emphasis>:  They probably would be more careful if the laws were written that way.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BROWN</emphasis>:  Would you like to respond to that too?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MITHAL</emphasis>:  I agree with that Ms. Twohig said.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BROWN</emphasis>:  Which part, the part of...   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MITHAL</emphasis>:  The part that companies...   </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BROWN</emphasis>:  ...question that part?   </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MITHAL</emphasis>:  The part where companies would be more likely to shore up their practices if consumers had more power.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BROWN</emphasis>:  I guess I don't know why a simple yes isn't clear there when credit providers know that the law is mostly the power of the law is mostly on their side and not of the consumer side, you know, (inaudible) the majesty, the law, it prohibits rich people as well as poor people from sleeping under bridges, yeah it does, well, that tells you a lot about where the power in society is and the power more and more is residing with those with more and more power and influence, in privilege, and consumers have less and less of that, it's just so clear to me that they are that the credit providers act worse because they -- because the law so often is on their side and the power resides in them.   </p><p>      Senator Donnelly.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DONNELLY</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman and thank you to the witnesses. On May 24th, the Economic Recovery Regulatory Relief And Consumer Protection Act was signed into law. I negotiated and wrote that legislation along with Chairman Crapo and several of my colleagues here. This new law includes important new consumer protection related to the credit bureaus to benefit servicemembers, veterans and all Americans.   </p><p>      The law provides free credit freezes, credit monitoring for servicemembers and protections for veterans from VA billing delays. I like to highlight these consumer friendly provisions and receive feedback and updates from you on efforts to oversee the implementation and enforcement.   </p><p>      The new law includes a provision to provide free credit monitoring for active duty service members. The FTC was provided one year to complete a rulemaking which will help shape the credit monitoring services provided. Ms. Mithal, I expect the FTC to complete its rulemaking as soon as possible so troops can start receiving this important service. What is the FTC's expected timeline for the rulemaking?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MITHAL</emphasis>:  So Senator, I can assure you we are working as expeditiously as possible to complete the rulemaking and I'm hoping that we would have a notice of proposed rulemaking out by hopefully at least the fall. I don't have complete control over that but that's what I am committing to.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DONNELLY</emphasis>:  Obviously, the sooner, the better.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MITHAL</emphasis>:  Absolutely.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DONNELLY</emphasis>:  Section 301 of the new law includes a section I authored with Senator Purdue to allow every American to freeze and unfreeze their credit free of charge and set year-long fraud alerts. Additionally the FTC in the major credit bureaus have to set up webpages where consumers can easily freeze their credit, set a fraud alert and opt out of prescreened credit offers. These provisions allow Americans to take control of their credit files. The law requires compliance by September 21. These provisions will make things easier for consumers. Can you please speak about the provisions generally and your expectation for the level of communication and collaboration that will occur between your agencies and the credit bureaus during implementation to ensure consumers benefit as was intended.   </p><p>      If you can each respond.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TWOHIG</emphasis>:  So I can assure you Senator, that the Bureau is going to work expeditiously to update to implement on what it needs to do in the --in implementing the Economic Growth And Regulatory Relief And Consumer Protection Act, that would include updating the summary of rights that goes to consumers so that they when they get their credit report, they have the information about these important protections available to them as well as educating consumers, we work collaboratively with the FTC and share information about that kind of information as well as of course, overseeing the compliance with these new provisions.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DONNELLY</emphasis>:  Ms. Mithal?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MITHAL</emphasis>:  And I would say, first of all, I think these are very important rights and they give important tools to consumers so thank you for your work on that. So our implementation, we have put out some guidance to consumers informing them of the new updates to the law that will take place in September, and we have already begun discussions with the CRAs about creating an online portal to effectuate all those tools for consumers and so we're hoping to be ready, but we will be ready by September when the law goes into effect.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DONNELLY</emphasis>:  Okay, section 302, the new law is based off the protecting veterans credit act which I introduced with Senator Rounds to ensure veterans are not wrongly penalized by medical bill payment delays at the Department of Veterans Affairs. Many veterans have their credit scores damaged when the VA was late to pay medical bills. That won't be a problem any longer due to this new law. Your agencies again have oversight and enforcement authority.   </p><p>      Can you speak as to how this provision will ensure that veterans are not wrongly penalized for medical debt that is actually the VA's responsibility. Miss Twohig?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TWOHIG</emphasis>:  Senator, you can be sure that we will be looking for compliance with those important new provisions.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DANIEL</emphasis>:  Ms. Mithal.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MITHAL</emphasis>:  And again I think that that provisions write very important new rights for veterans, I think there have been recent studies showing that lack of predictiveness of medical debt and so I think it's a very important provision and we will do everything we can to support it.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DONNELLY</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BROWN</emphasis>:  Thank you, Senator Donnelly. And I ask unanimous consent to enter into the record a letter from several consumer advocacy groups, without objection, whatever, thank you. Thanks for being the last guy standing.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DONNELLY</emphasis>:  Ready to help anytime.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BROWN</emphasis>:  That concludes the question for today, the questions for the record are due from Senators in one week by Thursday, July 19, we ask the two of you to respond to those questions as quickly as possible this -- thank you for joining us, this concludes the hearing.  </p><p>      END   </p></bodyText></section></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">POLTRN2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5STJ-XKT1-JDPT-T22K-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">147909</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-02-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><publicationInfo><publicationName>CQ Transcriptions</publicationName><bodyText><p>All materials herein are protected by United States copyright law and may not be reproduced, distributed, transmitted, displayed, published or broadcast without the prior written permission of CQ Transcriptions.

The committee today will have will -- the committee hearing today is entitled An Overview of the Credit Bureaus and the Fair Credit Reporting Act. Credit bureaus play a valuable role in our financial system by helping financial institutions assess a consumer's ability to meet financial obligations and also facilitating access to beneficial financial products and services.   </p><p>      Given this role, they have a lot of valuable personal information on consumers and therefore are targets of cyberattacks. Last year, Equifax experienced an unprecedented cybersecurity incident which compromised the personal data of over 145 million people. Following that event, the banking committee held two oversight hearings on the breach and consumer data protection at credit bureaus. The first hearing with the former Equifax CEO examine details surrounding the breach, while the second hearing with outside experts examined what improvements might be made surrounding credit reporting agencies and data security.   </p><p>      This committee also recently held a hearing on cybersecurity and risks to the financial services industry. These hearings demonstrated bipartisan concern about the Equifax data breach and the protection of consumers personally identifiable information, as well as support for specific legislative measures to address such concerns. Some of these were addressed in Senate Bill 2155, the Economic Growth Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act, which included meaningful consumer protections for consumers who become victims of fraud.   </p><p>      For example, it provides consumers unlimited free credit freezes and unfreezes per year. It allows parents to turn on and off credit reporting for children under 18 and provides important protections for veterans and seniors. Last month, a New York Times article commenting on the bill noted that one helpful change will allow consumers to freeze their credit files at the three major credit reporting bureaus without charge. Consumers can also thaw their files temporarily or permanently without a fee.   </p><p>      Susan Grant, director of Consumer Protection and Privacy at the Consumer Federation of America expressed support for these measures calling them a good thing.   </p><p>      Paul Stevens, director of policy and advocacy of the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse similarly noted that the freeze provision has the potential to save consumers a lot of money. But there is still an opportunity to see whether more should be done and today's hearing will help inform this committee in that regard.   </p><p>      Today, I look forward to hearing about -- more from the witnesses about the scope of the Fair Credit Reporting Act and other relevant laws and regulations as they pertain to credit bureaus, the extent to which the Bureau of consumer financial protection and the FTC, whom the two witnesses represent today oversee credit Bureau data security and accuracy.   </p><p>      The current state of data security, data accuracy, data breach policy and the dispute resolution processes at the credit bureaus and what if any improvements could be made. States have begun to react in their own ways to various aspects of the public debate on privacy, data security, and the Equifax data breach.   </p><p>      Two weeks ago, California enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act which will take effect on January 20 -- January 1, 2020. The act which applies to certain organizations conducting business in California establishes a new privacy framework by creating new data privacy rights imposing special rules for the collection of minors consumer data and creating damages frameworks for violations and businesses failing to implement reasonable security procedures. Many members are interested in learning more about what California and other states are doing on this front.   </p><p>      Additionally, two weeks ago, eight state banking Commissioners jointly took action against Equifax in a consent order requiring the company to take various actions regarding risk assessment and information security.   </p><p>      I've long been concerned about data collection and data privacy protections by the government and the private sector. Given Americans' increased reliance on the use of technology where information can be shared by the swipe of a finger, we should be careful to ensure that companies and government entities who have such information use it responsibly and keep it safe. Senator Brown?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BROWN</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thanks very much to our witnesses. Thanks for holding this hearing today, I hope that my colleagues would excuse me and particularly welcome Ms. Twohig to our committee. She is from the consumer protection bureau, grew up in Fairview Park, a Westside suburb of Cleveland, she graduated from Ohio State, she worked for the Cleveland Foundation, the preeminent community foundation in the United States of America. She has a long career as a public servant with FTC, the Treasury Department, and was an early employee of this terrific agency, the Consumer Protection -- Financial Protection Bureau.   </p><p>      So thank you both to leave you out -- but thank you both for joining us. The consumer credit reporting system is stacked against Americans, a bad credit report can keep you on the job and can put you on a list you'll be targeted with expensive credit cards or high-cost loans, you are almost powerless to do anything about it.   </p><p>      Americans have basically no control over these reports, it can dictate their lives and their families plans for the future, they often don't know whether they're accurate or whether they're inaccurate. Six years ago I chaired a subcommittee hearing where consumer activists and some consumer advocates in the CFPB identified problems in the credit reporting industry, we've had several hearings in this committee over the last year on credit reporting companies and on data privacy.   </p><p>      In the meantime breach after breach has occurred. Last year as we know, 148 million Americans had their sensitive data stolen as hackers exploited a known security flaw that Equifax did not fix. Millions more been affected by breaches at banks like J.P. Morgan Chase, stores like Target, Whole Foods, even Trump Hotels.   </p><p>      Congressional efforts including provisions included in S2155 haven't done anything meaningful to address accuracy of credit reports to fix privacy concerns or to give consumers controls over their own personal data.   </p><p>      At the same time, big tech companies continually add more and more of our personal information to their digital warehouses, their financial and personal details about hundreds of millions of Americans, they see the potential for a big payday and selling that data to credit reporting companies.   </p><p>      These companies are amassing more and more of our data, but they still seem totally unprepared to deal with cyberattacks, they are building virtual -- shall we say silver platters for hackers. People want and deserve a lot more control over their personal information, credit reporting presents a unique problem because often Americans don't even know these corporations collect their data in the first place.   </p><p>      Right now consumers can't vote as my money and my colleagues like to say can't simply vote with their feet when a company doesn't treat them well, when a credit Bureau fails to protect their privacy, Congress passed the Fair Credit Reporting Act in the first place to rein in credit bureaus that originally function as unsupervised by agencies collecting personal information that we would be appalled to see in someone's credit report today. After scandals at Facebook, people are rightfully worried about big companies once again compiling and selling files a personal data on every American without her knowledge out of our control or our consent.   </p><p>      More Americans would be surprised at how lenders are putting this data to use. Last week the Washington Post ran a story about a company called Mariner Finance that uses a loop on the SCRA to look at people's credit records without their permission and then targets them with scams. Mariner sends checks for thousands of dollars to struggling families that can be cashed the day they are plucked from the mail but the checks are really just expensive loans waiting to trap the consumer who cashes them.   </p><p>      Now Mariner will tell you they are increasing access to credit, their terms, but that's exactly what we're told about subprime loans, some will say including a potentially, your boss at the CFPB, that the market will take care of that. Well, the market clearly hasn't. The fact is that Mariner is weaponizing people's credit history to target them with an expensive loan and making huge profits for the hedge fund that owns it.   </p><p>      Your credit report can be used to force you into court rightly or wrongly to settle debts but what if your credit card company or your cable provider erroneously reports a missed payment or default of the account?   </p><p>      They are protected, you can't take them to court at all and that's just absolutely outrageous. It turns out that's a big problem, CFPB paper found last year that credit reporting companies haven't been doing enough to ensure the information they get is accurate. They are protected and consumers aren't in part because of behavior of this United States Senate and because of a court Supreme Court that moves more and more to protect corporate interest.   </p><p>      What incentive do these companies have? The people they hurt won't be able to have their day in court. We have heard all of this before, the credit reporting system is backward like so much of our economy, it works for big corporations, it works for people with privilege, it doesn't work for regular Americans.   </p><p>      The Fair Credit Reporting Act is 50 years old the amount and type of information collected, they would've been unthinkable when it was created, it's time for a serious overhaul that puts Americans in control of their own data. I've introduced bills and saw many of my colleagues that would do just that. I hope the committee will not only listen to the advice we get today but will also take action to give people control over what should be their personal information.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CRAPO</emphasis>:  Thank you, Senator Brown.   </p><p>      And we will now move our witnesses and their testimony. First we will hear from Ms. Peggy Twohig who currently serves as the assistant director for supervision policy and the division of supervision enforcement and fair lending at the Bureau of Consumer financial protection. The office of supervision is responsible for developing strategy across bank and non-bank markets and ensuring that policy decisions are consistent across markets, charters, and regions.   </p><p>      After that we will hear from Ms. Maneesha Mithal, did I pronounce that right?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MITHAL</emphasis>:  Mithal.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CRAPO</emphasis>:  Mithal. All right. Ms. Maneesha Mithal who serves as the associate director for the division of privacy and identity protection in the Bureau of consumer protection at the Federal Trade Commission. In this capacity she supervises the work in the area of data security, identity theft, credit reporting and behavioral advertising and general privacy.   </p><p>      We appreciate both of you joining us today and we will proceed in the order that you were introduced. Ms Twohig.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TWOHIG</emphasis>:  Good morning, Chairman Crapo, Ranking Member Brown and thank you for that special introduction, I'm very proud of my Cleveland roots, and thank you for the opportunity to testify today about the work of the Bureau of consumer financial protection to address consumer protections in the credit reporting market.   </p><p>      My name is Peggy Twohig and I'm assistant director for subversion policy at the bureau. Credit reporting plays a critical role in consumer financial services and has enormous reach and impact. Over 200 million Americans have credit files with trade lines furnished voluntarily by over 10,000 providers. This information is used by creditors and other types of businesses to make decisions about individual transactions with consumers.   </p><p>      In particular, creditors rely on this information to decide whether to approve loans and what terms to offer. Accurate credit reporting is important to creditors and other businesses to make good business decisions. For an individual consumer, an accurate credit report can be even more important given the significant impact that information can have on that consumers ability to obtain financial and other products and services.   </p><p>      Because of the importance of accuracy to businesses and consumers? The structure of the fair credit reporting act creates interrelated legal standards and requirements to support the policy goal of accurate credit reporting. These requirements anticipate that all reports will not be perfect. Instead the FCRA requires that consumer reporting agencies or CRA's have a reasonable procedures to assure maximum possible accuracy of reports.   </p><p>      It also imposes certain accuracy obligations on furnishers of credit report information and the FCRA has a dispute and investigation framework with obligations on both CRA's and furnishers to ensure that potential errors are investigated and errors are corrected promptly.   </p><p>      The written testimony of the Bureau reviews the legal authority of the Bureau, to supervisor enforced and enforce the federal consumer financial laws applicable to CRAs.   </p><p>      I will focus here on the work the bureau has done exercising these authorities. In both its supervision and enforcement work, the bureau has focused on credit reporting accuracy and dispute handling by both CRAs and furnishers.   </p><p>      As discussed in a special edition of supervisory highlights published last year, the Bureau of supervisory work has prioritized reviews of key elements underpinning accuracy. As a result of these reviews, the bureau directed specific improvements in data accuracy and dispute resolution at one or more CRA including improving oversight of incoming data from the furnishers, instituting quality-control programs of compiled Consumer Reports. Monitoring furnisher dispute metrics to identify and correct root causes. Improved investigations of consumer disputes including a review of relevant information provided by consumers, and improving communication to consumers of dispute results.   </p><p>      In supervising bank and non-bank furnishers, the bureau has found furnishers that were not complying with their FCRA obligations and directed them to comply including developing reasonable written policies and procedures regarding the accuracy of the information they furnish, taking corrective action when they furnish information they determine to be inaccurate, and bringing their dispute handling practices into compliance.   </p><p>      The Bureau has also brought enforcement actions and entered into a number of settlements related to violations of the FCRA's accuracy and dispute investigation requirements.   </p><p>      Turning to data security, CRAs hold a tremendous amount of sensitive information about consumers. If CRAs do not protect this data, it may lead to data breaches creating the risk of substantial harm to consumers including the risk of identity theft. Since the Equifax breach, the Bureau has increased its attention to data security issues in our supervisory and enforcement work.   </p><p>      The Bureau has the authority to conduct data security investigations and to conduct examinations at certain non-banks including larger CRAs. This authority includes assessing the facts and circumstances to determine whether a CRAs data security practices constitute violations of federal consumer financial law including the prohibition against unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts and practices, or the FCRA.   </p><p>      Our supervisory enforcement and consumer education efforts will continue in this important area. Consumers should have confidence in their credit report that their credit reports are secure and comply with all applicable legal requirements. Thank you again for the opportunity to testify today at this important hearing, and we would be happy to answer your questions about the Bureau's work-related credit reporting.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CRAPO</emphasis>:  Thank you very much. Ms. Mithal.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MITHAL</emphasis>:  Thank you. Chairman Crapo, Ranking Member Brown and members of the committee. My name is Maneesha Mithal and I'm the associate director at the Division of Privacy and Identity Protection at the Federal Trade Commission. I appreciate the opportunity to appear before you today to discuss the fair credit reporting act, credit bureaus, and data security.   </p><p>      As you know, the FCRA is intended help consumers in three-way. First, it helps consumers prevent and misuse of sensitive consumer report information by limiting recipients to those who have a legitimate need for it. Second, it works to improve the accuracy and integrity of the consumer reporting system. And third, it promotes the efficiency of the nation's banking and consumer credit systems.   </p><p>      Now the commission has played a key role in the implementation enforcement and interpretation of the FCRA since its enactment. Let me mention three key examples.   </p><p>      First, in 2012, the commission published a study of credit report accuracy. According to the study findings, one in four consumers identified errors on their credit reports that might affect their credit scores. Four out of five consumers who filed disputes experienced some modification to their credit report, and 5 percent of consumers experienced a change in their credit score that could impact their credit risk classification.   </p><p>      The second activity that the FTC engages in is enforcement. Enforcement continues to be a top priority for the commission. Since 2011, the Bureau has been examining the nationwide credit bureaus. As a result, the FTC has focused its FCRA law enforcement efforts on other entities in the credit reporting area and other aspects of the consumer reporting industry more broadly.   </p><p>      One example is enforcing a law against furnishers that aren't supervised by the Bureau. The FTC has settled cases against data furnishers that allegedly had inadequate policies and procedures for reporting accurate information to CRAs.   </p><p>      Another example is employment background screening CRAs. For instance, in the InfoTrack case, the commission alleged that a background screening CRA failed to have reasonable procedures to ensure maximum possible accuracy of the consumer reports it provided, and as a result, it provided inaccurate information suggesting that job applicant may have been registered sex offenders when they were in fact, not.   </p><p>      Third, the commission continues to educate consumers and businesses on their consumer reporting rights and obligations under the FCRA. One example is their publication, credit, and your consumer rights which provides an overview of credit for consumers, explains consumers legal rights, and offers practical tips to help solve credit problems.   </p><p>      Now, let me close by mentioning the importance of credit bureaus maintaining reasonable security of the consumer information that is entrusted to them. Since 2001, the commission has undertaken substantial efforts to promote data security in this and other sectors.   </p><p>      We enforced several laws requiring companies to maintain reasonable security including the FTC act, the Gramm Leach Bliley safeguards rule, and certain provisions of the FCRA. The commission has brought over 60 law enforcement actions against companies that allegedly engaged in unreasonable data security practices.   </p><p>      Last year the commission took the unusual step of publicly confirming its investigation into the Equifax data breach due to scale of the public interest in the matter. And although we aggressively enforced our data security laws, I believe there are some gaps in our authority.   </p><p>      For example we cannot seek civil penalties for violations of most data security laws. To fill in these gaps, the commission has supported federal data security legislation on a bipartisan basis for over a decade. My written testimony discusses these issues in further detail and I'm happy to answer any questions you might have.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CRAPO</emphasis>:  Thank you Ms. Mithal. And my first question is for you, this is primarily just sort of the housekeeping item but as I indicated in my opening statement, the economic growth regulatory relief and consumer protection act has some significant provisions in it in this arena in terms of protecting the consumers with the ability to place security freezes on their credit files with the credit bureaus.   </p><p>      This provision will empower consumers to protect their credit in the event of future data breaches or incidents of identity theft, I'm just seeking your commitment that you and the FTC will move expeditiously to implement these credit bureau provisions in Senate Bill 2155.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MITHAL</emphasis>:  Absolutely, you have our commitment to expeditiously and we have already begun, we issued a consumer blog post and we began our rulemaking process. So thank you.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CRAPO</emphasis>:  Thank you. And Ms. Twohig, credit bureaus, well let me put it this way, I have long been concerned about the ever increasing amounts of big data that are being collected both in the private sector and in the public sector by the government.   </p><p>      And as you know, one of the agencies that I've been worried about is the consumer financial protection bureau. Are credit bureaus required to provide data to the bureau?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TWOHIG</emphasis>:  Mr. Senator, thank you for that question. In our supervisory work, they are required to respond to our requests when we are conducting an examination and the requests that we make of the credit bureaus are similar to the request we make of other financial service providers that we oversee through our examination authority.   </p><p>      So that would be we request information such as how they are complying with the law and their compliance management systems, so for example their board and management oversight, their policies and procedures, they are monitoring their training on what audits they're doing so all the elements that go into compliance management system we asked for that general information and then more specifically, we asked for more specific information when were determining particular compliance with particular provisions of the law.   </p><p>      So for example we may need specific information about consumer files when we're doing transaction testings to ensure for example that they were complying with the law in following up on a consumers dispute?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CRAPO</emphasis>:  And my understanding is that the agency is seeking to collect specific credit card transactional data on hundreds of millions of the accounts, is that not correct?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MITHAL</emphasis>:  My understanding, senator, is that a separate part of the Bureau, it's research arm, collects in a credit panel the identified information on consumers for research purposes.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CRAPO</emphasis>:  But you're not in a position to describe exactly what they are collecting?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MITHAL</emphasis>:  Correct, we need to follow up with you and get you the details on that.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CRAPO</emphasis>:  All right. Do you know -- well, let me go back again to the information that you are familiar with. Is the data that you are requiring provided by mandate or is it purchased?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MITHAL</emphasis>:  So on their -- the area that I work in, supervision, the legal requirement under Dodd Frank is that they are required to respond to supervisory request for the information we need to...   </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CRAPO</emphasis>:  All right. And are there other private sector entities that are required to provide that in addition to the credit bureaus, and what are they? For example credit card companies, banks, others?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TWOHIG</emphasis>:  So there's various provisions of different kinds of law that do require reporting to the Bureau. I believe for example under the Card Act, credit card issuers are required to provide their agreements that the bureau posts on the website, I'm not familiar sitting here right now with all the different provisions that might require reporting to the Bureau but there's a number of different requirements that would come into play.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CRAPO</emphasis>:  All right, I appreciate that and just quickly, I only got about a minute left so if you can just give me about a 30-second answer sort of a high-level answer as to what have we learned from the Equifax data breach about what we need to do from here.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TWOHIG</emphasis>:  So Senator, I can tell you that even though the bureau's investigations are not public, in this instance, it is a matter of public record that the bureau is investigating Equifax, we are coordinating with the FTC on that investigation so that's in process. So I think it's premature to really answer that question.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CRAPO</emphasis>:  All right. Ms Mithal?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MITHAL</emphasis>:  So like Ms Twohig, I can't comment on the specifics, but what I can say is two things. One is that credit, we learned that credit bureaus do hold the most sensitive information about consumers available in the marketplace and it is incumbent on these credit bureaus to protect that information.   </p><p>      And second, I think that in terms of the big data breaches, I think the FTC could use more authority to seek civil penalties against companies that don't -- that violates the laws that we enforce.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CRAPO</emphasis>:  All right, thank you.   </p><p>      And Senator Brown has indicated that he wants to yield his first slot to Senator Schatz, so Senator Schatz, please go ahead.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCHATZ</emphasis>:  Thank you, Chairman, and thank you to the Ranking Member Brown, and I promise I won't make a habit out of this. I appreciate it very much, thank you very much for your testimony.   </p><p>      Ms. Twohig, I wanted to follow up on something that Ms Mithal described, there was an FTC report that found that 5 percent of credit reports contain confirmed material errors.   </p><p>      So these are confirmed material errors that there are more errors than that, but even if it's just 5 percent, that is the bare minimum of confirmed material errors, you are talking about 10 million people and worse than that, two years later, 84 percent of those errors remain on the credit reports.   </p><p>      Can you tell me a little bit about what your supervisory work is entailing and what you found as it relates to the accuracy and dispute resolution?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TWOHIG</emphasis>:  Thank you for that question, Senator. I'd be happy to talk about that.   </p><p>      As I said, because of the concerns about credit report accuracy, the Bureau did its first rule to identify what larger participants in the marketplace was going to establish a non-bank supervision program for that wasn't already in the statute with respect to credit bureaus, consumer reporting agencies, because of the priority that the Bureau gave to look into that market and to be able to apply first ever supervisory authority on that industry.   </p><p>      So they had never been before the Bureau, been examined by any federal or state regulator. And we prioritize that and we have been conducting that work and so we've been very focused on looking at their compliance with the accuracy in the dispute resolution provisions of the FCRA.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCHATZ</emphasis>:  And what have you found?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TWOHIG</emphasis>:  And we found that in general, as a big picture matter, supervision is an attempt to get companies to have a preventive -- to prevent law violations, to have a proactive approach to compliance to make sure that they had their compliance house in order so that violations don't occur in the first place.   </p><p>      We think we've made progress in shifting their attitude and culture toward more of a proactive compliance posture, but we have found problems with their compliance with the law and we have given them directives to improve where we found they have fallen short and we have seen improvements over time. But that's not to say there isn't more work to do, Senator.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCHATZ</emphasis>:  Thank you. Ms. Mithal, Senator Kennedy and I have a bill that would give consumers more tools to manage their credit reports and I think it's really important for this committee especially for Republicans on this committee to recognize that we all know that we can't blow up the system, that although there are consumer problems related to these credit bureaus, we still need some measure of credit worthiness and were not intending to be so disruptive as to create problems in lending.   </p><p>      But there are some basic things that we can do to empower consumers and I want to make sure that they're not customers, they have not enlisted, people, generally speaking, do not sign up with these credit bureaus, but they are consumers. And our bill tries to empower consumers to for instance know what the credit bureaus know, to be able to see those same lines and to have an online portal that is not so labyrinthed in that allows a person to resolve any dispute in a straightforward manner.   </p><p>      Is it fair to say, Ms. Mithal, that you support the goals of this legislation?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MITHAL</emphasis>:  Absolutely. I think credit report accuracy -- inaccuracy issues continue to harm those consumers that are affected by it, not only is it that on the lack of credit in the future, it's the time and expense it takes to clear up their credit reports so I think the tool you're aiming to provide consumers through your bill, those are the types of tools that are absolutely worth considering.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCHATZ</emphasis>:  Can you talk a little bit about the importance of an online portal?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MITHAL</emphasis>:  Sure, so I think one of the problems for consumers is that it's very difficult to know how to navigate the credit reporting system. And so I think the easier we can make it for consumers the more tools we could provide for them, the more one-stop shop we can provide for them, I think that's very consistent with as you said, the kind of free flow of credit information through this.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCHATZ</emphasis>:  One final question which I think I will take for the record for both of you, it's sort of twofold. First, we should draw a distinction between breaches which create credit score problems and credit inaccuracies and the endemic problem of these credit bureaus basically getting it wrong anywhere from 5 percent to 15 percent of the time but at least 5 percent of the time in a material way.   </p><p>      So although the Equifax breach caused us to think about these bureaus and focus on that question, this is not a cybersecurity question exclusively, it's also a basic consumer rights question so my question for the record is what specifically are the pain points for consumers as they go about trying to resolve these questions and I've run out of time and I appreciate indulgence of the chair and the ranking member.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CRAPO</emphasis>:  Thank you. Senator Scott?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCOTT</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman and thank you to the witnesses for being here today. I've worked for the last six or seven years on something called the opportunity agenda, trying to find a way to empower those folks living in distressed communities as you probably both know, we have about 50 million Americans today who live in those distressed communities and as I think about ways to empower those folks living in distressed communities, the access to credit issue jumps out very clearly.   </p><p>      The BCFP has found that 26 million Americans are credit invisible, another 19 million Americans are unscorable because their information is either insufficient and/or just too old. It should come as no surprise that there is a strong correlation between your income and whether you have a credit score or credit record.   </p><p>      Almost 30 percent of Americans living in low income areas are credit invisible, an additional 15 percent of Americans living in those areas are unscorable. In South Carolina when you combine those two numbers together, that means about one -- nearly one out of every four South Carolina adults are in that category.   </p><p>      A solution to bring credit invisibles out of the shadows is S3040, the Credit Access and Inclusion Act.   </p><p>      Credit invisible's regularly make payments for their rent, gas, water, electricity, and cell phones. New credit scoring models recognize these payments are payments that are predictive of your actual credit risk. Unfortunately the FCRA ensures that missed payments and collection are reported to the credit bureaus but not necessarily the ones you make on time.   </p><p>      The Brookings Institution states that the consideration of this payment data will lead to a 21 percent increase to prime credit for those earning less than $20,000 a year and a 15 percent increase to prime credit for those earning between $20,000 and $30,000 a year, that will make a huge difference for credit worthy folks trying to climb the economic ladder, and my bill helps us get there.   </p><p>      Ms. Twohig, what is the impact on the consumer of being credit invisible when it comes to interest rates, applying for job or finding an apartment?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TWOHIG</emphasis>:  Senator, first of all, I want to say that the Bureau shares your concern about access to credit, in fact, one of the Bureau's strategic goals is to ensure that all consumers have access to consumer financial services.   </p><p>      With respect to the particular impact, the particular impact will vary for each consumer and what they're applying for and what they're trying to do in the particular credit or other markets, but I think it is fair to say that if the consumer does not have credit filed with one of the national credit reporting companies or if it doesn't have enough in that file to score, then that consumer is basically shut out of the mainstream credit markets.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCOTT</emphasis>:  Well, that kind of relates to my second question, the BCFP has suggested that more of this information at the credit bureaus will help credit invisibles access mainstream credit sources, sounds like you would concur that that would be accurate.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TWOHIG</emphasis>:  So alternative data of the type you're discussing is also something that the Bureau is interested in learning more about and is monitoring. In fact, the Bureau issued last year a request for information from the public to get information about different kinds of alternative data and the aspects of that alternative data and how it could help consumers and access to credit. We received over 100 comments, we're currently monitoring that information and studying that information and learning more about it, but I think also it's fair to say that if that information is accurate and predictive, then that could be part of the solution to increase access to credit.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCOTT</emphasis>:  Thank you. I will just say to my Chairman and the Ranking Member who I know both have a passion for finding ways of bringing those folks who are today credit invisible out of the shadows and into a place where they can rely on a strong credit score to be able to have lower interest rates, greater access to better jobs, and certainly be able to find places to live in higher quality communities and all that is anchored in how your credit score and not being credit invisible.   </p><p>      So hopefully, S3040 will be on the top of the docket both of you. Thank you both.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CRAPO</emphasis>:  Thank you, Senator Scott.   </p><p>      Senator Menendez.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MENENDEZ</emphasis>:  Thank you.   </p><p>      Ms. Twohig and Ms. Mithal, let me start off by asking you each to give me the last four digits of your Social Security number?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TWOHIG</emphasis>:  Senator, I really don't want to do that in a public forum.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MITHAL</emphasis>:  I have the same reaction.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MENENDEZ</emphasis>:  All right, how about telling me which stores you opened the credit cards with?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TWOHIG</emphasis>:  Which stores?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MENENDEZ</emphasis>:  Yes.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TWOHIG</emphasis>:  I don't think I have opened any credit card with a store lately.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MITHAL</emphasis>:  That is not something I would be willing to share in a public forum.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MENENDEZ</emphasis>:  Or maybe can you tell us the outstanding balance in your home mortgage loans?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TWOHIG</emphasis>:  Senator, I'd prefer not to say that kind of information either.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MITHAL</emphasis>:  The same.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MENENDEZ</emphasis>:  I'm not surprised but that information which I'm sure you would want to be shared or sold without your permission, and yet under current law, consumer reporting agencies like Equifax can share and sell your information, where you live, where you pay your bills and whether you pay it on time, what you filed for, whether you filed for bankruptcy without ever having to get your consent. Isn't that right?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TWOHIG</emphasis>:  That is correct, although there are certain limitations on how they can use the data.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MENENDEZ</emphasis>:  Now, America consumers are at the mercy of three mega companies who control the security and safety of their personal information, that makes no sense, consumers should have the ability to control when how and to whom their data is shared just like you want to control it here in this public forum.   </p><p>      Last year, a massive Equifax data breach laid bare the systemic problems with the credit reporting industry. Its failure to guard sensitive data left 145.5 million Americans exposed to identity theft and fraud. Ms. Mithal, Equifax waited an inexplicable six weeks to disclose the breach that had occurred, worse over months after the breach millions of consumers were still unaware of the breach in part because there's no national requirement to alert consumers.   </p><p>      My bill, S2188 the Consumer Data Protection Act would require consumer reporting agency to quickly notify the Federal Trade Commission, the CFPB law enforcement and consumers of a breach while keeping intact existing strong state consumer protection laws. Generally speaking, does the FTC support the idea of requiring companies to provide notification to consumers where there is a data security breach?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MITHAL</emphasis>:  Absolutely, and the commission has done so for almost a for over a decade and a bipartisan basis.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MENENDEZ</emphasis>:  Now let me ask you another issue we need to address here is the ability to hold consumer reporting agencies accountable when there is a breach, when they have failed, clearly failed to protect consumers personal data, my legislation also provides FTC the authority to pursue fines against a consumer reporting agency such as Equifax that negligently, knowingly, or willingly causes a data breach. In your view, would the institution of a monetary penalty framework, incentivize consumer reporting agencies to better secure consumer data?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MITHAL</emphasis>:  Yes.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MENENDEZ</emphasis>:  Let me ask another question for both witnesses, given the unique and varied nature of consumer harm that results from a data breach at a consumer reporting agency which includes everything from identity theft to difficulty purchasing a home or securing employment, would it be helpful to have a comprehensive study analyzing both the immediate and long-term costs and damages to individuals affected by data breaches at consumer reporting agencies?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MITHAL</emphasis>:  So I think that there's no question that there's tremendous harm to consumers from data breaches of their sensitive information I think it would be worth considering a study to quantify that harm.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MENENDEZ</emphasis>:  Ms. Twohig?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TWOHIG</emphasis>:  I would agree with Ms. Mithal and to the extent the Bureau can be helpful providing technical expertise in analyzing that topic, we would be happy to do so.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MENENDEZ</emphasis>:  Well, thank you. I really didn't want to know your social security number or your balances on your mortgage which I hope is virtually nil, but this is the very essence of what we're talking about as we deal with this issue here today.   </p><p>      Thank you, Mr. Chairman.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CRAPO</emphasis>:  Senator Kennedy.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KENNEDY</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Ms. Mithal, can we agree that the work of the CRAs facilitates commerce in America?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MITHAL</emphasis>:  Absolutely.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KENNEDY</emphasis>:  Do you agree with that to, Ms. Twohig?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TWOHIG</emphasis>:  Yes.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KENNEDY</emphasis>:  And I think we can also agree can we not that that's a good thing...   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MITHAL</emphasis>:  Yes.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KENNEDY</emphasis>:  In our free enterprise system?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MITHAL</emphasis>:  Yes.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KENNEDY</emphasis>:  When the CRA's gather information about me, do they ask my permission?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TWOHIG</emphasis>:  No.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MITHAL</emphasis>:  No.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KENNEDY</emphasis>:  Do they pay me the information?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TWOHIG</emphasis>:  No.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MITHAL</emphasis>:  No.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KENNEDY</emphasis>:  They gather this information and they assign me a score basically make an evaluation, a judgment about me whether I'm credit worthy person or not. Is that correct?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MITHAL</emphasis>:  Correct.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KENNEDY</emphasis>:  And in 5 percent to 10 percent of the cases they get it wrong, they have some bad data, is that correct?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MITHAL</emphasis>:  Yes.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KENNEDY</emphasis>:  If they have bad data and I call them up and say hey you got bad data on me, you didn't talk to me first, I could have fixed this upfront but you didn't talk to me but you got some bad data on it on me and it's affecting my life and my family's life. And the credit, the CRA says okay will get back to you and they never get back to me or they get back to me and say we disagree. What is my recourse?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MITHAL</emphasis>:  So under the FCRA, there's a dispute process where the credit reporting agency is required to respond within a particular amount of time and on the let the end of the day when the credit bureau says that no, you in fact, owe this debt, the consumer owes the debt.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TWOHIG</emphasis>:  That is right, the consumer can put a statement on their credit report if they are not satisfied with the results, the dispute...   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KENNEDY</emphasis>:  How long does that take?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MITHAL</emphasis>:  I believe under the FCRA, the investigation process is 30 to 45 days.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TWOHIG</emphasis>:  That is right.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KENNEDY</emphasis>:  I have to fill out a bunch of forms, do I?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TWOHIG</emphasis>:  Yes.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KENNEDY</emphasis>:  Okay, how long do you think it takes to fill out all those forms and make the phone calls and say, hey, you got my information wrong?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TWOHIG</emphasis>:  So I think there is certainly some time it takes on the part of the consumer to kind of understand the dispute process, to go through the dispute process and implement it.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KENNEDY</emphasis>:  And if I got a day job I can't do that at work, right?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TWOHIG</emphasis>:  Yes, it's certainly a lot of time to expense to dispute...   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KENNEDY</emphasis>:  Can I do it at night or weekend, can I call them up on the weekends? Do the CRA work in the weekend, do you know?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TWOHIG</emphasis>:  I believe to have an online portal that you can file a dispute online and submit documents now, you can submit, the consumers can submit documents in support of their dispute online.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KENNEDY</emphasis>:  Okay, and let's suppose at the end of the process, they come back to me and they say no, we're not changing anything or I know this doesn't happen very often but you get somebody having a bad day and they say, we are not changing anything and by the way we don't care, because we don't have to, you are not my cousin.   </p><p>      What would I do?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TWOHIG</emphasis>:  So, I think, speaking for the...   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KENNEDY</emphasis>:  Do I file a complaint with the FTC?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TWOHIG</emphasis>:  Sure, you can file a complaint with the FTC?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KENNEDY</emphasis>:  Do I need a lawyer?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TWOHIG</emphasis>:  No, you don't need a lawyer?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KENNEDY</emphasis>:  Does it take time, you got a fair -- I bet it's not a one page form, is it?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TWOHIG</emphasis>:  Yes, it takes time.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KENNEDY</emphasis>:  It's not a one-page form, is it?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TWOHIG</emphasis>:  It's multiple pages.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KENNEDY</emphasis>:  And how quickly would the FTC act?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TWOHIG</emphasis>:  It would take a while.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KENNEDY</emphasis>:  Like how long is a while?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TWOHIG</emphasis>:  It could take -- so let me just clarify, we don't act on behalf of individual consumers...   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KENNEDY</emphasis>:  I understand, how long would it take.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TWOHIG</emphasis>:  It would take several months to investigate probably...   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KENNEDY</emphasis>:  It could take a year, doesn't it? It could take two years sometimes, doesn't it?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TWOHIG</emphasis>:  Sure.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KENNEDY</emphasis>:  In the meantime, they got bad data about me.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TWOHIG</emphasis>:  Yes.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KENNEDY</emphasis>:  And they didn't pay me for it, they didn't even ask me.   </p><p>      Now, I think CRAs perform an important service and do facilitate commerce but it seems to me that we ought to be smart enough particularly with technology to come up with the system that says, we are going to make it as easy as possible for the people with respect to whom the CRAs have bad information. So they can -- those people can get it fixed and they can get it fixed quickly and I can get it fixed efficiently and they can get it fixed inexpensively and they can get it fixed so they don't have to miss the kids' ballgames.   </p><p>      Now, I'm like Senator Schatz, and I have a bill that will do that, what is wrong with that bill?   </p><p>      I think it's a good bill, don't you?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MITHAL</emphasis>:  I do think it's a good bill and I would support the goals of the legislation which is to, as you articulated, to make it a lot easier for consumers to file disputes of consumer reporting agencies.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KENNEDY</emphasis>:  Ms Twohig?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TWOHIG</emphasis>:  Senator, I would say that all the issues you just pointed out are the reason why we prioritized at the bureau, supervising both the CRAs and furnishers...   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KENNEDY</emphasis>:  Yes, ma'am, I know you are prioritizing, I'm not fuzzing at you, but you are still part of the bureaucracy, and it's pretty intimidating for the average American who didn't ask to be brought into this system, it's a good system, but it's pretty intimidating when the CRAs get it wrong.   </p><p>      And we ought to make it as easy as possible for them to get it fixed. That is good for them, that is good for the companies, that is good for the free enterprise system, and I think we can do better.   </p><p>      Thank you, Mr. Chairman.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CRAPO</emphasis>:  Thank you. Senator Warner?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARNER</emphasis>:  Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman.   </p><p>      First of all, thank you for holding this hearing, I think you're hearing bipartisan concern and I want to thank the ranking member for also yielding to us. I also want to point out though that Ms. Twohig and Ms. Mithal are longtime professionals, I think they would lean in to being willing to try to help us fix this problem, but they can't fix this problem on their own without Congress acting.   </p><p>      So I want to reiterate what I think a lot of members have made -- I had to choice in Equifax having my data, Senator Menendez raised this, Senator Kennedy has, Senator Schatz has, to me as a former business guy, it is remarkable that a data breach based upon sloppy cybersecurity standards that took place over year ago, the public wasn't notified until 11 months ago that we still, and this is not your fault at this point, if Congress hasn't acted, if they had paid no penalty, (inaudible) took a little hit in the market, but they have almost recovered back because they don't expect Congress to do its job to give the FTC the ability to put a civil penalty process in place.   </p><p>      Now Senator Warren and I have a very comprehensive bill that I'm sure she will speak to as well that would put a liability regime in place that would particularly in the event of negligent behavior, put a real incentive to make sure that credit reporting agencies up their game and let me, just again for the record, Ms. Mithal, the FTC at this point does not have the ability to put any civil penalty on a CRA based on performance, do they?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MITHAL</emphasis>:  Not on the basis of data security violations generally, no.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARNER</emphasis>:  So unless the Congress acts, whether it's Senator Warren's bill, Senator Menendez' bill, Senator Kennedy's bill, Schatz' bill, you don't have the tool, as a matter of fact, if we go and look at the so called safeguards rule that we've heard from Ms. Twohig's testimony that CFPB does not have authority under the safeguards rule to examine or look at the practices of the CRA, Ms. Mithal, does the FTC have the authority under the safeguards rule to examine credit reporting agencies to ensure that rule is being followed?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MITHAL</emphasis>:  So just to be clear, we don't have examination authority, but we can investigates CRA to make sure that they are following language (ph) by safeguard rules, but significantly as you pointed out, we do not have the authority to seek civil penalties under the safeguards rule.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARNER</emphasis>:  Right, and if memory serves, I'm sure Senator Kennedy remembers as well, FTC indicated they had opened an investigation into the Equifax breach but here we are over a year after the breach took place and at 11 months after the public was finally notified yet we still don't have a result in even if you come up with a result you don't have the ability to impose penalties because you have no liability regime in place.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MITHAL</emphasis>:  Not under data security, yes.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARNER</emphasis>:  Mr. Chairman, I think this is an area because I can assure you that sitting from the intel side, this is a problem that is not going to go away, this is a problem that is going to only exponentially increase and Senator Menendez went down the path of would you be willing to offer your personal information, you wouldn't, but if somebody has hacked in and got that information from Equifax and contacts you with that personalized information and you combine that with the next realm of misinformation, disinformation and you suddenly have a live stream video of what appears to be the face of somebody you recognize popping up on your social media account asking you to do something, either invest in some company vote for some candidate, you put those two together and you have a potential crisis that goes well beyond just financial concerns.   </p><p>      And if we don't act, I think we are going to be irresponsible in ensuring that kind of activity doesn't take place and because they -- I agree with Senator Kennedy, the incentives are not there at all for any CRA to clean up its act.   </p><p>      There are no civil penalties, there's no liability regime, and I think we can do better and I think these professionals actually would want us to do better if we would give them the tools. And let me just in my last 30 seconds though, Senator Scott raised this question about some of the folks who were on bank (ph), I am concerned as well as we think through -- Ms. Mithal, this is for you, you know, as we start looking at the use of artificial intelligence, machine learning, there is going to be a lot of tools used particularly by non-bank financial institutions who may provide credit lending, how we make sure that we ensure fairness in this new regime.   </p><p>      But at this moment in time, it's again I don't believe the FTC has the appropriate ability to look at non-bank financial institution whose using AI techniques to grant a loan under (FICRA), is that correct?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MITHAL</emphasis>:  So we did do report on this issue a few years ago and we did mention that there are certain circumstances when companies use AI technology to make decisions about credit or housing employment eligibility that we would have authority to take action under the FCRA, but that is against a limited set of entities that are third party using the information. So there's some gaps there.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARNER</emphasis>:  And I would only say, Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member, that if we think what's happened with Equifax was something, wait until you see the non-bank financial start to use AI in the sophisticated way and if we don't get ahead of this in terms of -- we ought to be able to use the data and good information but if we don't put some rules in place, the Equifax breach will pale in comparison to what the next generation of the attacks will look like.   </p><p>      Thank you, Mr. Chairman.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CRAPO</emphasis>:  I share your concern, Senator Warner.   </p><p>      Senator Warren.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  Thank you very much Mr. Chairman, thanks for holding this hearing, thank you Ranking Member Brown for letting us go ahead of you here. You know, I'm going to pick up on the same theme that my colleagues have been talking about. After Equifax disclosed its massive data breach last year, I sent letters to Equifax and the other large credit bureaus and federal regulators seeking information about the breach and the options for holding Equifax accountable.   </p><p>      My staff compiled that information in an investigative report that my office issued in February and I'd like to submit a copy of that report for the record, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Chairman? Without objection.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CRAPO</emphasis>:  Without objection.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CRAPO</emphasis>:  What did I just agree to?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  We are done.   </p><p>      So we put this report together, one of the key findings of this report is that federal agencies don't have the legal tools they need to stop data breaches at credit bureaus and hold credit bureaus accountable for compromising sensitive personal information.   </p><p>      As Senator Warner was just pointing, out the FTC has some authority to oversee data security at credit bureaus but it currently has no authority to seek civil penalties against the bureaus for compromising consumer information. So let me just ask Ms. Mithal, do you think the FTC should have that authority?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MITHAL</emphasis>:  Yes.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  Good. Thank you.   </p><p>      In fact the response the FTC sent to my letter specifically requested legislation that would \"allow the FTC to seek civil penalties to help ensure effective deterrence of cyber security breaches\" so asking for it. Meanwhile CFPB has some supervisory authority over large credit bureaus but limited ability to issue rules on how the bureaus must safeguard sensitive consumer data. Is that right, Ms. Twohig?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TWOHIG</emphasis>:  That is correct.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  Good. In other words, even if CFPB spots serious cyber security problems at the credit bureaus it supervises, it cannot issue new rules to try to address these problems, is that right?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TWOHIG</emphasis>:  So we do not have the authority under the safeguards provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act or the safeguards rule.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  Okay so in response to my letter to the CFPB, then Director Cordray said that the agency supported new legislation because \"federal laws that are applicable to data security have not kept pace with technological and cyber security developments\" in other words, we want the authority to do this.   </p><p>      So after receiving these responses, Senator Warner and I spent months working with each other and with experts in the field to develop the data breach prevention and compensation act, our bill would authorize the FTC to impose large and automatic penalties on any large credit bureau that allowed sensitive consumer information to be accessed.   </p><p>      The way we see it, if credit bureaus collect our personal information without our permission, then they should have an absolute obligation to protect data from hackers and thieves. The bill would also create a new office of cyber security at the FTC with responsibility to establish cyber security standards at credit bureaus and supervise compliance with those standards.   </p><p>      Ms. Mithal, do you think the FTC would be better equipped to oversee how credit bureaus protect sensitive information if Senator Warner's and my bill became law?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MITHAL</emphasis>:  So I certainly I do think we had the expertise, I think it's a question of resources and so your law comes with resources, that would be welcome.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  Good, fair enough. Fair enough.   </p><p>      But you got to have the authority you can't do anything.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MITHAL</emphasis>:  Correct.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  So, thank you. Mr. Chairman, I know that you and many of your Republican colleagues on his committee are concerned about the lack of adequate protection of consumer data at credit bureaus and I hope you'll work with Senator Warner and with me to push this legislation forward.   </p><p>      Our federal agencies have made it absolutely clear that they need more legal authority to protect consumers, we can't just cross our fingers and hope that another breach doesn't happen because another breach will happen and if we fail to act, then we bear some responsibility for that.   </p><p>      More of our constituents will be harmed unless Congress acts so I urge you to join with Senator Warner and me and others on this committee to try to push our bill forward.   </p><p>      Thank you, Mr. Chairman.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CRAPO</emphasis>:  Thank you, Senator Warren.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  Thank you.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CRAPO</emphasis>:  Senator Cortez Masto?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CORTEZ MASTO</emphasis>:  Thank you. Thank you Mr. Chair and Ranking Member for, I agree, this important discussion and thank you to both of you for being here and all of the work that you do.   </p><p>      I'm curious, last and I want to talk a little bit about exclusive contracts, last October right after the announcement of Equifax's massive data breach the New York Times ran an article about how Equifax and Freddie Mac have an exclusive relationship that harms both consumers and small businesses, I'm curious if either one of you are familiar with that article or familiar with this concept that there are exclusive contracts?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MITHAL</emphasis>:  I'm not.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TWOHIG</emphasis>:  I'm not familiar either.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CORTEZ MASTO</emphasis>:  So this isn't something that either one of your organization is looking into is something that is harmful to individual consumers or small businesses.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MITHAL</emphasis>:  I can only speak to privacy and cyber security issues and that is not something that is on our radar screen.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TWOHIG</emphasis>:  And for the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection and as I said at the outset we can confirm that we're investigating Equifax's data security practices in coordination with the FTC, beyond that our investigations are not public.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CORTEZ MASTO</emphasis>:  Yes, thank you very much.   </p><p>      And Ms. Twohig, let me jump back then to the concept of -- and I agree with my colleagues that -- this concern that all this data is being collected on all of us individually and we had no control over it.   </p><p>      So Ms. Twohig, let me start with you, as you well know, there is criticisms around the world had different standards for consumer control of their own privacy, for instance, the new privacy laws in the European Union provide more privacy options than we do here in the United States. In fact, Americans have really little say over what data can be aggregated by these credit bureaus.   </p><p>      If an opt in system for credit bureaus was established, how would that impact people, our communities, and our economy? In other words also in and as you address that, what is the reaction we are seeing to the implementation of the general data protection regulations in the European Union.   </p><p>      And the reason I bring this up is because we've all been talking about opt in, but there is this concern that somehow it is going to be -- have some -- an impact on our economy, on our businesses and so I'm curious if you have any insight into that either one of you, and let me start with you, Mr. Twohig.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TWOHIG</emphasis>:  So at the outset, I would say that the Economic Growth and Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act provides additional important consumer protections in my view to allow consumers to get a free security freeze and so even though that's not exactly what...   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CORTEZ MASTO</emphasis>:  That is not an opt in.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TWOHIG</emphasis>:  That is not an opt in, but it's one step toward more control if consumers choose to exercise it.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CORTEZ MASTO</emphasis>:  But it's less than what the European Union requires?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TWOHIG</emphasis>:  I believe so.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CORTEZ MASTO</emphasis>:  Any other?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MITHAL</emphasis>:  Yes, I guess I would say that I would have a bit of a concern about an across the board opt in. And I could see people who have a bad credit history or who have criminal records, or bankruptcy is not waning that infrastructure to be reported and is not opting into the system.   </p><p>      And I think that could raise the credit across the board. So I do have some concerns about that, I agree with the general concept that consumers should have more control, but there are potential means of accomplishing that.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CORTEZ MASTO</emphasis>:  Do you think some of the legislation you've heard today gives more of that control to consumers?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MITHAL</emphasis>:  I think there are some very interesting options worth exploring through that legislation.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CORTEZ MASTO</emphasis>:  Thank you, I appreciate that.   </p><p>      And let me also then go back to this idea, I agree with my colleague, Senator Scott, and the concern about too many adults have credit invisible and unscorable credit, and I think that is harmful in so many different ways.   </p><p>      But I also understand, Ms. Twohig, from what you said that you are studying the issue that the agency is studying the issue on alternative to data.   </p><p>      Can you talk a little bit more about that and when you are going to anticipate completion of that study and what your intent is after your -- the study is completed?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TWOHIG</emphasis>:  So I don't have a particular date and I'm not sure there is a particular study, it's just something that the bureau is very interested in and has requested information so we could learn more about that.   </p><p>      I can tell you that the acting director has created an office of innovation with the goal of seeing what the bureau can do to spur innovation in all kinds of ways and that would include the use of alternative data and avenues for increasing access to credit.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CORTEZ MASTO</emphasis>:  Okay, thank you. And then one final question, I know that a number of states just recently announced that a consent order last week with Equifax and I believe these states really took the lead on this and did their necessary investigation.   </p><p>      One of the reasons why I have concerns that there needs to be more of this collaboration between states and the federal government in this area is because I have seen here as we have had these hearings that state oversight is ever more necessary now, what I have seen from Director Mulvaney and really the CFPB nominee, Kraninger have not shown any willingness to challenge financial services industry.   </p><p>      So given what I know and what I have seen here, let me ask you this. There is a legislation in the house, that is HR3626, and it requires enhancing information sharing between federal and state regulators when conducting the TSP exams. Would that be something you would support and I'm asking both of you?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TWOHIG</emphasis>:  So I can say as a general matter than, and I've been with the bureau since the beginning in the supervision program, we have placed a priority on developing relationships with state regulators and my (inaudible) colleague is the same for the state attorneys general, and so we have close and cooperative relationships with those regulators and the acting director has said he wants to improve that even more.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CORTEZ MASTO</emphasis>:  That is wonderful to hear. Thank you.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MITHAL</emphasis>:  And I would echo that sentiment and I just want to also say that I think we have been talking a lot about gaps in the FTC's authority but I do want to say whatever authority congress gives us, we exercise very aggressively. So we brought over 60 data security cases and we looked at a variety of sectors so I didn't want to make it sound like we were sitting on our hands.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CORTEZ MASTO</emphasis>:  Thank you. And I notice my time is up. Thank you both.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CRAPO</emphasis>:  Thank you. Senator Jones.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JONES</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you for the witnesses for coming here today. I want to mention something about today, I want to go back to cybersecurity like so many others but from a little bit different angle.   </p><p>      And I appreciate all of the colleagues on this committee concerned with the Equifaxes of the world and the holders of this information. But you know, I'm an old prosecutor, and when we have a bank robbery, we just didn't focus on what happened at the bank, we focused on who got the money and trying to catch those folks.   </p><p>      So my question is and we heard a lot today about Equifax and CRAs, is law enforcement involved in that investigation, and if so, if they are not, I would like to know why, and if so, can we have an expectation at some point when these investigation is released that there has been an effort and we hopefully can find out who did this but I agree with Senator Warner, this problem is not going away and we need to focus on perpetrators as much as those holding the date.   </p><p>      I will give that to both of you.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MITHAL</emphasis>:  Do I don't think I can talk about this in the context of the specific nonpublic investigation but what I can't say that we work very closely with criminal authorities, I think it's a kind of a one-two punch type situation where we want make sure as a civil matter that agencies and companies that are entrusted in the consumer data are doing everything they can to protect it and at the same time, we work with criminal law enforcement authority to catch the bad guys and to try to share information to accomplish that.   </p><p>      So I agree it's a very important part of the equation.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TWOHIG</emphasis>:  And that would be the same for the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection in terms of coordinating with criminal law enforcement agencies.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JONES</emphasis>:  When this investigation is public would you expect there to be some element of the report about the culprits in this particular Equifax matter?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TWOHIG</emphasis>:  I really can't speak to that.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JONES</emphasis>:  All right, that's fair enough.   </p><p>      All right, the other thing I like to mention is that a recent study showed that Alabama, my state, ranked third from the bottom in terms of average credit score and I know there are a lot of things that impact credit scores but what seem clear is that there were also regional differences that remain kind of static and one of the CFPB and FTC both have tools to educate customers which I think is as important as anything in trying to get folks to get their scores up, I see TV ads all the time but that's not the same to try to get your free credit score is not the same as trying to say get your free credit score up.   </p><p>      So could you both briefly describe some of the tools that your agencies have with regard to education and what you believe to be the most effective way to educate the public about how to maintain a good credit score?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MITHAL</emphasis>:  So I can start with that. And so we have what I believe is a world-class Office Of Consumer Business Education and one of the things we do is we put out our financial literacy materials, materials about credit scores and how to check your credit reports. And I think what we recognize that -- is a lot of people not know the FTC and so they feel a lot more comfortable getting this information from their local communities, their churches, their schools, their libraries, and so we do not copyright our information, we put out there for the local communities to put out their own communities and we would be happy to work with your office to get our materials to you.   </p><p>      We are also members of an interagency financial literacy task force. So again I think we are trying, I think I absolutely agree that education is a very important part of what we do and we need to get the word out to consumers so they can help protect themselves.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JONES</emphasis>:  Great. Well, do you want to address that, Ms. Twohig?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TWOHIG</emphasis>:  Same for the bureau, consumer education is a very important part of what we do and we have materials and educational materials about how to create a credit file so consumers can have access to mainstream credit. Our community affairs office is also doing active work in certain communities to try to help on the communities to understand what they can do locally to help consumers understand how they can create and build their credit files and positive credit history.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JONES</emphasis>:  Great. Thank you both and my staff will reach out to you to try to so that we can do some affirmative things in Alabama. And the remaining moment I just like to follow back up with what Senator Scott said about the bill that he and I have introduced on the Credit Access Inclusion Act and Mr. Chairman and Senator Brown, I would also urge this committee to get involved and try to get that bill out, a companion bill that's I think identical, passed the house unanimously and in an era which the divide over Supreme Court nominations and things like that are about to get great greater, I don't want a bill that is a truly bipartisan bill to fall through the cracks like this and I would urge the committee to take some action let's get that done.   </p><p>      So thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CRAPO</emphasis>:  Thank you, Senator Jones.   </p><p>      Senator Van Hollen.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">VAN HOLLEN</emphasis>:  Thank you Mr. Chairman and ranking member and thank you both for your testimony here today.   </p><p>      We talked about a number things. Two of the categories we talked about, one how do we create more incentives to discourage or prevent, deter credit rating agencies from becoming victims of data breaches? Obviously no one has interest in having a big data breach but the cost-benefit analysis needs to be changed and that is what Senators Warner and Warren have been talking about.   </p><p>      The other issue I would Senator Kennedy and Senator Schatz have been talking about is the accuracy of the information collected by the credit ratings agency and I want to focus on that for a moment because, yes, I absolutely agree that we should make it easier for consumers to try to get their complaints submitted and processed more quickly, but it still appears to me that when you look at the sort of incentives of the CRAs that when they get it wrong, other than making the consumer whole again or correcting the error, they don't seem to have any penalty applied.   </p><p>      So let me know if there is a current penalty that can be applied when they get it wrong and we already know that in 5 percent of the cases, they get it wrong which represents millions and millions of Americans which can have a devastating impact on their lives.   </p><p>      So it seems to me in addition to making it easier to remedy the situation from the point of your consumer, we should also create greater incentives for the CRAs to get right in the first place so that the burden is on them when they get it wrong, that there are some penalty to be paid for getting it wrong. Are there any penalties right now that either of you can apply when they -- when you just find that they're getting it wrong a lot?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MITHAL</emphasis>:  So we do have the authority to seek civil policies for companies that don't have reasonable procedures to have maximum possible accuracy. So I have been clarifying that under the FCA (ph), we don't have the authority to get penalties under data security but for accuracy, we do, and we have gotten those civil penalties. But I just want to emphasize the statutory standard, there is reasonable procedures for accuracy so it is not that every accuracy or every inaccuracy in a credit report will get a civil penalty.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">VAN HOLLEN</emphasis>:  Right, would it would it make sense to think of those applying more of the penalty when people get it wrong, in other words as I understand it right now, if you're a consumer whose been -- believes you have bad information that's negatively affecting your credit report, you go to this long process, right? You get on the phone, you may be put on hold, you do what you said, it may take a couple of years, at the end of the day what you the FTC determines is whether or not the consumer's complaint was correct, right?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MITHAL</emphasis>:  So we look to see whether the company's procedures were reasonable. you just look at the reasonable.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">VAN HOLLEN</emphasis>:  You just look at the reasonable nature of that and if you find that they were unreasonable, what do you do to the company?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MITHAL</emphasis>:  So we have gotten civil penalties against several companies sell so one was a couple years ago against the company we had about $2.6 million civil penalty, there is another check authorization company, we got about a $3.5 million civil penalty. So again it depends on the facts and circumstances and we look at several statutory factors in determining the appropriate penalty amount.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">VAN HOLLEN</emphasis>:  Right. Would it be worth looking at greater sort of deterrent mechanisms so that there's more of a burden on the CRAs to get it right in the first place and if so what kind of suggestions would you have?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MITHAL</emphasis>:  So I certainly kind of sympathize with the goal of making it easier for consumers to dispute credit reporting accuracy and also to make the whole process easier for consumers and I think that is a goal worth exploring and I would be happy to work with your staff and others on the committee to accomplish that goal.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">VAN HOLLEN</emphasis>:  All right.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TWOHIG</emphasis>:  So Senator, similarly, the Bureau can get penalties where there's been noncompliance with the FCRA's reasonable procedures provision, in fact brought a case against a consumer reporting agency and got, I believe about 5 million in penalties for their failure to comply with that part of the law. More generally, I think I also sympathize with the problems you're pointing out and that's exactly why we've used this new supervisory authority that has never existed before until the Bureau was created to prioritize looking at the national credit reporting agencies and other consumer reporting agencies for to ensure that they are looking at all aspects of accuracy. There is very different components -- various different components of really what it takes to get a quality data control system, there's the incoming information, there's compiling it and there's monitoring any indications of problems after the fact.   </p><p>      We've broken it down and looked at various aspects and worked through our supervisory authority to require improvements in each part of those pieces of the system.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">VAN HOLLEN</emphasis>:  Good because I think until your -- let's say you're a CRA, until you have to suffer -- right now as the consumer goes to this complaint process and the CRA the end of the okay, they got to make them whole, right, we made a mistake two years ago that's affected your life but there's no other penalty to be applied unless they somehow have a system of that you determine has met this -- that it's been shaky at and even with those systems today, as we know, 5 percent error rate which affects tens of millions of people.   </p><p>      So anyway, I look forward to working with the Chairman, Ranking Member, and all of you. Thanks.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BROWN</emphasis>:  Thank you, Senator Van Hollen.   </p><p>      My questions are for both of you, I have a couple of questions. A lot of people as we know work hard every day, sometimes people working multiple jobs to keep up with their bills, if they're injured, if they fall ill we don't have many, many, many companies in this country on any kind of leave policy, some don't have good health insurance so when people are injured or fall ill, huge unexpected medical costs could haunt their credit report for years. Given this type of debt is generally out of a person's control they obviously didn't choose this, should we not pause medical debt reporting at least until more Americans have access to affordable insurance? I will start with you.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TWOHIG</emphasis>:  So Senator, I think it is correct that medical debt is different than other kinds of debt, it can cause special problems for consumers, they can be subject to medical debt collection when they are just waiting for reimbursement and so I think it is a different kind of debt than regular debt.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BROWN</emphasis>:  That is? Okay. Go ahead.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MITHAL</emphasis>:  I agree with that, and I think the S2155 with an excellent start in at least excluding certain medical debt for veterans and I think this is an idea worth exploring...   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BROWN</emphasis>:  It should be broader than that.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MITHAL</emphasis>:  I think that's an idea worth exploring, yes.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BROCKMAN</emphasis>:  I mentioned partially a follow-up to Senator Cortez Masto, I mentioned Mariner Finance in my opening statements, a company that sends cashable checks to people who might be in financial trouble but the check is as we know it, a high-cost loan. Industry claims these prescreened offers that are the -- they are allowed by their by the FCRA to help borrowers get a better deal and it looks like shady lenders fundamentally are taking advantage of a loophole to target struggling families. Wouldn't consumers be better off and less likely to face predatory lending practices if they had to opt into these offers and to opt in rather than having to take steps to opt out? Let's start with you.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MITHAL</emphasis>:  Sure so I also read the article and I was very troubled by the practices, I can't speak on any particular company but the types of practices that are described in the article were very troubling.   </p><p>      So under the FCRA, prescreened offers are permitted if they are a firm offer of credit and so that is something that the statute specifically allows if congress were to determine the change that, we went we would enforce that requirement as well so that is something that the law currently requires, but again, we would be ready to work with congress in any potential changes in that?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BROWN</emphasis>:  Mr. Twohig.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TWOHIG</emphasis>:  I would agree with that, consumers now have a right to opt out, but as you suggest, Senator, that's different than having to default the other way and we would be happy to work with you to consider whether there is a policy determination do you think would be better for consumers.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BROWN</emphasis>:  That is mostly yes.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TWOHIG</emphasis>:  We would be happy to work with you to consider the pros and cons of going that direction.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BROWN</emphasis>:  That is quite a yes.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TWOHIG</emphasis>:  Not quite a -- yes.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BROWN</emphasis>:  Fair Credit Reporting Act protects companies who provide information to credit bureaus, consumers can't take them to court to get fixed as we know that. we've all heard the horror stories of someone trying to fix inaccurate data on a credit report.   </p><p>      If consumers were allowed to have their day in court, would providers be more careful ensuring the data they report to credit bureaus is accurate, Ms. Twohig?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TWOHIG</emphasis>:  So there is a private right of action under the Fair Credit Reporting Act and there are private actions filed by consumers if they believe that their information is inaccurate. So I just want to make sure I understand what you're...   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BROWN</emphasis>:  There is a private right of action but that private right of action has been, to put it mildly, diluted by this Congress, and by decisions made by government, correct?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TWOHIG</emphasis>:  I can't speak to that, what I can say is that we are well aware at the Bureau of our obligation to ensure compliance with the law which is indeed why we prioritized supervising and enforcement in that area.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BROWN</emphasis>:  I know you do and I appreciate that and I appreciate your service over the years, but don't providers, the credit providers fundamentally know there's not a particularly effective private right of action, do they not know that?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TWOHIG</emphasis>:  I can't speak to what they...   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BROWN</emphasis>:  Well, yes, you can, they know the credit -- the credit providers know about forced arbitration, the credit providers know how the laws have changed, the credit providers know where the power in the society resides, it's not with consumers, it's not with employees, it's with employers, it's with credit reporting companies. You've had a string of really important jobs, you are obviously a really bright woman, you do recognize that, correct?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TWOHIG</emphasis>:  I recognize that it can be hard for an individual consumer and that's actually why I spent my career in public service trying to do what I can do...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BROWN</emphasis>:  I get all that and thank you again for that, but you you're not willing to say that the providers would be more careful ensuring the data they report to credit bureaus is accurate if the laws were written to give consumers more power in the marketplace?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TWOHIG</emphasis>:  They probably would be more careful if the laws were written that way.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BROWN</emphasis>:  Would you like to respond to that too?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MITHAL</emphasis>:  I agree with that Ms. Twohig said.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BROWN</emphasis>:  Which part, the part of...   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MITHAL</emphasis>:  The part that companies...   </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BROWN</emphasis>:  ...question that part?   </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MITHAL</emphasis>:  The part where companies would be more likely to shore up their practices if consumers had more power.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BROWN</emphasis>:  I guess I don't know why a simple yes isn't clear there when credit providers know that the law is mostly the power of the law is mostly on their side and not of the consumer side, you know, (inaudible) the majesty, the law, it prohibits rich people as well as poor people from sleeping under bridges, yeah it does, well, that tells you a lot about where the power in society is and the power more and more is residing with those with more and more power and influence, in privilege, and consumers have less and less of that, it's just so clear to me that they are that the credit providers act worse because they -- because the law so often is on their side and the power resides in them.   </p><p>      Senator Donnelly.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DONNELLY</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman and thank you to the witnesses. On May 24th, the Economic Recovery Regulatory Relief And Consumer Protection Act was signed into law. I negotiated and wrote that legislation along with Chairman Crapo and several of my colleagues here. This new law includes important new consumer protection related to the credit bureaus to benefit servicemembers, veterans and all Americans.   </p><p>      The law provides free credit freezes, credit monitoring for servicemembers and protections for veterans from VA billing delays. I like to highlight these consumer friendly provisions and receive feedback and updates from you on efforts to oversee the implementation and enforcement.   </p><p>      The new law includes a provision to provide free credit monitoring for active duty service members. The FTC was provided one year to complete a rulemaking which will help shape the credit monitoring services provided. Ms. Mithal, I expect the FTC to complete its rulemaking as soon as possible so troops can start receiving this important service. What is the FTC's expected timeline for the rulemaking?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MITHAL</emphasis>:  So Senator, I can assure you we are working as expeditiously as possible to complete the rulemaking and I'm hoping that we would have a notice of proposed rulemaking out by hopefully at least the fall. I don't have complete control over that but that's what I am committing to.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DONNELLY</emphasis>:  Obviously, the sooner, the better.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MITHAL</emphasis>:  Absolutely.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DONNELLY</emphasis>:  Section 301 of the new law includes a section I authored with Senator Purdue to allow every American to freeze and unfreeze their credit free of charge and set year-long fraud alerts. Additionally the FTC in the major credit bureaus have to set up webpages where consumers can easily freeze their credit, set a fraud alert and opt out of prescreened credit offers. These provisions allow Americans to take control of their credit files. The law requires compliance by September 21. These provisions will make things easier for consumers. Can you please speak about the provisions generally and your expectation for the level of communication and collaboration that will occur between your agencies and the credit bureaus during implementation to ensure consumers benefit as was intended.   </p><p>      If you can each respond.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TWOHIG</emphasis>:  So I can assure you Senator, that the Bureau is going to work expeditiously to update to implement on what it needs to do in the --in implementing the Economic Growth And Regulatory Relief And Consumer Protection Act, that would include updating the summary of rights that goes to consumers so that they when they get their credit report, they have the information about these important protections available to them as well as educating consumers, we work collaboratively with the FTC and share information about that kind of information as well as of course, overseeing the compliance with these new provisions.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DONNELLY</emphasis>:  Ms. Mithal?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MITHAL</emphasis>:  And I would say, first of all, I think these are very important rights and they give important tools to consumers so thank you for your work on that. So our implementation, we have put out some guidance to consumers informing them of the new updates to the law that will take place in September, and we have already begun discussions with the CRAs about creating an online portal to effectuate all those tools for consumers and so we're hoping to be ready, but we will be ready by September when the law goes into effect.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DONNELLY</emphasis>:  Okay, section 302, the new law is based off the protecting veterans credit act which I introduced with Senator Rounds to ensure veterans are not wrongly penalized by medical bill payment delays at the Department of Veterans Affairs. Many veterans have their credit scores damaged when the VA was late to pay medical bills. That won't be a problem any longer due to this new law. Your agencies again have oversight and enforcement authority.   </p><p>      Can you speak as to how this provision will ensure that veterans are not wrongly penalized for medical debt that is actually the VA's responsibility. Miss Twohig?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TWOHIG</emphasis>:  Senator, you can be sure that we will be looking for compliance with those important new provisions.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DANIEL</emphasis>:  Ms. Mithal.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MITHAL</emphasis>:  And again I think that that provisions write very important new rights for veterans, I think there have been recent studies showing that lack of predictiveness of medical debt and so I think it's a very important provision and we will do everything we can to support it.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DONNELLY</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BROWN</emphasis>:  Thank you, Senator Donnelly. And I ask unanimous consent to enter into the record a letter from several consumer advocacy groups, without objection, whatever, thank you. Thanks for being the last guy standing.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DONNELLY</emphasis>:  Ready to help anytime.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BROWN</emphasis>:  That concludes the question for today, the questions for the record are due from Senators in one week by Thursday, July 19, we ask the two of you to respond to those questions as quickly as possible this -- thank you for joining us, this concludes the hearing.  </p><p>      END   </p></bodyText></section></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FMRWRE2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5STJ-XKT1-JDPT-T21W-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">345281</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><publicationInfo><publicationName>Financial Markets Regulatory Wire</publicationName><bodyText><p>All materials herein are protected by United States copyright law and may not be reproduced, distributed, transmitted, displayed, published or broadcast without the prior written permission of CQ Transcriptions.

MICHAEL D. CRAPO</nameText></person></p></bodyText></section><section sectionType=\"body\"><bodyText><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CRAPO</emphasis>:  This hearing will come to order.  </p><p>      Today we will hear four very unique perspectives on a segment of Financial Technology or Fintech.  </p><p>      Almost exactly one year ago the Committee held a hearing to explore the various sectors and applications of Fintech. In the short time between that hearing on this one many developments and innovations have occurred both in the private sector and on the regulatory front. Digitization and Data in particular are constantly evolving challenging the way we've traditionally approached and conducted oversight of the Financial Services Sector.   </p><p>      As technology has developed and the ability to readily and cheaply interact with and use data has flourished we have experienced a sort of revolution in the Digital Era. This Digital revolution brings with it the promise of increasing consumer choice, inclusion, and economic prosperity among other things.  </p><p>      Less than a decade ago the concept of Mobile Banking, a simple transaction was relatively new. Now consumers have countless options by which to interact with and to access their financial information and conduct transactions.  </p><p>      As this marketplace rapidly develops so must we constantly evaluate our regulatory and oversight framework much of which was designed prior to the Digital Era. To the extent that there are improvements that can be made to better foster and not stifle innovation we should examine those.  </p><p>      Although these technological developments are incredibly positive the increase digitization and ease of collecting, storing, and using data presents a new set of challenges and requires our diligence -- our vigilance.  </p><p>      Many products and services in the Fintech sector revolve around Big Data Analytics, Data Aggregation, and other technologies that makes use of consumer data. Often times these processes operate in the background and are not always completely transparent to consumers. It's important for consumers to know when their data is being collected and how it's being used.  </p><p>      It is equally important for the companies and the government alike to act responsibly with this data and ensure that it is protected. As we've seen in recent years this can be a challenging task. In order to fully embrace the immense benefits that can result from technological innovation we must ensure that proper safeguards are in place and consumers are fully informed.  </p><p>      Today I hope to hear from our witnesses about the ways in which Fintech is changing the Financial sector and the improvements that can be made to ensure the regulatory landscape welcomes that innovation, what kind of data is being collected and used, and how such data secured and protected, and what the opportunities and challenges are going forward.  </p><p>      Senator Brown?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BROWN</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  </p><p>      In the run-up to the financial crisis, Wall Street banks bragged about innovations they -- that they claim made the financial system less risky and credit more affordable. Some of these innovations were in consumer products like interest-only Subprime mortgages; other innovations were happening behind the scenes like growth and risky collateralized debt obligations and credit default swaps.  </p><p>      According to the banks, technological advances like increasing computer power -- computing power and information sharing through the Internet allowed financial institutions to calculate and mitigate the risks of these complex financial innovations.  </p><p>      In Washington banks told lawmakers that regulation would hold back progress, they say that often many issues, and make credit more expensive for consumers rather than look at financial technology with an eye to the risks. Federal banking supervisors repealed safety and soundness protections and that they use their authority to override consumer protection laws in several states.  </p><p>      Eventually so-called financial innovations led to the biggest economic disaster in almost a century causing millions of Americans their homes, their jobs, much of their savings, criticizing banking -- bankers and regulators who lost sights -- who lost sight of the enormous risks that came with these new innovations.  </p><p>      Former Fed Chair Paul Volcker declared, \"The ATM has been the only useful innovation in banking for the past 20 years.\"  </p><p>      I'm more optimistic about some new technologies benefiting consumers rather than just lining Wall Street's pockets but I think we should look at this Treasurer report with the same level of skepticism.  </p><p>      Rather than learn from past mistakes the Treasury report embraces the shortsightedness of pre-crisis regulators and exalts the benefits of financial innovation. It describes federal and state regulation as cumbersome or as barriers to innovation and recommends cutting important consumer protections like the CFPB's Payday Lending Rule.  </p><p>      If even suggest ripping away what little control we as consumers now have over our own personal financial data just a year after Equifax put a hundred and forty-eight million American identities at risk, 5 million in my state alone.  </p><p>      Just like a dozen years ago, Wall Street banks and big companies are making record profits but working families are struggling just to get by; student loan debt is at record levels; credit card defaults are rising; worker pay isn't keeping up with inflation; comments from the administration notwithstanding but we managed to cut tax for the richest Americans while CEO and shareholders have reaped huge windfalls through over a half trillion dollars in stock buy backs.  </p><p>      Plenty of financial institutions are adopting new technology without running afoul of the law. Rather than focusing on how we can weaken the rules for a handful of companies, a peer group (ph) -- who prefer to be called Fintech rather than Payday Lenders or Data Aggregators rather than Consumer Reporting Bureaus, Treasury should be focused on policies that help working families.  </p><p>      This isn't a partisan issue for me. I raise concerns about relaxing the rules for Fintech firms when Comptroller Curry, appointed by President Obama, suggested a special Fintech charter almost two years ago.  </p><p>      The new leaders at the Federal Reserve, the OCC, the FDIC, and the CFPB, have already made it clear they are ready to give Wall Street whatever it asks for and they never have enough.  </p><p>      In the recommendations in this report calls for more handout for financial firms, Fintech or otherwise.  </p><p>      I'm interested however to hear from our witnesses about how new financial technologies could increase our control over our own information, better protect against cyber-attacks, make it easier for lenders to ensure they're following the law and as traditional banks partner with technology firms, I think it's important for the Committee to consider where gaps in regulations might lead to future systemic risks.  </p><p>      Thank you, Mr. Chairman for holding the hearing.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CRAPO</emphasis>:  Thank you Senator Brown. And I agree with you, this is not a partisan issue we all want to get the benefit of what can be developed with this kind of increasing technological capacity but there is significant concern about privacy and protection of data, of our consumers that is agreed to on both sides of the aisle here I believe.  </p><p>      We welcome our witnesses here with us today.  </p><p>      We have Mr. Steven Boms, the President of Allon Advocacy, on behalf of the Consumer Financial Data Rights Association; Mr. Stuart Rubinstein, President of Fidelity Wealth Technologies; Mr. Brian Knight, Director of the Innovation and Governance Program at Mercatus Center at George Mason University; and Ms. Saule Omarova -- did I -- pronounce that right? Who is the Professor of Law and Director at the Jack Clarke Program on the Law and Regulation of Financial Institutions and Markets at Cornell University.  </p><p>      We again welcome all of you. We appreciate your being here to share your expertise with us. Your written statements will be made a part of the record. We ask you to please be very careful to pay attention to the five-minute clock for your oral comments and as you are engaged in questioning; the Senators have a five-minute clock too and sometimes they run right out of the last second for their last question and when that happens, I ask you to be prompt in your responses to those questions.  </p><p>      With that Mr. Boms, you may begin?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BOMS</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  </p><p>      Chairman Crapo, Ranking Member Brown, and members of the committee thank you for this opportunity to testify today on behalf of the Consumer Financial Data Rights or CFDR group, a consortium of approximately 50 aggregators and Fintech firms united behind consumer's rights to access their financial data.  </p><p>      My testimony this morning also represents the views of the Financial Data and Technology Association or FDATA of North America which is the trade association urging the adoption of an open banking-like regime in the U. S., Canada, and Mexico.  </p><p>      The CFDR group and its members consulted frequently with the Treasury Department as it considered the current state of the Fintech market. Our engagement was principally focused on the crucial issue of consumer-permissioned financial data which was an area of emphasis in the Department's report and which I'd like to focus on today.  </p><p>      A recent White House study concluded that 20 percent of adult Americans are under banked by the traditional Financial Services system and almost 9 million households are entirely unbanked. For these consumers, third-party technology-based tools can provide vital affordable access to a financial system that's left them behind. These tools also help other Americans address the growing complexity of the financial system.   </p><p>      Most consumers have multiple accounts across a variety of providers. The most basic fundamental first step towards financial health, understanding what one has and what one owes can be needlessly difficult. Technology-powered tools can provide intuitive, accessible platforms that enables even the least financially savvy among us to manage their finances and improve economic outcomes.  </p><p>      The lifeblood of these tools is user-permissioned data access, the right of the consumer or the small business to affirmatively grant access, to the application of their choice, to connect to or see their financial data.  </p><p>      Unlike in other jurisdictions globally there is no legal requirement in the United States stipulating that a financial institution must make the consumers or small businesses' financial data it holds available to a third party when the customer provides consent or where there are restrictions on the consumer's access to that data are permissible.  </p><p>      Consumers are dependent on the Financial Services providers with which they do business, with disparate outcomes for Americans who bank with different financial institutions. The lack of a cohesive framework also threatens American competitiveness and financial innovation internationally.  </p><p>      The Treasury Department identified the key outstanding issues with regard to user-permissioned data access. I'll briefly highlight five recommendations for the Committee's consideration here, noting that I provide significantly more reaction in my written testimony.  </p><p>      Number one, the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection should affirm that third parties properly authorized by consumers follow from the definition of consumer for the purpose of obtaining access to financial account and transaction data. Though it may seem self-evident, Section 1033 of Dodd-Frank provides that the Bureau has the authority to promulgate a rule to ensure end users have electronic access to their online data but the Bureau has thus far declined to do so.  </p><p>      Treasury's affirmation that Dodd-Frank provides this right to consumers and small businesses even in the absence of the Bureau rule-making represents a significant victory for innovation and for consumer and small business financial empowerment.  </p><p>      Number two, all regulators should recognize the benefits of consumer access to financial account and transaction data in electronic form.  </p><p>      One of the systemic disadvantages facing the Fintech ecosystem in the United States is the immense relative regulatory fragmentation that exists. There are at least eight federal regulatory agencies with jurisdiction over some portion of financial data access. There are of course also state regulatory authorities.  </p><p>      Treasury's call for all agencies to align behind its interpretation of Dodd-Frank, Section 1033 is an important step towards a level playing field and one that could be hastened by congressional engagement.  </p><p>      Number three, the Bureau should work with the private sector to develop best practices on disclosures and terms and conditions regarding consumers use of products and services.  </p><p>      The United Kingdom's Open Banking architecture include prescriptive consent flows that ensure consumers or small business experience, granting or revoking consent to access their data to any third party is uniform. These open-banking consent standards are an excellent starting point for creating best practices in the U. S. market.  </p><p>      Number four, a solution must address resolution of liability for data access.  </p><p>      The CFDR earlier this year released a set of principles, Secure Open Data Access or SODA which calls for traceability, minimum cyber-liability insurance standards and other standards designed to ensure that the entity responsible for consumer financial loss as a result of a breach, be it a bank or an aggregator or a Fintech firm, is going to be charged with making the end user whole for direct losses resulting from that breach.  </p><p>      While CFDR members are implementing these principles, regulatory agencies and Treasury could augment and assist this work by undertaking efforts to create a more vibrant and affordable cyber-liability insurance market.  </p><p>      Number five, address the standardization of data elements as part of improving consumer's access to their data.  </p><p>      While the CFDR group and FDATA North America wholeheartedly agree with the Department's recommendation, I would respectfully submit an addendum. The standardization of data elements should be made available to the consumer, to permit access to third parties of their choosing so that all data elements available to the end user in their native online banking environments is also available to the third-party if the consumer consents.  </p><p>      This approach would fully enable and users to leverage their own financial data to their economic benefit and will allow for the realization of the competitive free marketplace in which consumers have full transparency and to financial products and services offered by Fintech providers and financial services firms alike.  </p><p>      Thank you again for this opportunity to testify. There are tens of millions of American consumers and small businesses that are already utilizing third-party tools to improve their financial well-being, more can be done to harness the power of innovation safely and security.  </p><p>      We stand ready to work with this committee to implement and identify Treasury's recommendations.  </p><p>      Thank you.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CRAPO</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Boms.  </p><p>      Mr. Rubinstein?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RUBINSTEIN</emphasis>:  Thank you, Chairman Crapo, Ranking Member Brown, and members of the committee.  </p><p>      My name is Stuart Rubinstein. I'm president of Fidelity Wealth Technologies and Head of Data Aggregation at Fidelity Investments.  </p><p>Fidelity is the leading provider of investment management, retirement planning, brokerage, and other Financial Services to more than 30 million individuals, institutions, and intermediaries, with more than $7 trillion in Assets Under Administration. We are strong supporters of Fintechs and are a major Fintech investor.   </p><p>      I'm appearing today to represent Fidelity with the specific focus on the topic of Financial Data Aggregation. At Fidelity we have a unique perspective, we are an aggregator ourselves and we're also a source of data to aggregators who act in behalf of our customers.  </p><p>Fidelity is a strong believer in the benefits our customers receive when they can see a consolidated picture of their finances through aggregated data. We have offered aggregation services to our customers for well over a decade and our customers have been able to access their Fidelity data through various third parties since the 1990s. But the cyber-security environment has changed over time and risks have become far more pronounced and must be addressed.  </p><p>      First most financial data aggregation that occurs today requires consumers to disclose their financial institutions username and password to the third party -- third-party aggregator or Fintech. While this process may have worked in the past it is now antiquated as there are new technologies that eliminate any such requirement. Because cyber-security is of paramount importance we believe that customers should not have to disclose their username and password in order to access any third-party service.   </p><p>      Second aggregators using credentials may have access to an entire website or mobile app which means they can access more data than may be necessary to provide their services. For example, a simple app that tracks your spending does not need to know your investment holdings but will have access to that under the current methods.   </p><p>      Because of the investment of cyber-threats Fidelity and others in the industry have worked hard on developing a different approach to data aggregation that helps to protect consumers. At Fidelity we've develop what we believe are five principles for empowering consumers to share their data safely with third parties:      First consumer should be able to access their financial account data where they want it and when they want it and through third parties if they so desire. The question becomes not if they can do it but how;  </p><p>      Two, access must be provided in a safe, secure, and transparent manner;  </p><p>      Three, consumers should provide affirmative consent and directly instruct their financial institution to share data with specific third parties;  </p><p>      Four, the -- fourth third parties should access only the financial data that they need to provide their product or service. This should not be a Trojan horse for the gathering, accumulating, and reselling of consumer; and   </p><p>      Fifth consumer should be able to monitor those account access-rights and direct their financial institution to revoke that if they so desire.  </p><p>      In an effort to back up these words with actions Fidelity announced in November of 2017 a new service based on these principles called \"Fidelity Access.\" Fidelity Access will allow Fidelity customers to provide third-party access to customer data through a secure connection without providing login credentials to any third party.  </p><p>      We've also been working with policymakers and industry groups to advance these principles and are pleased that many have taken thoughtful approaches to this problem.  </p><p>      Finally, I would be remiss if I did not mention the most difficult issues standing in the way of wider adoption of safer data sharing technologies, the issue of responsibility. We believe companies that collect and handle financial data should be responsible for protecting that data and making customers whole if misuse, fraud, or theft occurs.  </p><p>      As we've been discussing Fidelity Access we've seen aggregators try to limit their liability, some to very small dollar-amounts. Fidelity believes firms that obtain and handle consumer aggregated data should be held responsible to protect that data from unauthorized use just as we are. Any other standard creates moral hazard and does not incentivize aggregators to take their data storage response -- data stewardship responsibilities seriously.  </p><p>      Thank you again for the opportunity to testify before you today. I look forward to answering your questions.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CRAPO</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Rubinstein.  </p><p>      Mr. Knight?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KNIGHT</emphasis>:  Thank you, Chairman Crapo, Ranking Member Brown, and members of the committee.  </p><p>      My name is Brian Knight and I'm the Director of the Innovation and Governance Program at the Mercatus Center.  </p><p>      Whether it's a loan to deal with an emergency, moving money to a loved one in need, or capital to build a business, access to high-quality financial services is essential. Technological innovation in financial services or Fintech has the potential to significantly improve this access.  </p><p>      As the Treasury Department notes one area where technology may dramatically change financial services is in the collection and use of data. Technology advances allow financial services firms to obtain more data from consumers and process the data in new ways with the goal of providing more accessible, inclusive, and cost-effective options.  </p><p>      While it is early there are encouraging signs that innovation is in fact helping consumers. These include Innovative products giving consumers more transparency as to their finances and allowing lenders to offer potential borrowers better quality credit through innovative underwriting.  </p><p>      There is also an indication that technology is making credit markets less discriminatory. This is promising but there have also been concerns raised about potential risks to consumers including risks of privacy and discrimination. These concerns should be taken seriously and we should react appropriately but we should be loath to rush into regulation without being certain that new regulation is necessary. As we assess what the government response to technological invasion should be we should keep a few things in mind:      First, we should judge innovation compared to the status quo, not perfection. Innovative financial service products will not be perfect but they may be better than the alternative. Imposing unduly burdensome regulation that hampers innovation and competition may ultimately be more harmful to the very consumers that regulation seeks to protect;  </p><p>      Second, we should acknowledge that existing regulations may address new risks. For example, the requirement that a lender be able to explain why it took an adverse action could mitigate against the concern that algorithmic underwriting will be unduly opaque. There are existing regulatory incentives as well as market incentives for companies to ensure their products are fair and appropriately transparent.  </p><p>      Third we should be open to the possibility that in some cases the current regulatory system is in fact overly burdensome. There may be cases where the cost of regulation now exceeds the potential benefits or where a regulatory structure that made sense in the past has been overtaken by market developments. This does not mean that new regulation may not sometimes be needed but as technology changes what is possible with financial services the optimal level or type of regulation may change.  </p><p>Fintech offers exciting possibilities for better, cheaper, and more inclusive financial services. We should be mindful of the risks posed but we should not overreact, instead we should work to ensure that the legal and regulatory system facilitates innovation and competition while preserving consumer protection so that Americans can obtain the best financial services possible.  </p><p>      I look forward to our discussion. And thank you for your time.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CRAPO</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Knight.  </p><p>      Ms. Omarova?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OMAROVA</emphasis>:  Senators, thank you for inviting me to testify here today.  </p><p>      My written testimony lays out the details of what I have to say so let me focus on a few big picture points.  </p><p>Fintech is by far the hottest topic in today's finance, cryptography, cloud computing, Big Data Analytics are changing financial markets by making transacting faster and easier to automate and scale up.  </p><p>      We have just heard arguments emphasizing the immense societal benefits of these changes as long as Fintech innovations are not stifled by outdated regulations.  </p><p>      Let's put these arguments in context, it is quite symbolic that we're convened here today almost exactly on the 10th anniversary of Lehman Brothers failure that triggered the global financial crisis.  </p><p>      I don't have to tell your senators what the calamity that crisis was, you lived through that crisis and for years before the crisis you and your colleagues probably sat through many hearings just like this one listening to many confident and articulate gentlemen with impeccable industry credentials tell you that you should not let outdated regulations stifle financial innovation.  </p><p>      They told you and the American public that innovative financial products like derivatives and subprime mortgage loans were making the financial system more efficient, resilient, and Democratic by enabling better risk management, expanding consumer choices, and making credit available to low income Americans. And so risky derivatives and predatory subprime loans were allowed to grow unregulated until they crashed the financial system 10 years ago.  </p><p>      Today the same rhetoric of financial innovation and consumer choice that brought us a crisis of 2008 returns to the center stage in the policy debate on Fintech. Of course, this time it's different, it's not about derivatives but about crypto-assets; it's not about predatory subprime lending but about marketplace lending. Once again new technology is promising to make the system more efficient, resilient, and Democratic, to expand consumer choices and to give low-income Americans access to financial services.  </p><p>      The Treasury report adopts this rhetoric and translates it into a strategy of significant deregulation in the U. S. banking sector meant to enable banks to deform large-scale business partnerships and even outright corporate affiliations with technology companies.  </p><p>      For example, the report advocates for a significant roll back of existing regulations in order to make it easier for the banks to give unaffiliated Tech companies, data aggregators, cloud service providers, and various Fintech firms much more direct access to their customers account and transactional data.  </p><p>      Currently banks are reluctant to allow data-mining businesses to get the direct fee of their depositors' accounts data because regulators make banks ultimately responsible for the handling of sensitive customer information. For the same reasons of regulatory compliance and liability, banks are currently cautious about moving all of their data to the cloud operated by a third party.  </p><p>      The Treasury characterizes this as a bottleneck in the flow of financial information and calls for a concerted regulatory effort to push banks to share their customer data and to outsource its management to third parties much more freely.  </p><p>      The claim here is that allowing unaffiliated Tech companies to access, host, and manage bank data will make financial services faster and cheaper for all consumers and give consumers control over their financial affairs.  </p><p>      Of course, banks will benefit from being able to reduce their operational and compliance costs and potentially increasing their revenues by charging aggregators for direct fees of customer data. And consumers will get the convenience of living in a seamless virtual space where all Fintech apps can just magically connect to all of their bank accounts but this is also expose consumers to tremendous risks.  </p><p>      Imagine that your personal bank account data, transaction history, and other sensitive information previously managed by your local bank is now stored in the cloud and shared directly and in real time with multiple data collecting companies. These companies are not regulated under a bank-like regime with dedicated supervisors making sure that the data is safe and secure, that these companies maintain strong operational controls and don't misuse sensitive consumer information.  </p><p>      In this environment it's easy to imagine not just one but many Equifax-style catastrophes occurring far more frequently and with far more devastating consequences. This is in fact a particular kind of a broader problem that our system of bank regulations has jealously guarded against since the 19th century.  </p><p>      The potential for excessive concentration of financial and market power if banks are allowed to engage too intimately with non-bank commercial businesses. This separation of banking and commerce remains a core principle of U. S. banking law to this day. The Treasury report however calls for measures that will directly undermine this long-standing and sensible regime. What it frames is loci-technical (ph) fixes to how regulators apply banking laws is in fact opening the door to de facto Fintech conglomeration. If allowed this new platform thrust will be able to monopolize the flow of both money and information, and effectively take control of our lives, not only as economic actors but also citizens.  </p><p>      The American Republic of George Washington and Teddy Roosevelt was never meant to become dystopic company town of this kind.  </p><p>      As we're deliberating on Fintech as a public policy matter I urge you to stand on guard and not let this become even a remote possibility.  </p><p>      Thank you.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CRAPO</emphasis>:  Thank you Ms. Omarova.  </p><p>      I'll start my questions with you Mr. Knight. While innovations in data have brought many benefits, it's also become known that firms may be in fact I think are using this data to drive social policy and to restrict access to entirely legal, in fact sometimes constitutionally protected conduct and do this for reasons of trying to influence social policy, unrelated to safety and soundness or other concerns that would make these targeted groups unfit to do business with. Do you think this presents a problem?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KNIGHT</emphasis>:  Thank you Senator, I do. And I think it presents a couple of problems.  </p><p>      The first one to key on the data point is to the extent your -- that a financial institution is collecting data that relates to a sensitive or private matter and particular the more grainial -- granular the data collection is, the potentially more harmful a breach would be, right?  </p><p>      The -- information that is relatively innocuous at one level of detail can become, extremely damaging at another level of detail and of course depending on how much micro-targeting if you will, the bank is doing and the fine -- the level of detail that the bank has stored, if that data is breached, that data is now available and people can be harmed more than had the data been recorded at a less -- at a less granular level.  </p><p>      The second and I think bigger issue that we're dealing with here while I think our starting point should be that a business can choose to do or not do business with anyone they want for whatever reason they want in a free market. And then we're going to narrow that for some compelling societal issues like antidiscrimination.  </p><p>      The problem is banks are not a free market. Banks because of public policy, there are barriers to entry, there are barriers to exit, there is significant subsidy and so banks have -- part of their market power is derived from public power and so when they chose to use their market power in an effort not to do what they've been charged to do which is to effectively intermediate credit or provide savings but instead try to insist or de facto regulate the American people in a -- in a social policy-setting, they're not using their market power, they're using public power and the people who are on the receiving end of that don't have the same market protections that they would in a freer market.  </p><p>      You know, if -- let's take an example of YouTube who you know, will periodically say, \"We won't cover certain types of videos for social policy reasons.\" Well you can stand up a YouTube competitor tomorrow, you don't need a government-granted, discretionary charter. There is no -- and if you were to stand up a competitor to YouTube, YouTube doesn't get special access to government Internet; it doesn't get insurance; it doesn't get lens -- loans from the government; there isn't a presumption that if YouTube is about ready to fail, the government will bail it out which are things that banks enjoy versus their non-bank competition and that limits the ability of banks -- that increases the ability of banks to throw market power around, that's not derived from anything other than government power.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CRAPO</emphasis>:  Well thank you. And I share those concerns.  </p><p>      I want to shift a little bit here and to you Ms. Omarova. I appreciate your testimony on some of the positive aspects that Fintech offers consumers but some of the concerns that you raise are also concerns that I share.  </p><p>      There's an article in today's \"Wall Street Journal\" that highlights this intersection and this is the title of it, \"Facebook and Financial Firms Tussle -- Tussled for Years Over Access to User Data.\" This follows on August article in \"The Wall Street Journal\" entitled, \"Facebook to Banks, 'Give Us Your Data. We Will Give You Our Users'.\" The article suggests that data privacy is a sticking point in these conversations.  </p><p>      Can you discuss the data privacy concerns and the need to better understand what kind of data is being collected and used and how such data is secured and protected? And I only have about a minute left in my time so I...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OMAROVA</emphasis>:  I think this article actually highlights precisely what's at stake here. This is what the Treasury report is suggesting. It's not so much about what current data aggregators do with data today, it's about companies like Facebook and it just shows that those Big Tech companies, platform companies that use information as currency in their businesses, once they get their hands on the data, on the sensitive bank customers' data, in any way for any reason they will try to use that data to increase their revenues in a variety of spheres.  </p><p>      And it will be extremely difficult to actually check how they use their data, they use proprietary algorithms to basically hide that from us. And who is going to oversee it? Who regulates Facebook for these kinds of issues? Nobody does.  </p><p>      I'm glad that Bank of America and Wells Fargo refused Facebook access to their bank customers data but I don't kid myself for any -- for a minute that they've done it out of some kind of moral respect for customer privacy. They've done it because of the regulations that apply to them today.  </p><p>      If we remove those regulations then all of our sensitive financial data will be open to companies like Facebook and we will not know how it will be used.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CRAPO</emphasis>:  Well thank you. I share those concerns as well.  </p><p>      Mr. Rubinstein and Mr. Boms, I'm out of time but I'm not out of questions for you, I might have to submit them if we don't get another opportunity.  </p><p>      Senator Brown?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BROWN</emphasis>:  Thanks Mr. Chairman.  </p><p>      Ms. Omarova thank you for mentioning the 10th anniversary. I -- there is a -- that as I've remind -- many of my colleagues here, a bit of collective amnesia on this dais in the Senate and thank you for always reminding me that.  </p><p>      I have three questions I'd like to get through, I'm going to start with you Ms. Omarova and if you'd moved the answer as close to yes or no as you can, I'll start (inaudible) each of the questions and move from my right to my left.  </p><p>      The Treasury Department and much of the financial industry argue that consumers should have the right to share their financial data with any third party of their choosing, do you think this should include the right for consumers to require that a Fintech or a data aggregator erase all information at that consumer's request?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OMAROVA</emphasis>:  Yes, absolutely. And you know, we have to keep in mind though that this rhetoric of consumer choice and consumers' right to share the information also imply the firms' right to share their information and that's what we need to guard against.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BROWN</emphasis>:  Thank you.   </p><p>      Mr. Knight?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KNIGHT</emphasis>:  Yes, subject to reasonable considerations like law enforcement.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BROWN</emphasis>:  OK.  </p><p>      Mr. Rubinstein?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RUBINSTEIN</emphasis>:  Yes, absolute -- yes, absolutely. Consumers should understand why they're sharing their data, share it for a specific purpose. When they no longer want to use that -- you no longer have that purpose, be able to stop sharing it and have it deleted.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BROWN</emphasis>:  Mr. Boms?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BOMS</emphasis>:  Agreed subject to applicable regulations and laws.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BROWN</emphasis>:  OK. Thanks.  </p><p>      It's hard for a consumer Ms. Omarova -- Ms. Omarova it's hard for a consumer to understand all the ways that financial data might be use by a company they share it with, should there be legal limits on how aggregators use a consumer's financial information in addition to consumer identified limits?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OMAROVA</emphasis>:  Yes, absolutely. Basically, data aggregators and other data platform companies like Facebook should not be allowed in the form of, quote/unquote, \"insider trading,\" once they get access to customer data in one context so they could use it in another context.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BROWN</emphasis>:  Mr. Knight, legal limitations?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KNIGHT</emphasis>:  I believe the limitation should revolve around disclosure and the fact that any consent is given -- is knowingly given and the consumer has rights to terminate that consent at any time.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BROWN</emphasis>:  Yes sir, Mr. Knight?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KNIGHT</emphasis>:  Yes. I would agree with that. I think really under disclosure -- under a disclosure explicit consent so the consumer knows what they're getting into, really understands it and can control it. I don't know that we need a specific legal limitation though.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BROWN</emphasis>:  Mr. Boms?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BOMS</emphasis>:  I would echo what the past gentleman said with the additional addendum which is we as an industry not just Fintech but the financial industry can and should do a lot better on conspicuous disclosures.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BROWN</emphasis>:  OK. So you're saying legal limits, you're saying disclosures should be the emphasis.  </p><p>      Last question, companies like Google and Facebook collect enormous amounts of personal information. They also influence what information consumers are exposed to for example Facebook might show Payday Loan advertisements to service members or to minorities but not its other users.  </p><p>      Should Fair Lending Laws be updated to cover not just providing credit products but also their targeted advertisements on Social Media platforms, Ms. Omarova?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OMAROVA</emphasis>:  Yes, absolutely. I agree the capacity makes -- raises a new spectrum of discrimination concerns and we have to guard against that.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BROWN</emphasis>:  Mr. Knight?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KNIGHT</emphasis>:  Senator, that's a great question and I don't know if I can give an answer in the time you'd want. If you'd like to submit a QFR, I'd be happy to answer it.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BROWN</emphasis>:  I will do that. Thank you.  </p><p>      Mr. Rubinstein?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RUBINSTEIN</emphasis>:  Senator, I'm sorry, I'm not an expert in Fair Lending and I probably cannot respond to that...   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BROWN</emphasis>:  OK.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RUBINSTEIN</emphasis>:  ... question.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BROWN</emphasis>:  Good. I'll still send a letter to you and have people at Fidelity answer it.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RUBINSTEIN</emphasis>:  We -- you can send the letter, we can try. We're not lenders so I don't know that we'd -- I have a good answer that one for you.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BROWN</emphasis>:  OK.  </p><p>      Mr. Boms?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BOMS</emphasis>:  And Senator I'd echo, I'd be happy to respond in writing. It's not something that we've discussed with our members.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BROWN</emphasis>:  OK.  </p><p>      Last question, thanks for your promptness all of you.  </p><p>      The biggest four banks control about 45 percent of bank assets according to your testimony. Facebook and Google together capture between 59 and 73 percent of the online advertising revenue in the U. S.  </p><p>      Do you think the Treasury report's recommendation which many of your cited favorably would benefit the large incumbents or would increase competition?  </p><p>      Ms. Omarova?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OMAROVA</emphasis>:  Well the increase in competition is another good rhetorical choice to you know, promote deregulation but in reality, both the financial sector and the Tech sector is -- are the businesses where economies of scale and economies of scope are extremely important so in reality what the Treasury report wants us to have is the maximum scale and maximum scope of these conglomerates.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BROWN</emphasis>:  So it would benefit the larger (inaudible)...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OMAROVA</emphasis>:  It would...  </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OMAROVA</emphasis>:  ... benefit large...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BROWN</emphasis>:  Mr. Knight?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OMAROVA</emphasis>:  ... incumbents.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KNIGHT</emphasis>:  Senator, I believe that it would actually be a mix -- potentially mixed benefit. In some cases, the largest companies would benefit. In some cases, the ability of smaller financial institutions to plug into large data providers may allow them to compete with larger financial services companies.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BROWN</emphasis>:  Mr. Rubinstein?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RUBINSTEIN</emphasis>:  Yes. The Treasury report refers to APIs which is \"Tech Speak\" for more secure data sharing methods. I do believe that that actually increases competition as there are standards, small companies only need to build to one standard to plug into many interfaces so, yes, I do think it helps competition.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BROWN</emphasis>:  It certainly would be working against Trans (ph).  </p><p>      But Mr. Boms?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BOMS</emphasis>:  And Senator, I would just say on behalf of many smaller financial technology firms and not the Facebook's or Google's of the world, there is a very strong view that this would promote competition.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BROWN</emphasis>:  So the smaller guys think it would promote competition?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BOMS</emphasis>:  Yes. That's correct.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BROWN</emphasis>:  Good. Thank you.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CRAPO</emphasis>:  Senator Rounds?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ROUNDS</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  </p><p>      First of all, thank you all for being here today. One of the common threads that I've noted through each of your testimonies was the importance of data breach or data security and Fintech and I'm really curious about the issue of the importance of or the challenges of a National Data Breach Standard.  </p><p>      A number of businesses and trade associations have called for Congress and the federal government to step in and establish one, unified data breach standard so businesses could operate across state lines, they would be forced to comply with a patchwork of different regulations.  </p><p>      In addition, my colleague in the house of Congressman Blaine Luetkemeyer recently released the Consumer Information Application Requirement Act. This legislation which has passed the House Financial Services Committee would require federal regulators to establish a National Unified Data Breach Standard.  </p><p>      On the other hand, 31 State attorneys general have released a letter opposing a prior version of a Data Breach Bill in the House because it would preempt state laws.  </p><p>      I'd like your thoughts first of all on what we're discussing right now, coming out of the House. And second of all is a national standard necessary and if so how do we balance that with state interests?  </p><p>      Who'd like to begin?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OMAROVA</emphasis>:  Let me take this on. I think as a general matter, just because a particular standard is unified, universally applied, easier to understand doesn't necessarily make it a better standard, right? It depends on what the standard is qualitatively.  </p><p>      We have the federal system of regulation in this country because we believe in the checks and balances, sometimes state consumer protection laws have to step in more effectively to protect us consumers from abuse by large companies and sometimes the federal laws do a better job by basically you know, creating an even playing field for everybody else.  </p><p>      So my responses that would be, it is not necessarily a bad idea to have a unified standard but the key to that would be that that standard creates the maximum protection for the customer's financial data from various abuses that would likely ensue if we take state authorities completely out of the game.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ROUNDS</emphasis>:  Thank you.  </p><p>      Other thoughts?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RUBINSTEIN</emphasis>:  I'm happy to respond Senator.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ROUNDS</emphasis>:  Please?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RUBINSTEIN</emphasis>:  Thank you for the question. We do support a federal -- a Breach Notification. We think it's -- while a large firm like ours can stay on top of the various state laws, speed is often very necessary in a Breach Notification. Being able to understand one law and be able to respond quickly to that, I think enhances consumer protection, gets customers notified, gets customers and regulators just notified faster.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ROUNDS</emphasis>:  Other thoughts?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BOMS</emphasis>:  Senator if I may. I would just add. I think certainly you would find broad support within the Fintech ecosystem for a national standard, provided that it was strong enough and provided the right consumer protections.  </p><p>      Just to juxtapose that with the ecosystem that we have today, it's very inconsistent from a regulatory perspective. We have CFDR members who are for example FFIEC-supervised and examined, as third-party vendors to large financial institutions. We have other Fintechs who are state regulated and said who are not subject to the Prudential Bank regulatory oversight. And so one standard that encapsulates best practices I think would be welcomed.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KNIGHT</emphasis>:  I concur, I can't speak to Representative Luetkemeyer's bill specifically but I'll also say that when assessing whether or not federal standard make sense some other things to think about are whether or not the patchwork of regulations is generating inefficiency that ends up costing consumers money; whether or not there is a disparate treatment among competitors so some people get to leverage one standard, some people get to leverage a different standard.  </p><p>      And third whether or not we're seeing citizens being de facto regulated by other states to a significant degree because of course you know, if you're a national player, you're going to comply with California even if someone in you know, Wisconsin maybe wouldn't support that standard.  </p><p>      One of the advantages -- potential advantages of a federal standard is that there is broader political representation in setting it and everyone gets a seat at the table, even if you don't end up winning.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ROUNDS</emphasis>:  Is there a process today where a lot of these states that have individual offices in particular attorney general's offices, consumer offices, to where they have -- do they have an association so speak where they can speak with a unified voice in terms of what should be part of a core of a national standard that you've worked with?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KNIGHT</emphasis>:  Well I have not worked with them on this topic but the National Association of Attorneys General may be a place to go and they do work together both on Advocacy and on Enforcement through multistate enforcement actions.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ROUNDS</emphasis>:  Any of you work with anyone of your Associations?  </p><p>      No. OK.  </p><p>      Thank you.  </p><p>      Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CRAPO</emphasis>:  Thank you Senator Rounds.  </p><p>      Senator Reed?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">REED</emphasis>:  Well thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you for your excellent testimony.   </p><p>      Mr. Rubinstein, thank you, very thoughtful comments, we appreciate it. You pointed out in your written testimony that you know, there are significant benefits but there are also as you say very real cyber-security and privacy risk.  </p><p>      Can you project or let us know what you -- your fears are about sort of the big problems that are out there lurking?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RUBINSTEIN</emphasis>:  Yes, Senator, thank you -- thank you for the question.  </p><p>      You know, number one is this issue of credential sharing, people giving away their IDs and passwords. Today when Fintechs or Aggregators show up at our front door they login typically with robotic activities, robots that impersonate the customer basically, same as you sitting at your keyboard, type in your ID and password.  </p><p>      That only gives access to data and some of that data may be private which you did not intend to share but it also can give access to transactions. And if you think about that, what does that mean? It means that you know, potentially a robot can come in and move your money and move it -- move it somewhere else. That's a risk from having just open access to the website which the current -- which the current methods have.  </p><p>      It's difficult for financial institution to know that that's a robot coming in because it looks just like a customer. It's also difficult for the customer then to come back later and say I didn't authorize that activity when in fact they actually gave their ID and password to it to a -- to a third party. Those are real risks though, we think about each and every day.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">REED</emphasis>:  Thank you very much.  </p><p>      The other aspect of this is that we're on a -- beginning of a huge (ph) wave eventually, the aggregation of data will go way beyond just sharing financial information from an institution with customers over the place like Facebook, it will go to all the information they collect, websites you're looking at, what -- may be in what potential pharmaceuticals your ordering , et cetera so that the financial decisions we've been made -- may not be being made by even individual, human beings will be -- and they might not be made in the financial institution, there may be a machine that sharing all this data. Is that something that you're concerned about?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RUBINSTEIN</emphasis>:  I think there are great concerns with data that flows without the customer's knowledge and...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">REED</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RUBINSTEIN</emphasis>:  ... affirmative consent so I think you know, all that comes in. However, we do firmly believe in the customer's right to share their data. It's their data. If they understand...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">REED</emphasis>:  Right.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RUBINSTEIN</emphasis>:  ... that's being shared, understand how it's being used, frankly they want -- if they want to participate in selling that data, let them participate. You know, hopefully they'll get rewarded for that but they should be able to turn it off at any time too.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">REED</emphasis>:  So that and in one concept there's the notion of you -- and I think you've -- we've said before and I think there has to be an opt in and opt out not just a generic one when you sign up but constantly as the situation changes, that if there is a value in your data then somehow the customer should be able to realize that value -- at least make the decision based upon you know, I'm giving something up but -- or I'm getting something. And then the notion of erasing data is critical, do you agree?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RUBINSTEIN</emphasis>:  Yes. Senator, we'll take Fidelity Access, I mentioned earlier my comments as an example when we use that a customer can actually have a dashboard that they can see which third parties they've granted access to their data so they can monitor that on an ongoing basis and with a single click be able to revoke that consent.  </p><p>      Now that only works in many -- financial institutions are building similar things, that only works on the financial institution's side. Once a consumer shares their data with a third party we do believe that they should be able to get that erased but that's actually between then that third...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">REED</emphasis>:  Right.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RUBINSTEIN</emphasis>:  ... party in the consumer.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">REED</emphasis>:  Oh, that's where we have to step in and provide some type of sensible rules so they can do that, correct?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RUBINSTEIN</emphasis>:  I think so, yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">REED</emphasis>:  Ms. Omarova, you -- in this the regulatory climate in which more and more is going to be left to the market, isn't that an argument for giving people the right to go to court if they feel aggrieved even more so and today? Private right of action if they feel aggrieved?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OMAROVA</emphasis>:  I suppose so. I think in general because of the complexity of the environment with which we are dealing today and because of the complexity of understanding exactly what kind of personal data is available to whom and how it could be used and the difficulty of monitoring all of that use. I think absolutely every lever of control over the use of that data by the Big Tech companies especially, should be utilized.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">REED</emphasis>:  Thank you very much.  </p><p>      Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CRAPO</emphasis>:  Senator Perdue?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PERDUE</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  </p><p>      You know, one of the unintended consequences of the Dodd-Frank law was I think it spawned probably -- and it's arguable that the greatest period of bank consolidation U.S. history. We've lost 1,700 banks in the last decade and virtually no new banks have been started. So I've got a question, in that environment Dr. Omarova, you mentioned earlier, I have a question for Mr. Knight first. I want to come back to you on a second question but Dr. Omarova talked about aggravation, the bigger the banks get the more important disaggregation of data becomes.  </p><p>      I'm concerned that today we have in that environment of consolidation we have six examining agencies charged with Consumer Financial Protection, one of those is CFPB. We had the acting director before this committee a couple months ago telling us there had been at least 240 breaches of data that they are investigating and possible as many as 800, anyone of those could be worse than the Equifax breach.  </p><p>      So the question I have is as we talk about -- Mr. Knight you talked about, accessing this data can help banks actually improve services particularly for people who are underserved today and I agree with that but this Unified National Data Security Standard as we're talking about Breach Notification that I think we all agree on, how would that apply in your mind to these federal examining agencies that have access to this same data?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KNIGHT</emphasis>:  So -- I apologize if I understand your question here, is the concern that there is going to be a breach at the agency level?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PERDUE</emphasis>:  Yes. We've already been told, there are 240 the CFPB, to be known breaches today, 800 they are investigating, any one of which could be worse than the Equifax breach.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KNIGHT</emphasis>:  Yes. I absolutely share that concern and I think that the challenge is, if you allow any entity to access data be it the bank or be it a federal agency, there is that risk and I think that while there are concerns and tools available to punish banks in the case of a breach, or Equifax in the case of a breach -- and we can debate whether or not these tools are adequate. It's harder in many respects to go after an agency due to issues like sovereign immunity and so...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PERDUE</emphasis>:  But should they be held to the same standard of data protection that commercial interests are?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KNIGHT</emphasis>:  ... At least the same standard.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PERDUE</emphasis>:  Thank you.  </p><p>      Dr. Omarova, I have a question about where the United States sits with our regulatory environment relative to other countries. In Kenya for example, 93 percent of Kenyans have access to a bank account through MPESA a mobile phone-based money transfer and Micro-Financing Service  </p><p>      In China, Ali Baba, I was in -- visit with Ali Baba and Tencent a couple months ago in China. They help facilitate $12.8 trillion in mobile payments in China. They've leapfrogged us and our technology here.  </p><p>      No matter we think of our Fintech, a lot of these innovations were developed here but we're slow adopters somehow in the United States.  </p><p>      Are we falling behind places like the U. K., Kenya, and China in terms of the adoption of this -- of this technology in Fintech?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OMAROVA</emphasis>:  Well Kenya is very different, it has a very different Financial Services market than we do here.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PERDUE</emphasis>:  Certainly.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OMAROVA</emphasis>:  They don't...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PERDUE</emphasis>:  We...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OMAROVA</emphasis>:  ... have...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PERDUE</emphasis>:  ... but...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OMAROVA</emphasis>:  ... the actual banking system...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PERDUE</emphasis>:  But the U.K. is very similar?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OMAROVA</emphasis>:  ... I'll -- I'll get to that...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PERDUE</emphasis>:  OK.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OMAROVA</emphasis>:  ... in a second and in Kenya by the way, the success of their mobile banking was built on the central bank and are the major telephone provider...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PERDUE</emphasis>:  Right.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OMAROVA</emphasis>:  ... banding (ph) together so the state was critical to providing this service to everybody else.  </p><p>      China, yes China has Ali Baba, which is competing with our you know, our PayPals and Facebooks and what have you. Again, in China the state apparatus is so strong that China can control whatever those companies do and that's a critical factor.  </p><p>      The U.K., we always hold of the U.K., especially the industry does as this sort of principal -- principles-based, much more market friendly, much smarter kind of regulator-type environment. But remember before the crisis, I worked in the Treasury and we were doing reports about how the Financial Services Authority were so much better than our regulators were in terms of allowing financial innovations to go forward.  </p><p>      And then the crisis hit. Where is the Financial Services Authority now?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PERDUE</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OMAROVA</emphasis>:  I'm not so sure that the Open Bank -- open-banking initiative in the U.K. is actually achieving the benefits that it was promising.  </p><p>      So I think what we should look for is not so much how you know, industry friendly or the regulatory a particular country's environment is, I think we should look at our market structure and the concentrations of power in the Tech industry in the financial sector in our country.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PERDUE</emphasis>:  And that's -- that's my question so the only -- I have to gauge this against other standards, other performances and so are we falling behind the adoption of these technologies, relative to consumer protection, and consumer access to banking services?  </p><p>      And anybody I'd -- I'd welcome anybody's response to that?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OMAROVA</emphasis>:  Oh.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PERDUE</emphasis>:  Dr. Omarova? Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OMAROVA</emphasis>:  You want me?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PERDUE</emphasis>:  Sure.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OMAROVA</emphasis>:  I don't think we are falling behind. I think we're taking a more cautious approach simply because we have probably much more to lose.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PERDUE</emphasis>:  Very good.   </p><p>      Anybody else?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BOMS</emphasis>:  Senator, I would -- I would just add, we shouldn't discount the vibrancy and resilience of the U. S. market which obviously stands way above other markets. That said the lack of consistency and clarity in the regulatory and legal framework in the U. S. with regard to data access presents a potential future competitive risk for the U. S. market.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PERDUE</emphasis>:  Right. Thank you very much.  </p><p>      Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CRAPO</emphasis>:  Senator Warner?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARNER</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  </p><p>      I want to follow-up we're Senator Perdue was at Mr. Boms, with what the Europeans are doing, with what the Brits are doing. You know, how does this affect again our market's ability to stay competitive in what's obviously a global field?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BOMS</emphasis>:  Sure. Senator, it's -- it's very early days. PSD2 and Open Banking in Europe and the U.K. just went live on 13th January this year. There was a conformance period that will last until September of next year so we are in this transition period but we're seeing adoption of Open Banking APIs by consumers in the U.K., for example increased 50 percent month over month so clearly there's interest in adoption of these tools.  </p><p>      We're seeing significant investment into the Fintech market in London. It's not because the cost of living or taxes are low it's because there is a clear regulatory framework and a legal framework for how these -- how these tools can be deployed, prescriptive consent and disclosure flows that consumer are coming to expect and are unaware of.  </p><p>      So I don't think it's an eminent threat but I do think if we don't get our house in order in the relative near-term it could become a threat.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARNER</emphasis>:  Well one of the things I -- and related to this -- while not the direct topic today you know, there's a group of us bipartisan that have been working for now 3 1/2, four years to try to at least standardize data breach legislation.  </p><p>      The fact that we've got 49, 47 different data breach legislative laws such as -- different than data portability but I would hope you think that some level of federal leadership on data breach would be important as well?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BOMS</emphasis>:  Absolutely Senator. So long as the floor that it establishes provide sufficient consumer protection.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARNER</emphasis>:  Right. And that's I think what we've done, frankly we have spent some of -- I was on the talk (ph) on business and before that, it's my old industry that's been some -- I released four data breach legislation but then they all want to carve out for their specific industry and that's not going to end up being the -- I think the way we get it -- get there.  </p><p>      And unfortunately, those efforts have lagged a little bit in the last eight or nine months and I think as we think about this we've got to think holistically and Ms. Omarova that's -- that's why want to go to my question with you is, I'm a big advocate around data portability and I think Senator Brown may have indirectly raised this question already.  </p><p>      In our -- in my efforts on the -- Intelligence Committee where we're looking at the social media firms who have these platforms, who have enormous, enormous power and growing power, if we -- if we deal with data portability in the Fintech space alone...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OMAROVA</emphasis>:  Yes.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARNER</emphasis>:  ... but don't deal with data portability in terms of our individual personal data, if you're not able to move from Facebook to another enterprise and make it easier and allow our CAT videos to move easily as well, we're really not going to be able to have the type of competitive market I think in -- in that field.  </p><p>      I just want you to like to comment on the need to not only get this right in the Fintech -- in the financial arena but more broadly based?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OMAROVA</emphasis>:  You are absolutely correct. Information is the currency in the digital economy and you know, it takes many forms and it flows through many, many markets for many, many goods and services, not just financial markets but markets for other types of data.  </p><p>      And it is a structural problem. I understand the concerns with competitiveness and I am completely in favor of allowing consumers to move freely between different apps and utilize various information in ways that serve their interest.   </p><p>      But the problem here is that you have to understand that -- structurally speaking financial institutions are sitting on the type of information that presents a you know, much heightened danger of misuse and this is where we should be particularly careful with respect to Fintech and how the financial information is moving structurally in these markets and probably deal with the broader issues of data protection outside the financial sector and perhaps Antitrust issues as well because those are serious structural issues that exists everywhere in the Big Tech sector separately.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARNER</emphasis>:  Well my concern is that what you know, -- and this committee is looking in terms of Russia sanctions at what happened in 2016...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OMAROVA</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARNER</emphasis>:  ... but -- where Russia intervene but what I see is the next iteration is that someone will come in and break into non-protected personal financial data...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OMAROVA</emphasis>:  Right.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARNER</emphasis>:  ... as they did with Equifax and Senator Warren and I have a bill and it's -- I think a travesty we're a year later and there's still has been no penalty paid by that -- by that company but they would break-in get personal information, contact any of us as an individual, and then what will pop up will be what was called a \"Deep Fake\" video, and it will be somebody that looks like Senator Brown but it's not actually Senator Brown, Livestream video and the combination to wreak havoc there, not only on the political side but on the market side is really huge so we have to solve this issue not just for financial data portability but across the board.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OMAROVA</emphasis>:  Oh that's...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARNER</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OMAROVA</emphasis>:  ... absolutely correct, that's absolutely correct.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARNER</emphasis>:  Thank you.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CRAPO</emphasis>:  Senator Cortez Masto?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CORTEZ MASTO</emphasis>:  Thank you. And thank you Mr. Chair and Ranking Member, obviously this is an important discussion.  </p><p>      And for all of you for being here today, it's a great conversation.  </p><p>      I echo my colleague Senator Warner. I think we have to look at the simplistic approach. I think -- what I've heard today we all agree we've got to address the data privacy security and consumer protection piece of this but this is emerging technology, it's not going away and we're going to have to figure out at a federal level how we address this but also, I believe incorporating state laws and the states as well. They can -- they have to be a part of this discussion.  </p><p>      So let me -- let me ask you this because we received a letter from the National Association of Federally Insured Credit Unions, the Committee did. One statement the Association makes is that as new companies emerge and compete in this area it is important that they compete on a level playing field of regulation from data security to consumer protection. Would each of you agree with that statement?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BOMS</emphasis>:  Senator, yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RUBINSTEIN</emphasis>:  Yes, absolutely. Whoever holds consumer data should be held to the same standards.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CORTEZ MASTO</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KNIGHT</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CORTEZ MASTO</emphasis>:  Thank you.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OMAROVA</emphasis>:  Well yes. It's a generally a good principle.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CORTEZ MASTO</emphasis>:  And that level playing field of doesn't that we rollback regulation, does it?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BOMS</emphasis>:  Senator, from my perspective no, it doesn't. It means that we make the regulation consistent across the various regulators who have some stake in this.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CORTEZ MASTO</emphasis>:  Thank you.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KNIGHT</emphasis>:  Yes. I agree.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CORTEZ MASTO</emphasis>:  Right. And I think you'd all agree?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KNIGHT</emphasis>:  Senator, I would say that -- when we talk about level playing field we should be thinking about what is the risk generating -- where's the risk that's generated that we're trying to regulate against and so if that risk exists, comparable regulation should exist.  </p><p>      If a new player comes along and offers a comparable service but doesn't generate a certain risk then they shouldn't be regulated at -- in the same way vis-a-vis that risk.  </p><p>      For example, a lender that doesn't fund their loans from federally insured deposits shouldn't be regulated as a depository because they're just not generating the risks that go along with the deposit holding. They should be regulated vis-a-vis consumer protection and lending for example.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CORTEZ MASTO</emphasis>:  OK.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OMAROVA</emphasis>:  Well, sometimes it's very difficult to figure out exactly what types of risks a particular lender or a particular situation really poses, sometimes we do not see how exactly they fund their loans and their services, we've learned that from this last crisis.  </p><p>      And I think that in that sense it's important that if we are looking for leveling the playing field we have to make sure that that common level is not the minimum regulatory level of oversight but the maximum one. And when we're looking at the maximum level of regulatory oversight in the interest of the American public, we should keep in mind the biggest players in those markets, not the smallest ones.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CORTEZ MASTO</emphasis>:  Thank you.  </p><p>      And can I ask you -- each one of you, so when we're talking about banks and credit unions that allow data aggregators access to bank customers' accounts, if there is a violation of those customer's privacy information and that privacy information for those customers who should be legally liable? Should the banks and credit unions be legally liable if there working with those third-party aggregators and there's a breach?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BOMS</emphasis>:  Senator, this is -- you've identified I think perhaps the largest most significant obstacle in this ecosystem which Mr. Rubinstein referenced in his opening statement.  </p><p>      The members that I represent would say that, \"he who breaches the data should be responsible for making the consumer whole.\" The catch to that and the issue with that is, we have decades of regulation and consumer expectations that say that it is the financial institution that either should or must make the consumer whole.  </p><p>      So on some level even though our members have taken it upon themselves are adopting this notion of \"he who breaches most make the consumer responsible,\" at some point we need to holistically take a look at the regulations that we have on the books and modernize them for the 21st century economy.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CORTEZ MASTO</emphasis>:  OK.  </p><p>      Anyone else? Yes?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RUBINSTEIN</emphasis>:  Senator, as Mr. Boms said it's a very difficult topic. You know, we firmly believe that whoever causes harm to the consumer should make the consumer whole. Unfortunately, this is -- this is a chain. Consumer data starts with the financial institution, it moves to a financial data aggregator then it moves to a Fintech, it may continue to move beyond that.  </p><p>      The financial institution only has a direct relationship in that first step of the chain with the financial aggregator. They need to look to that financial aggregator to make the financial institution whole if the financial institution has reimbursed the consumer and then they can deal with their own customer, similar to getting into a car accident, right? You have auto insurance, you turn to your insurance company and then your insurance company goes and subrogates with the other -- with the others down the chain.  </p><p>      It's been very difficult. The industry is not adapting that yet and we can use a notion that direction.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CORTEZ MASTO</emphasis>:  Thank you.  </p><p>      Ms. Omarova or please...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OMAROVA</emphasis>:  So...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CORTEZ MASTO</emphasis>:  ... down the line, whoever likes to go next?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OMAROVA</emphasis>:  ... I think that everybody in that chain should bear responsibility and to be exposed to the liability for data breaches of bank customer data.  </p><p>      And what concerns me about the Treasury report in particular is that it never really addresses that issue directly and he talks about, \"yes, we need to kind of have an appropriate liability regime,\" but it's not clear to me what that regime will be like.  </p><p>      What I know though is as a practical matter in order to incentivize banks to share their information, their bank customer information with various technology companies, you're going to have to relax the actual liability constraints existing today on them because otherwise they simply wouldn't share it so that's what concerns me a lot.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CORTEZ MASTO</emphasis>:  Thank you. And I know I'm out of time. Mr. Chair, I don't know Mr. Knight if you wanted to say a few words? I don't want to take up any...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KNIGHT</emphasis>:  Briefly.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CORTEZ MASTO</emphasis>:  ... more time. Thank you.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KNIGHT</emphasis>:  So in addition to all that's been said, I'd say that the one threshold question we didn't talk about is the Treasury takes the position in the report that's Dodd-Frank's Section 1033, compels the bank to make the information available to the consumers chosen aggregator.   </p><p>      I don't know if that's a position the Bureau will take and if we're compelling the bank then the normative argument for holding the bank liable if some accident happens down the chain with an aggregator they did not choose to partner with but were compelled to partner with weakens, whereas if it's a matter of choice all the way down then the principles discussed make more sense.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CRAPO</emphasis>:  Senator Scott?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCOTT</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  </p><p>      Thank you to the panel for investing the time to be here this morning.  </p><p>      Things get complicated when a company is headquartered in Tennessee, does business in South Carolina and its breached in Arkansas. Those states all have different laws on the books governing when and how companies must notify the public of a data breach.  </p><p>      The reality is that a patchwork quota (ph) of 50 different breach notifications standards creates a race to the bottom in which breached parties will often comply with the lowest possible standard. Consumers are ultimately the ones that pay the price. They are the ones that lose out.  </p><p>      I know that Senator Rounds touched on this question earlier but let me ask you Mr. Boms, is the state-by-state framework for breach notification effective, who stands to benefit from a more uniformed approach?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BOMS</emphasis>:  Senator, we think that there is certainly room for improvement, a federal approach that lifts up what the ceiling is across the board would benefit consumers, it would benefit the industry. We think it would be a win-win for everybody involved.  </p><p>      It's not simply an issue of regulatory complexity at the state level, several of the Fintech firms that have worked with have federal supervision through a third-party vendor management and said there's a piece of Prudential Bank regulatory authority here as well in this work. This is another area where consistency among regulation not deregulation would be immensely helpful.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCOTT</emphasis>:  Thank you, sir.  </p><p>      The Graham -- Gramm-Leach-Biley -- Bliley Act from 1999, we did business very differently than. I think we were all still using paper for most of our transactions. We probably had dial up for our Internet connection and we certainly did not have cell phones that could do anything other than call, and that was a pretty expensive venture as well.  </p><p>      Bottom line is that the world has changed so significantly since GLBA was enforced, being law but it is still the foundation of how we govern data aggregators for financial institutions. I'm encouraged by the fact that removing to APIs from screen scraping but it is happening fairly slowly.  </p><p>      Mr. Boms you mentioned Europe, Mexico, and Japan, in your testimony. How are U. S. policymakers falling behind in crafting laws that foster Fintech innovation and protection consumer -- and protecting consumer data?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BOMS</emphasis>:  Senator, I would -- I would answer in two parts.   </p><p>      I think the first thing I would say is APIs in and of themselves are not a panacea, they will not solve everything. The API in addition to being secure as we've heard also must be robust so the API must make -- must include data fields like fees for example so the consumer who is using a third-party tool that compares fees at one for example financial institution can compare what is fees would be for the same products or services at another financial institution so making sure that the APIs with the direct fees are robust is the first step.  </p><p>      The second is there are no standards in the U. S. market. The Treasury report talks about data standardization which we think is a very important area that other markets have addressed.  </p><p>      In the U.K. open-banking environment, the data elements are standardized. The Mexican central bank and securities regulator are currently working on an API that would standardize the data sets. This would be we think one place to start but there are quite a few that the regulators here could begin with.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCOTT</emphasis>:  Thank you.  </p><p>      Almost 30 percent of Americans living in economically distressed communities are credit invisible meaning they have no credit score. An additional 15 percent are unsupportable to -- due to having an insufficient or old credit history. In South Carolina that combined number is about 23 percent or one out of every four adults.  </p><p>      Senator Cortez Masto and I have worked diligently to find ways to bring that credit-invisible person to a place where their consistent habits of paying their bills, whether it's their electric bill or cell phone or the rent from a place that they're renting, they're paying those on time, they should get some credit for that.  </p><p>      Mr. Knight you testified that innovative underwriting can provide consumers with benefits such as low interest rates, can you speak to the benefits of using rent and utility payments in credit scoring and two other developments in underwriting that will benefit consumers?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KNIGHT</emphasis>:  Thank you, Senator. Yes. I think that expanding access to the types of data that bear on the creditworthiness of a borrower, even if they are -- have not traditionally been captured in traditional underwriting like a FICO score, has the potential to be valuable in allowing lenders to make an accurate assessment of the risk that they would take on by lending to a borrower for -- in some cases that will make someone who is credit invisible visible and therefore the lender has enough data, they feel like they can then make you know, make an offer.  </p><p>      In other cases, it will indicate that people who are in fact good credit risks or better credit risk than they otherwise get credit for because you're looking at data that hasn't otherwise been picked up so I think that there is potential value there.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCOTT</emphasis>:  Thank you.  </p><p>      I have another question on my legislation on the Mobile Act but I'll submit for the record.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CRAPO</emphasis>:  Thank you.  </p><p>      Senator Warren?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  </p><p>      So Fintech holds out a lot of promise for consumers and also raises a number of concerns. I think it's critical that the government moves methodically on a regulatory approach to Fintech so we encourage productive innovation but we don't expose consumers to a lot of unnecessary risks.  </p><p>      So the Treasury Department issued a report on Fintech earlier this year and almost every instance it advocates for deregulation in an effort to stimulate the Fintech industry and I'm concerned about a lot of those recommendations. One set of recommendations is about rolling back the rules that govern how banks can share personal financial information with third-party data aggregators.  </p><p>      So Professor Omarova, I know you addressed this issue in your written testimony and I just would like you if you could very briefly to explain what your concerns are with the Treasury Department's recommendations on this front?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OMAROVA</emphasis>:  So my main concern is that the Treasury's approach will essentially open the flood gates for the banks that are currently regulated to open up this treasure trove of sensitive financial data on their customers that they have for much broader types of uses by various tech companies.  </p><p>      So my concern is about Facebook, it is about Google, it is about Amazon, and we don't know what they do with the data they touch so they could use it, they could get access to that data in one capacity let's say as a cloud service provider and the code writer but then misuse it in order to miss sell something to the customer, right?   </p><p>      And that's what I worry about and the customer consent here could be obtained by the bank at the point when the customer is actually opening a deposit account with a bank and that's what concerns me, this notion of consent and choice could be actually diminished.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  All right. That's -- it's -- it's very important. Thank you.  </p><p>      And given just what just happened with the Equifax breach I think a lot of my constituents and constituents for pretty much everybody here would be uncomfortable with the idea of even more companies getting access to our financial data without our effective consent and without strict rules on how they have to protect that data.  </p><p>      Another set of Treasury recommendation would further weaken the wall between banking and commerce. They would allow our biggest banks and our huge technology platforms to join their corporate empires, you were just talking about this, and giant technology companies like Facebook and Google to build up equity stakes in multiple, smaller banks across the country.  </p><p>      It -- again could you go back to this Professor and describes some of the potential harms in allowing this kind of consolidation across different industries?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OMAROVA</emphasis>:  Right. So the Treasury basically seek -- seeks to weaken the -- how control is defined in the Bank Holding Company Act. The Bank Holding Company Act currently subjects in a company that controls a U. S. bank or is affiliated with a U. S. bank to various regulations and supervision and it's essentially an Antitrust law that seeks to prevent banks from abusing their control of immense power over public money and credit, right?  </p><p>      And what the Treasury says is essentially, we should make it much easier for the banks to acquire equity stakes in tech companies and vice versa. And I worry about the fact that it will not create greater competition, it will actually lead to extreme concentrations of power over money and information across the sectors.  </p><p>      And it will take the \"Too-Big-to-Fail\" problem to an unprecedented level because in the next crisis we may have to save Facebook and Amazon because they would be so intertwined in the financial sector.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  So this is...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OMAROVA</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  ... actually, this is powerfully important and I appreciate your comments on this.  </p><p>      You know, a lot of discussion in Fintech centers on the consumer to corporate part of this but there's also the part about the effect it would have on wholesale banking. Can you just say a word more about that? You've talked about blowing up \"Too Big to Fail,\" just a bit more?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OMAROVA</emphasis>:  So remember with subprime mortgages for example, it was also, the rhetoric was all about the right of the consumer to choose, to take a very expensive loan for example but in reality those mortgages were the fuel for the wholesale market speculation and so I worry that allowing digitization (ph) of data and all of the sort of new Fintech innovation without proper controls will actually increase the potential for wholesale market speculation in the secondary market that would make the system more volatile and more unstable and we have to be aware of that danger.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  Good. So thank you very much.   </p><p>      You know, I know there's a lot that improving technology can do to reduce costs and improve service for customers but I'm concerned that this Treasury report consistently ignores real concerns that could arise both for consumers and for the industry and change the -- have an impact on protecting data, on reducing consumer choices on maintaining safety in the financial systems.  </p><p>      So thank you very much Mr. Chairman for holding this hearing. I hope we'll continue to dig into this issue. Thank you.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CRAPO</emphasis>:  We definitely will and I think there's a lot of bipartisan agreement on a lot of these issues.  </p><p>      I need to wrap up the hearing, however Senator Brown has asked for one more round of five minutes...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BROWN</emphasis>:  I have a question.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CRAPO</emphasis>:  ... so...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BROWN</emphasis>:  Yes. Thanks.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CRAPO</emphasis>:  ... I'll just -- Senator Brown...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BROWN</emphasis>:  Thank you.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CRAPO</emphasis>:  ... I will grant that (inaudible)...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BROWN</emphasis>:  Thank you Chairman.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CRAPO</emphasis>:  ... sorry, I'm going to have to wrap the hearing after.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BROWN</emphasis>:  And Mr. Chairman, thank you for the -- we've had just sort of private discussions about the overlap in the common interest we see in some of this on privacy and hopeful we can -- oh I'm hopeful that we can come together on some things.  </p><p>      Couple of questions left, I have -- quickly Ms. -- Professor Omarova and Mr. Knight if I could direct the first one to you, should non-financial -- starting with you Professor Omarova, should a non-financial company be allowed access to consumers detailed financial -- financial data such as transactions or account balances or should the traditional separation of banking and commerce extent the data sharing as well?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OMAROVA</emphasis>:  I absolutely think that the traditional separation of banking and commerce should extend to everything that relates to data.  </p><p>      I don't think that pure disclosure really cures the problem because the problem is structural. The problem is about the market power crossing over different sectors and essentially hurting all of us in the long-term competitiveness of our economy.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BROWN</emphasis>:  Thank you.  </p><p>      Mr. Knight, any comments on that?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KNIGHT</emphasis>:  So I'm somewhat more optimistic of that. I think that there may be circumstances where that sort -- allowing that sort of exchange can actually be beneficial to the consumer.  </p><p>      I do think that a meaningful disclosure, meaningful acceptance is critical to this because of what we're talking about, very sensitive information and if the consumer is allowing that information to be shared it should be used only for the purposes that the consumer has granted access to and that consent should be periodically reacquired, it should not be something that you know, click yes on a splash screen when you first sign up and then never hear about it again.  </p><p>      So I -- but I do think there may be scenarios where that exchange actually is worth it.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BROWN</emphasis>:  Thank you.  </p><p>      And last question Mr. Boms.  </p><p>      And thank you, Mr. Chairman.  </p><p>      What would be the impact of a successful hack of one of your members?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KNIGHT</emphasis>:  Senator, it would depend on which of the members we're talking about so if I could I'll separate them from the aggregator members, and the end-Fintech clients.  </p><p>      For the aggregator members, there's a lot -- a lot of variety. There are mostly read-only platforms, you can't execute transactions across them. While many do hold credentials as a way to get into the ecosystem, they employ best-in-class security systems, hardware encryption, elements of data security that I'm not qualified to get into. That's not to say that more can't be done but of course you know, they're -- they're not encumbered by...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BROWN</emphasis>:  And there have been successful hacks in the past of course... It's  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KNIGHT</emphasis>:  ... Well, I would argue...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BROWN</emphasis>:  ... against them (ph)?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KNIGHT</emphasis>:  ... I would argue respectfully that the vast majority of the hacks that we see in the financial ecosystem are at the incumbent financial institutions not at the Fintech players or at least the ones that I represent. That's not to say that one won't happen (inaudible) second (inaudible).  </p><p>      For the end user -- and I should also add for the aggregators many have adopted policies where they don't collect PII so they are the pipeline, they connect one entity to the data that they acquire for the use case but don't themselves retain the identifying information that the end user provides to their third-party.  </p><p>      But I think underlying the question Senator, is there needs to be standards for data security in this ecosystem and that's why my members at least have come out and said whether it's regulatory prescribed or whether it's private sector driven, we're ready to have that conversation and we've already started to deploy some of those standards across the 50 companies that I work with.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BROWN</emphasis>:  Yes. Thanks.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CRAPO</emphasis>:  Alright. Thank you, Senator Brown.  </p><p>      And I again want to thank the witnesses. I have a lot more questions I want to ask. I don't know if I'll pummel you with all of those but over time we are going to dig much more deeply into this as a committee. This is an incredibly important issue and it's complex, it needs to be understood and we appreciate your helping us to get a deeper understanding today.  </p><p>      That concludes the committee questioning.  </p><p>      For senators wishing to submit questions for the record questions those questions will be due in one week on Tuesday, September 25.   </p><p>      Witnesses, we ask you when you receive questions if you would promptly respond them -- respond to them. And again, we thank you for your willingness to come and share expertise with us today.  </p><p>      With that this hearing is adjourned.  </p><p>      END   </p></bodyText></section></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FMRWRE2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5T9F-1JC1-F15W-H0MN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">345281</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><publicationInfo><publicationName>Financial Markets Regulatory Wire</publicationName><bodyText><p>All materials herein are protected by United States copyright law and may not be reproduced, distributed, transmitted, displayed, published or broadcast without the prior written permission of CQ Transcriptions.

OMAROVA, PROFESSOR OF LAW AND DIRECTOR OF CORNELL      UNIVERSITY'S JACK CLARKE PROGRAM ON THE LAW AND REGULATION OF      FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND MARKETS, TESTIFY</p><p>      [*]      CRAPO:  This hearing will come to order.</p><p>      Today we will hear four very unique perspectives on a segment of Financial Technology or Fintech.</p><p>      Almost exactly one year ago the Committee held a hearing to explore the various sectors and applications of Fintech. In the short time between that hearing on this one many developments and innovations have occurred both in the private sector and on the regulatory front. Digitization and Data in particular are constantly evolving challenging the way we've traditionally approached and conducted oversight of the Financial Services Sector. </p><p>      As technology has developed and the ability to readily and cheaply interact with and use data has flourished we have experienced a sort of revolution in the Digital Era. This Digital revolution brings with it the promise of increasing consumer choice, inclusion, and economic prosperity among other things.</p><p>      Less than a decade ago the concept of Mobile Banking, a simple transaction was relatively new. Now consumers have countless options by which to interact with and to access their financial information and conduct transactions.</p><p>      As this marketplace rapidly develops so must we constantly evaluate our regulatory and oversight framework much of which was designed prior to the Digital Era. To the extent that there are improvements that can be made to better foster and not stifle innovation we should examine those.</p><p>      Although these technological developments are incredibly positive the increase digitization and ease of collecting, storing, and using data presents a new set of challenges and requires our diligence -- our vigilance.</p><p>      Many products and services in the Fintech sector revolve around Big Data Analytics, Data Aggregation, and other technologies that makes use of consumer data. Often times these processes operate in the background and are not always completely transparent to consumers. It's important for consumers to know when their data is being collected and how it's being used.</p><p>      It is equally important for the companies and the government alike to act responsibly with this data and ensure that it is protected. As we've seen in recent years this can be a challenging task. In order to fully embrace the immense benefits that can result from technological innovation we must ensure that proper safeguards are in place and consumers are fully informed.</p><p>      Today I hope to hear from our witnesses about the ways in which Fintech is changing the Financial sector and the improvements that can be made to ensure the regulatory landscape welcomes that innovation, what kind of data is being collected and used, and how such data secured and protected, and what the opportunities and challenges are going forward.</p><p>      Senator Brown?</p><p>      BROWN:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</p><p>      In the run-up to the financial crisis, Wall Street banks bragged about innovations they -- that they claim made the financial system less risky and credit more affordable. Some of these innovations were in consumer products like interest-only Subprime mortgages; other innovations were happening behind the scenes like growth and risky collateralized debt obligations and credit default swaps.</p><p>      According to the banks, technological advances like increasing computer power -- computing power and information sharing through the Internet allowed financial institutions to calculate and mitigate the risks of these complex financial innovations.</p><p>      In Washington banks told lawmakers that regulation would hold back progress, they say that often many issues, and make credit more expensive for consumers rather than look at financial technology with an eye to the risks. Federal banking supervisors repealed safety and soundness protections and that they use their authority to override consumer protection laws in several states.</p><p>      Eventually so-called financial innovations led to the biggest economic disaster in almost a century causing millions of Americans their homes, their jobs, much of their savings, criticizing banking -- bankers and regulators who lost sights -- who lost sight of the enormous risks that came with these new innovations.</p><p>      Former Fed Chair Paul Volcker declared, \"The ATM has been the only useful innovation in banking for the past 20 years.\"</p><p>      I'm more optimistic about some new technologies benefiting consumers rather than just lining Wall Street's pockets but I think we should look at this Treasurer report with the same level of skepticism.</p><p>      Rather than learn from past mistakes the Treasury report embraces the shortsightedness of pre-crisis regulators and exalts the benefits of financial innovation. It describes federal and state regulation as cumbersome or as barriers to innovation and recommends cutting important consumer protections like the CFPB's Payday Lending Rule.</p><p>      If even suggest ripping away what little control we as consumers now have over our own personal financial data just a year after Equifax put a hundred and forty-eight million American identities at risk, 5 million in my state alone.</p><p>      Just like a dozen years ago, Wall Street banks and big companies are making record profits but working families are struggling just to get by; student loan debt is at record levels; credit card defaults are rising; worker pay isn't keeping up with inflation; comments from the administration notwithstanding but we managed to cut tax for the richest Americans while CEO and shareholders have reaped huge windfalls through over a half trillion dollars in stock buy backs.</p><p>      Plenty of financial institutions are adopting new technology without running afoul of the law. Rather than focusing on how we can weaken the rules for a handful of companies, a peer group (ph) -- who prefer to be called Fintech rather than Payday Lenders or Data Aggregators rather than Consumer Reporting Bureaus, Treasury should be focused on policies that help working families.</p><p>      This isn't a partisan issue for me. I raise concerns about relaxing the rules for Fintech firms when Comptroller Curry, appointed by President Obama, suggested a special Fintech charter almost two years ago.</p><p>      The new leaders at the Federal Reserve, the OCC, the FDIC, and the CFPB, have already made it clear they are ready to give Wall Street whatever it asks for and they never have enough.</p><p>      In the recommendations in this report calls for more handout for financial firms, Fintech or otherwise.</p><p>      I'm interested however to hear from our witnesses about how new financial technologies could increase our control over our own information, better protect against cyber-attacks, make it easier for lenders to ensure they're following the law and as traditional banks partner with technology firms, I think it's important for the Committee to consider where gaps in regulations might lead to future systemic risks.</p><p>      Thank you, Mr. Chairman for holding the hearing.</p><p>      CRAPO:  Thank you Senator Brown. And I agree with you, this is not a partisan issue we all want to get the benefit of what can be developed with this kind of increasing technological capacity but there is significant concern about privacy and protection of data, of our consumers that is agreed to on both sides of the aisle here I believe.</p><p>      We welcome our witnesses here with us today.</p><p>      We have Mr. Steven Boms, the President of Allon Advocacy, on behalf of the Consumer Financial Data Rights Association; Mr. Stuart Rubinstein, President of Fidelity Wealth Technologies; Mr. Brian Knight, Director of the Innovation and Governance Program at Mercatus Center at George Mason University; and Ms. Saule Omarova -- did I -- pronounce that right? Who is the Professor of Law and Director at the Jack Clarke Program on the Law and Regulation of Financial Institutions and Markets at Cornell University.</p><p>      We again welcome all of you. We appreciate your being here to share your expertise with us. Your written statements will be made a part of the record. We ask you to please be very careful to pay attention to the five-minute clock for your oral comments and as you are engaged in questioning; the Senators have a five-minute clock too and sometimes they run right out of the last second for their last question and when that happens, I ask you to be prompt in your responses to those questions.</p><p>      With that Mr. Boms, you may begin?</p><p>      BOMS:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</p><p>      Chairman Crapo, Ranking Member Brown, and members of the committee thank you for this opportunity to testify today on behalf of the Consumer Financial Data Rights or CFDR group, a consortium of approximately 50 aggregators and Fintech firms united behind consumer's rights to access their financial data.</p><p>      My testimony this morning also represents the views of the Financial Data and Technology Association or FDATA of North America which is the trade association urging the adoption of an open banking-like regime in the U. S., Canada, and Mexico.</p><p>      The CFDR group and its members consulted frequently with the Treasury Department as it considered the current state of the Fintech market. Our engagement was principally focused on the crucial issue of consumer-permissioned financial data which was an area of emphasis in the Department's report and which I'd like to focus on today.</p><p>      A recent White House study concluded that 20 percent of adult Americans are under banked by the traditional Financial Services system and almost 9 million households are entirely unbanked. For these consumers, third-party technology-based tools can provide vital affordable access to a financial system that's left them behind. These tools also help other Americans address the growing complexity of the financial system. </p><p>      Most consumers have multiple accounts across a variety of providers. The most basic fundamental first step towards financial health, understanding what one has and what one owes can be needlessly difficult. Technology-powered tools can provide intuitive, accessible platforms that enables even the least financially savvy among us to manage their finances and improve economic outcomes.</p><p>      The lifeblood of these tools is user-permissioned data access, the right of the consumer or the small business to affirmatively grant access, to the application of their choice, to connect to or see their financial data.</p><p>      Unlike in other jurisdictions globally there is no legal requirement in the United States stipulating that a financial institution must make the consumers or small businesses' financial data it holds available to a third party when the customer provides consent or where there are restrictions on the consumer's access to that data are permissible.</p><p>      Consumers are dependent on the Financial Services providers with which they do business, with disparate outcomes for Americans who bank with different financial institutions. The lack of a cohesive framework also threatens American competitiveness and financial innovation internationally.</p><p>      The Treasury Department identified the key outstanding issues with regard to user-permissioned data access. I'll briefly highlight five recommendations for the Committee's consideration here, noting that I provide significantly more reaction in my written testimony.</p><p>      Number one, the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection should affirm that third parties properly authorized by consumers follow from the definition of consumer for the purpose of obtaining access to financial account and transaction data. Though it may seem self-evident, Section 1033 of Dodd-Frank provides that the Bureau has the authority to promulgate a rule to ensure end users have electronic access to their online data but the Bureau has thus far declined to do so.</p><p>      Treasury's affirmation that Dodd-Frank provides this right to consumers and small businesses even in the absence of the Bureau rule-making represents a significant victory for innovation and for consumer and small business financial empowerment.</p><p>      Number two, all regulators should recognize the benefits of consumer access to financial account and transaction data in electronic form.</p><p>      One of the systemic disadvantages facing the Fintech ecosystem in the United States is the immense relative regulatory fragmentation that exists. There are at least eight federal regulatory agencies with jurisdiction over some portion of financial data access. There are of course also state regulatory authorities.</p><p>      Treasury's call for all agencies to align behind its interpretation of Dodd-Frank, Section 1033 is an important step towards a level playing field and one that could be hastened by congressional engagement.</p><p>      Number three, the Bureau should work with the private sector to develop best practices on disclosures and terms and conditions regarding consumers use of products and services.</p><p>      The United Kingdom's Open Banking architecture include prescriptive consent flows that ensure consumers or small business experience, granting or revoking consent to access their data to any third party is uniform. These open-banking consent standards are an excellent starting point for creating best practices in the U. S. market.</p><p>      Number four, a solution must address resolution of liability for data access.</p><p>      The CFDR earlier this year released a set of principles, Secure Open Data Access or SODA which calls for traceability, minimum cyber-liability insurance standards and other standards designed to ensure that the entity responsible for consumer financial loss as a result of a breach, be it a bank or an aggregator or a Fintech firm, is going to be charged with making the end user whole for direct losses resulting from that breach.</p><p>      While CFDR members are implementing these principles, regulatory agencies and Treasury could augment and assist this work by undertaking efforts to create a more vibrant and affordable cyber-liability insurance market.</p><p>      Number five, address the standardization of data elements as part of improving consumer's access to their data.</p><p>      While the CFDR group and FDATA North America wholeheartedly agree with the Department's recommendation, I would respectfully submit an addendum. The standardization of data elements should be made available to the consumer, to permit access to third parties of their choosing so that all data elements available to the end user in their native online banking environments is also available to the third-party if the consumer consents.</p><p>      This approach would fully enable and users to leverage their own financial data to their economic benefit and will allow for the realization of the competitive free marketplace in which consumers have full transparency and to financial products and services offered by Fintech providers and financial services firms alike.</p><p>      Thank you again for this opportunity to testify. There are tens of millions of American consumers and small businesses that are already utilizing third-party tools to improve their financial well-being, more can be done to harness the power of innovation safely and security.</p><p>      We stand ready to work with this committee to implement and identify Treasury's recommendations.</p><p>      Thank you.</p><p>      CRAPO:  Thank you, Mr. Boms.</p><p>      Mr. Rubinstein?</p><p>      RUBINSTEIN:  Thank you, Chairman Crapo, Ranking Member Brown, and members of the committee.</p><p>      My name is Stuart Rubinstein. I'm president of Fidelity Wealth Technologies and Head of Data Aggregation at Fidelity Investments.</p><p>      Fidelity is the leading provider of investment management, retirement planning, brokerage, and other Financial Services to more than 30 million individuals, institutions, and intermediaries, with more than $7 trillion in Assets Under Administration. We are strong supporters of Fintechs and are a major Fintech investor. </p><p>      I'm appearing today to represent Fidelity with the specific focus on the topic of Financial Data Aggregation. At Fidelity we have a unique perspective, we are an aggregator ourselves and we're also a source of data to aggregators who act in behalf of our customers.</p><p>      Fidelity is a strong believer in the benefits our customers receive when they can see a consolidated picture of their finances through aggregated data. We have offered aggregation services to our customers for well over a decade and our customers have been able to access their Fidelity data through various third parties since the 1990s. But the cyber-security environment has changed over time and risks have become far more pronounced and must be addressed.</p><p>      First most financial data aggregation that occurs today requires consumers to disclose their financial institutions username and password to the third party -- third-party aggregator or Fintech. While this process may have worked in the past it is now antiquated as there are new technologies that eliminate any such requirement. Because cyber-security is of paramount importance we believe that customers should not have to disclose their username and password in order to access any third-party service. </p><p>      Second aggregators using credentials may have access to an entire website or mobile app which means they can access more data than may be necessary to provide their services. For example, a simple app that tracks your spending does not need to know your investment holdings but will have access to that under the current methods. </p><p>      Because of the investment of cyber-threats Fidelity and others in the industry have worked hard on developing a different approach to data aggregation that helps to protect consumers. At Fidelity we've develop what we believe are five principles for empowering consumers to share their data safely with third parties:      First consumer should be able to access their financial account data where they want it and when they want it and through third parties if they so desire. The question becomes not if they can do it but how;</p><p>      Two, access must be provided in a safe, secure, and transparent manner;</p><p>      Three, consumers should provide affirmative consent and directly instruct their financial institution to share data with specific third parties;</p><p>      Four, the -- fourth third parties should access only the financial data that they need to provide their product or service. This should not be a Trojan horse for the gathering, accumulating, and reselling of consumer; and </p><p>      Fifth consumer should be able to monitor those account access-rights and direct their financial institution to revoke that if they so desire.</p><p>      In an effort to back up these words with actions Fidelity announced in November of 2017 a new service based on these principles called \"Fidelity Access.\" Fidelity Access will allow Fidelity customers to provide third-party access to customer data through a secure connection without providing login credentials to any third party.</p><p>      We've also been working with policymakers and industry groups to advance these principles and are pleased that many have taken thoughtful approaches to this problem.</p><p>      Finally, I would be remiss if I did not mention the most difficult issues standing in the way of wider adoption of safer data sharing technologies, the issue of responsibility. We believe companies that collect and handle financial data should be responsible for protecting that data and making customers whole if misuse, fraud, or theft occurs.</p><p>      As we've been discussing Fidelity Access we've seen aggregators try to limit their liability, some to very small dollar-amounts. Fidelity believes firms that obtain and handle consumer aggregated data should be held responsible to protect that data from unauthorized use just as we are. Any other standard creates moral hazard and does not incentivize aggregators to take their data storage response -- data stewardship responsibilities seriously.</p><p>      Thank you again for the opportunity to testify before you today. I look forward to answering your questions.</p><p>      CRAPO:  Thank you, Mr. Rubinstein.</p><p>      Mr. Knight?</p><p>      KNIGHT:  Thank you, Chairman Crapo, Ranking Member Brown, and members of the committee.</p><p>      My name is Brian Knight and I'm the Director of the Innovation and Governance Program at the Mercatus Center.</p><p>      Whether it's a loan to deal with an emergency, moving money to a loved one in need, or capital to build a business, access to high-quality financial services is essential. Technological innovation in financial services or Fintech has the potential to significantly improve this access.</p><p>      As the Treasury Department notes one area where technology may dramatically change financial services is in the collection and use of data. Technology advances allow financial services firms to obtain more data from consumers and process the data in new ways with the goal of providing more accessible, inclusive, and cost-effective options.</p><p>      While it is early there are encouraging signs that innovation is in fact helping consumers. These include Innovative products giving consumers more transparency as to their finances and allowing lenders to offer potential borrowers better quality credit through innovative underwriting.</p><p>      There is also an indication that technology is making credit markets less discriminatory. This is promising but there have also been concerns raised about potential risks to consumers including risks of privacy and discrimination. These concerns should be taken seriously and we should react appropriately but we should be loath to rush into regulation without being certain that new regulation is necessary. As we assess what the government response to technological invasion should be we should keep a few things in mind:      First, we should judge innovation compared to the status quo, not perfection. Innovative financial service products will not be perfect but they may be better than the alternative. Imposing unduly burdensome regulation that hampers innovation and competition may ultimately be more harmful to the very consumers that regulation seeks to protect;</p><p>      Second, we should acknowledge that existing regulations may address new risks. For example, the requirement that a lender be able to explain why it took an adverse action could mitigate against the concern that algorithmic underwriting will be unduly opaque. There are existing regulatory incentives as well as market incentives for companies to ensure their products are fair and appropriately transparent.</p><p>      Third we should be open to the possibility that in some cases the current regulatory system is in fact overly burdensome. There may be cases where the cost of regulation now exceeds the potential benefits or where a regulatory structure that made sense in the past has been overtaken by market developments. This does not mean that new regulation may not sometimes be needed but as technology changes what is possible with financial services the optimal level or type of regulation may change.</p><p>Fintech offers exciting possibilities for better, cheaper, and more inclusive financial services. We should be mindful of the risks posed but we should not overreact, instead we should work to ensure that the legal and regulatory system facilitates innovation and competition while preserving consumer protection so that Americans can obtain the best financial services possible.</p><p>      I look forward to our discussion. And thank you for your time.</p><p>      CRAPO:  Thank you, Mr. Knight.</p><p>      Ms. Omarova?</p><p>      OMAROVA:  Senators, thank you for inviting me to testify here today.</p><p>      My written testimony lays out the details of what I have to say so let me focus on a few big picture points.</p><p>Fintech is by far the hottest topic in today's finance, cryptography, cloud computing, Big Data Analytics are changing financial markets by making transacting faster and easier to automate and scale up.</p><p>      We have just heard arguments emphasizing the immense societal benefits of these changes as long as Fintech innovations are not stifled by outdated regulations.</p><p>      Let's put these arguments in context, it is quite symbolic that we're convened here today almost exactly on the 10th anniversary of Lehman Brothers failure that triggered the global financial crisis.</p><p>      I don't have to tell your senators what the calamity that crisis was, you lived through that crisis and for years before the crisis you and your colleagues probably sat through many hearings just like this one listening to many confident and articulate gentlemen with impeccable industry credentials tell you that you should not let outdated regulations stifle financial innovation.</p><p>      They told you and the American public that innovative financial products like derivatives and subprime mortgage loans were making the financial system more efficient, resilient, and Democratic by enabling better risk management, expanding consumer choices, and making credit available to low income Americans. And so risky derivatives and predatory subprime loans were allowed to grow unregulated until they crashed the financial system 10 years ago.</p><p>      Today the same rhetoric of financial innovation and consumer choice that brought us a crisis of 2008 returns to the center stage in the policy debate on Fintech. Of course, this time it's different, it's not about derivatives but about crypto-assets; it's not about predatory subprime lending but about marketplace lending. Once again new technology is promising to make the system more efficient, resilient, and Democratic, to expand consumer choices and to give low-income Americans access to financial services.</p><p>      The Treasury report adopts this rhetoric and translates it into a strategy of significant deregulation in the U. S. banking sector meant to enable banks to deform large-scale business partnerships and even outright corporate affiliations with technology companies.</p><p>      For example, the report advocates for a significant roll back of existing regulations in order to make it easier for the banks to give unaffiliated Tech companies, data aggregators, cloud service providers, and various Fintech firms much more direct access to their customers account and transactional data.</p><p>      Currently banks are reluctant to allow data-mining businesses to get the direct fee of their depositors' accounts data because regulators make banks ultimately responsible for the handling of sensitive customer information. For the same reasons of regulatory compliance and liability, banks are currently cautious about moving all of their data to the cloud operated by a third party.</p><p>      The Treasury characterizes this as a bottleneck in the flow of financial information and calls for a concerted regulatory effort to push banks to share their customer data and to outsource its management to third parties much more freely.</p><p>      The claim here is that allowing unaffiliated Tech companies to access, host, and manage bank data will make financial services faster and cheaper for all consumers and give consumers control over their financial affairs.</p><p>      Of course, banks will benefit from being able to reduce their operational and compliance costs and potentially increasing their revenues by charging aggregators for direct fees of customer data. And consumers will get the convenience of living in a seamless virtual space where all Fintech apps can just magically connect to all of their bank accounts but this is also expose consumers to tremendous risks.</p><p>      Imagine that your personal bank account data, transaction history, and other sensitive information previously managed by your local bank is now stored in the cloud and shared directly and in real time with multiple data collecting companies. These companies are not regulated under a bank-like regime with dedicated supervisors making sure that the data is safe and secure, that these companies maintain strong operational controls and don't misuse sensitive consumer information.</p><p>      In this environment it's easy to imagine not just one but many Equifax-style catastrophes occurring far more frequently and with far more devastating consequences. This is in fact a particular kind of a broader problem that our system of bank regulations has jealously guarded against since the 19th century.</p><p>      The potential for excessive concentration of financial and market power if banks are allowed to engage too intimately with non-bank commercial businesses. This separation of banking and commerce remains a core principle of U. S. banking law to this day. The Treasury report however calls for measures that will directly undermine this long-standing and sensible regime. What it frames is loci-technical (ph) fixes to how regulators apply banking laws is in fact opening the door to de facto Fintech conglomeration. If allowed this new platform thrust will be able to monopolize the flow of both money and information, and effectively take control of our lives, not only as economic actors but also citizens.</p><p>      The American Republic of George Washington and Teddy Roosevelt was never meant to become dystopic company town of this kind.</p><p>      As we're deliberating on Fintech as a public policy matter I urge you to stand on guard and not let this become even a remote possibility.</p><p>      Thank you.</p><p>      CRAPO:  Thank you Ms. Omarova.</p><p>      I'll start my questions with you Mr. Knight. While innovations in data have brought many benefits, it's also become known that firms may be in fact I think are using this data to drive social policy and to restrict access to entirely legal, in fact sometimes constitutionally protected conduct and do this for reasons of trying to influence social policy, unrelated to safety and soundness or other concerns that would make these targeted groups unfit to do business with. Do you think this presents a problem?</p><p>      KNIGHT:  Thank you Senator, I do. And I think it presents a couple of problems.</p><p>      The first one to key on the data point is to the extent your -- that a financial institution is collecting data that relates to a sensitive or private matter and particular the more grainial -- granular the data collection is, the potentially more harmful a breach would be, right?</p><p>      The -- information that is relatively innocuous at one level of detail can become, extremely damaging at another level of detail and of course depending on how much micro-targeting if you will, the bank is doing and the fine -- the level of detail that the bank has stored, if that data is breached, that data is now available and people can be harmed more than had the data been recorded at a less -- at a less granular level.</p><p>      The second and I think bigger issue that we're dealing with here while I think our starting point should be that a business can choose to do or not do business with anyone they want for whatever reason they want in a free market. And then we're going to narrow that for some compelling societal issues like antidiscrimination.</p><p>      The problem is banks are not a free market. Banks because of public policy, there are barriers to entry, there are barriers to exit, there is significant subsidy and so banks have -- part of their market power is derived from public power and so when they chose to use their market power in an effort not to do what they've been charged to do which is to effectively intermediate credit or provide savings but instead try to insist or de facto regulate the American people in a -- in a social policy-setting, they're not using their market power, they're using public power and the people who are on the receiving end of that don't have the same market protections that they would in a freer market.</p><p>      You know, if -- let's take an example of YouTube who you know, will periodically say, \"We won't cover certain types of videos for social policy reasons.\" Well you can stand up a YouTube competitor tomorrow, you don't need a government-granted, discretionary charter. There is no -- and if you were to stand up a competitor to YouTube, YouTube doesn't get special access to government Internet; it doesn't get insurance; it doesn't get lens -- loans from the government; there isn't a presumption that if YouTube is about ready to fail, the government will bail it out which are things that banks enjoy versus their non-bank competition and that limits the ability of banks -- that increases the ability of banks to throw market power around, that's not derived from anything other than government power.</p><p>      CRAPO:  Well thank you. And I share those concerns.</p><p>      I want to shift a little bit here and to you Ms. Omarova. I appreciate your testimony on some of the positive aspects that Fintech offers consumers but some of the concerns that you raise are also concerns that I share.</p><p>      There's an article in today's \"Wall Street Journal\" that highlights this intersection and this is the title of it, \"Facebook and Financial Firms Tussle -- Tussled for Years Over Access to User Data.\" This follows on August article in \"The Wall Street Journal\" entitled, \"Facebook to Banks, 'Give Us Your Data. We Will Give You Our Users'.\" The article suggests that data privacy is a sticking point in these conversations.</p><p>      Can you discuss the data privacy concerns and the need to better understand what kind of data is being collected and used and how such data is secured and protected? And I only have about a minute left in my time so I...</p><p>      OMAROVA:  I think this article actually highlights precisely what's at stake here. This is what the Treasury report is suggesting. It's not so much about what current data aggregators do with data today, it's about companies like Facebook and it just shows that those Big Tech companies, platform companies that use information as currency in their businesses, once they get their hands on the data, on the sensitive bank customers' data, in any way for any reason they will try to use that data to increase their revenues in a variety of spheres.</p><p>      And it will be extremely difficult to actually check how they use their data, they use proprietary algorithms to basically hide that from us. And who is going to oversee it? Who regulates Facebook for these kinds of issues? Nobody does.</p><p>      I'm glad that Bank of America and Wells Fargo refused Facebook access to their bank customers data but I don't kid myself for any -- for a minute that they've done it out of some kind of moral respect for customer privacy. They've done it because of the regulations that apply to them today.</p><p>      If we remove those regulations then all of our sensitive financial data will be open to companies like Facebook and we will not know how it will be used.</p><p>      CRAPO:  Well thank you. I share those concerns as well.</p><p>      Mr. Rubinstein and Mr. Boms, I'm out of time but I'm not out of questions for you, I might have to submit them if we don't get another opportunity.</p><p>      Senator Brown?</p><p>      BROWN:  Thanks Mr. Chairman.</p><p>      Ms. Omarova thank you for mentioning the 10th anniversary. I -- there is a -- that as I've remind -- many of my colleagues here, a bit of collective amnesia on this dais in the Senate and thank you for always reminding me that.</p><p>      I have three questions I'd like to get through, I'm going to start with you Ms. Omarova and if you'd moved the answer as close to yes or no as you can, I'll start (inaudible) each of the questions and move from my right to my left.</p><p>      The Treasury Department and much of the financial industry argue that consumers should have the right to share their financial data with any third party of their choosing, do you think this should include the right for consumers to require that a Fintech or a data aggregator erase all information at that consumer's request?</p><p>      OMAROVA:  Yes, absolutely. And you know, we have to keep in mind though that this rhetoric of consumer choice and consumers' right to share the information also imply the firms' right to share their information and that's what we need to guard against.</p><p>      BROWN:  Thank you. </p><p>      Mr. Knight?</p><p>      KNIGHT:  Yes, subject to reasonable considerations like law enforcement.</p><p>      BROWN:  OK.</p><p>      Mr. Rubinstein?</p><p>      RUBINSTEIN:  Yes, absolute -- yes, absolutely. Consumers should understand why they're sharing their data, share it for a specific purpose. When they no longer want to use that -- you no longer have that purpose, be able to stop sharing it and have it deleted.</p><p>      BROWN:  Mr. Boms?</p><p>      BOMS:  Agreed subject to applicable regulations and laws.</p><p>      BROWN:  OK. Thanks.</p><p>      It's hard for a consumer Ms. Omarova -- Ms. Omarova it's hard for a consumer to understand all the ways that financial data might be use by a company they share it with, should there be legal limits on how aggregators use a consumer's financial information in addition to consumer identified limits?</p><p>      OMAROVA:  Yes, absolutely. Basically, data aggregators and other data platform companies like Facebook should not be allowed in the form of, quote/unquote, \"insider trading,\" once they get access to customer data in one context so they could use it in another context.</p><p>      BROWN:  Mr. Knight, legal limitations?</p><p>      KNIGHT:  I believe the limitation should revolve around disclosure and the fact that any consent is given -- is knowingly given and the consumer has rights to terminate that consent at any time.</p><p>      BROWN:  Yes sir, Mr. Knight?</p><p>      KNIGHT:  Yes. I would agree with that. I think really under disclosure -- under a disclosure explicit consent so the consumer knows what they're getting into, really understands it and can control it. I don't know that we need a specific legal limitation though.</p><p>      BROWN:  Mr. Boms?</p><p>      BOMS:  I would echo what the past gentleman said with the additional addendum which is we as an industry not just Fintech but the financial industry can and should do a lot better on conspicuous disclosures.</p><p>      BROWN:  OK. So you're saying legal limits, you're saying disclosures should be the emphasis.</p><p>      Last question, companies like Google and Facebook collect enormous amounts of personal information. They also influence what information consumers are exposed to for example Facebook might show Payday Loan advertisements to service members or to minorities but not its other users.</p><p>      Should Fair Lending Laws be updated to cover not just providing credit products but also their targeted advertisements on Social Media platforms, Ms. Omarova?</p><p>      OMAROVA:  Yes, absolutely. I agree the capacity makes -- raises a new spectrum of discrimination concerns and we have to guard against that.</p><p>      BROWN:  Mr. Knight?</p><p>      KNIGHT:  Senator, that's a great question and I don't know if I can give an answer in the time you'd want. If you'd like to submit a QFR, I'd be happy to answer it.</p><p>      BROWN:  I will do that. Thank you.</p><p>      Mr. Rubinstein?</p><p>      RUBINSTEIN:  Senator, I'm sorry, I'm not an expert in Fair Lending and I probably cannot respond to that... </p><p>      BROWN:  OK.</p><p>      RUBINSTEIN:  ... question.</p><p>      BROWN:  Good. I'll still send a letter to you and have people at Fidelity answer it.</p><p>      RUBINSTEIN:  We -- you can send the letter, we can try. We're not lenders so I don't know that we'd -- I have a good answer that one for you.</p><p>      BROWN:  OK.</p><p>      Mr. Boms?</p><p>      BOMS:  And Senator I'd echo, I'd be happy to respond in writing. It's not something that we've discussed with our members.</p><p>      BROWN:  OK.</p><p>      Last question, thanks for your promptness all of you.</p><p>      The biggest four banks control about 45 percent of bank assets according to your testimony. Facebook and Google together capture between 59 and 73 percent of the online advertising revenue in the U. S.</p><p>      Do you think the Treasury report's recommendation which many of your cited favorably would benefit the large incumbents or would increase competition?</p><p>      Ms. Omarova?</p><p>      OMAROVA:  Well the increase in competition is another good rhetorical choice to you know, promote deregulation but in reality, both the financial sector and the Tech sector is -- are the businesses where economies of scale and economies of scope are extremely important so in reality what the Treasury report wants us to have is the maximum scale and maximum scope of these conglomerates.</p><p>      BROWN:  So it would benefit the larger (inaudible)...</p><p>      OMAROVA:  It would...</p><p>      (CROSSTALK)</p><p>      OMAROVA:  ... benefit large...</p><p>      BROWN:  Mr. Knight?</p><p>      OMAROVA:  ... incumbents.</p><p>      KNIGHT:  Senator, I believe that it would actually be a mix -- potentially mixed benefit. In some cases, the largest companies would benefit. In some cases, the ability of smaller financial institutions to plug into large data providers may allow them to compete with larger financial services companies.</p><p>      BROWN:  Mr. Rubinstein?</p><p>      RUBINSTEIN:  Yes. The Treasury report refers to APIs which is \"Tech Speak\" for more secure data sharing methods. I do believe that that actually increases competition as there are standards, small companies only need to build to one standard to plug into many interfaces so, yes, I do think it helps competition.</p><p>      BROWN:  It certainly would be working against Trans (ph).</p><p>      But Mr. Boms?</p><p>      BOMS:  And Senator, I would just say on behalf of many smaller financial technology firms and not the Facebook's or Google's of the world, there is a very strong view that this would promote competition.</p><p>      BROWN:  So the smaller guys think it would promote competition?</p><p>      BOMS:  Yes. That's correct.</p><p>      BROWN:  Good. Thank you.</p><p>      CRAPO:  Senator Rounds?</p><p>      ROUNDS:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</p><p>      First of all, thank you all for being here today. One of the common threads that I've noted through each of your testimonies was the importance of data breach or data security and Fintech and I'm really curious about the issue of the importance of or the challenges of a National Data Breach Standard.</p><p>      A number of businesses and trade associations have called for Congress and the federal government to step in and establish one, unified data breach standard so businesses could operate across state lines, they would be forced to comply with a patchwork of different regulations.</p><p>      In addition, my colleague in the house of Congressman Blaine Luetkemeyer recently released the Consumer Information Application Requirement Act. This legislation which has passed the House Financial Services Committee would require federal regulators to establish a National Unified Data Breach Standard.</p><p>      On the other hand, 31 State attorneys general have released a letter opposing a prior version of a Data Breach Bill in the House because it would preempt state laws.</p><p>      I'd like your thoughts first of all on what we're discussing right now, coming out of the House. And second of all is a national standard necessary and if so how do we balance that with state interests?</p><p>      Who'd like to begin?</p><p>      OMAROVA:  Let me take this on. I think as a general matter, just because a particular standard is unified, universally applied, easier to understand doesn't necessarily make it a better standard, right? It depends on what the standard is qualitatively.</p><p>      We have the federal system of regulation in this country because we believe in the checks and balances, sometimes state consumer protection laws have to step in more effectively to protect us consumers from abuse by large companies and sometimes the federal laws do a better job by basically you know, creating an even playing field for everybody else.</p><p>      So my responses that would be, it is not necessarily a bad idea to have a unified standard but the key to that would be that that standard creates the maximum protection for the customer's financial data from various abuses that would likely ensue if we take state authorities completely out of the game.</p><p>      ROUNDS:  Thank you.</p><p>      Other thoughts?</p><p>      RUBINSTEIN:  I'm happy to respond Senator.</p><p>      ROUNDS:  Please?</p><p>      RUBINSTEIN:  Thank you for the question. We do support a federal -- a Breach Notification. We think it's -- while a large firm like ours can stay on top of the various state laws, speed is often very necessary in a Breach Notification. Being able to understand one law and be able to respond quickly to that, I think enhances consumer protection, gets customers notified, gets customers and regulators just notified faster.</p><p>      ROUNDS:  Other thoughts?</p><p>      BOMS:  Senator if I may. I would just add. I think certainly you would find broad support within the Fintech ecosystem for a national standard, provided that it was strong enough and provided the right consumer protections.</p><p>      Just to juxtapose that with the ecosystem that we have today, it's very inconsistent from a regulatory perspective. We have CFDR members who are for example FFIEC-supervised and examined, as third-party vendors to large financial institutions. We have other Fintechs who are state regulated and said who are not subject to the Prudential Bank regulatory oversight. And so one standard that encapsulates best practices I think would be welcomed.</p><p>      KNIGHT:  I concur, I can't speak to Representative Luetkemeyer's bill specifically but I'll also say that when assessing whether or not federal standard make sense some other things to think about are whether or not the patchwork of regulations is generating inefficiency that ends up costing consumers money; whether or not there is a disparate treatment among competitors so some people get to leverage one standard, some people get to leverage a different standard.</p><p>      And third whether or not we're seeing citizens being de facto regulated by other states to a significant degree because of course you know, if you're a national player, you're going to comply with California even if someone in you know, Wisconsin maybe wouldn't support that standard.</p><p>      One of the advantages -- potential advantages of a federal standard is that there is broader political representation in setting it and everyone gets a seat at the table, even if you don't end up winning.</p><p>      ROUNDS:  Is there a process today where a lot of these states that have individual offices in particular attorney general's offices, consumer offices, to where they have -- do they have an association so speak where they can speak with a unified voice in terms of what should be part of a core of a national standard that you've worked with?</p><p>      KNIGHT:  Well I have not worked with them on this topic but the National Association of Attorneys General may be a place to go and they do work together both on Advocacy and on Enforcement through multistate enforcement actions.</p><p>      ROUNDS:  Any of you work with anyone of your Associations?</p><p>      No. OK.</p><p>      Thank you.</p><p>      Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</p><p>      CRAPO:  Thank you Senator Rounds.</p><p>      Senator Reed?</p><p>      REED:  Well thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you for your excellent testimony. </p><p>      Mr. Rubinstein, thank you, very thoughtful comments, we appreciate it. You pointed out in your written testimony that you know, there are significant benefits but there are also as you say very real cyber-security and privacy risk.</p><p>      Can you project or let us know what you -- your fears are about sort of the big problems that are out there lurking?</p><p>      RUBINSTEIN:  Yes, Senator, thank you -- thank you for the question.</p><p>      You know, number one is this issue of credential sharing, people giving away their IDs and passwords. Today when Fintechs or Aggregators show up at our front door they login typically with robotic activities, robots that impersonate the customer basically, same as you sitting at your keyboard, type in your ID and password.</p><p>      That only gives access to data and some of that data may be private which you did not intend to share but it also can give access to transactions. And if you think about that, what does that mean? It means that you know, potentially a robot can come in and move your money and move it -- move it somewhere else. That's a risk from having just open access to the website which the current -- which the current methods have.</p><p>      It's difficult for financial institution to know that that's a robot coming in because it looks just like a customer. It's also difficult for the customer then to come back later and say I didn't authorize that activity when in fact they actually gave their ID and password to it to a -- to a third party. Those are real risks though, we think about each and every day.</p><p>      REED:  Thank you very much.</p><p>      The other aspect of this is that we're on a -- beginning of a huge (ph) wave eventually, the aggregation of data will go way beyond just sharing financial information from an institution with customers over the place like Facebook, it will go to all the information they collect, websites you're looking at, what -- may be in what potential pharmaceuticals your ordering , et cetera so that the financial decisions we've been made -- may not be being made by even individual, human beings will be -- and they might not be made in the financial institution, there may be a machine that sharing all this data. Is that something that you're concerned about?</p><p>      RUBINSTEIN:  I think there are great concerns with data that flows without the customer's knowledge and...</p><p>      REED:  Yes.</p><p>      RUBINSTEIN:  ... affirmative consent so I think you know, all that comes in. However, we do firmly believe in the customer's right to share their data. It's their data. If they understand...</p><p>      REED:  Right.</p><p>      RUBINSTEIN:  ... that's being shared, understand how it's being used, frankly they want -- if they want to participate in selling that data, let them participate. You know, hopefully they'll get rewarded for that but they should be able to turn it off at any time too.</p><p>      REED:  So that and in one concept there's the notion of you -- and I think you've -- we've said before and I think there has to be an opt in and opt out not just a generic one when you sign up but constantly as the situation changes, that if there is a value in your data then somehow the customer should be able to realize that value -- at least make the decision based upon you know, I'm giving something up but -- or I'm getting something. And then the notion of erasing data is critical, do you agree?</p><p>      RUBINSTEIN:  Yes. Senator, we'll take Fidelity Access, I mentioned earlier my comments as an example when we use that a customer can actually have a dashboard that they can see which third parties they've granted access to their data so they can monitor that on an ongoing basis and with a single click be able to revoke that consent.</p><p>      Now that only works in many -- financial institutions are building similar things, that only works on the financial institution's side. Once a consumer shares their data with a third party we do believe that they should be able to get that erased but that's actually between then that third...</p><p>      REED:  Right.</p><p>      RUBINSTEIN:  ... party in the consumer.</p><p>      REED:  Oh, that's where we have to step in and provide some type of sensible rules so they can do that, correct?</p><p>      RUBINSTEIN:  I think so, yes.</p><p>      REED:  Ms. Omarova, you -- in this the regulatory climate in which more and more is going to be left to the market, isn't that an argument for giving people the right to go to court if they feel aggrieved even more so and today? Private right of action if they feel aggrieved?</p><p>      OMAROVA:  I suppose so. I think in general because of the complexity of the environment with which we are dealing today and because of the complexity of understanding exactly what kind of personal data is available to whom and how it could be used and the difficulty of monitoring all of that use. I think absolutely every lever of control over the use of that data by the Big Tech companies especially, should be utilized.</p><p>      REED:  Thank you very much.</p><p>      Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</p><p>      CRAPO:  Senator Perdue?</p><p>      PERDUE:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</p><p>      You know, one of the unintended consequences of the Dodd-Frank law was I think it spawned probably -- and it's arguable that the greatest period of bank consolidation U.S. history. We've lost 1,700 banks in the last decade and virtually no new banks have been started. So I've got a question, in that environment Dr. Omarova, you mentioned earlier, I have a question for Mr. Knight first. I want to come back to you on a second question but Dr. Omarova talked about aggravation, the bigger the banks get the more important disaggregation of data becomes.</p><p>      I'm concerned that today we have in that environment of consolidation we have six examining agencies charged with Consumer Financial Protection, one of those is CFPB. We had the acting director before this committee a couple months ago telling us there had been at least 240 breaches of data that they are investigating and possible as many as 800, anyone of those could be worse than the Equifax breach.</p><p>      So the question I have is as we talk about -- Mr. Knight you talked about, accessing this data can help banks actually improve services particularly for people who are underserved today and I agree with that but this Unified National Data Security Standard as we're talking about Breach Notification that I think we all agree on, how would that apply in your mind to these federal examining agencies that have access to this same data?</p><p>      KNIGHT:  So -- I apologize if I understand your question here, is the concern that there is going to be a breach at the agency level?</p><p>      PERDUE:  Yes. We've already been told, there are 240 the CFPB, to be known breaches today, 800 they are investigating, any one of which could be worse than the Equifax breach.</p><p>      KNIGHT:  Yes. I absolutely share that concern and I think that the challenge is, if you allow any entity to access data be it the bank or be it a federal agency, there is that risk and I think that while there are concerns and tools available to punish banks in the case of a breach, or Equifax in the case of a breach -- and we can debate whether or not these tools are adequate. It's harder in many respects to go after an agency due to issues like sovereign immunity and so...</p><p>      PERDUE:  But should they be held to the same standard of data protection that commercial interests are?</p><p>      KNIGHT:  ... At least the same standard.</p><p>      PERDUE:  Thank you.</p><p>      Dr. Omarova, I have a question about where the United States sits with our regulatory environment relative to other countries. In Kenya for example, 93 percent of Kenyans have access to a bank account through MPESA a mobile phone-based money transfer and Micro-Financing Service</p><p>      In China, Ali Baba, I was in -- visit with Ali Baba and Tencent a couple months ago in China. They help facilitate $12.8 trillion in mobile payments in China. They've leapfrogged us and our technology here.</p><p>      No matter we think of our Fintech, a lot of these innovations were developed here but we're slow adopters somehow in the United States.</p><p>      Are we falling behind places like the U. K., Kenya, and China in terms of the adoption of this -- of this technology in Fintech?</p><p>      OMAROVA:  Well Kenya is very different, it has a very different Financial Services market than we do here.</p><p>      PERDUE:  Certainly.</p><p>      OMAROVA:  They don't...</p><p>      PERDUE:  We...</p><p>      OMAROVA:  ... have...</p><p>      PERDUE:  ... but...</p><p>      OMAROVA:  ... the actual banking system...</p><p>      PERDUE:  But the U.K. is very similar?</p><p>      OMAROVA:  ... I'll -- I'll get to that...</p><p>      PERDUE:  OK.</p><p>      OMAROVA:  ... in a second and in Kenya by the way, the success of their mobile banking was built on the central bank and are the major telephone provider...</p><p>      PERDUE:  Right.</p><p>      OMAROVA:  ... banding (ph) together so the state was critical to providing this service to everybody else.</p><p>      China, yes China has Ali Baba, which is competing with our you know, our PayPals and Facebooks and what have you. Again, in China the state apparatus is so strong that China can control whatever those companies do and that's a critical factor.</p><p>      The U.K., we always hold of the U.K., especially the industry does as this sort of principal -- principles-based, much more market friendly, much smarter kind of regulator-type environment. But remember before the crisis, I worked in the Treasury and we were doing reports about how the Financial Services Authority were so much better than our regulators were in terms of allowing financial innovations to go forward.</p><p>      And then the crisis hit. Where is the Financial Services Authority now?</p><p>      PERDUE:  Yes.</p><p>      OMAROVA:  I'm not so sure that the Open Bank -- open-banking initiative in the U.K. is actually achieving the benefits that it was promising.</p><p>      So I think what we should look for is not so much how you know, industry friendly or the regulatory a particular country's environment is, I think we should look at our market structure and the concentrations of power in the Tech industry in the financial sector in our country.</p><p>      PERDUE:  And that's -- that's my question so the only -- I have to gauge this against other standards, other performances and so are we falling behind the adoption of these technologies, relative to consumer protection, and consumer access to banking services?</p><p>      And anybody I'd -- I'd welcome anybody's response to that?</p><p>      OMAROVA:  Oh.</p><p>      PERDUE:  Dr. Omarova? Yes.</p><p>      OMAROVA:  You want me?</p><p>      PERDUE:  Sure.</p><p>      OMAROVA:  I don't think we are falling behind. I think we're taking a more cautious approach simply because we have probably much more to lose.</p><p>      PERDUE:  Very good. </p><p>      Anybody else?</p><p>      BOMS:  Senator, I would -- I would just add, we shouldn't discount the vibrancy and resilience of the U. S. market which obviously stands way above other markets. That said the lack of consistency and clarity in the regulatory and legal framework in the U. S. with regard to data access presents a potential future competitive risk for the U. S. market.</p><p>      PERDUE:  Right. Thank you very much.</p><p>      Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</p><p>      CRAPO:  Senator Warner?</p><p>      WARNER:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</p><p>      I want to follow-up we're Senator Perdue was at Mr. Boms, with what the Europeans are doing, with what the Brits are doing. You know, how does this affect again our market's ability to stay competitive in what's obviously a global field?</p><p>      BOMS:  Sure. Senator, it's -- it's very early days. PSD2 and Open Banking in Europe and the U.K. just went live on 13th January this year. There was a conformance period that will last until September of next year so we are in this transition period but we're seeing adoption of Open Banking APIs by consumers in the U.K., for example increased 50 percent month over month so clearly there's interest in adoption of these tools.</p><p>      We're seeing significant investment into the Fintech market in London. It's not because the cost of living or taxes are low it's because there is a clear regulatory framework and a legal framework for how these -- how these tools can be deployed, prescriptive consent and disclosure flows that consumer are coming to expect and are unaware of.</p><p>      So I don't think it's an eminent threat but I do think if we don't get our house in order in the relative near-term it could become a threat.</p><p>      WARNER:  Well one of the things I -- and related to this -- while not the direct topic today you know, there's a group of us bipartisan that have been working for now 3 1/2, four years to try to at least standardize data breach legislation.</p><p>      The fact that we've got 49, 47 different data breach legislative laws such as -- different than data portability but I would hope you think that some level of federal leadership on data breach would be important as well?</p><p>      BOMS:  Absolutely Senator. So long as the floor that it establishes provide sufficient consumer protection.</p><p>      WARNER:  Right. And that's I think what we've done, frankly we have spent some of -- I was on the talk (ph) on business and before that, it's my old industry that's been some -- I released four data breach legislation but then they all want to carve out for their specific industry and that's not going to end up being the -- I think the way we get it -- get there.</p><p>      And unfortunately, those efforts have lagged a little bit in the last eight or nine months and I think as we think about this we've got to think holistically and Ms. Omarova that's -- that's why want to go to my question with you is, I'm a big advocate around data portability and I think Senator Brown may have indirectly raised this question already.</p><p>      In our -- in my efforts on the -- Intelligence Committee where we're looking at the social media firms who have these platforms, who have enormous, enormous power and growing power, if we -- if we deal with data portability in the Fintech space alone...</p><p>      OMAROVA:  Yes. </p><p>      WARNER:  ... but don't deal with data portability in terms of our individual personal data, if you're not able to move from Facebook to another enterprise and make it easier and allow our CAT videos to move easily as well, we're really not going to be able to have the type of competitive market I think in -- in that field.</p><p>      I just want you to like to comment on the need to not only get this right in the Fintech -- in the financial arena but more broadly based?</p><p>      OMAROVA:  You are absolutely correct. Information is the currency in the digital economy and you know, it takes many forms and it flows through many, many markets for many, many goods and services, not just financial markets but markets for other types of data.</p><p>      And it is a structural problem. I understand the concerns with competitiveness and I am completely in favor of allowing consumers to move freely between different apps and utilize various information in ways that serve their interest. </p><p>      But the problem here is that you have to understand that -- structurally speaking financial institutions are sitting on the type of information that presents a you know, much heightened danger of misuse and this is where we should be particularly careful with respect to Fintech and how the financial information is moving structurally in these markets and probably deal with the broader issues of data protection outside the financial sector and perhaps Antitrust issues as well because those are serious structural issues that exists everywhere in the Big Tech sector separately.</p><p>      WARNER:  Well my concern is that what you know, -- and this committee is looking in terms of Russia sanctions at what happened in 2016...</p><p>      OMAROVA:  Yes.</p><p>      WARNER:  ... but -- where Russia intervene but what I see is the next iteration is that someone will come in and break into non-protected personal financial data...</p><p>      OMAROVA:  Right.</p><p>      WARNER:  ... as they did with Equifax and Senator Warren and I have a bill and it's -- I think a travesty we're a year later and there's still has been no penalty paid by that -- by that company but they would break-in get personal information, contact any of us as an individual, and then what will pop up will be what was called a \"Deep Fake\" video, and it will be somebody that looks like Senator Brown but it's not actually Senator Brown, Livestream video and the combination to wreak havoc there, not only on the political side but on the market side is really huge so we have to solve this issue not just for financial data portability but across the board.</p><p>      OMAROVA:  Oh that's...</p><p>      WARNER:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</p><p>      OMAROVA:  ... absolutely correct, that's absolutely correct.</p><p>      WARNER:  Thank you.</p><p>      CRAPO:  Senator Cortez Masto?</p><p>      CORTEZ MASTO:  Thank you. And thank you Mr. Chair and Ranking Member, obviously this is an important discussion.</p><p>      And for all of you for being here today, it's a great conversation.</p><p>      I echo my colleague Senator Warner. I think we have to look at the simplistic approach. I think -- what I've heard today we all agree we've got to address the data privacy security and consumer protection piece of this but this is emerging technology, it's not going away and we're going to have to figure out at a federal level how we address this but also, I believe incorporating state laws and the states as well. They can -- they have to be a part of this discussion.</p><p>      So let me -- let me ask you this because we received a letter from the National Association of Federally Insured Credit Unions, the Committee did. One statement the Association makes is that as new companies emerge and compete in this area it is important that they compete on a level playing field of regulation from data security to consumer protection. Would each of you agree with that statement?</p><p>      BOMS:  Senator, yes.</p><p>      RUBINSTEIN:  Yes, absolutely. Whoever holds consumer data should be held to the same standards.</p><p>      CORTEZ MASTO:  Yes.</p><p>      KNIGHT:  Yes.</p><p>      CORTEZ MASTO:  Thank you.</p><p>      OMAROVA:  Well yes. It's a generally a good principle.</p><p>      CORTEZ MASTO:  And that level playing field of doesn't that we rollback regulation, does it?</p><p>      BOMS:  Senator, from my perspective no, it doesn't. It means that we make the regulation consistent across the various regulators who have some stake in this.</p><p>      CORTEZ MASTO:  Thank you.</p><p>      KNIGHT:  Yes. I agree.</p><p>      CORTEZ MASTO:  Right. And I think you'd all agree?</p><p>      KNIGHT:  Senator, I would say that -- when we talk about level playing field we should be thinking about what is the risk generating -- where's the risk that's generated that we're trying to regulate against and so if that risk exists, comparable regulation should exist.</p><p>      If a new player comes along and offers a comparable service but doesn't generate a certain risk then they shouldn't be regulated at -- in the same way vis-a-vis that risk.</p><p>      For example, a lender that doesn't fund their loans from federally insured deposits shouldn't be regulated as a depository because they're just not generating the risks that go along with the deposit holding. They should be regulated vis-a-vis consumer protection and lending for example.</p><p>      CORTEZ MASTO:  OK.</p><p>      OMAROVA:  Well, sometimes it's very difficult to figure out exactly what types of risks a particular lender or a particular situation really poses, sometimes we do not see how exactly they fund their loans and their services, we've learned that from this last crisis.</p><p>      And I think that in that sense it's important that if we are looking for leveling the playing field we have to make sure that that common level is not the minimum regulatory level of oversight but the maximum one. And when we're looking at the maximum level of regulatory oversight in the interest of the American public, we should keep in mind the biggest players in those markets, not the smallest ones.</p><p>      CORTEZ MASTO:  Thank you.</p><p>      And can I ask you -- each one of you, so when we're talking about banks and credit unions that allow data aggregators access to bank customers' accounts, if there is a violation of those customer's privacy information and that privacy information for those customers who should be legally liable? Should the banks and credit unions be legally liable if there working with those third-party aggregators and there's a breach?</p><p>      BOMS:  Senator, this is -- you've identified I think perhaps the largest most significant obstacle in this ecosystem which Mr. Rubinstein referenced in his opening statement.</p><p>      The members that I represent would say that, \"he who breaches the data should be responsible for making the consumer whole.\" The catch to that and the issue with that is, we have decades of regulation and consumer expectations that say that it is the financial institution that either should or must make the consumer whole.</p><p>      So on some level even though our members have taken it upon themselves are adopting this notion of \"he who breaches most make the consumer responsible,\" at some point we need to holistically take a look at the regulations that we have on the books and modernize them for the 21st century economy.</p><p>      CORTEZ MASTO:  OK.</p><p>      Anyone else? Yes?</p><p>      RUBINSTEIN:  Senator, as Mr. Boms said it's a very difficult topic. You know, we firmly believe that whoever causes harm to the consumer should make the consumer whole. Unfortunately, this is -- this is a chain. Consumer data starts with the financial institution, it moves to a financial data aggregator then it moves to a Fintech, it may continue to move beyond that.</p><p>      The financial institution only has a direct relationship in that first step of the chain with the financial aggregator. They need to look to that financial aggregator to make the financial institution whole if the financial institution has reimbursed the consumer and then they can deal with their own customer, similar to getting into a car accident, right? You have auto insurance, you turn to your insurance company and then your insurance company goes and subrogates with the other -- with the others down the chain.</p><p>      It's been very difficult. The industry is not adapting that yet and we can use a notion that direction.</p><p>      CORTEZ MASTO:  Thank you.</p><p>      Ms. Omarova or please...</p><p>      OMAROVA:  So...</p><p>      CORTEZ MASTO:  ... down the line, whoever likes to go next?</p><p>      OMAROVA:  ... I think that everybody in that chain should bear responsibility and to be exposed to the liability for data breaches of bank customer data.</p><p>      And what concerns me about the Treasury report in particular is that it never really addresses that issue directly and he talks about, \"yes, we need to kind of have an appropriate liability regime,\" but it's not clear to me what that regime will be like.</p><p>      What I know though is as a practical matter in order to incentivize banks to share their information, their bank customer information with various technology companies, you're going to have to relax the actual liability constraints existing today on them because otherwise they simply wouldn't share it so that's what concerns me a lot.</p><p>      CORTEZ MASTO:  Thank you. And I know I'm out of time. Mr. Chair, I don't know Mr. Knight if you wanted to say a few words? I don't want to take up any...</p><p>      KNIGHT:  Briefly.</p><p>      CORTEZ MASTO:  ... more time. Thank you.</p><p>      KNIGHT:  So in addition to all that's been said, I'd say that the one threshold question we didn't talk about is the Treasury takes the position in the report that's Dodd-Frank's Section 1033, compels the bank to make the information available to the consumers chosen aggregator. </p><p>      I don't know if that's a position the Bureau will take and if we're compelling the bank then the normative argument for holding the bank liable if some accident happens down the chain with an aggregator they did not choose to partner with but were compelled to partner with weakens, whereas if it's a matter of choice all the way down then the principles discussed make more sense.</p><p>      CRAPO:  Senator Scott?</p><p>      SCOTT:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</p><p>      Thank you to the panel for investing the time to be here this morning.</p><p>      Things get complicated when a company is headquartered in Tennessee, does business in South Carolina and its breached in Arkansas. Those states all have different laws on the books governing when and how companies must notify the public of a data breach.</p><p>      The reality is that a patchwork quota (ph) of 50 different breach notifications standards creates a race to the bottom in which breached parties will often comply with the lowest possible standard. Consumers are ultimately the ones that pay the price. They are the ones that lose out.</p><p>      I know that Senator Rounds touched on this question earlier but let me ask you Mr. Boms, is the state-by-state framework for breach notification effective, who stands to benefit from a more uniformed approach?</p><p>      BOMS:  Senator, we think that there is certainly room for improvement, a federal approach that lifts up what the ceiling is across the board would benefit consumers, it would benefit the industry. We think it would be a win-win for everybody involved.</p><p>      It's not simply an issue of regulatory complexity at the state level, several of the Fintech firms that have worked with have federal supervision through a third-party vendor management and said there's a piece of Prudential Bank regulatory authority here as well in this work. This is another area where consistency among regulation not deregulation would be immensely helpful.</p><p>      SCOTT:  Thank you, sir.</p><p>      The Graham -- Gramm-Leach-Biley -- Bliley Act from 1999, we did business very differently than. I think we were all still using paper for most of our transactions. We probably had dial up for our Internet connection and we certainly did not have cell phones that could do anything other than call, and that was a pretty expensive venture as well.</p><p>      Bottom line is that the world has changed so significantly since GLBA was enforced, being law but it is still the foundation of how we govern data aggregators for financial institutions. I'm encouraged by the fact that removing to APIs from screen scraping but it is happening fairly slowly.</p><p>      Mr. Boms you mentioned Europe, Mexico, and Japan, in your testimony. How are U. S. policymakers falling behind in crafting laws that foster Fintech innovation and protection consumer -- and protecting consumer data?</p><p>      BOMS:  Senator, I would -- I would answer in two parts. </p><p>      I think the first thing I would say is APIs in and of themselves are not a panacea, they will not solve everything. The API in addition to being secure as we've heard also must be robust so the API must make -- must include data fields like fees for example so the consumer who is using a third-party tool that compares fees at one for example financial institution can compare what is fees would be for the same products or services at another financial institution so making sure that the APIs with the direct fees are robust is the first step.</p><p>      The second is there are no standards in the U. S. market. The Treasury report talks about data standardization which we think is a very important area that other markets have addressed.</p><p>      In the U.K. open-banking environment, the data elements are standardized. The Mexican central bank and securities regulator are currently working on an API that would standardize the data sets. This would be we think one place to start but there are quite a few that the regulators here could begin with.</p><p>      SCOTT:  Thank you.</p><p>      Almost 30 percent of Americans living in economically distressed communities are credit invisible meaning they have no credit score. An additional 15 percent are unsupportable to -- due to having an insufficient or old credit history. In South Carolina that combined number is about 23 percent or one out of every four adults.</p><p>      Senator Cortez Masto and I have worked diligently to find ways to bring that credit-invisible person to a place where their consistent habits of paying their bills, whether it's their electric bill or cell phone or the rent from a place that they're renting, they're paying those on time, they should get some credit for that.</p><p>      Mr. Knight you testified that innovative underwriting can provide consumers with benefits such as low interest rates, can you speak to the benefits of using rent and utility payments in credit scoring and two other developments in underwriting that will benefit consumers?</p><p>      KNIGHT:  Thank you, Senator. Yes. I think that expanding access to the types of data that bear on the creditworthiness of a borrower, even if they are -- have not traditionally been captured in traditional underwriting like a FICO score, has the potential to be valuable in allowing lenders to make an accurate assessment of the risk that they would take on by lending to a borrower for -- in some cases that will make someone who is credit invisible visible and therefore the lender has enough data, they feel like they can then make you know, make an offer.</p><p>      In other cases, it will indicate that people who are in fact good credit risks or better credit risk than they otherwise get credit for because you're looking at data that hasn't otherwise been picked up so I think that there is potential value there.</p><p>      SCOTT:  Thank you.</p><p>      I have another question on my legislation on the Mobile Act but I'll submit for the record.</p><p>      CRAPO:  Thank you.</p><p>      Senator Warren?</p><p>      WARREN:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</p><p>      So Fintech holds out a lot of promise for consumers and also raises a number of concerns. I think it's critical that the government moves methodically on a regulatory approach to Fintech so we encourage productive innovation but we don't expose consumers to a lot of unnecessary risks.</p><p>      So the Treasury Department issued a report on Fintech earlier this year and almost every instance it advocates for deregulation in an effort to stimulate the Fintech industry and I'm concerned about a lot of those recommendations. One set of recommendations is about rolling back the rules that govern how banks can share personal financial information with third-party data aggregators.</p><p>      So Professor Omarova, I know you addressed this issue in your written testimony and I just would like you if you could very briefly to explain what your concerns are with the Treasury Department's recommendations on this front?</p><p>      OMAROVA:  So my main concern is that the Treasury's approach will essentially open the flood gates for the banks that are currently regulated to open up this treasure trove of sensitive financial data on their customers that they have for much broader types of uses by various tech companies.</p><p>      So my concern is about Facebook, it is about Google, it is about Amazon, and we don't know what they do with the data they touch so they could use it, they could get access to that data in one capacity let's say as a cloud service provider and the code writer but then misuse it in order to miss sell something to the customer, right? </p><p>      And that's what I worry about and the customer consent here could be obtained by the bank at the point when the customer is actually opening a deposit account with a bank and that's what concerns me, this notion of consent and choice could be actually diminished.</p><p>      WARREN:  All right. That's -- it's -- it's very important. Thank you.</p><p>      And given just what just happened with the Equifax breach I think a lot of my constituents and constituents for pretty much everybody here would be uncomfortable with the idea of even more companies getting access to our financial data without our effective consent and without strict rules on how they have to protect that data.</p><p>      Another set of Treasury recommendation would further weaken the wall between banking and commerce. They would allow our biggest banks and our huge technology platforms to join their corporate empires, you were just talking about this, and giant technology companies like Facebook and Google to build up equity stakes in multiple, smaller banks across the country.</p><p>      It -- again could you go back to this Professor and describes some of the potential harms in allowing this kind of consolidation across different industries?</p><p>      OMAROVA:  Right. So the Treasury basically seek -- seeks to weaken the -- how control is defined in the Bank Holding Company Act. The Bank Holding Company Act currently subjects in a company that controls a U. S. bank or is affiliated with a U. S. bank to various regulations and supervision and it's essentially an Antitrust law that seeks to prevent banks from abusing their control of immense power over public money and credit, right?</p><p>      And what the Treasury says is essentially, we should make it much easier for the banks to acquire equity stakes in tech companies and vice versa. And I worry about the fact that it will not create greater competition, it will actually lead to extreme concentrations of power over money and information across the sectors.</p><p>      And it will take the \"Too-Big-to-Fail\" problem to an unprecedented level because in the next crisis we may have to save Facebook and Amazon because they would be so intertwined in the financial sector.</p><p>      WARREN:  So this is...</p><p>      OMAROVA:  Yes.</p><p>      WARREN:  ... actually, this is powerfully important and I appreciate your comments on this.</p><p>      You know, a lot of discussion in Fintech centers on the consumer to corporate part of this but there's also the part about the effect it would have on wholesale banking. Can you just say a word more about that? You've talked about blowing up \"Too Big to Fail,\" just a bit more?</p><p>      OMAROVA:  So remember with subprime mortgages for example, it was also, the rhetoric was all about the right of the consumer to choose, to take a very expensive loan for example but in reality those mortgages were the fuel for the wholesale market speculation and so I worry that allowing digitization (ph) of data and all of the sort of new Fintech innovation without proper controls will actually increase the potential for wholesale market speculation in the secondary market that would make the system more volatile and more unstable and we have to be aware of that danger.</p><p>      WARREN:  Good. So thank you very much. </p><p>      You know, I know there's a lot that improving technology can do to reduce costs and improve service for customers but I'm concerned that this Treasury report consistently ignores real concerns that could arise both for consumers and for the industry and change the -- have an impact on protecting data, on reducing consumer choices on maintaining safety in the financial systems.</p><p>      So thank you very much Mr. Chairman for holding this hearing. I hope we'll continue to dig into this issue. Thank you.</p><p>      CRAPO:  We definitely will and I think there's a lot of bipartisan agreement on a lot of these issues.</p><p>      I need to wrap up the hearing, however Senator Brown has asked for one more round of five minutes...</p><p>      BROWN:  I have a question.</p><p>      CRAPO:  ... so...</p><p>      BROWN:  Yes. Thanks.</p><p>      CRAPO:  ... I'll just -- Senator Brown...</p><p>      BROWN:  Thank you.</p><p>      CRAPO:  ... I will grant that (inaudible)...</p><p>      BROWN:  Thank you Chairman.</p><p>      CRAPO:  ... sorry, I'm going to have to wrap the hearing after.</p><p>      BROWN:  And Mr. Chairman, thank you for the -- we've had just sort of private discussions about the overlap in the common interest we see in some of this on privacy and hopeful we can -- oh I'm hopeful that we can come together on some things.</p><p>      Couple of questions left, I have -- quickly Ms. -- Professor Omarova and Mr. Knight if I could direct the first one to you, should non-financial -- starting with you Professor Omarova, should a non-financial company be allowed access to consumers detailed financial -- financial data such as transactions or account balances or should the traditional separation of banking and commerce extent the data sharing as well?</p><p>      OMAROVA:  I absolutely think that the traditional separation of banking and commerce should extend to everything that relates to data.</p><p>      I don't think that pure disclosure really cures the problem because the problem is structural. The problem is about the market power crossing over different sectors and essentially hurting all of us in the long-term competitiveness of our economy.</p><p>      BROWN:  Thank you.</p><p>      Mr. Knight, any comments on that?</p><p>      KNIGHT:  So I'm somewhat more optimistic of that. I think that there may be circumstances where that sort -- allowing that sort of exchange can actually be beneficial to the consumer.</p><p>      I do think that a meaningful disclosure, meaningful acceptance is critical to this because of what we're talking about, very sensitive information and if the consumer is allowing that information to be shared it should be used only for the purposes that the consumer has granted access to and that consent should be periodically reacquired, it should not be something that you know, click yes on a splash screen when you first sign up and then never hear about it again.</p><p>      So I -- but I do think there may be scenarios where that exchange actually is worth it.</p><p>      BROWN:  Thank you.</p><p>      And last question Mr. Boms.</p><p>      And thank you, Mr. Chairman.</p><p>      What would be the impact of a successful hack of one of your members?</p><p>      KNIGHT:  Senator, it would depend on which of the members we're talking about so if I could I'll separate them from the aggregator members, and the end-Fintech clients.</p><p>      For the aggregator members, there's a lot -- a lot of variety. There are mostly read-only platforms, you can't execute transactions across them. While many do hold credentials as a way to get into the ecosystem, they employ best-in-class security systems, hardware encryption, elements of data security that I'm not qualified to get into. That's not to say that more can't be done but of course you know, they're -- they're not encumbered by...</p><p>      BROWN:  And there have been successful hacks in the past of course... It's</p><p>      KNIGHT:  ... Well, I would argue...</p><p>      BROWN:  ... against them (ph)?</p><p>      KNIGHT:  ... I would argue respectfully that the vast majority of the hacks that we see in the financial ecosystem are at the incumbent financial institutions not at the Fintech players or at least the ones that I represent. That's not to say that one won't happen (inaudible) second (inaudible).</p><p>      For the end user -- and I should also add for the aggregators many have adopted policies where they don't collect PII so they are the pipeline, they connect one entity to the data that they acquire for the use case but don't themselves retain the identifying information that the end user provides to their third-party.</p><p>      But I think underlying the question Senator, is there needs to be standards for data security in this ecosystem and that's why my members at least have come out and said whether it's regulatory prescribed or whether it's private sector driven, we're ready to have that conversation and we've already started to deploy some of those standards across the 50 companies that I work with.</p><p>      BROWN:  Yes. Thanks.</p><p>      CRAPO:  Alright. Thank you, Senator Brown.</p><p>      And I again want to thank the witnesses. I have a lot more questions I want to ask. I don't know if I'll pummel you with all of those but over time we are going to dig much more deeply into this as a committee. This is an incredibly important issue and it's complex, it needs to be understood and we appreciate your helping us to get a deeper understanding today.</p><p>      That concludes the committee questioning.</p><p>      For senators wishing to submit questions for the record questions those questions will be due in one week on Tuesday, September 25. </p><p>      Witnesses, we ask you when you receive questions if you would promptly respond them -- respond to them.

MICHAEL D. CRAPO</nameText></person></p></bodyText></section><section sectionType=\"body\"><bodyText><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CRAPO</emphasis>:  This hearing will come to order.  </p><p>      Today we will hear four very unique perspectives on a segment of Financial Technology or Fintech.  </p><p>      Almost exactly one year ago the Committee held a hearing to explore the various sectors and applications of Fintech. In the short time between that hearing on this one many developments and innovations have occurred both in the private sector and on the regulatory front. Digitization and Data in particular are constantly evolving challenging the way we've traditionally approached and conducted oversight of the Financial Services Sector.   </p><p>      As technology has developed and the ability to readily and cheaply interact with and use data has flourished we have experienced a sort of revolution in the Digital Era. This Digital revolution brings with it the promise of increasing consumer choice, inclusion, and economic prosperity among other things.  </p><p>      Less than a decade ago the concept of Mobile Banking, a simple transaction was relatively new. Now consumers have countless options by which to interact with and to access their financial information and conduct transactions.  </p><p>      As this marketplace rapidly develops so must we constantly evaluate our regulatory and oversight framework much of which was designed prior to the Digital Era. To the extent that there are improvements that can be made to better foster and not stifle innovation we should examine those.  </p><p>      Although these technological developments are incredibly positive the increase digitization and ease of collecting, storing, and using data presents a new set of challenges and requires our diligence -- our vigilance.  </p><p>      Many products and services in the Fintech sector revolve around Big Data Analytics, Data Aggregation, and other technologies that makes use of consumer data. Often times these processes operate in the background and are not always completely transparent to consumers. It's important for consumers to know when their data is being collected and how it's being used.  </p><p>      It is equally important for the companies and the government alike to act responsibly with this data and ensure that it is protected. As we've seen in recent years this can be a challenging task. In order to fully embrace the immense benefits that can result from technological innovation we must ensure that proper safeguards are in place and consumers are fully informed.  </p><p>      Today I hope to hear from our witnesses about the ways in which Fintech is changing the Financial sector and the improvements that can be made to ensure the regulatory landscape welcomes that innovation, what kind of data is being collected and used, and how such data secured and protected, and what the opportunities and challenges are going forward.  </p><p>      Senator Brown?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BROWN</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  </p><p>      In the run-up to the financial crisis, Wall Street banks bragged about innovations they -- that they claim made the financial system less risky and credit more affordable. Some of these innovations were in consumer products like interest-only Subprime mortgages; other innovations were happening behind the scenes like growth and risky collateralized debt obligations and credit default swaps.  </p><p>      According to the banks, technological advances like increasing computer power -- computing power and information sharing through the Internet allowed financial institutions to calculate and mitigate the risks of these complex financial innovations.  </p><p>      In Washington banks told lawmakers that regulation would hold back progress, they say that often many issues, and make credit more expensive for consumers rather than look at financial technology with an eye to the risks. Federal banking supervisors repealed safety and soundness protections and that they use their authority to override consumer protection laws in several states.  </p><p>      Eventually so-called financial innovations led to the biggest economic disaster in almost a century causing millions of Americans their homes, their jobs, much of their savings, criticizing banking -- bankers and regulators who lost sights -- who lost sight of the enormous risks that came with these new innovations.  </p><p>      Former Fed Chair Paul Volcker declared, \"The ATM has been the only useful innovation in banking for the past 20 years.\"  </p><p>      I'm more optimistic about some new technologies benefiting consumers rather than just lining Wall Street's pockets but I think we should look at this Treasurer report with the same level of skepticism.  </p><p>      Rather than learn from past mistakes the Treasury report embraces the shortsightedness of pre-crisis regulators and exalts the benefits of financial innovation. It describes federal and state regulation as cumbersome or as barriers to innovation and recommends cutting important consumer protections like the CFPB's Payday Lending Rule.  </p><p>      If even suggest ripping away what little control we as consumers now have over our own personal financial data just a year after Equifax put a hundred and forty-eight million American identities at risk, 5 million in my state alone.  </p><p>      Just like a dozen years ago, Wall Street banks and big companies are making record profits but working families are struggling just to get by; student loan debt is at record levels; credit card defaults are rising; worker pay isn't keeping up with inflation; comments from the administration notwithstanding but we managed to cut tax for the richest Americans while CEO and shareholders have reaped huge windfalls through over a half trillion dollars in stock buy backs.  </p><p>      Plenty of financial institutions are adopting new technology without running afoul of the law. Rather than focusing on how we can weaken the rules for a handful of companies, a peer group (ph) -- who prefer to be called Fintech rather than Payday Lenders or Data Aggregators rather than Consumer Reporting Bureaus, Treasury should be focused on policies that help working families.  </p><p>      This isn't a partisan issue for me. I raise concerns about relaxing the rules for Fintech firms when Comptroller Curry, appointed by President Obama, suggested a special Fintech charter almost two years ago.  </p><p>      The new leaders at the Federal Reserve, the OCC, the FDIC, and the CFPB, have already made it clear they are ready to give Wall Street whatever it asks for and they never have enough.  </p><p>      In the recommendations in this report calls for more handout for financial firms, Fintech or otherwise.  </p><p>      I'm interested however to hear from our witnesses about how new financial technologies could increase our control over our own information, better protect against cyber-attacks, make it easier for lenders to ensure they're following the law and as traditional banks partner with technology firms, I think it's important for the Committee to consider where gaps in regulations might lead to future systemic risks.  </p><p>      Thank you, Mr. Chairman for holding the hearing.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CRAPO</emphasis>:  Thank you Senator Brown. And I agree with you, this is not a partisan issue we all want to get the benefit of what can be developed with this kind of increasing technological capacity but there is significant concern about privacy and protection of data, of our consumers that is agreed to on both sides of the aisle here I believe.  </p><p>      We welcome our witnesses here with us today.  </p><p>      We have Mr. Steven Boms, the President of Allon Advocacy, on behalf of the Consumer Financial Data Rights Association; Mr. Stuart Rubinstein, President of Fidelity Wealth Technologies; Mr. Brian Knight, Director of the Innovation and Governance Program at Mercatus Center at George Mason University; and Ms. Saule Omarova -- did I -- pronounce that right? Who is the Professor of Law and Director at the Jack Clarke Program on the Law and Regulation of Financial Institutions and Markets at Cornell University.  </p><p>      We again welcome all of you. We appreciate your being here to share your expertise with us. Your written statements will be made a part of the record. We ask you to please be very careful to pay attention to the five-minute clock for your oral comments and as you are engaged in questioning; the Senators have a five-minute clock too and sometimes they run right out of the last second for their last question and when that happens, I ask you to be prompt in your responses to those questions.  </p><p>      With that Mr. Boms, you may begin?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BOMS</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  </p><p>      Chairman Crapo, Ranking Member Brown, and members of the committee thank you for this opportunity to testify today on behalf of the Consumer Financial Data Rights or CFDR group, a consortium of approximately 50 aggregators and Fintech firms united behind consumer's rights to access their financial data.  </p><p>      My testimony this morning also represents the views of the Financial Data and Technology Association or FDATA of North America which is the trade association urging the adoption of an open banking-like regime in the U. S., Canada, and Mexico.  </p><p>      The CFDR group and its members consulted frequently with the Treasury Department as it considered the current state of the Fintech market. Our engagement was principally focused on the crucial issue of consumer-permissioned financial data which was an area of emphasis in the Department's report and which I'd like to focus on today.  </p><p>      A recent White House study concluded that 20 percent of adult Americans are under banked by the traditional Financial Services system and almost 9 million households are entirely unbanked. For these consumers, third-party technology-based tools can provide vital affordable access to a financial system that's left them behind. These tools also help other Americans address the growing complexity of the financial system.   </p><p>      Most consumers have multiple accounts across a variety of providers. The most basic fundamental first step towards financial health, understanding what one has and what one owes can be needlessly difficult. Technology-powered tools can provide intuitive, accessible platforms that enables even the least financially savvy among us to manage their finances and improve economic outcomes.  </p><p>      The lifeblood of these tools is user-permissioned data access, the right of the consumer or the small business to affirmatively grant access, to the application of their choice, to connect to or see their financial data.  </p><p>      Unlike in other jurisdictions globally there is no legal requirement in the United States stipulating that a financial institution must make the consumers or small businesses' financial data it holds available to a third party when the customer provides consent or where there are restrictions on the consumer's access to that data are permissible.  </p><p>      Consumers are dependent on the Financial Services providers with which they do business, with disparate outcomes for Americans who bank with different financial institutions. The lack of a cohesive framework also threatens American competitiveness and financial innovation internationally.  </p><p>      The Treasury Department identified the key outstanding issues with regard to user-permissioned data access. I'll briefly highlight five recommendations for the Committee's consideration here, noting that I provide significantly more reaction in my written testimony.  </p><p>      Number one, the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection should affirm that third parties properly authorized by consumers follow from the definition of consumer for the purpose of obtaining access to financial account and transaction data. Though it may seem self-evident, Section 1033 of Dodd-Frank provides that the Bureau has the authority to promulgate a rule to ensure end users have electronic access to their online data but the Bureau has thus far declined to do so.  </p><p>      Treasury's affirmation that Dodd-Frank provides this right to consumers and small businesses even in the absence of the Bureau rule-making represents a significant victory for innovation and for consumer and small business financial empowerment.  </p><p>      Number two, all regulators should recognize the benefits of consumer access to financial account and transaction data in electronic form.  </p><p>      One of the systemic disadvantages facing the Fintech ecosystem in the United States is the immense relative regulatory fragmentation that exists. There are at least eight federal regulatory agencies with jurisdiction over some portion of financial data access. There are of course also state regulatory authorities.  </p><p>      Treasury's call for all agencies to align behind its interpretation of Dodd-Frank, Section 1033 is an important step towards a level playing field and one that could be hastened by congressional engagement.  </p><p>      Number three, the Bureau should work with the private sector to develop best practices on disclosures and terms and conditions regarding consumers use of products and services.  </p><p>      The United Kingdom's Open Banking architecture include prescriptive consent flows that ensure consumers or small business experience, granting or revoking consent to access their data to any third party is uniform. These open-banking consent standards are an excellent starting point for creating best practices in the U. S. market.  </p><p>      Number four, a solution must address resolution of liability for data access.  </p><p>      The CFDR earlier this year released a set of principles, Secure Open Data Access or SODA which calls for traceability, minimum cyber-liability insurance standards and other standards designed to ensure that the entity responsible for consumer financial loss as a result of a breach, be it a bank or an aggregator or a Fintech firm, is going to be charged with making the end user whole for direct losses resulting from that breach.  </p><p>      While CFDR members are implementing these principles, regulatory agencies and Treasury could augment and assist this work by undertaking efforts to create a more vibrant and affordable cyber-liability insurance market.  </p><p>      Number five, address the standardization of data elements as part of improving consumer's access to their data.  </p><p>      While the CFDR group and FDATA North America wholeheartedly agree with the Department's recommendation, I would respectfully submit an addendum. The standardization of data elements should be made available to the consumer, to permit access to third parties of their choosing so that all data elements available to the end user in their native online banking environments is also available to the third-party if the consumer consents.  </p><p>      This approach would fully enable and users to leverage their own financial data to their economic benefit and will allow for the realization of the competitive free marketplace in which consumers have full transparency and to financial products and services offered by Fintech providers and financial services firms alike.  </p><p>      Thank you again for this opportunity to testify. There are tens of millions of American consumers and small businesses that are already utilizing third-party tools to improve their financial well-being, more can be done to harness the power of innovation safely and security.  </p><p>      We stand ready to work with this committee to implement and identify Treasury's recommendations.  </p><p>      Thank you.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CRAPO</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Boms.  </p><p>      Mr. Rubinstein?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RUBINSTEIN</emphasis>:  Thank you, Chairman Crapo, Ranking Member Brown, and members of the committee.  </p><p>      My name is Stuart Rubinstein. I'm president of Fidelity Wealth Technologies and Head of Data Aggregation at Fidelity Investments.  </p><p>      Fidelity is the leading provider of investment management, retirement planning, brokerage, and other Financial Services to more than 30 million individuals, institutions, and intermediaries, with more than $7 trillion in Assets Under Administration. We are strong supporters of Fintechs and are a major Fintech investor.   </p><p>      I'm appearing today to represent Fidelity with the specific focus on the topic of Financial Data Aggregation. At Fidelity we have a unique perspective, we are an aggregator ourselves and we're also a source of data to aggregators who act in behalf of our customers.  </p><p>      Fidelity is a strong believer in the benefits our customers receive when they can see a consolidated picture of their finances through aggregated data. We have offered aggregation services to our customers for well over a decade and our customers have been able to access their Fidelity data through various third parties since the 1990s. But the cyber-security environment has changed over time and risks have become far more pronounced and must be addressed.  </p><p>      First most financial data aggregation that occurs today requires consumers to disclose their financial institutions username and password to the third party -- third-party aggregator or Fintech. While this process may have worked in the past it is now antiquated as there are new technologies that eliminate any such requirement. Because cyber-security is of paramount importance we believe that customers should not have to disclose their username and password in order to access any third-party service.   </p><p>      Second aggregators using credentials may have access to an entire website or mobile app which means they can access more data than may be necessary to provide their services. For example, a simple app that tracks your spending does not need to know your investment holdings but will have access to that under the current methods.   </p><p>      Because of the investment of cyber-threats Fidelity and others in the industry have worked hard on developing a different approach to data aggregation that helps to protect consumers. At Fidelity we've develop what we believe are five principles for empowering consumers to share their data safely with third parties:      First consumer should be able to access their financial account data where they want it and when they want it and through third parties if they so desire. The question becomes not if they can do it but how;  </p><p>      Two, access must be provided in a safe, secure, and transparent manner;  </p><p>      Three, consumers should provide affirmative consent and directly instruct their financial institution to share data with specific third parties;  </p><p>      Four, the -- fourth third parties should access only the financial data that they need to provide their product or service. This should not be a Trojan horse for the gathering, accumulating, and reselling of consumer; and   </p><p>      Fifth consumer should be able to monitor those account access-rights and direct their financial institution to revoke that if they so desire.  </p><p>      In an effort to back up these words with actions Fidelity announced in November of 2017 a new service based on these principles called \"Fidelity Access.\" Fidelity Access will allow Fidelity customers to provide third-party access to customer data through a secure connection without providing login credentials to any third party.  </p><p>      We've also been working with policymakers and industry groups to advance these principles and are pleased that many have taken thoughtful approaches to this problem.  </p><p>      Finally, I would be remiss if I did not mention the most difficult issues standing in the way of wider adoption of safer data sharing technologies, the issue of responsibility. We believe companies that collect and handle financial data should be responsible for protecting that data and making customers whole if misuse, fraud, or theft occurs.  </p><p>      As we've been discussing Fidelity Access we've seen aggregators try to limit their liability, some to very small dollar-amounts. Fidelity believes firms that obtain and handle consumer aggregated data should be held responsible to protect that data from unauthorized use just as we are. Any other standard creates moral hazard and does not incentivize aggregators to take their data storage response -- data stewardship responsibilities seriously.  </p><p>      Thank you again for the opportunity to testify before you today. I look forward to answering your questions.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CRAPO</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Rubinstein.  </p><p>      Mr. Knight?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KNIGHT</emphasis>:  Thank you, Chairman Crapo, Ranking Member Brown, and members of the committee.  </p><p>      My name is Brian Knight and I'm the Director of the Innovation and Governance Program at the Mercatus Center.  </p><p>      Whether it's a loan to deal with an emergency, moving money to a loved one in need, or capital to build a business, access to high-quality financial services is essential. Technological innovation in financial services or Fintech has the potential to significantly improve this access.  </p><p>      As the Treasury Department notes one area where technology may dramatically change financial services is in the collection and use of data. Technology advances allow financial services firms to obtain more data from consumers and process the data in new ways with the goal of providing more accessible, inclusive, and cost-effective options.  </p><p>      While it is early there are encouraging signs that innovation is in fact helping consumers. These include Innovative products giving consumers more transparency as to their finances and allowing lenders to offer potential borrowers better quality credit through innovative underwriting.  </p><p>      There is also an indication that technology is making credit markets less discriminatory. This is promising but there have also been concerns raised about potential risks to consumers including risks of privacy and discrimination. These concerns should be taken seriously and we should react appropriately but we should be loath to rush into regulation without being certain that new regulation is necessary. As we assess what the government response to technological invasion should be we should keep a few things in mind:      First, we should judge innovation compared to the status quo, not perfection. Innovative financial service products will not be perfect but they may be better than the alternative. Imposing unduly burdensome regulation that hampers innovation and competition may ultimately be more harmful to the very consumers that regulation seeks to protect;  </p><p>      Second, we should acknowledge that existing regulations may address new risks. For example, the requirement that a lender be able to explain why it took an adverse action could mitigate against the concern that algorithmic underwriting will be unduly opaque. There are existing regulatory incentives as well as market incentives for companies to ensure their products are fair and appropriately transparent.  </p><p>      Third we should be open to the possibility that in some cases the current regulatory system is in fact overly burdensome. There may be cases where the cost of regulation now exceeds the potential benefits or where a regulatory structure that made sense in the past has been overtaken by market developments. This does not mean that new regulation may not sometimes be needed but as technology changes what is possible with financial services the optimal level or type of regulation may change.  </p><p>Fintech offers exciting possibilities for better, cheaper, and more inclusive financial services. We should be mindful of the risks posed but we should not overreact, instead we should work to ensure that the legal and regulatory system facilitates innovation and competition while preserving consumer protection so that Americans can obtain the best financial services possible.  </p><p>      I look forward to our discussion. And thank you for your time.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CRAPO</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Knight.  </p><p>      Ms. Omarova?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OMAROVA</emphasis>:  Senators, thank you for inviting me to testify here today.  </p><p>      My written testimony lays out the details of what I have to say so let me focus on a few big picture points.  </p><p>Fintech is by far the hottest topic in today's finance, cryptography, cloud computing, Big Data Analytics are changing financial markets by making transacting faster and easier to automate and scale up.  </p><p>      We have just heard arguments emphasizing the immense societal benefits of these changes as long as Fintech innovations are not stifled by outdated regulations.  </p><p>      Let's put these arguments in context, it is quite symbolic that we're convened here today almost exactly on the 10th anniversary of Lehman Brothers failure that triggered the global financial crisis.  </p><p>      I don't have to tell your senators what the calamity that crisis was, you lived through that crisis and for years before the crisis you and your colleagues probably sat through many hearings just like this one listening to many confident and articulate gentlemen with impeccable industry credentials tell you that you should not let outdated regulations stifle financial innovation.  </p><p>      They told you and the American public that innovative financial products like derivatives and subprime mortgage loans were making the financial system more efficient, resilient, and Democratic by enabling better risk management, expanding consumer choices, and making credit available to low income Americans. And so risky derivatives and predatory subprime loans were allowed to grow unregulated until they crashed the financial system 10 years ago.  </p><p>      Today the same rhetoric of financial innovation and consumer choice that brought us a crisis of 2008 returns to the center stage in the policy debate on Fintech. Of course, this time it's different, it's not about derivatives but about crypto-assets; it's not about predatory subprime lending but about marketplace lending. Once again new technology is promising to make the system more efficient, resilient, and Democratic, to expand consumer choices and to give low-income Americans access to financial services.  </p><p>      The Treasury report adopts this rhetoric and translates it into a strategy of significant deregulation in the U. S. banking sector meant to enable banks to deform large-scale business partnerships and even outright corporate affiliations with technology companies.  </p><p>      For example, the report advocates for a significant roll back of existing regulations in order to make it easier for the banks to give unaffiliated Tech companies, data aggregators, cloud service providers, and various Fintech firms much more direct access to their customers account and transactional data.  </p><p>      Currently banks are reluctant to allow data-mining businesses to get the direct fee of their depositors' accounts data because regulators make banks ultimately responsible for the handling of sensitive customer information. For the same reasons of regulatory compliance and liability, banks are currently cautious about moving all of their data to the cloud operated by a third party.  </p><p>      The Treasury characterizes this as a bottleneck in the flow of financial information and calls for a concerted regulatory effort to push banks to share their customer data and to outsource its management to third parties much more freely.  </p><p>      The claim here is that allowing unaffiliated Tech companies to access, host, and manage bank data will make financial services faster and cheaper for all consumers and give consumers control over their financial affairs.  </p><p>      Of course, banks will benefit from being able to reduce their operational and compliance costs and potentially increasing their revenues by charging aggregators for direct fees of customer data. And consumers will get the convenience of living in a seamless virtual space where all Fintech apps can just magically connect to all of their bank accounts but this is also expose consumers to tremendous risks.  </p><p>      Imagine that your personal bank account data, transaction history, and other sensitive information previously managed by your local bank is now stored in the cloud and shared directly and in real time with multiple data collecting companies. These companies are not regulated under a bank-like regime with dedicated supervisors making sure that the data is safe and secure, that these companies maintain strong operational controls and don't misuse sensitive consumer information.  </p><p>      In this environment it's easy to imagine not just one but many Equifax-style catastrophes occurring far more frequently and with far more devastating consequences. This is in fact a particular kind of a broader problem that our system of bank regulations has jealously guarded against since the 19th century.  </p><p>      The potential for excessive concentration of financial and market power if banks are allowed to engage too intimately with non-bank commercial businesses. This separation of banking and commerce remains a core principle of U. S. banking law to this day. The Treasury report however calls for measures that will directly undermine this long-standing and sensible regime. What it frames is loci-technical (ph) fixes to how regulators apply banking laws is in fact opening the door to de facto Fintech conglomeration. If allowed this new platform thrust will be able to monopolize the flow of both money and information, and effectively take control of our lives, not only as economic actors but also citizens.  </p><p>      The American Republic of George Washington and Teddy Roosevelt was never meant to become dystopic company town of this kind.  </p><p>      As we're deliberating on Fintech as a public policy matter I urge you to stand on guard and not let this become even a remote possibility.  </p><p>      Thank you.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CRAPO</emphasis>:  Thank you Ms. Omarova.  </p><p>      I'll start my questions with you Mr. Knight. While innovations in data have brought many benefits, it's also become known that firms may be in fact I think are using this data to drive social policy and to restrict access to entirely legal, in fact sometimes constitutionally protected conduct and do this for reasons of trying to influence social policy, unrelated to safety and soundness or other concerns that would make these targeted groups unfit to do business with. Do you think this presents a problem?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KNIGHT</emphasis>:  Thank you Senator, I do. And I think it presents a couple of problems.  </p><p>      The first one to key on the data point is to the extent your -- that a financial institution is collecting data that relates to a sensitive or private matter and particular the more grainial -- granular the data collection is, the potentially more harmful a breach would be, right?  </p><p>      The -- information that is relatively innocuous at one level of detail can become, extremely damaging at another level of detail and of course depending on how much micro-targeting if you will, the bank is doing and the fine -- the level of detail that the bank has stored, if that data is breached, that data is now available and people can be harmed more than had the data been recorded at a less -- at a less granular level.  </p><p>      The second and I think bigger issue that we're dealing with here while I think our starting point should be that a business can choose to do or not do business with anyone they want for whatever reason they want in a free market. And then we're going to narrow that for some compelling societal issues like antidiscrimination.  </p><p>      The problem is banks are not a free market. Banks because of public policy, there are barriers to entry, there are barriers to exit, there is significant subsidy and so banks have -- part of their market power is derived from public power and so when they chose to use their market power in an effort not to do what they've been charged to do which is to effectively intermediate credit or provide savings but instead try to insist or de facto regulate the American people in a -- in a social policy-setting, they're not using their market power, they're using public power and the people who are on the receiving end of that don't have the same market protections that they would in a freer market.  </p><p>      You know, if -- let's take an example of YouTube who you know, will periodically say, \"We won't cover certain types of videos for social policy reasons.\" Well you can stand up a YouTube competitor tomorrow, you don't need a government-granted, discretionary charter. There is no -- and if you were to stand up a competitor to YouTube, YouTube doesn't get special access to government Internet; it doesn't get insurance; it doesn't get lens -- loans from the government; there isn't a presumption that if YouTube is about ready to fail, the government will bail it out which are things that banks enjoy versus their non-bank competition and that limits the ability of banks -- that increases the ability of banks to throw market power around, that's not derived from anything other than government power.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CRAPO</emphasis>:  Well thank you. And I share those concerns.  </p><p>      I want to shift a little bit here and to you Ms. Omarova. I appreciate your testimony on some of the positive aspects that Fintech offers consumers but some of the concerns that you raise are also concerns that I share.  </p><p>      There's an article in today's \"Wall Street Journal\" that highlights this intersection and this is the title of it, \"Facebook and Financial Firms Tussle -- Tussled for Years Over Access to User Data.\" This follows on August article in \"The Wall Street Journal\" entitled, \"Facebook to Banks, 'Give Us Your Data. We Will Give You Our Users'.\" The article suggests that data privacy is a sticking point in these conversations.  </p><p>      Can you discuss the data privacy concerns and the need to better understand what kind of data is being collected and used and how such data is secured and protected? And I only have about a minute left in my time so I...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OMAROVA</emphasis>:  I think this article actually highlights precisely what's at stake here. This is what the Treasury report is suggesting. It's not so much about what current data aggregators do with data today, it's about companies like Facebook and it just shows that those Big Tech companies, platform companies that use information as currency in their businesses, once they get their hands on the data, on the sensitive bank customers' data, in any way for any reason they will try to use that data to increase their revenues in a variety of spheres.  </p><p>      And it will be extremely difficult to actually check how they use their data, they use proprietary algorithms to basically hide that from us. And who is going to oversee it? Who regulates Facebook for these kinds of issues? Nobody does.  </p><p>      I'm glad that Bank of America and Wells Fargo refused Facebook access to their bank customers data but I don't kid myself for any -- for a minute that they've done it out of some kind of moral respect for customer privacy. They've done it because of the regulations that apply to them today.  </p><p>      If we remove those regulations then all of our sensitive financial data will be open to companies like Facebook and we will not know how it will be used.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CRAPO</emphasis>:  Well thank you. I share those concerns as well.  </p><p>      Mr. Rubinstein and Mr. Boms, I'm out of time but I'm not out of questions for you, I might have to submit them if we don't get another opportunity.  </p><p>      Senator Brown?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BROWN</emphasis>:  Thanks Mr. Chairman.  </p><p>      Ms. Omarova thank you for mentioning the 10th anniversary. I -- there is a -- that as I've remind -- many of my colleagues here, a bit of collective amnesia on this dais in the Senate and thank you for always reminding me that.  </p><p>      I have three questions I'd like to get through, I'm going to start with you Ms. Omarova and if you'd moved the answer as close to yes or no as you can, I'll start (inaudible) each of the questions and move from my right to my left.  </p><p>      The Treasury Department and much of the financial industry argue that consumers should have the right to share their financial data with any third party of their choosing, do you think this should include the right for consumers to require that a Fintech or a data aggregator erase all information at that consumer's request?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OMAROVA</emphasis>:  Yes, absolutely. And you know, we have to keep in mind though that this rhetoric of consumer choice and consumers' right to share the information also imply the firms' right to share their information and that's what we need to guard against.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BROWN</emphasis>:  Thank you.   </p><p>      Mr. Knight?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KNIGHT</emphasis>:  Yes, subject to reasonable considerations like law enforcement.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BROWN</emphasis>:  OK.  </p><p>      Mr. Rubinstein?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RUBINSTEIN</emphasis>:  Yes, absolute -- yes, absolutely. Consumers should understand why they're sharing their data, share it for a specific purpose. When they no longer want to use that -- you no longer have that purpose, be able to stop sharing it and have it deleted.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BROWN</emphasis>:  Mr. Boms?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BOMS</emphasis>:  Agreed subject to applicable regulations and laws.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BROWN</emphasis>:  OK. Thanks.  </p><p>      It's hard for a consumer Ms. Omarova -- Ms. Omarova it's hard for a consumer to understand all the ways that financial data might be use by a company they share it with, should there be legal limits on how aggregators use a consumer's financial information in addition to consumer identified limits?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OMAROVA</emphasis>:  Yes, absolutely. Basically, data aggregators and other data platform companies like Facebook should not be allowed in the form of, quote/unquote, \"insider trading,\" once they get access to customer data in one context so they could use it in another context.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BROWN</emphasis>:  Mr. Knight, legal limitations?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KNIGHT</emphasis>:  I believe the limitation should revolve around disclosure and the fact that any consent is given -- is knowingly given and the consumer has rights to terminate that consent at any time.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BROWN</emphasis>:  Yes sir, Mr. Knight?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KNIGHT</emphasis>:  Yes. I would agree with that. I think really under disclosure -- under a disclosure explicit consent so the consumer knows what they're getting into, really understands it and can control it. I don't know that we need a specific legal limitation though.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BROWN</emphasis>:  Mr. Boms?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BOMS</emphasis>:  I would echo what the past gentleman said with the additional addendum which is we as an industry not just Fintech but the financial industry can and should do a lot better on conspicuous disclosures.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BROWN</emphasis>:  OK. So you're saying legal limits, you're saying disclosures should be the emphasis.  </p><p>      Last question, companies like Google and Facebook collect enormous amounts of personal information. They also influence what information consumers are exposed to for example Facebook might show Payday Loan advertisements to service members or to minorities but not its other users.  </p><p>      Should Fair Lending Laws be updated to cover not just providing credit products but also their targeted advertisements on Social Media platforms, Ms. Omarova?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OMAROVA</emphasis>:  Yes, absolutely. I agree the capacity makes -- raises a new spectrum of discrimination concerns and we have to guard against that.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BROWN</emphasis>:  Mr. Knight?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KNIGHT</emphasis>:  Senator, that's a great question and I don't know if I can give an answer in the time you'd want. If you'd like to submit a QFR, I'd be happy to answer it.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BROWN</emphasis>:  I will do that. Thank you.  </p><p>      Mr. Rubinstein?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RUBINSTEIN</emphasis>:  Senator, I'm sorry, I'm not an expert in Fair Lending and I probably cannot respond to that...   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BROWN</emphasis>:  OK.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RUBINSTEIN</emphasis>:  ... question.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BROWN</emphasis>:  Good. I'll still send a letter to you and have people at Fidelity answer it.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RUBINSTEIN</emphasis>:  We -- you can send the letter, we can try. We're not lenders so I don't know that we'd -- I have a good answer that one for you.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BROWN</emphasis>:  OK.  </p><p>      Mr. Boms?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BOMS</emphasis>:  And Senator I'd echo, I'd be happy to respond in writing. It's not something that we've discussed with our members.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BROWN</emphasis>:  OK.  </p><p>      Last question, thanks for your promptness all of you.  </p><p>      The biggest four banks control about 45 percent of bank assets according to your testimony. Facebook and Google together capture between 59 and 73 percent of the online advertising revenue in the U. S.  </p><p>      Do you think the Treasury report's recommendation which many of your cited favorably would benefit the large incumbents or would increase competition?  </p><p>      Ms. Omarova?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OMAROVA</emphasis>:  Well the increase in competition is another good rhetorical choice to you know, promote deregulation but in reality, both the financial sector and the Tech sector is -- are the businesses where economies of scale and economies of scope are extremely important so in reality what the Treasury report wants us to have is the maximum scale and maximum scope of these conglomerates.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BROWN</emphasis>:  So it would benefit the larger (inaudible)...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OMAROVA</emphasis>:  It would...  </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OMAROVA</emphasis>:  ... benefit large...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BROWN</emphasis>:  Mr. Knight?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OMAROVA</emphasis>:  ... incumbents.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KNIGHT</emphasis>:  Senator, I believe that it would actually be a mix -- potentially mixed benefit. In some cases, the largest companies would benefit. In some cases, the ability of smaller financial institutions to plug into large data providers may allow them to compete with larger financial services companies.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BROWN</emphasis>:  Mr. Rubinstein?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RUBINSTEIN</emphasis>:  Yes. The Treasury report refers to APIs which is \"Tech Speak\" for more secure data sharing methods. I do believe that that actually increases competition as there are standards, small companies only need to build to one standard to plug into many interfaces so, yes, I do think it helps competition.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BROWN</emphasis>:  It certainly would be working against Trans (ph).  </p><p>      But Mr. Boms?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BOMS</emphasis>:  And Senator, I would just say on behalf of many smaller financial technology firms and not the Facebook's or Google's of the world, there is a very strong view that this would promote competition.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BROWN</emphasis>:  So the smaller guys think it would promote competition?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BOMS</emphasis>:  Yes. That's correct.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BROWN</emphasis>:  Good. Thank you.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CRAPO</emphasis>:  Senator Rounds?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ROUNDS</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  </p><p>      First of all, thank you all for being here today. One of the common threads that I've noted through each of your testimonies was the importance of data breach or data security and Fintech and I'm really curious about the issue of the importance of or the challenges of a National Data Breach Standard.  </p><p>      A number of businesses and trade associations have called for Congress and the federal government to step in and establish one, unified data breach standard so businesses could operate across state lines, they would be forced to comply with a patchwork of different regulations.  </p><p>      In addition, my colleague in the house of Congressman Blaine Luetkemeyer recently released the Consumer Information Application Requirement Act. This legislation which has passed the House Financial Services Committee would require federal regulators to establish a National Unified Data Breach Standard.  </p><p>      On the other hand, 31 State attorneys general have released a letter opposing a prior version of a Data Breach Bill in the House because it would preempt state laws.  </p><p>      I'd like your thoughts first of all on what we're discussing right now, coming out of the House. And second of all is a national standard necessary and if so how do we balance that with state interests?  </p><p>      Who'd like to begin?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OMAROVA</emphasis>:  Let me take this on. I think as a general matter, just because a particular standard is unified, universally applied, easier to understand doesn't necessarily make it a better standard, right? It depends on what the standard is qualitatively.  </p><p>      We have the federal system of regulation in this country because we believe in the checks and balances, sometimes state consumer protection laws have to step in more effectively to protect us consumers from abuse by large companies and sometimes the federal laws do a better job by basically you know, creating an even playing field for everybody else.  </p><p>      So my responses that would be, it is not necessarily a bad idea to have a unified standard but the key to that would be that that standard creates the maximum protection for the customer's financial data from various abuses that would likely ensue if we take state authorities completely out of the game.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ROUNDS</emphasis>:  Thank you.  </p><p>      Other thoughts?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RUBINSTEIN</emphasis>:  I'm happy to respond Senator.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ROUNDS</emphasis>:  Please?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RUBINSTEIN</emphasis>:  Thank you for the question. We do support a federal -- a Breach Notification. We think it's -- while a large firm like ours can stay on top of the various state laws, speed is often very necessary in a Breach Notification. Being able to understand one law and be able to respond quickly to that, I think enhances consumer protection, gets customers notified, gets customers and regulators just notified faster.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ROUNDS</emphasis>:  Other thoughts?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BOMS</emphasis>:  Senator if I may. I would just add. I think certainly you would find broad support within the Fintech ecosystem for a national standard, provided that it was strong enough and provided the right consumer protections.  </p><p>      Just to juxtapose that with the ecosystem that we have today, it's very inconsistent from a regulatory perspective. We have CFDR members who are for example FFIEC-supervised and examined, as third-party vendors to large financial institutions. We have other Fintechs who are state regulated and said who are not subject to the Prudential Bank regulatory oversight. And so one standard that encapsulates best practices I think would be welcomed.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KNIGHT</emphasis>:  I concur, I can't speak to Representative Luetkemeyer's bill specifically but I'll also say that when assessing whether or not federal standard make sense some other things to think about are whether or not the patchwork of regulations is generating inefficiency that ends up costing consumers money; whether or not there is a disparate treatment among competitors so some people get to leverage one standard, some people get to leverage a different standard.  </p><p>      And third whether or not we're seeing citizens being de facto regulated by other states to a significant degree because of course you know, if you're a national player, you're going to comply with California even if someone in you know, Wisconsin maybe wouldn't support that standard.  </p><p>      One of the advantages -- potential advantages of a federal standard is that there is broader political representation in setting it and everyone gets a seat at the table, even if you don't end up winning.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ROUNDS</emphasis>:  Is there a process today where a lot of these states that have individual offices in particular attorney general's offices, consumer offices, to where they have -- do they have an association so speak where they can speak with a unified voice in terms of what should be part of a core of a national standard that you've worked with?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KNIGHT</emphasis>:  Well I have not worked with them on this topic but the National Association of Attorneys General may be a place to go and they do work together both on Advocacy and on Enforcement through multistate enforcement actions.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ROUNDS</emphasis>:  Any of you work with anyone of your Associations?  </p><p>      No. OK.  </p><p>      Thank you.  </p><p>      Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CRAPO</emphasis>:  Thank you Senator Rounds.  </p><p>      Senator Reed?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">REED</emphasis>:  Well thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you for your excellent testimony.   </p><p>      Mr. Rubinstein, thank you, very thoughtful comments, we appreciate it. You pointed out in your written testimony that you know, there are significant benefits but there are also as you say very real cyber-security and privacy risk.  </p><p>      Can you project or let us know what you -- your fears are about sort of the big problems that are out there lurking?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RUBINSTEIN</emphasis>:  Yes, Senator, thank you -- thank you for the question.  </p><p>      You know, number one is this issue of credential sharing, people giving away their IDs and passwords. Today when Fintechs or Aggregators show up at our front door they login typically with robotic activities, robots that impersonate the customer basically, same as you sitting at your keyboard, type in your ID and password.  </p><p>      That only gives access to data and some of that data may be private which you did not intend to share but it also can give access to transactions. And if you think about that, what does that mean? It means that you know, potentially a robot can come in and move your money and move it -- move it somewhere else. That's a risk from having just open access to the website which the current -- which the current methods have.  </p><p>      It's difficult for financial institution to know that that's a robot coming in because it looks just like a customer. It's also difficult for the customer then to come back later and say I didn't authorize that activity when in fact they actually gave their ID and password to it to a -- to a third party. Those are real risks though, we think about each and every day.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">REED</emphasis>:  Thank you very much.  </p><p>      The other aspect of this is that we're on a -- beginning of a huge (ph) wave eventually, the aggregation of data will go way beyond just sharing financial information from an institution with customers over the place like Facebook, it will go to all the information they collect, websites you're looking at, what -- may be in what potential pharmaceuticals your ordering , et cetera so that the financial decisions we've been made -- may not be being made by even individual, human beings will be -- and they might not be made in the financial institution, there may be a machine that sharing all this data. Is that something that you're concerned about?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RUBINSTEIN</emphasis>:  I think there are great concerns with data that flows without the customer's knowledge and...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">REED</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RUBINSTEIN</emphasis>:  ... affirmative consent so I think you know, all that comes in. However, we do firmly believe in the customer's right to share their data. It's their data. If they understand...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">REED</emphasis>:  Right.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RUBINSTEIN</emphasis>:  ... that's being shared, understand how it's being used, frankly they want -- if they want to participate in selling that data, let them participate. You know, hopefully they'll get rewarded for that but they should be able to turn it off at any time too.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">REED</emphasis>:  So that and in one concept there's the notion of you -- and I think you've -- we've said before and I think there has to be an opt in and opt out not just a generic one when you sign up but constantly as the situation changes, that if there is a value in your data then somehow the customer should be able to realize that value -- at least make the decision based upon you know, I'm giving something up but -- or I'm getting something. And then the notion of erasing data is critical, do you agree?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RUBINSTEIN</emphasis>:  Yes. Senator, we'll take Fidelity Access, I mentioned earlier my comments as an example when we use that a customer can actually have a dashboard that they can see which third parties they've granted access to their data so they can monitor that on an ongoing basis and with a single click be able to revoke that consent.  </p><p>      Now that only works in many -- financial institutions are building similar things, that only works on the financial institution's side. Once a consumer shares their data with a third party we do believe that they should be able to get that erased but that's actually between then that third...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">REED</emphasis>:  Right.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RUBINSTEIN</emphasis>:  ... party in the consumer.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">REED</emphasis>:  Oh, that's where we have to step in and provide some type of sensible rules so they can do that, correct?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RUBINSTEIN</emphasis>:  I think so, yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">REED</emphasis>:  Ms. Omarova, you -- in this the regulatory climate in which more and more is going to be left to the market, isn't that an argument for giving people the right to go to court if they feel aggrieved even more so and today? Private right of action if they feel aggrieved?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OMAROVA</emphasis>:  I suppose so. I think in general because of the complexity of the environment with which we are dealing today and because of the complexity of understanding exactly what kind of personal data is available to whom and how it could be used and the difficulty of monitoring all of that use. I think absolutely every lever of control over the use of that data by the Big Tech companies especially, should be utilized.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">REED</emphasis>:  Thank you very much.  </p><p>      Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CRAPO</emphasis>:  Senator Perdue?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PERDUE</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  </p><p>      You know, one of the unintended consequences of the Dodd-Frank law was I think it spawned probably -- and it's arguable that the greatest period of bank consolidation U.S. history. We've lost 1,700 banks in the last decade and virtually no new banks have been started. So I've got a question, in that environment Dr. Omarova, you mentioned earlier, I have a question for Mr. Knight first. I want to come back to you on a second question but Dr. Omarova talked about aggravation, the bigger the banks get the more important disaggregation of data becomes.  </p><p>      I'm concerned that today we have in that environment of consolidation we have six examining agencies charged with Consumer Financial Protection, one of those is CFPB. We had the acting director before this committee a couple months ago telling us there had been at least 240 breaches of data that they are investigating and possible as many as 800, anyone of those could be worse than the Equifax breach.  </p><p>      So the question I have is as we talk about -- Mr. Knight you talked about, accessing this data can help banks actually improve services particularly for people who are underserved today and I agree with that but this Unified National Data Security Standard as we're talking about Breach Notification that I think we all agree on, how would that apply in your mind to these federal examining agencies that have access to this same data?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KNIGHT</emphasis>:  So -- I apologize if I understand your question here, is the concern that there is going to be a breach at the agency level?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PERDUE</emphasis>:  Yes. We've already been told, there are 240 the CFPB, to be known breaches today, 800 they are investigating, any one of which could be worse than the Equifax breach.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KNIGHT</emphasis>:  Yes. I absolutely share that concern and I think that the challenge is, if you allow any entity to access data be it the bank or be it a federal agency, there is that risk and I think that while there are concerns and tools available to punish banks in the case of a breach, or Equifax in the case of a breach -- and we can debate whether or not these tools are adequate. It's harder in many respects to go after an agency due to issues like sovereign immunity and so...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PERDUE</emphasis>:  But should they be held to the same standard of data protection that commercial interests are?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KNIGHT</emphasis>:  ... At least the same standard.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PERDUE</emphasis>:  Thank you.  </p><p>      Dr. Omarova, I have a question about where the United States sits with our regulatory environment relative to other countries. In Kenya for example, 93 percent of Kenyans have access to a bank account through MPESA a mobile phone-based money transfer and Micro-Financing Service  </p><p>      In China, Ali Baba, I was in -- visit with Ali Baba and Tencent a couple months ago in China. They help facilitate $12.8 trillion in mobile payments in China. They've leapfrogged us and our technology here.  </p><p>      No matter we think of our Fintech, a lot of these innovations were developed here but we're slow adopters somehow in the United States.  </p><p>      Are we falling behind places like the U. K., Kenya, and China in terms of the adoption of this -- of this technology in Fintech?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OMAROVA</emphasis>:  Well Kenya is very different, it has a very different Financial Services market than we do here.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PERDUE</emphasis>:  Certainly.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OMAROVA</emphasis>:  They don't...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PERDUE</emphasis>:  We...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OMAROVA</emphasis>:  ... have...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PERDUE</emphasis>:  ... but...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OMAROVA</emphasis>:  ... the actual banking system...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PERDUE</emphasis>:  But the U.K. is very similar?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OMAROVA</emphasis>:  ... I'll -- I'll get to that...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PERDUE</emphasis>:  OK.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OMAROVA</emphasis>:  ... in a second and in Kenya by the way, the success of their mobile banking was built on the central bank and are the major telephone provider...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PERDUE</emphasis>:  Right.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OMAROVA</emphasis>:  ... banding (ph) together so the state was critical to providing this service to everybody else.  </p><p>      China, yes China has Ali Baba, which is competing with our you know, our PayPals and Facebooks and what have you. Again, in China the state apparatus is so strong that China can control whatever those companies do and that's a critical factor.  </p><p>      The U.K., we always hold of the U.K., especially the industry does as this sort of principal -- principles-based, much more market friendly, much smarter kind of regulator-type environment. But remember before the crisis, I worked in the Treasury and we were doing reports about how the Financial Services Authority were so much better than our regulators were in terms of allowing financial innovations to go forward.  </p><p>      And then the crisis hit. Where is the Financial Services Authority now?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PERDUE</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OMAROVA</emphasis>:  I'm not so sure that the Open Bank -- open-banking initiative in the U.K. is actually achieving the benefits that it was promising.  </p><p>      So I think what we should look for is not so much how you know, industry friendly or the regulatory a particular country's environment is, I think we should look at our market structure and the concentrations of power in the Tech industry in the financial sector in our country.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PERDUE</emphasis>:  And that's -- that's my question so the only -- I have to gauge this against other standards, other performances and so are we falling behind the adoption of these technologies, relative to consumer protection, and consumer access to banking services?  </p><p>      And anybody I'd -- I'd welcome anybody's response to that?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OMAROVA</emphasis>:  Oh.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PERDUE</emphasis>:  Dr. Omarova? Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OMAROVA</emphasis>:  You want me?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PERDUE</emphasis>:  Sure.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OMAROVA</emphasis>:  I don't think we are falling behind. I think we're taking a more cautious approach simply because we have probably much more to lose.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PERDUE</emphasis>:  Very good.   </p><p>      Anybody else?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BOMS</emphasis>:  Senator, I would -- I would just add, we shouldn't discount the vibrancy and resilience of the U. S. market which obviously stands way above other markets. That said the lack of consistency and clarity in the regulatory and legal framework in the U. S. with regard to data access presents a potential future competitive risk for the U. S. market.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PERDUE</emphasis>:  Right. Thank you very much.  </p><p>      Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CRAPO</emphasis>:  Senator Warner?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARNER</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  </p><p>      I want to follow-up we're Senator Perdue was at Mr. Boms, with what the Europeans are doing, with what the Brits are doing. You know, how does this affect again our market's ability to stay competitive in what's obviously a global field?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BOMS</emphasis>:  Sure. Senator, it's -- it's very early days. PSD2 and Open Banking in Europe and the U.K. just went live on 13th January this year. There was a conformance period that will last until September of next year so we are in this transition period but we're seeing adoption of Open Banking APIs by consumers in the U.K., for example increased 50 percent month over month so clearly there's interest in adoption of these tools.  </p><p>      We're seeing significant investment into the Fintech market in London. It's not because the cost of living or taxes are low it's because there is a clear regulatory framework and a legal framework for how these -- how these tools can be deployed, prescriptive consent and disclosure flows that consumer are coming to expect and are unaware of.  </p><p>      So I don't think it's an eminent threat but I do think if we don't get our house in order in the relative near-term it could become a threat.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARNER</emphasis>:  Well one of the things I -- and related to this -- while not the direct topic today you know, there's a group of us bipartisan that have been working for now 3 1/2, four years to try to at least standardize data breach legislation.  </p><p>      The fact that we've got 49, 47 different data breach legislative laws such as -- different than data portability but I would hope you think that some level of federal leadership on data breach would be important as well?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BOMS</emphasis>:  Absolutely Senator. So long as the floor that it establishes provide sufficient consumer protection.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARNER</emphasis>:  Right. And that's I think what we've done, frankly we have spent some of -- I was on the talk (ph) on business and before that, it's my old industry that's been some -- I released four data breach legislation but then they all want to carve out for their specific industry and that's not going to end up being the -- I think the way we get it -- get there.  </p><p>      And unfortunately, those efforts have lagged a little bit in the last eight or nine months and I think as we think about this we've got to think holistically and Ms. Omarova that's -- that's why want to go to my question with you is, I'm a big advocate around data portability and I think Senator Brown may have indirectly raised this question already.  </p><p>      In our -- in my efforts on the -- Intelligence Committee where we're looking at the social media firms who have these platforms, who have enormous, enormous power and growing power, if we -- if we deal with data portability in the Fintech space alone...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OMAROVA</emphasis>:  Yes.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARNER</emphasis>:  ... but don't deal with data portability in terms of our individual personal data, if you're not able to move from Facebook to another enterprise and make it easier and allow our CAT videos to move easily as well, we're really not going to be able to have the type of competitive market I think in -- in that field.  </p><p>      I just want you to like to comment on the need to not only get this right in the Fintech -- in the financial arena but more broadly based?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OMAROVA</emphasis>:  You are absolutely correct. Information is the currency in the digital economy and you know, it takes many forms and it flows through many, many markets for many, many goods and services, not just financial markets but markets for other types of data.  </p><p>      And it is a structural problem. I understand the concerns with competitiveness and I am completely in favor of allowing consumers to move freely between different apps and utilize various information in ways that serve their interest.   </p><p>      But the problem here is that you have to understand that -- structurally speaking financial institutions are sitting on the type of information that presents a you know, much heightened danger of misuse and this is where we should be particularly careful with respect to Fintech and how the financial information is moving structurally in these markets and probably deal with the broader issues of data protection outside the financial sector and perhaps Antitrust issues as well because those are serious structural issues that exists everywhere in the Big Tech sector separately.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARNER</emphasis>:  Well my concern is that what you know, -- and this committee is looking in terms of Russia sanctions at what happened in 2016...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OMAROVA</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARNER</emphasis>:  ... but -- where Russia intervene but what I see is the next iteration is that someone will come in and break into non-protected personal financial data...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OMAROVA</emphasis>:  Right.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARNER</emphasis>:  ... as they did with Equifax and Senator Warren and I have a bill and it's -- I think a travesty we're a year later and there's still has been no penalty paid by that -- by that company but they would break-in get personal information, contact any of us as an individual, and then what will pop up will be what was called a \"Deep Fake\" video, and it will be somebody that looks like Senator Brown but it's not actually Senator Brown, Livestream video and the combination to wreak havoc there, not only on the political side but on the market side is really huge so we have to solve this issue not just for financial data portability but across the board.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OMAROVA</emphasis>:  Oh that's...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARNER</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OMAROVA</emphasis>:  ... absolutely correct, that's absolutely correct.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARNER</emphasis>:  Thank you.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CRAPO</emphasis>:  Senator Cortez Masto?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CORTEZ MASTO</emphasis>:  Thank you. And thank you Mr. Chair and Ranking Member, obviously this is an important discussion.  </p><p>      And for all of you for being here today, it's a great conversation.  </p><p>      I echo my colleague Senator Warner. I think we have to look at the simplistic approach. I think -- what I've heard today we all agree we've got to address the data privacy security and consumer protection piece of this but this is emerging technology, it's not going away and we're going to have to figure out at a federal level how we address this but also, I believe incorporating state laws and the states as well. They can -- they have to be a part of this discussion.  </p><p>      So let me -- let me ask you this because we received a letter from the National Association of Federally Insured Credit Unions, the Committee did. One statement the Association makes is that as new companies emerge and compete in this area it is important that they compete on a level playing field of regulation from data security to consumer protection. Would each of you agree with that statement?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BOMS</emphasis>:  Senator, yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RUBINSTEIN</emphasis>:  Yes, absolutely. Whoever holds consumer data should be held to the same standards.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CORTEZ MASTO</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KNIGHT</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CORTEZ MASTO</emphasis>:  Thank you.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OMAROVA</emphasis>:  Well yes. It's a generally a good principle.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CORTEZ MASTO</emphasis>:  And that level playing field of doesn't that we rollback regulation, does it?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BOMS</emphasis>:  Senator, from my perspective no, it doesn't. It means that we make the regulation consistent across the various regulators who have some stake in this.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CORTEZ MASTO</emphasis>:  Thank you.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KNIGHT</emphasis>:  Yes. I agree.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CORTEZ MASTO</emphasis>:  Right. And I think you'd all agree?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KNIGHT</emphasis>:  Senator, I would say that -- when we talk about level playing field we should be thinking about what is the risk generating -- where's the risk that's generated that we're trying to regulate against and so if that risk exists, comparable regulation should exist.  </p><p>      If a new player comes along and offers a comparable service but doesn't generate a certain risk then they shouldn't be regulated at -- in the same way vis-a-vis that risk.  </p><p>      For example, a lender that doesn't fund their loans from federally insured deposits shouldn't be regulated as a depository because they're just not generating the risks that go along with the deposit holding. They should be regulated vis-a-vis consumer protection and lending for example.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CORTEZ MASTO</emphasis>:  OK.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OMAROVA</emphasis>:  Well, sometimes it's very difficult to figure out exactly what types of risks a particular lender or a particular situation really poses, sometimes we do not see how exactly they fund their loans and their services, we've learned that from this last crisis.  </p><p>      And I think that in that sense it's important that if we are looking for leveling the playing field we have to make sure that that common level is not the minimum regulatory level of oversight but the maximum one. And when we're looking at the maximum level of regulatory oversight in the interest of the American public, we should keep in mind the biggest players in those markets, not the smallest ones.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CORTEZ MASTO</emphasis>:  Thank you.  </p><p>      And can I ask you -- each one of you, so when we're talking about banks and credit unions that allow data aggregators access to bank customers' accounts, if there is a violation of those customer's privacy information and that privacy information for those customers who should be legally liable? Should the banks and credit unions be legally liable if there working with those third-party aggregators and there's a breach?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BOMS</emphasis>:  Senator, this is -- you've identified I think perhaps the largest most significant obstacle in this ecosystem which Mr. Rubinstein referenced in his opening statement.  </p><p>      The members that I represent would say that, \"he who breaches the data should be responsible for making the consumer whole.\" The catch to that and the issue with that is, we have decades of regulation and consumer expectations that say that it is the financial institution that either should or must make the consumer whole.  </p><p>      So on some level even though our members have taken it upon themselves are adopting this notion of \"he who breaches most make the consumer responsible,\" at some point we need to holistically take a look at the regulations that we have on the books and modernize them for the 21st century economy.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CORTEZ MASTO</emphasis>:  OK.  </p><p>      Anyone else? Yes?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RUBINSTEIN</emphasis>:  Senator, as Mr. Boms said it's a very difficult topic. You know, we firmly believe that whoever causes harm to the consumer should make the consumer whole. Unfortunately, this is -- this is a chain. Consumer data starts with the financial institution, it moves to a financial data aggregator then it moves to a Fintech, it may continue to move beyond that.  </p><p>      The financial institution only has a direct relationship in that first step of the chain with the financial aggregator. They need to look to that financial aggregator to make the financial institution whole if the financial institution has reimbursed the consumer and then they can deal with their own customer, similar to getting into a car accident, right? You have auto insurance, you turn to your insurance company and then your insurance company goes and subrogates with the other -- with the others down the chain.  </p><p>      It's been very difficult. The industry is not adapting that yet and we can use a notion that direction.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CORTEZ MASTO</emphasis>:  Thank you.  </p><p>      Ms. Omarova or please...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OMAROVA</emphasis>:  So...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CORTEZ MASTO</emphasis>:  ... down the line, whoever likes to go next?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OMAROVA</emphasis>:  ... I think that everybody in that chain should bear responsibility and to be exposed to the liability for data breaches of bank customer data.  </p><p>      And what concerns me about the Treasury report in particular is that it never really addresses that issue directly and he talks about, \"yes, we need to kind of have an appropriate liability regime,\" but it's not clear to me what that regime will be like.  </p><p>      What I know though is as a practical matter in order to incentivize banks to share their information, their bank customer information with various technology companies, you're going to have to relax the actual liability constraints existing today on them because otherwise they simply wouldn't share it so that's what concerns me a lot.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CORTEZ MASTO</emphasis>:  Thank you. And I know I'm out of time. Mr. Chair, I don't know Mr. Knight if you wanted to say a few words? I don't want to take up any...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KNIGHT</emphasis>:  Briefly.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CORTEZ MASTO</emphasis>:  ... more time. Thank you.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KNIGHT</emphasis>:  So in addition to all that's been said, I'd say that the one threshold question we didn't talk about is the Treasury takes the position in the report that's Dodd-Frank's Section 1033, compels the bank to make the information available to the consumers chosen aggregator.   </p><p>      I don't know if that's a position the Bureau will take and if we're compelling the bank then the normative argument for holding the bank liable if some accident happens down the chain with an aggregator they did not choose to partner with but were compelled to partner with weakens, whereas if it's a matter of choice all the way down then the principles discussed make more sense.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CRAPO</emphasis>:  Senator Scott?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCOTT</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  </p><p>      Thank you to the panel for investing the time to be here this morning.  </p><p>      Things get complicated when a company is headquartered in Tennessee, does business in South Carolina and its breached in Arkansas. Those states all have different laws on the books governing when and how companies must notify the public of a data breach.  </p><p>      The reality is that a patchwork quota (ph) of 50 different breach notifications standards creates a race to the bottom in which breached parties will often comply with the lowest possible standard. Consumers are ultimately the ones that pay the price. They are the ones that lose out.  </p><p>      I know that Senator Rounds touched on this question earlier but let me ask you Mr. Boms, is the state-by-state framework for breach notification effective, who stands to benefit from a more uniformed approach?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BOMS</emphasis>:  Senator, we think that there is certainly room for improvement, a federal approach that lifts up what the ceiling is across the board would benefit consumers, it would benefit the industry. We think it would be a win-win for everybody involved.  </p><p>      It's not simply an issue of regulatory complexity at the state level, several of the Fintech firms that have worked with have federal supervision through a third-party vendor management and said there's a piece of Prudential Bank regulatory authority here as well in this work. This is another area where consistency among regulation not deregulation would be immensely helpful.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCOTT</emphasis>:  Thank you, sir.  </p><p>      The Graham -- Gramm-Leach-Biley -- Bliley Act from 1999, we did business very differently than. I think we were all still using paper for most of our transactions. We probably had dial up for our Internet connection and we certainly did not have cell phones that could do anything other than call, and that was a pretty expensive venture as well.  </p><p>      Bottom line is that the world has changed so significantly since GLBA was enforced, being law but it is still the foundation of how we govern data aggregators for financial institutions. I'm encouraged by the fact that removing to APIs from screen scraping but it is happening fairly slowly.  </p><p>      Mr. Boms you mentioned Europe, Mexico, and Japan, in your testimony. How are U. S. policymakers falling behind in crafting laws that foster Fintech innovation and protection consumer -- and protecting consumer data?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BOMS</emphasis>:  Senator, I would -- I would answer in two parts.   </p><p>      I think the first thing I would say is APIs in and of themselves are not a panacea, they will not solve everything. The API in addition to being secure as we've heard also must be robust so the API must make -- must include data fields like fees for example so the consumer who is using a third-party tool that compares fees at one for example financial institution can compare what is fees would be for the same products or services at another financial institution so making sure that the APIs with the direct fees are robust is the first step.  </p><p>      The second is there are no standards in the U. S. market. The Treasury report talks about data standardization which we think is a very important area that other markets have addressed.  </p><p>      In the U.K. open-banking environment, the data elements are standardized. The Mexican central bank and securities regulator are currently working on an API that would standardize the data sets. This would be we think one place to start but there are quite a few that the regulators here could begin with.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCOTT</emphasis>:  Thank you.  </p><p>      Almost 30 percent of Americans living in economically distressed communities are credit invisible meaning they have no credit score. An additional 15 percent are unsupportable to -- due to having an insufficient or old credit history. In South Carolina that combined number is about 23 percent or one out of every four adults.  </p><p>      Senator Cortez Masto and I have worked diligently to find ways to bring that credit-invisible person to a place where their consistent habits of paying their bills, whether it's their electric bill or cell phone or the rent from a place that they're renting, they're paying those on time, they should get some credit for that.  </p><p>      Mr. Knight you testified that innovative underwriting can provide consumers with benefits such as low interest rates, can you speak to the benefits of using rent and utility payments in credit scoring and two other developments in underwriting that will benefit consumers?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KNIGHT</emphasis>:  Thank you, Senator. Yes. I think that expanding access to the types of data that bear on the creditworthiness of a borrower, even if they are -- have not traditionally been captured in traditional underwriting like a FICO score, has the potential to be valuable in allowing lenders to make an accurate assessment of the risk that they would take on by lending to a borrower for -- in some cases that will make someone who is credit invisible visible and therefore the lender has enough data, they feel like they can then make you know, make an offer.  </p><p>      In other cases, it will indicate that people who are in fact good credit risks or better credit risk than they otherwise get credit for because you're looking at data that hasn't otherwise been picked up so I think that there is potential value there.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCOTT</emphasis>:  Thank you.  </p><p>      I have another question on my legislation on the Mobile Act but I'll submit for the record.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CRAPO</emphasis>:  Thank you.  </p><p>      Senator Warren?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  </p><p>      So Fintech holds out a lot of promise for consumers and also raises a number of concerns. I think it's critical that the government moves methodically on a regulatory approach to Fintech so we encourage productive innovation but we don't expose consumers to a lot of unnecessary risks.  </p><p>      So the Treasury Department issued a report on Fintech earlier this year and almost every instance it advocates for deregulation in an effort to stimulate the Fintech industry and I'm concerned about a lot of those recommendations. One set of recommendations is about rolling back the rules that govern how banks can share personal financial information with third-party data aggregators.  </p><p>      So Professor Omarova, I know you addressed this issue in your written testimony and I just would like you if you could very briefly to explain what your concerns are with the Treasury Department's recommendations on this front?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OMAROVA</emphasis>:  So my main concern is that the Treasury's approach will essentially open the flood gates for the banks that are currently regulated to open up this treasure trove of sensitive financial data on their customers that they have for much broader types of uses by various tech companies.  </p><p>      So my concern is about Facebook, it is about Google, it is about Amazon, and we don't know what they do with the data they touch so they could use it, they could get access to that data in one capacity let's say as a cloud service provider and the code writer but then misuse it in order to miss sell something to the customer, right?   </p><p>      And that's what I worry about and the customer consent here could be obtained by the bank at the point when the customer is actually opening a deposit account with a bank and that's what concerns me, this notion of consent and choice could be actually diminished.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  All right. That's -- it's -- it's very important. Thank you.  </p><p>      And given just what just happened with the Equifax breach I think a lot of my constituents and constituents for pretty much everybody here would be uncomfortable with the idea of even more companies getting access to our financial data without our effective consent and without strict rules on how they have to protect that data.  </p><p>      Another set of Treasury recommendation would further weaken the wall between banking and commerce. They would allow our biggest banks and our huge technology platforms to join their corporate empires, you were just talking about this, and giant technology companies like Facebook and Google to build up equity stakes in multiple, smaller banks across the country.  </p><p>      It -- again could you go back to this Professor and describes some of the potential harms in allowing this kind of consolidation across different industries?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OMAROVA</emphasis>:  Right. So the Treasury basically seek -- seeks to weaken the -- how control is defined in the Bank Holding Company Act. The Bank Holding Company Act currently subjects in a company that controls a U. S. bank or is affiliated with a U. S. bank to various regulations and supervision and it's essentially an Antitrust law that seeks to prevent banks from abusing their control of immense power over public money and credit, right?  </p><p>      And what the Treasury says is essentially, we should make it much easier for the banks to acquire equity stakes in tech companies and vice versa. And I worry about the fact that it will not create greater competition, it will actually lead to extreme concentrations of power over money and information across the sectors.  </p><p>      And it will take the \"Too-Big-to-Fail\" problem to an unprecedented level because in the next crisis we may have to save Facebook and Amazon because they would be so intertwined in the financial sector.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  So this is...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OMAROVA</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  ... actually, this is powerfully important and I appreciate your comments on this.  </p><p>      You know, a lot of discussion in Fintech centers on the consumer to corporate part of this but there's also the part about the effect it would have on wholesale banking. Can you just say a word more about that? You've talked about blowing up \"Too Big to Fail,\" just a bit more?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OMAROVA</emphasis>:  So remember with subprime mortgages for example, it was also, the rhetoric was all about the right of the consumer to choose, to take a very expensive loan for example but in reality those mortgages were the fuel for the wholesale market speculation and so I worry that allowing digitization (ph) of data and all of the sort of new Fintech innovation without proper controls will actually increase the potential for wholesale market speculation in the secondary market that would make the system more volatile and more unstable and we have to be aware of that danger.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  Good. So thank you very much.   </p><p>      You know, I know there's a lot that improving technology can do to reduce costs and improve service for customers but I'm concerned that this Treasury report consistently ignores real concerns that could arise both for consumers and for the industry and change the -- have an impact on protecting data, on reducing consumer choices on maintaining safety in the financial systems.  </p><p>      So thank you very much Mr. Chairman for holding this hearing. I hope we'll continue to dig into this issue. Thank you.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CRAPO</emphasis>:  We definitely will and I think there's a lot of bipartisan agreement on a lot of these issues.  </p><p>      I need to wrap up the hearing, however Senator Brown has asked for one more round of five minutes...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BROWN</emphasis>:  I have a question.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CRAPO</emphasis>:  ... so...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BROWN</emphasis>:  Yes. Thanks.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CRAPO</emphasis>:  ... I'll just -- Senator Brown...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BROWN</emphasis>:  Thank you.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CRAPO</emphasis>:  ... I will grant that (inaudible)...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BROWN</emphasis>:  Thank you Chairman.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CRAPO</emphasis>:  ... sorry, I'm going to have to wrap the hearing after.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BROWN</emphasis>:  And Mr. Chairman, thank you for the -- we've had just sort of private discussions about the overlap in the common interest we see in some of this on privacy and hopeful we can -- oh I'm hopeful that we can come together on some things.  </p><p>      Couple of questions left, I have -- quickly Ms. -- Professor Omarova and Mr. Knight if I could direct the first one to you, should non-financial -- starting with you Professor Omarova, should a non-financial company be allowed access to consumers detailed financial -- financial data such as transactions or account balances or should the traditional separation of banking and commerce extent the data sharing as well?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OMAROVA</emphasis>:  I absolutely think that the traditional separation of banking and commerce should extend to everything that relates to data.  </p><p>      I don't think that pure disclosure really cures the problem because the problem is structural. The problem is about the market power crossing over different sectors and essentially hurting all of us in the long-term competitiveness of our economy.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BROWN</emphasis>:  Thank you.  </p><p>      Mr. Knight, any comments on that?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KNIGHT</emphasis>:  So I'm somewhat more optimistic of that. I think that there may be circumstances where that sort -- allowing that sort of exchange can actually be beneficial to the consumer.  </p><p>      I do think that a meaningful disclosure, meaningful acceptance is critical to this because of what we're talking about, very sensitive information and if the consumer is allowing that information to be shared it should be used only for the purposes that the consumer has granted access to and that consent should be periodically reacquired, it should not be something that you know, click yes on a splash screen when you first sign up and then never hear about it again.  </p><p>      So I -- but I do think there may be scenarios where that exchange actually is worth it.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BROWN</emphasis>:  Thank you.  </p><p>      And last question Mr. Boms.  </p><p>      And thank you, Mr. Chairman.  </p><p>      What would be the impact of a successful hack of one of your members?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KNIGHT</emphasis>:  Senator, it would depend on which of the members we're talking about so if I could I'll separate them from the aggregator members, and the end-Fintech clients.  </p><p>      For the aggregator members, there's a lot -- a lot of variety. There are mostly read-only platforms, you can't execute transactions across them. While many do hold credentials as a way to get into the ecosystem, they employ best-in-class security systems, hardware encryption, elements of data security that I'm not qualified to get into. That's not to say that more can't be done but of course you know, they're -- they're not encumbered by...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BROWN</emphasis>:  And there have been successful hacks in the past of course... It's  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KNIGHT</emphasis>:  ... Well, I would argue...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BROWN</emphasis>:  ... against them (ph)?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KNIGHT</emphasis>:  ... I would argue respectfully that the vast majority of the hacks that we see in the financial ecosystem are at the incumbent financial institutions not at the Fintech players or at least the ones that I represent. That's not to say that one won't happen (inaudible) second (inaudible).  </p><p>      For the end user -- and I should also add for the aggregators many have adopted policies where they don't collect PII so they are the pipeline, they connect one entity to the data that they acquire for the use case but don't themselves retain the identifying information that the end user provides to their third-party.  </p><p>      But I think underlying the question Senator, is there needs to be standards for data security in this ecosystem and that's why my members at least have come out and said whether it's regulatory prescribed or whether it's private sector driven, we're ready to have that conversation and we've already started to deploy some of those standards across the 50 companies that I work with.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BROWN</emphasis>:  Yes. Thanks.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CRAPO</emphasis>:  Alright. Thank you, Senator Brown.  </p><p>      And I again want to thank the witnesses. I have a lot more questions I want to ask. I don't know if I'll pummel you with all of those but over time we are going to dig much more deeply into this as a committee. This is an incredibly important issue and it's complex, it needs to be understood and we appreciate your helping us to get a deeper understanding today.  </p><p>      That concludes the committee questioning.  </p><p>      For senators wishing to submit questions for the record questions those questions will be due in one week on Tuesday, September 25.   </p><p>      Witnesses, we ask you when you receive questions if you would promptly respond them -- respond to them. And again, we thank you for your willingness to come and share expertise with us today.  </p><p>      With that this hearing is adjourned.  </p><p>      END   </p></bodyText></section></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">POLTRN2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5T9F-1JC1-F15W-H0N1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">147909</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-02-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><publicationInfo><publicationName>CQ Transcriptions</publicationName><bodyText><p>All materials herein are protected by United States copyright law and may not be reproduced, distributed, transmitted, displayed, published or broadcast without the prior written permission of CQ Transcriptions.

Instead of building something better, they tear things down for their own profit.</p><p>And as usual, it's workers - especially low-wage workers and Black and brown workers, mostly women - getting exploited.</p><p>As we all know, essential workers clean our hospitals, feed our families, drive our public transportation, deliver our packages, and so much else that we take for granted.</p><p>And these essential workers are the ones most likely to get sick when people don't wear masks --we continue to see that, as cases spike again.</p><p>Newsflash - four months into a pandemic, four months after public health officials said we should wear masks, the Secretary of HHS says he agrees. Even the Vice President is wearing a mask, and Leader McConnell is saying we should wear masks.</p><p>Finally, most people in high places, at least, are wearing masks.</p><p>Essential workers are largely women, often people of color, and they've been taken advantage of by corporations for decades - they aren't paid a living wage, they don't have control over their schedules, they don't have good benefits or safety protections on the job, and they're usually sabotaged if they try to organize a union.</p><p>Big Tech has just made it easier for corporations to exploit them.</p><p>Tech companies give other corporations new tools to mine people's data, to target them with ads for predatory lending. They created facial recognition technology and sold it to law enforcement, to better target protestors. Their app-based business models have made it even more efficient to turn thousands of workers into, quote, \"independent contractors,\" with no job security or workplace protections.</p><p>Facebook even created a new tool called \"Facebook Workplace\" to let corporations censor and spy on workers trying to organize unions. They've backed off for now, and of course they claim that's not what it was intended for - but it was right there in their marketing materials, selling other corporate executives on a tool that would allow them to blacklist the word \"unionize.\"</p><p>So given that history, why on earth would we trust Big Tech with our banking system?</p><p>We do need some disruption in the banking system.</p><p>As many working families in this country know, it is expensive to be poor. You have to pay to cash the check from a hard weeks' work. You have to move money around at just the right time and in just the right way. You have to pay a transfer fee pocketed by your bank. You make one misstep, you get smacked with a late fee that could have covered food or diapers. And if you need to borrow a little money because your pay day doesn't line up with the due dates on your bills? Be prepared to pay loan-shark rates.</p><p>For rich people with money in the bank, the bank pays you. For everyone else, you pay the bank.</p><p>Many essential workers also interact with the economy mostly in cash. Since the pandemic, it's only gotten harder and more dangerous, as people try to use digital platforms to pay for as much as possible, to reduce contact and exposure to the virus.</p><p>These are problems we need to tackle - but I'm skeptical financial technology firms will solve them. Given these companies' record, it seems more likely they'll only make the problems worse.</p><p>Yes, these fintech firms claim that low-paid workers and communities of color stand to benefit the most from their \"innovation.\"</p><p>But even with all the fintech hype over the last decade, it's hard to think of any revolutionary products or services that have actually helped the people they say it will.</p><p>Marketplace lending and small-dollar credit underwriting promised affordable and abundant credit, but if you look at the punishing terms that come with these products, they're really just payday lenders with a website or an app.</p><p>We heard all kinds of promises about how cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum would fundamentally change our relationship with the banking system. Workers would be able to efficiently and cheaply transfer money, make online payments, or buy groceries, all without a bank account. But that's not what happened--Bitcoin is primarily used by wealthy investors.</p><p>These companies promised their algorithms would guarantee \"innovative\" products and services to people locked out of the financial system. That's simply not true - the algorithms use biased data, and we end up with more discrimination against the very people they say their products will help.</p><p>And let's not forget that many of these companies have argued that they should have all the benefits of a bank, but not be regulated like one, and do not provide their customers the protections they deserve.</p><p>The people who really benefit are always the same - the CEOs and their wealthy investors.</p><p>For corporations, the U.S. banking system is a public good.</p><p>The dollar carries the full faith and credit of the government. Deposit insurance protects banks from runs. The Fed operates an enormous payment and clearing and settlement system that makes possible trillions of dollars commerce every year.</p><p>We need a different approach. The banking system in the United States should be a public good for everyone.</p><p>That's why I introduced the Banking for All Act. It would allow every American to walk into any bank or post office in the country - or go online - and set up a free, secure bank account, backed by the Federal Reserve and hooked directly into the Federal Reserve's payment systems.</p><p>Banking for All means no more check cashing fees. No more paying to use the money you already earned. No more waiting until Wednesday to use money you were paid on Friday.</p><p>It means all workers would able to fully participate in the economy that they keep being told they're essential to.</p><p>And it means if you're lucky enough to have some savings at the end of the month, you get the same great interest rate the big banks do.</p><p>Technologies like Central Bank Digital Currencies and full digitization of the payments system can help make this a valuable tool for everyone. And it doesn't require us to gut financial protections to make this solution work.</p><p>This is an opportunity to offer real, tangible benefits to workers and their families, right now, and to fight the inequality that has locked too many Black and brown Americans of the banking system.</p><p>Thank you to the witnesses for your testimony, and thank you Mr. Chairman for holding this hearing.</p><p>Read this original document at: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.banking.senate.gov/download/06/30/2020/brown-statement-anddownload=1\">https://www.banking.senate.gov/download/06/30/2020/brown-statement-anddownload=1</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CODUPB-COSSC630002C3</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CO2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6083-WGY1-JCCP-00SG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">468349</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1171\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Federal Information and News Dispatch, Inc.</copyright><publicationName>Congressional Documents and Publications</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"06\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>June 30, 2020</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Report</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Country &amp;

KYRSTEN SINEMA (D-ARIZ.) </p><p>[*]CRAPO: This committee will come to order. </p><p>We would like to welcome today to the committee four witnesses with extensive experience and a range of perspectives on issues related to data ownership, valuation and privacy. </p><p>Including Mr. Jeffrey Ritter, founding chair of the American Bar Association Committee on Cyberspace Law and an external lecturer at the University of Oxford and I guess you're on research sabbatical. Mr. Chad Marlow, senior advocacy and policy counsel at the American Civil Liberties Union. Mr. Will Rinehart, director of technology and innovation policy at the American Action Forum and Ms. Michelle Dennedy, chief executive officer of Drumwave. </p><p>As a result of an increasing digital economy, more personal information is available to companies than ever before. </p><p>Private companies are collecting, processing, analyzing and sharing considerable data on individuals for all kinds of purposes. </p><p>There have been many questions about what personal data is being collected, how it's being collected, with whom it is being shared and how it is being used, including in ways that affect individuals' financial lives. </p><p>Given the vast amount of personal information flowing through the economy, individuals need real control over it. </p><p>This committee has held a series of data privacy hearings exploring possible frameworks for facilitating privacy rights to consumers. Nearly all have included references to data as a new currency or commodity. </p><p>The next question then is, who owns it? There's much debate about the concept of data ownership. The monetary value of personal information and its potential role in data privacy. </p><p>Some have argued that privacy and control of information could benefit from applying explicit property right to personal data, similar to owning a home or protecting intellectual property. Others contend that the very nature of data is different than that of other tangible assets or goods. </p><p>Still it is difficult to ignore the concept of data ownership that appears in existing data privacy frameworks. </p><p>For example, the European Union's general data protection regulation or GDPR grants an individual the right to request and access personally identifiable information that has been collected about them. </p><p>There is an inherent element of ownership in each of these rights and it's necessary to address some of the difficulties of ownership when certain rights are exercised, such as whether information could pertain to more than one individual or if individual ownership applies in the concept of derived data. </p><p>Associated with concepts about data ownership or control is the value of personal data being used in the marketplace and the opportunities for individuals to benefit from its use. </p><p>Senators Kennedy and Warner have both led on these issues, with Senator Kennedy introducing legislation that would grant an explicit property right over personal data and Senator Warner introducing legislation that would give consumers more information about the value of their personal data and how it is being used in the economy. </p><p>As the Banking Committee continues exploring ways to give individuals real control over their data, it's important to learn more about what relationship exists between the true data ownership and the individual's degree of control over their personal information. </p><p>How a property right would work for different types of personal information. How data ownership interacts with existing privacy laws including the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act and the GDPR. </p><p>And different ways companies use personal data, how personal data could be reliably valued and what that means for privacy. </p><p>I appreciate our witnesses today for offering their expertise and sharing their unique range of perspectives on these issues. </p><p>Senator Brown. </p><p>BROWN: Thanks Mr. Chairman for calling this hearing and welcome to all four witnesses, special welcome to Jeffrey Ritter who, shall we say we knew each other forty years ago. I'll leave it at that. At the state house in Columbus. </p><p>This committee has spent some time over the last several months discussing Facebook's poorly, no other way--no other adverb to describe it, poorly thought out plan to create a global currency. </p><p>The bottom line is we know that Facebook simply cannot be trusted with American's personal information. It's terrible at protecting its user's privacy. It's pretty clear the last thing we should do is trust them with America's currency. </p><p>It isn't just Facebook. Every time corporations in Silicon Valley come up with a new business model, the results the same, they get more access to our personal data, spending habits, location, the websites we visit, and it means more money in their pockets, everyone else gets hurt. </p><p>So, I begin this hearing with a simple question. Who has the right to your personal, private information, you or Silicon Valley CEO's like Mark Zuckerberg? </p><p>And I think we all agree that Americans should have more control over their private information, but should we treat that private information just like property. Today's witnesses discuss that idea. </p><p>At first glance it might seem like a simple way to tackle the common problems--the complex problems created by data collection and machine learning. The promise is that if we just treat personal data like property, markets will do the hard work of protecting our privacy for us. We all know that's not how it will work. </p><p>Instead of making companies responsible for protecting their customers privacy, this idea puts the burden on all of us individually and collectively. </p><p>Now imagine if every time you wanted to use Facebook or pay for something with an app or log into a Wi-Fi network you had to read even more legal fine print and then check a box saying \"okay, I waive my personal right to my data to use this service\" or you had to join some kind of data collective to sell your data. </p><p>Working people in this country have enough to worry about trying to get kids out the door in the morning, get to work on time, make rent, save for college, pay the bills. </p><p>The idea that people should also have to manage their data like a landlord manages it's tenants, it's just ludicrous. It should be pretty simple; corporations should not be allowed to invade our privacy. We know that today, they are. </p><p>But think about all the personal data that's already floating around out there. Equifax exposed the personal information of more than 150 million Americans, social security numbers, birthdays, addresses. CapitalOne exposed the personal information of more than 100 million Americans. </p><p>How can you own your own data when it's already littered all over the internet? </p><p>Big tech don't--big tech doesn't want to protect your personal information, they want to profit off it, protecting your privacy doesn't make them any money, it costs them money so they're simply not going to do it. </p><p>They want your data, they want to get it for free, they want to pay as little as possible if they can't get it for free. </p><p>So, it should be no surprise that I'm skeptical. I think most of us up here are quite skeptical when I hear of plans for America's data to be treated again, like property. </p><p>If American's want more control over their private information, we have to find a way to prevent corporations from mining our data and selling it to each other, creating a supermarket for selling away our privacy does the opposite. </p><p>Treating data as something that can be owned and bought and sold doesn't solve any of these problems, especially when undermining our privacy is the business model. </p><p>Mark Zuckerberg and his Silicon Valley buddies want us to skip over the part when we have control over our own privacy and they want to jump to the part where giant tech companies get to use their market power to squeeze our privacy out of us in a way it will all be legal. That's not acceptable. </p><p>I appreciate that Chairman Crapo's been working with me in a bi-partisan way so a lot of interest in this committee in doing it right, to create real privacy protections. Privacy isn't partisan, it's a basic right. </p><p>I look forward to continuing our work together. </p><p>CRAPO: Thank you. </p><p>We will now proceed to the testimony. I've already introduced each of our witnesses and we'll proceed in the order that I introduced you. </p><p>I ask that you please pay attention to the five-minute rule and I ask the same thing of our colleagues here. </p><p>Mr. Ritter, please proceed. </p><p>RITTER: Thank you. Good morning, Chairman Crapo, Ranking Member Brown and members of the committee. </p><p>I join you today to speak in the role as an active contributor. For over 30 years, the law reforms enabling the United States and global electronic commerce, privacy and information security. </p><p>Speaking bluntly, the time is long overdue for this hearing and the work of this senate committee and the Senate and the Congress to develop comprehensive privacy reform. </p><p>Right now, we have basically been relegated to playing catch up with the Europeans and the other nations that are embracing the rules they have written. </p><p>We're trying to weave together what we have into some type of whole cloth that is new, but privacy law reform will surely fail if we do not address the issues that have been focused on by the chair and by Senator Brown in their opening remarks. </p><p>There's a fundamental question, it does need to be answered. Who owns digital information? It is not any question that is an asset of human society in the 21st century but is it something that can be owned. </p><p>In the totality of all digital information, we have in Senator Brown's words, skipped over it. For billions and trillions of dollars of development over the last 30 years, no one's given an answer. For personal information, this question is even more important. </p><p>Yes, it is identifiable, but who truly owns it? Who can control it? </p><p>From a perspective of decades of working in the international scene in trying to advance these rules I would observe that the United States once led the world writing the rules for electronic contracting, electronic signatures and electronic commerce to work. But at this point, we are falling behind. </p><p>So, I would suggest that we need to do something new. We need to re-establish this nation's leadership by confronting this very hard question and incorporate it into our privacy reforms. </p><p>Clear explicit rules are needed. I may disagree with Senator Brown's opening remarks about figuring out it should be owned or not owned as property, by whom, but we need to clarify these rules so that we can, in fact control the uses and misuses of this information. </p><p>It's only by crafting those rules that we can then enhance and enable acquiring, using, transferring, selling, sharing, controlling data. We've got to know whose it is so we can make someone accountable. </p><p>Every commercial system built on the rule of law for real estate, banking, consumer products, industrial products begins with a commitment to define and protect the owner of the property. </p><p>Yet across the digital world we now live in, particularly for privacy and individual data, while the data subject has controls, the fundamental question has not been answered, who owns it. </p><p>This is not a question that's being addressed in isolation here in the United States. As summarized in an article I included in our testimony--written testimony, Germany, Japan, and the OECD are all calling for formal legal rules on ownership, including Chancellor Merkel herself. </p><p>Japan has already published model guidelines for structuring data sharing and licensing agreements based on ownership principals. </p><p>Not yet translated in English, allowing Japanese companies to build commercial momentum in being able to engage in these kinds of transactions. </p><p>So, I submit humbly, that failing to address data ownership and our privacy reforms will further isolate the United States and allow the rules for data, and data as property to be written by others. </p><p>Now the solutions for crafting this legal concept are already part of federal law. They were incorporated in the laws governing electronic transferrable records and, in the U.N., model laws they've recently been approved with substantial U.S. input and influence. </p><p>There, the rights of ownership are exercised by establishing and maintaining control of the file. </p><p>Now under this principal, realistically the first owner of the information will be the business entity with whom the data subject is engaging, the bank, the hospital, the university. </p><p>After all, they are the ones that have the systems that establish the control over the information. But I do believe that recognizing ownership should not do anything to diminish or remove a data subjects' controls. </p><p>We cannot keep the world's systems from engaging with our information, but we can regulate it and recognizing the property rights are more clear. It's going to help the process. </p><p>So, in closing just let me begin by emphasizing the opportunity, not the obstacle. Clarify these rules, reconciling controls with ownership will not only improve a data subject's--individuals control of their information, but will in fact foster greater accountability for the misuse of that information against the individual's interest. </p><p>Thank you, Mr. Chairman. </p><p>CRAPO: Thank you very much. Mr. Marlow. </p><p>MARLOW: Chairman Crapo, Ranking Member Brown and members of the committee, thank you for the privilege of testifying before you today. </p><p>I serve as a senior advocacy and policy counsel at the ACLU where my principal focus is on issues involving privacy and technology. </p><p>In that role, I spend a great deal of time with the ACLU's 53 affiliates throughout the nation learning about and taking positions on state level privacy legislation. </p><p>Over the past year I have encountered numerous state efforts to enact data as property laws. And today I would like to share what I have learned. </p><p>In the 2019 state legislative sessions data's property laws were pursued or introduced in 11 states. To illustrate those states experiences, I'm going to focus on the effort in the state of Oregon. </p><p>In Oregon, where the bill specifically sought to treat personal health information as property, the leading talking point of the bill was that it was pro-privacy. </p><p>Such a law the argument went, would give people the right to authorize the sale of their data and receive a portion of the proceeds in return. It is notable that what the amount might be was never actually discussed. </p><p>The pro-privacy part of the pitch was that persons could also elect to not have their data sold. The presentation proved persuasive. 40 lawmakers out of 100 in the entire legislature signed on to sponsor the bill at the time it was introduced. </p><p>But then something happened. </p><p>Legislators started to learn more about what the data's property model looks like when it's put into practice and they became concerned that the model was not pro-privacy after all. </p><p>The basis of these concerns was three-fold. First, in order to effectuate the data as property model, at the same time a patients personal information was collected and they were notified of their privacy rights, the power of the government would be applied to essentially advertise the option to forego those rights by selling away one's personal information. Lawmakers grow uncomfortable with the sense they were facilitating this anti-privacy choice. </p><p>Second, lawmakers became concerned about adopting a model where persons with less wealth were likely to end up with less privacy. They recognized that American's who were economically secure would find it easy to reject offers to sell their private information, but they also knew that might not be the case for an elderly person who has a hard time affording their prescriptions and rent. </p><p>Or that it might be too tempting a sales pitch for a family that is struggling to put food on their table. </p><p>Lawmakers also started to appreciate how a government endorsed data as property law might serve to further expand the existing digital divide, where person's enduring socioeconomic and regional economic disadvantages, including disproportionately persons of color already have less privacy because they are force to rely on more affordable but less privacy protective technology products and services. </p><p>Third, lawmakers were concerned that enacting a data as property model would require the application of a unique tracking identifier to all personal information which they were especially leery of given the model's ability to expand beyond the healthcare context. </p><p>Privacy and the ability to remain anonymous might both be casualties of the effort to turn data into property. </p><p>In the end, Oregon state legislature, despite 40 percent of its members having originally sponsored the bill, wisely abandoned the data as property model and the bill died. </p><p>Ultimately lawmakers in all 11 states in which the data as property bill was pursued came to the same conclusion and not a single bill passed. </p><p>In the laboratories of democracy, the data as property experiment is failing to gain traction. </p><p>But let me end my testimony on a positive note from out state legislatures. In 2019, two state laws were adopted that made important advances in protecting privacy without treating data as property. </p><p>The California Consumer Privacy Act, which among its many achievements allows consumers to opt out of their personal information being sold and Maine's Act To Protect Privacy Of Online Customer Information, which takes the superior approach of not allowing a person's information to be sold without first securing their opt-in permission. </p><p>These efforts should be studied, replicated, perhaps improved upon and most of all respected by congress by not pre-empting the privacy protections that they have achieved. </p><p>The high value Americans place on their privacy is universal, non-partisan and wisely enshrined in our Bill of Rights. </p><p>The proper response to the pervasive laws of individual privacy is to pass stronger privacy laws, not just to throw up our hands and conclude the only issue left to tackle is who gets the money. </p><p>Congress has the ability to adopt strong privacy laws without relying on models that undermine privacy in the process, and I have every confidence that you will. </p><p>Thank you again for the opportunity to testify today. </p><p>CRAPO: Thank you. Mr. Rinehart. </p><p>RINEHART: Chairman Crapo, Ranking Member Brown and members of the committee, thank you again for the opportunity to testify before you today on the issue of data property rights. </p><p>Like others in privacy, I'm skeptical that a data property right is actually the best policy mechanism for ensuring privacy. </p><p>My written testimony today actually goes into far more detail, but I want to highlight three important points that I feel are necessary to point out. </p><p>First off, privacy--a property right to personal data isn't necessary to in fact secure privacy and in fact it could be an inefficient one economically. </p><p>Second, valuing data is often difficult because raw or personal data is not what is in demand but in fact the insights that are built on top of it. </p><p>And third, regardless of the privacy regime that's adopted, privacy laws will create an unavoidable cost from compliance which will reverberate throughout the economy. </p><p>Data ownership seems to fit naturally with our common experience in relationship with technology, but I think there are fundamental reasons to be skeptical. </p><p>Since my fellow panelists focused on some of the legal side of things, I want to highlight one area that concerns me. </p><p>It's really unclear if the assignment of data property rights will actually align all of the incentives between users and firms. </p><p>In particular, if a broad right to data is established, users would be forced to search for innovative opportunities. While some see this as a plus, I think it would, in reality it would actually be a burden. </p><p>Assigning property rights in data will dramatically change who can say no to any potential innovation. Users would be forced to become their own data entrepreneurs. In this world users would become--rather users would learn what companies already know. </p><p>Which brings me to my second point. Valuing personal data is often very difficult because what is in demand is actually the insights that are built on top of that data. </p><p>In my written testimony I go into far more detail and in fact lay out the four basic methods to price data. </p><p>But the takeaway I think is pretty abundantly clear, there's no perfect way to value data and its highly context dependent. </p><p>I think one story really highlights this tension. So, when Caesar's Entertainment went bankrupt a couple years back, the total rewards customer program got valued at nearly a billion dollars, which made it the most valuable asset in the proceeding. </p><p>Even though it wasn't sold off, the ombudsman privacy report understood that it would actually be a very tough sell because of the difficulties of incorporating it into another customer loyalty program. </p><p>The total rewards example I think underscores a pretty--particularly important characteristic of data. It is often valued within a relationship or a firm relationship but is often difficult to value outside of that firm relationship. </p><p>For my third and final point, I really want to highlight what I think is probably the most important thing to note here, that regardless of the particular policy mechanism that's chosen for privacy, these laws will create unavoidable cost from compliance which will impact investment opportunities in callous industries. </p><p>We've already seen this in Europe, where investment from venture capital has gone down, at least in the short term by some 39 percent. </p><p>In the U.S. California's CCPA was estimated by its own state agencies to cost nearly 1.8 percent of gross state product which is quite massive. </p><p>In the ITIF think tank here in the D.C. area, estimated that a federal privacy law could cost as much as $122 billion per year. </p><p>All this reminds me of one of my favorite authors, Seth Godin, who once remarked \"the art of good decision making is looking forward to and celebrating the tradeoffs, not pretending they don't exist\". </p><p>I thank you for your time and I look forward to questions. </p><p>CRAPO: Thank you. Ms. Dennedy. </p><p>DENNEDY: Chairman Crapo, Ranking Member Brown and members of the committee, thank you for having me here today. </p><p>I'm ah, in the clean-up position. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>So, I won't go deeply into the various analyses. In my written testimony I submitted to you, Chapter 13 of the Privacy Engineers Manifesto, a book that was actually published before GDPR was--was actually put into law but in the thick of the negotiations and many of these issues were pertinent then as I believe they are now. </p><p>As everyone you've heard reflected here is, I think the summation answer is this is hard and we're not afraid of hard things. </p><p>Although Ranking Member Brown might have some cynicism around, I think it was you or Silicon Valley CEO's, I happen to be one, I'm not like Mark in many different ways but I assure you there's a lot of work that's been going on over the years. </p><p>I've spent most of my career, first as a patent litigator and then as a chief privacy officer, I was one of the first five in the world where we decided and sat down in a small room together, that there must be something better, there must be something bigger, there must be a way to functionalize what was then the only real framework, was the OECD Principals for Fair Information Management and the '95 Act coming out of Europe. So, we have very much been led in high tech, in the belly of the beast, by the Europeans for decades. </p><p>So, what we did is really look at what is the functional tool. So just as Julia Apgar told us once upon a time, when there was a huge infant mortality, stop looking at just the mother and sometimes look at the baby. </p><p>The procedural change of turning a nurse's head and looking at a child to see if it was breathing or not, changed the child and the parent mortality rates. </p><p>We believe at Drumwave, if you look at the data, we will have a similar moment. If we indeed say, value our data, I proclaim that you must value the data, you must give an accounting dear tech firms, dear hospitals, dear senate bodies of every single piece of information that is observed. </p><p>I will submit that you cannot today, because the systems are designed to create more systems. The systems that we are sitting on top of and running our economies on, our cultures, and our families, and our educational institutions are based on software and hardware, rather than data. </p><p>So, the shift is how do we account for and look at data. And I go into some length in my--in my written submission about picking a model, whether it is a tangible property right. We have aspects of tangible property that are working, but some are not. </p><p>So, for example, let's look at a privacy right that's not necessarily a data privacy right. When I go into a public bathroom stall, for a brief moment, that stall is mine. I don't own that real estate, I don't even buy a ticket, I just go into the stall and the expectation is that I close the stall and its mine for a moment. The moment I left, it's no longer mine. </p><p>So, think about data moving in and out of cells, in data bases left and right. We may think that we want to understand every single transaction. What you actually want to do is find the errant transaction. </p><p>So, we're actually working on developing something we're calling a dynamic information meaning score, which is a combination of looking at the machine learning on data bases and data systems as they do flow today. </p><p>So, engineers such as my father, with whom I wrote this book, understand back from the days of UNIVAC in the earliest days. When you model data, when a real engineer models data, they think constantly about all users, the auditor, the lawyers, the regulator and the user. </p><p>We have forgotten the user in this current economy. To look at the user you must look at the data. To look at how you build systems, you have to think about who these users are. There are aspects of data if we ask the systems, we will find the answers. </p><p>But I believe the model looks a little bit more like the constructs around intellectual property, where you may have a shared right. </p><p>In fact, the economic value for companies in a social network in context is the grand value. So ironically, if you wanted to get a payback of what your data was worth, it's actually worth less as an individual person, the greater the data set. The greater the data set, the more the social network gets from the analytics off the top of it. </p><p>So, if we do a pure formula of how much each of us is worth, we'll find a diminishing result. If instead we look to things like copyright and trademark and goodwill and brand, then we might find a blooming type of right. </p><p>So, the more I participate online as an individual, I actually am increasing the value of that transaction. </p><p>I will leave the rest of my remarks for question and answer and thank you very much for your time and covering this important topic. </p><p>CRAPO: Well, thank you very much. Each of you raise very interesting aspects of this issue. </p><p>I'd like to start out with you Mr. Ritter and focus for just a minute on GDPR. </p><p>You know, the EU's new privacy directive provides individuals with greater control over their data, including the right to access, erase and restrict the processing of it. </p><p>How does the EU approach--how does the concept of data ownership show up in the GDPR? </p><p>RITTER: Well, thank you Senator. </p><p>Many of the rights that you're describing are the things that we might associate as attributes of ownership to our computers, our cars, other things of physical goods that we own as consumers. </p><p>Who can use it? Who can share it? Who can possibly sell it on our behalf? </p><p>But the reality is the ownership as a legal concept has not been addressed in the GDPR so we have this awkward situation in privacy law where these rights are being assigned to, or being confirmed by legislation to exist for the individuals but they have no mechanism of attaching those rights to the information. </p><p>In all of their modern systems, we have of in commerce, there is a concept of ownership and I think that's been as Senator Brown said, something that was skipped over, both in Europe and here in the United States. </p><p>By establishing ownership as a concept, nothing should degrade or reduce the rights of the data of the individual, as data subject to be able to have awareness of what their information is doing. </p><p>But what I think the Europeans did in GDPR revisions has been to create transparency, create awareness, create accessibility. All of which are consistent with the kind of things that are being proposed in legislation, such as the Data Act of Senator (INAUDIBLE), certainly the Own Your Data Privacy Act by Senator Kennedy. </p><p>So, the Europeans skipped it as well and I think that actually has created an opportunity for the commercial sector to exploit the data without giving the individuals effective enforcement and I think that's what's missing from GDPR. </p><p>If we know who owns it and therefore who breaks the rules of their custody of that data for the individual, then we have stronger enforcement of those. </p><p>CRAPO: All right. Thank you very much. </p><p>And Mr. Marlow and Mr. Rinehart, I think each of you if I recall correctly, talked about the cost of privacy. I guess the cost of ownership, if we create a system like that. </p><p>Could you each just briefly expand on that a little bit? </p><p>MARLOW: Thank you Mr. Chairman. </p><p>Let me say initially that I think that the concepts of cost and the concepts of ownership come in because of the familiarity of that model to Americans, right? </p><p>I own my car, or I own my television, I own my house. </p><p>And so, the idea that because I have control over my car if I own my data, that would give me similar levels of control and so we think about cost as being part of that conversation. </p><p>But what I would remind the committee is we have rights to free speech even though we don't own our speech. </p><p>We have rights to vote, even though we don't own our vote and we have rights to privacy, even though we don't own our privacy and our data. </p><p>And so, I would encourage people, although it is tempting to kind of come back to the what is the value. The idea that because we see control elements in the marketplace and in private property, if GDPR is trying to copy that level of control, it must also copy the marketplace model including assigning costs I think gets us on the wrong track. </p><p>CRAPO: Thank you. Mr. Rinehart? </p><p>RINEHART: Yes, thank you for the question. </p><p>This I think really fundamentally goes at kind of the heart of--of what consumers want. </p><p>I mean I know there are a lot of concerns obviously with what's happening in Silicon Valley and concerns about privacy, but we do know the consumers do benefit pretty massively from a lot of these services and there's a lot of reports and surveys and information to that extent. </p><p>What I would highlight is that if you really do establish a property right where property writing data where you're effectively requiring every single person to say yes to some sort of innovative service, the kind of new innovative services that you would want to compete with a Facebook or a Google might not actually be able to be created. </p><p>I know this is not exactly the--sometimes it is not exactly convincing to individuals that--that these sorts of things could happen, but we have seen this in the past exact--especially with for example with the telecommunication companies. They had a very similar sort of kind of opt-in requirement whenever they were doing you know in the--in the 1990s when they were--when they were trying to reach consumers, and we do know that that has or it did have an effect on some of the telecommunications companies including U.S. west. I would just highlight the fact that when you do require individuals to say yes to innovation it just makes that sort of innovative service and products all that more difficult. </p><p>CRAPO: Thank you. And Ms. Dennedy, I am out of my five minutes, but I'm probably going to ask you in writing to respond to some--you had some very intriguing issues that you raised and I want to pursue those with you. </p><p>DENNEDY: Absolutely. </p><p>CRAPO: Senator Warner? </p><p>WARNER: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you for holding this hearing. This is an issue that I am very interested in and engaged in. I--I agree and disagree with a number of the comments that have been made. Mr. Ritter I do think this America's failure to leadership in this area is going to come back and harm us. I think it's a pattern where we are seeing America start to retreat. Mr. Marlow I think you accurately point out some of the tensions of attritional ownership model and have given me a lot to think about. </p><p>Mr. Reinhardt I think you are a defender of the status quo and frankly I find your arguments very lacking because I--I actually think the status quo was not going to be continued and I find this notion of gosh, it's hard to figure out some of these notion--ideas is--is patently absurd. I mean I made some money in the Telcom business. I remember initially it was really hard to figure out beyond user base what these companies would be worth. Well, the market drove a methodology around value around spectrum, imperfect we came to that. </p><p>I mean (INAUDIBLE), when he lost out on the acquisition of LinkedIn you know basically he said companies are buying these based on the value of the data that is being collected. Ms. Dennedy I agree there is a complexity to this it is not single data points, it is that combination but to make an argument that you can't figure this out, or it's hard to figure out it is going to be an unwarranted cost that just totally spurious (SP) and companies are making acquisitions all of the time in this space based on valuations. </p><p>That is why I think one of the areas I would like to start with I think there could be some broad bipartisan agreement, I got bipartisan legislation on this called the Dashboard Act that would say we ought to at least know what information is being collected on us in a more granular way. We ought to be able to know who that is being offered to on a third party basis. And yes, even Mr. Rinehart if it is a little bit hard, and we won't be a perfect model, but we ought to know what it's worth because the premise of these companies that have said we are offering you a proposition that this is all free, there is nothing free about what Facebook or Google offer. </p><p>It's not morally wrong but there are giant sucking sounds of personal data being collected about us being monetized in a model that you know based on advertising nothing wrong but there is so much opaqueness and clearly the establishment--established companies don't want more transparency because we might have grapple with the questions that Mr. Ritter and Mr. Marlow put out so strongly. And we might actually if we had more valuation questions we might say there might be companies that would say maybe there's a way to do this intermediate between the platform and the user because it we know Kennedy's data is worth $10, Testers is worth $20 and mine is worth $5 maybe you might be willing to get some portion of back, maybe not even having to get to the ownership question so that somebody could provide a level of service in between two help protect you. </p><p>So this is a--it is a hard, hard issue but to say there is not any previous models I think is wrong. I think the notion that we can't sort this out I would urge, and I know Senator Kennedy has some legislation in this area as well. I think it is really, really important that we do the hard work of trying to sort this out particularly whether we are thinking about consumer protection, whether we are thinking about the idea of true transparency, whether we are thinking about the idea of pro-competition. Unlike some of my colleagues who want to go straight to break up I would rather see if we can introduce more competition into this model and we are not going to have more competition if we have the level of opaqueness and where the large platform companies who control all of the data at this point and--and you know aren't anxious to share, aren't anxious to have more transparency continue that way. </p><p>So I would like to start I guess I'm a little more speechifying than questioning here, but Mr. Ritter and Ms. Dennedy talk about the idea around digital markets about the notion without getting into ownership just the notion of more transparency value add, valueless? Either one of you want to go first? </p><p>DENNEDY: Jeffrey knows that I am obsessed with this area. There is a great deal to be gleaned, earned, and profited by through(SP) transparency. I am a huge, huge fanatic and found in one of my prior companies I did with the consent of the Federal Trade Commission I did a graphic novel for our privacy policy for intel because I believed the subject matter was too complex to read through 16 page of legalese. So we did a cartoon to train our customers. </p><p>At Cisco, we did what I called the Lord Ashfield's (SP). We did subway maps that look a lot like the underground in--in London to map out where the data is, where was mine, where was yours, where was third-party? Was it perfect? No. Those maps are proliferating. Actually ironically enough just this week, I heard from some form of the privacy engineers at Facebook that they are adopting them. I don't know if that's going to bubble up to the top, but I am pleased to hear that the beginnings of that innovation are occurring. </p><p>I think transparency allows you to understand where asset--I go back to the old-fashioned accounting rules and say what is an asset? It is something based on an activity that can potentially provide future benefit in the future and if it stops providing future benefit for the consumer or the user it starts to become a liability. That sounds a lot like a market, so the more transparent I believe that we can be and create the systems to look at the metadata that we have already we can start to create those markets. </p><p>Now I am a believer in this, but I am also early in the market. Is this something comprehensively that if you said tomorrow we want abject transparency it would take some time to catch up; I think we can get there. </p><p>CRAPO: We will probably have to have your remarks--your answers Mr. Ritter in writing or following sorry Senator Warner we have got to move on. Senator Kennedy? </p><p>KENNEDY: I--I first want to thank all of you for coming today. I know you are all busy, and I don't want you to construe what I am about to say as a comment on your personhood. It is more a comment on the testimony. </p><p>I am not fluent in BS, and I haven't the slightest idea what you are talking about except that we've got a problem. One of the issues before us is whether data is property or not. I didn't hear you answer that. </p><p>If it's not property it's something, and a lot of people are making money off of it. Mr. Rinehart, you--you said it's hard to value this something. Well let me tell you one way to value it. Last year Facebook's revenue was $56 billion; that's nine zeros. 98.5% of it was revenue from ads that were specifically targeted to people based on data. So whether it's property, a property right, or a cabbage, it is being monetized, and it is people's personal information. Can we agree on that? </p><p>RINEHART: I would want to add a little bit of complexity to that--that-- </p><p>KENNEDY: Of course, you would. </p><p>RINEHART: So I mean what--what they are selling is the--effectively the attention of individuals and that to me is--adds some complexity to this question about the value of data as compared to say the value-- </p><p>KENNEDY: Mr. Rinehart I don't mean to be read--rude but we are senators, okay? Whatever-- whatever--this is what I sense that--that and I have nothing against social media. These are wonderful American companies, but we are dealing with problems that nobody anticipated at least I didn't, and my constituents didn't. </p><p>Forget about whether it's property or not; it is something, and it's mine, or at least it originates with me. When I go on Facebook and share information whatever you want to call it, it started with me, and now it's on Facebook and whoever Facebook chooses to give it to. Why can't we have a rule that says whatever you want to call it my rights follow it and I can license it, share it with you and Facebook--I hate to pick on Facebook but that sharing has to be knowing and it has to be willful. And I have to be able to change my mind, and I have to be able to call Facebook or click on an icon and say by the way I want to see what you've got on me and consistent with Senator Warner's point I would kind of like to know what it's worth. Why can't we do that? </p><p>Now let me tell you why part of we can't--reason we can't do that. Part of that is our fault. We have been holding hearings on this subject I don't know two, three years. We--we will be probably be doing it again. This is not a reflection on this committee, this is on the Senate. All we do--all we do is issue press releases, hold hearings and strut. Okay? This to me, is not complicated. Why can't we just agree on those rules? What is wrong with that? </p><p>RINEHART: So I wouldn't necessarily say that those rules are--are wrong and by any means. I mean, CCPA California's Privacy Act does, in fact, establish a lot of those sorts of rights without having to establish a property right. So that to me I mean we can, and I have--you know I have been supportive of privacy laws in--in the past, and I think that that is something that is--that is very much needed for this country. </p><p>KENNEDY: Yeah, but you keep--you all keep saying that and then you never propose anything. Look I--I--I am about to run out of time here. Let me tell you what is going to happen. Okay? We have got a problem. I don't think anybody anticipated it. If they did they didn't do anything about it. At some point the American people are going to get fed up, and then we are going to have to do something. Otherwise we won't get reelected, which is what motivates people. </p><p>MARLOW: Sir, can I--can I just suggest one-- </p><p>KENNEDY: And--and--and you may not like what we do. </p><p>MARLOW: Fair enough, sir. But if I can just suggest one thing. If the Senate were to pass very strict privacy laws that didn't necessarily adopt a property model, people with the right to say you can and cannot use my data would still be able to sell their permission. They could still say, but for $10 I will give you a guess instead of a no. So it is possible to have people sell their data without adopting the data is property model that carries with it a lot of downsides that strong privacy protections that don't necessarily impinge(ph) the right to sell data would not bring with them. </p><p>KENNEDY: I am way over. I am sorry, Mr. Chairman. </p><p>CRAPO: Thank you. Senator Menendez? </p><p>MENENDEZ: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Marlow, companies such as Lexis-Nexis risk solutions collect hundreds of nonmedical personal attributes in order to help to predict a person's medical cost. The company claims that providers can use this data to improve patient healthcare and health outcomes, but I have concerns that these same data can be used to discriminate against patients, including vulnerable populations such as low-income individuals and the elderly. What if any protections exist for consumers to prevent insurance companies from using this data to discriminate against customers? </p><p>MARLOW: Thank you, Senator. I--first of all I want to recognize that you point out a very particular challenge. The--the healthcare data area is something that will have to be explored and drilled down to independently regardless of where the Senate comes out on this issue because certainly I think concepts of having people be able to study populations and develop healthcare solutions and cure diseases is something that is very, very important. </p><p>I think the challenge is that when data flows into a marketplace, flows into the insurance companies it is very difficult to be able to parse the algorithms to understand to what extent they are-- </p><p>MENENDEZ: So, in essence, you are telling me that there is no patient protection at this point? </p><p>MARLOW: Well, I think that there are. I think that there are certain laws that would kind of writ large propose kind of blatant discrimination, but it's--it is the finer discrimination that is hard to identify that is hard to get at. And so the question of without, unfortunately (INAUDIBLE) algorithmic transparency is a very challenging one, but it is within the question that an answer may or may not be revealed. </p><p>MENENDEZ: Ms. Dennedy, after data companies analyze this data and generate a health risk score for a client such as a health insurance company do consumers have any right to see that analysis or score? </p><p>DENNEDY: I--I think that they should if they don't already. I think this is part and parcel of what we call privacy engineering and the new field of ethics engineering that is emerging, and this is exactly addressing these complex issues that you are talking about. </p><p>When you are actually doing system design the question must be asked how do you interrogate how decisions were made and in the same light when we are talking about ethics engineering for machine learning and machine algorithms as everyone is kind of calling colloquially AI these days most of it is machine learning understanding for patients where the algorithm has been applied may be nonsense to that patient. However to the ethics boards of hospitals today, to the FDA that approves drugs and gadgets that are part of our healthcare system I believe there are structures in place if we provide the transparency behind how these scores are calculated. </p><p>MENENDEZ: Yeah, what happens if some of the data is wrong? </p><p>DENNEDY: Well, that's exactly the problem. </p><p>MENENDEZ: What--what recourse do consumers actually have to correct inaccurate data that is going to affect their health profile and their risk that ultimately is going to affect their insurance coverage and other things? </p><p>DENNEDY: So this is part of the beauty of what is included in the GDPR that we would love to see in a federal bill which is the privacy disclosures, the privacy impact assessments that must be done before a system is put into place to process information or when that system is changed by third parties. That information would be in those disclosures of those privacy impact assessments that are required under the law in Europe and not here. </p><p>MENENDEZ: I see Mr. Ritter is anxious to give a comment. Before I do let me throw out what probably next to my final question. Given the sensitive nature of health data does that data deserve heightened protection and/or regulation? Do you want to start off, Mr. Ritter? </p><p>RITTER: Thank you. First, I would take exception to the notion that health data can be treated apart from the broader question as both the personal information and all information that we gather. We need solutions here, and with regard to how we enforce these rules as a government we must demand transparency, and I watched with interest the hearings of this committee earlier this week on the audit process and looking at brokers and the SEC rules, and that kind of transparency of automated awareness, automated surveillance of compliance is going to be what we as a nation must anticipate. </p><p>We can no longer just write generic rules that tell companies what they should and should not do. The consumer benefits from that level of interaction in enforcing rules by being able to see that from an automated perspective. One of the earlier references was to the provision of an Oregon law about having a unique tracer on a record. That is exactly how it is done today, and I actually think that is where we are moving in the future. </p><p>We have license plates on automobiles. We have serial numbers, we have RFID devices. I put one inside the box of my bicycles when it ships across the ocean, so I know exactly where my box is no matter what the airline says. That kind of traceability is getting smaller and smaller, and I think that is going to be part of how we can enforce the rules is asking the machines to execute the compliance with those capabilities. </p><p>MENENDEZ: Mr. Chairman, this is a big topic, but I think particularly we are being naive if we simply assume that the collection analysis of health data will be used only to lower costs and improve health outcomes. We have to take seriously the threat that this data could be abused and ultimately lead to consumers being taken advantage of and I will look forward to working with the chair (INAUDIBLE). </p><p>CRAPO: Good point. Senator McSally? </p><p>MCSALLY: Thank you Mr. Chair, and for having this hearing. Thanks everybody, for their testimonies. I first need to confess like I am a privacy zealot; personally I leave a lead a very boring life but just on principle I'm the kind of person who you know fills out those forms when you get them in the mail about opting out from your credit card company and I don't put location services on my phone. I do all sorts of other weird things I don't want to let everybody know about it, but it's--and I was have these conversations extremely frustrating to me that we are in the situation that we are in. </p><p>I have arguments with one of my staff members who like loves tailored ads and doesn't mind giving up all of his privacy in order to have tailored ads, and I'm like I will pick what I want to buy. I don't need you get my stuff and sending me ads. It's just like it's such a personal frustrating thing for me and for my constituents who I represent, and I appreciate it is a complex issue and you know what I'm hearing from you all today may be data as a private property maybe isn't the way to do it. </p><p>Okay, fine, but I guess when I am struggling with is part of what is happening, I think culturally is we have got all of these new tools that are out there that people are able to use for free and their revenue model is to collect your data and sell it. I mean, we all know that, and maybe unwillingly, people did it on initially, but now that is kind of our expectation that we can to a free Internet search, we can do for you social media contacts and communication. It's not free because it's taking your information and profiting off of that. </p><p>But if there's another model of like okay, is a market not demanding this I guess where let's have a social media platform where you can pay a certain amount and say I want to be able to engage, but I want to keep all of my stuff private, so you can't sell it? What is the value of that and is there even a market for that? </p><p>Mr. Rinehart on page 7 of your testimony use it during a study; most subjects happily accepted to sell their personal information for just $0.25. So part of this is kind of cultural and what our expectations are. I would also be concerned about the socioeconomic divide so if some of us are willing to pay in order to protect our privacy but others can't then we have a division going on there of just those of the lower-income having their data being taken and sold and that is a problem too. </p><p>So if the solution isn't data as private property, what is it, and does it start with transparency? That is where I am sort of landing. Does it start with let's shine a flashlight on what is actually going on, let people see and be mortified by what information they have that is being collected and analyzed, and then maybe that will drive a different market solution or even different companies? I mean I am not one that wants a government solution that is going to stop innovation. </p><p>You know we want less regulations and more innovation but in this case how do we deal with that conflict, and what is the best place to start? Is it transparency? You guys are all saying it's not data as private property, then what is it? </p><p>RITTER: Yes, transparency is critical. What we are seeing in the way we manage data as property is increased--increased detail, increased capability of monitoring detail, and that also enables us to have more rapid response both in corporate systems, in government systems, in information security allows us to see what is happening. Transparency is good, and the division between you and your staffer with regard to the acceptance of all of this is something that we are just going to live through and-- </p><p>MCSALLY: But then we get to choose, it's all about freedom, right? </p><p>RITTER: It's humankind. </p><p>MCSALLY: Yeah. </p><p>RITTER: Right? But--but for the systems to survive and for the digital age to--to--to bring us down but actually to be a backbone for humankind to move forward we have to demand that transparency in government requirements such as the ones that are being proposed in Senator Kennedy's legislation and some of the other pieces that have been drafted by members of this committee are outstanding first steps in that direction. </p><p>MARLOW: Senator if I may, and I really appreciate being able to discuss this with a privacy zealot like myself. But a couple of things. So--so one, privacy is not about secrecy, it is about choice, right? So it is certainly acceptable within a privacy regime for you, and your staff are to come out in different places. </p><p>MCSALLY: Exactly. </p><p>MARLOW: What we want to make sure is that-- </p><p>MCSALLY: Right now there is no choice for people like me. </p><p>MARLOW: Precisely and we want to make sure not only that you have a choice, right, but that the choices well educated, informed, transparent, and meaningful and precise, right? All of those things I think have to enter the equation. </p><p>Another aspect that you brought up that is important to privacy is that we want to make sure that consumers like yourself and myself cannot be punished by companies were exercising our privacy choices or conversely that those who give up their privacy are rewarded in ways we are not. But I think that the idea of bringing money into that equation goes to your final point which is we do not want to establish a system like data is property where government is used to fund additional weight on the anti-privacy side by saying and we're going to make sure you know there's money on we may not tell you how much but there's money at the other side of the equation. So I thank you very much for your observations. There is absolutely a path to get there. </p><p>MCSALLY: And I know we are out of time, but eventually money is a part of it, whether it's monetizing your data or not. There is no such model for Facebook to exist if we are all opting out, right? Because then they can't--is not their business model. So somehow I mean I know we got to go but somehow we have got to have this conversation about how some of these tools can be accessible for people that really can be impacting their lives forget about the social media aspect but even in medical advances but also having people know what's going on with their information and why it's being used. </p><p>MARLOW: Right, but like your staffer Senator, not everyone is going to opt out. That is kind of the doomsday scenario, but that is not going to happen because some people do like targeted and like to be directed online. </p><p>MCSALLY: All right. Thank you Mr. Chairman. I appreciate. </p><p>DENNEDY: Can I just have one more quick-- </p><p>CRAPO: Real quick. </p><p>DENNEDY: Thank you. Very quickly I think we are focused on transparency at the bottom layer; let's not forget the top. The war that is going on for every CPO right now, the war for attention and budgets I don't see any CPOs sitting on public words. I don't see the Chairman's letter to--to their shareholders talking about what their data scores are. Until we score our data and it comes from the top down it is entirely a battle of one, and it depends on who your privacy officer and how big her hairnet is--I don't know what the appropriate senatorial thing is to say there. </p><p>CRAPO: Understood. Senator Tester? </p><p>TESTER: I want to thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to thank Ranking Member Brown for having this hearing. The more that you talk, the more confused I become. </p><p>I am--okay so I mean I--I deal with property the same way most people deal with property it is something you own, it is something you sell a bushel of wheat, for example, I am a farmer, and I sell it. It goes to General Mills, General Mills might sell it to somebody else, they might make flour out of it, but I don't care, okay? I got my money, and I don't give a damn. </p><p>The problem here with this and why it is such a critically important issue and why this hearing is so important is because the solution is so complex because everybody has got a different perspective. Senator McSally said it she--she loves her privacy and not secrecy but privacy. So we have got a situation where we have got health information that if it gets in the wrong hands can have incredibly or even in the right hands I might add can have incredibly negative impacts on my health insurance premiums, bank information that could cost me to buy a house a lot more or a lot less. Same thing on health premiums. </p><p>And then we have got a situation where I buy a transmission for my combine and who really gives a damn? Really? I mean what are they going to do? I bought it, it's done, all of that information can transfer. I'm not going to buy another transmission because I don't need it. So it's really--it's really hard to figure out where we are in this and what works but--but let me--let me ask you this and I--and I have a great respect for everybody that is on this panel, and I mean that. I appreciate all of your perspectives because I think they are very interesting, but we had a hard time with real ID in Montana. If we put tracers on information Mr. Ritter should my constituency concerned about me voting for a bill that has that in it? </p><p>RITTER: Yes, but not because of the tracers but because of the inadequacy of the bill to not deal with the consequences of the records that those tracers produce, and that is where the difference can be made. Mr. Tester my original clients 40 years ago were farmers, and so in response to your point actually when you bought the new transmission that fact is very interesting to the company from which you purchase the oil because they want to know the useful life's of the transmission. The transmission company once you know when you purchase it based on the number of hours of usage-- </p><p>TESTER: Really good point. </p><p>RITTER: --number of hours of usage that were created off of the tractor. </p><p>TESTER: And so--so the issue becomes should we pass a bill that says basically you cannot--excuse me. If this is my wife-- </p><p>RITTER: We all understand. </p><p>TESTER: It's not. You know what--you know what this is? It's a targeted ad. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>RITTER: It's a scam likely. </p><p>TESTER: So do you know you want to talk about cost and money--do you want to talk about cost and money? I mean if there's one thing that makes my head explode it's the fact that I have got people out there who I don't want to do business with that are trying to market crap to me that I don't want and whether it's through this telephone or whether it's through the computer when I'm sitting there trying to read an article and all of these damn screens keep popping up and I'm not a tech genius that can get all of this stuff off its baloney (PH) and that's a real problem for me it may be a different problem for somebody in a different economic stature, but the problem for me is I am getting all of this information I don't want. </p><p>So how do we fix it is the question? How--how do we really fix it and protect my civil liberties for privacy, not stop business but I will tell you that several of you talk to about cost there's a lot of cost with doing nothing here too, so we need to do something. So how do we fix it because I got the impression from you, Mr. Ritter, that the EU is doing--and other people by the way I don't want to pick on you, you are a good guy--the EU is doing some stuff, and Japan is doing some stuff, but it is really not complete or is it? </p><p>RITTER: One of the things that distinguishes both European policy development and Japan is extensive research and consensus development before they introduced definitive rules. That is something we struggle with here in the United States to--to stay in-- </p><p>TESTER: What did you just say? </p><p>RITTER: They think about it, and they write their rules with design. </p><p>TESTER: Okay. </p><p>RITTER: All right? You wouldn't buy a combine-- </p><p>TESTER: That is exactly what we do here in the United States Senate. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>RITTER: The survey came out just about eight weeks to go on the impact of GDPR on the European citizen, and it indicated that they have had over 145,000 complaints just in the first year but and I take a look at my notes here 45% of the people that were surveyed in Europe liked the reduction in nonresponsive marketing. Right? They were getting better tailoring and (INAUDIBLE) like that. </p><p>TESTER: And how--and excuse me, and I am going to make it very, very short. How did--how did they make that stop that reduction? How did they--how did they make that reduction in marketing happen? </p><p>RITTER: Many of the rules that the GDPR embraced also I think Senator  Masto's bill embraces just put an accountability on companies for having to disclose the (INAUDIBLE). </p><p>TESTER: And what happens if--if they don't follow the rules? Is there penalties? </p><p>RITTER: The problem of enforcement is one we also have to address. </p><p>TESTER: I will get back to my original point. If this was easy, it would already be done. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you Ranking Member Brown, for your courtesy. </p><p>CRAPO: Thank you. By the way, we have a do not call list bill that we are working on. </p><p>TESTER: Yeah, well, we passed it, didn't we? </p><p>CRAPO: We have a better, more enhanced one. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>Go ahead, senator. </p><p>TOOMEY: Thanks, Mr. Chairman. I think this has been a great hearing and a great discussion. I appreciate you doing it. I want to really thank all of our witnesses for--for contributing to thoughtful ideas to a very challenging and interesting conversation. </p><p>Some--some of the points that I think that are extremely important, I think Senator Tester was touching on the fact that probably most people have different views about different data sets about themselves. I mean, I want much more privacy about my health care records for instance, then I do about whether I just bought a tractor. I am sympathetic to the argument that transparency is generally probably a good thing, and I am sympathetic to the idea of consumers having greater ability to exercise some choices about what data is released and what is not. </p><p>But one of the things we haven't talked a whole lot about this morning is the fact that in the model that has organically evolved consumers get compensated. There is actually a lot of compensation. We talk about how much revenue Facebook took in, it is a staggering number. It is hard for me to quantify but I can tell you I perceive significant value every single day when I go and turn on Pandora and I can get to listen to any music I want for free as long as I want and very regularly I will go to any number of competing map software and get fantastic directions to any destination I want to go to anywhere and I pay nothing for it. I can read newspapers and magazines. </p><p>You know the list is endless, right, of all of the things and in fact in many of these spaces, not all, many of them there is real competition and to the extent that there is real competition you have to assume that the data that is being--that is the you know the revenue stream for these companies that have these apps they are competing for that and so they are presumably competing to offer me evermore in return for me providing them my data to the point where it should converge on something approximating the value of it, right? </p><p>So I like that value. I love the innovation. I have no idea what new things are going to be available next year but I bet there's a bunch of others that I am going to enjoy using and so I wonder if anybody and my don't we start with Mr. Rinehart would--would want to comment on the fact that without property rights which I haven't thought enough about to have an opinion on consumers are already being compensated every single day for the data that they share and what are your thoughts on the level of compensation? </p><p>RINEHART: Yes, I mean, this is something I tried to highlight in my--my testimony is the conflict between the data that supports the services and how consumers then value the service is because those are slightly different things. We do know that consumers do value these services pretty extensively. I did some quick calculations before the hearing, and social media by most accounts probably benefits people to about $13,000 per year. They use it pretty extensively, and this is a pretty--you know I can--I can follow up later but we also know from a whole bunch of other surveys that you know if you were to try to give up, for example, Google search you would cost people something like $18,000 per year to you know to be willing to pay to get or to be you know compensated to be to not use Google. Similarly like $8000 or around $8000 for maps as you had mentioned your map--mapping services. So yes, consumers do benefit in kind of these implicit values or in an implicit way which doesn't show up in a lot of data and that is also what makes the evaluation of data is itself, and as I mentioned throughout my testimony just makes it a little bit more difficult. </p><p>DENNEDY: Can I add one thing? I--my ears are hurting that we are saying it can't be a property right. I think that data is probably some sort of an intellectual property right. It may not be a tangible right, but I think exactly as you are talking about data to me is currency. So if you think about one current a--a penny, a U.S. penny, that alone isn't very much and I can tell you I have got a penny and you've got a penny the story that that penny tells when you put it together with the rest of my data story where am I spending it, how my spending--who am I? If I hand him a dollar it means less than if I have a dollar based on our past history. </p><p>So when we are talking about valuing data sets, let's be careful to understand that what you are really talking about is the lifetime. Sometimes there is a one-time transaction with data, and it looks and feels like a property right or a bailment, and other times, it really is what is that relationship worth, and the banking community, in particular, understands that better than anyone. </p><p>RINEHART: Can I just add one small comment? I mean I--I would mention at least within intellectual property the traditional reason why you establish property rights for intellectual property is because there is an underproduction of those sorts of services and what we are talking about here especially with privacy is very much the opposite of that. </p><p>What we are trying to establish or at least I think what we are trying to talk about is the limitations of disclosure. So the--I just find the intellectual property the typical way of talking about it in the typical way of thinking about it through property rights as a way to incentivize creation is, in fact, the opposite of what we are talking about with privacy which is incentivizing some sort of disclosure which is just I think a complicated--it's--it's just--it's a more subtle way to think about the difference between the two. </p><p>TOOMEY: Thank you very much. </p><p>CRAPO: Thank you. Senator Brown? </p><p>BROWN: Thank you, Senator--Mr. Chairman thanks for your flexibility. The finance committee was doing a really important hearing on opioids, and as Mr. Ritter knows, and some of you do it say terrible problem in Ohio as one of the worst problems in the country. </p><p>We know the system we have right now doesn't protect Americans' privacy phones, laptops, TVs, credit cards turned into tools to harvest personal information for a few or maybe more than a few to profit. Mr. Ritter, Mr. Marlow when we are talking about a property rights model for data isn't that just a way to legitimize and expand on the way Facebook and other big tech companies spy on every aspect of our lives? </p><p>RITTER: In the 21st-century, senator, surveillance will be part of our life. This is something that we as a society must decide how to regulate. I don't think that they are spying on our lives in a way that is at first instance inapposite(ph) to our purpose and interacting with them. I walk into a bank to open a bank account so that I can save my money and pay my bills. I roll onto a gurney into a hospital ER for them to save my life and that involves collecting a whole bunch of data and x-rays and MRIs and vital information. This is part of how we provide services in the 21st century. </p><p>Each of us to use your metaphor is a data generator, even our devices and I think that what we have to recognize is we can't stop the surveillance that the digital age demands for operational efficiency but we can impose appropriate against the misuse of that information beyond the original purpose for which it is collected, and we can better enforce those by making clear who stands responsible. </p><p>BROWN: Thank you. And Mr. Marlow, answer that if you would, in however direction you want to take but include in it explaining how a property rights model would--would or could or should provide meaningful privacy protections. </p><p>MARLOW: So--so I would say this. The property rights model would provide privacy protections and the fact that any model that says you own this data, you have the right to sell it the corollary would be, and you have the right not to sell it. The problem with the data as property model is you can accomplish all of those things with privacy legislation like California has, like Maine has without having to create a data as property model that will further incentivize people to give up their property. </p><p>And I would say that just to put a fine point on something surveillance is not necessarily going to be a part of our lives going forward. Attempts to surveillance will be. The extent to which surveillance succeeds or fails, the extent to which we have privacy or not is in your hands, and so I would be more than happy to come back another time for this committee to talk about the way that our laboratories of democracy, our state legislatures are approaching this issue and making significant progress. So I would not be defeatist here. The only way that privacy disappears and surveillance wins the day is if we take an attitude that it is inevitable. </p><p>BROWN: Then let me--let me pursue that again with both of you on the left Mr. Ritter and Mr. Marlow. We have been discussing whether or not we should create property rights in data. I know that you are both are skeptical that it is even possible, and Senator Kennedy compared data to a cabbage. If I sell you a cabbage or a house or a car or any other property I have to hand it over to the property owner. I sell you data I still can't keep a copy of it. How does the difference between data and Senator Kennedy's cabbage make it hard to exercise property rights the same way you could exercise--exercise privacy rights the same way you could exercise property rights? Start with Mr. Ritter. </p><p>RITTER: Actually, I think cabbage and my medical record are very similar senator. As detailed in my written testimony the scientific consensus surprises us in contrast to what Ms. Dennedy said I don't believe information is intangible. It is a tangible object; it is just small, and as our technology evolves we can, in fact, manage the rules and the use and the economic implications of that use through technical means and through rules being applied. We just have to design the rules correctly. </p><p>So actually do think there's a great potential here to improve the protection of the individual from misuse and increase the enforceability of violations of those rules by making more clear if you will who is on first and has the ownership responsibility to make sure the consumer's interests are protected. </p><p>BROWN: Mr. Marlow comments thank you. Mr. Ritter? </p><p>RITTER: Data makes terrible coleslaw unlike cabbage so I would start there but--but I--I would say again the problem is that it feels like we are trying to put a square peg into a round hole. The data is property model although it has some facets that promote property also undermines property like the need to if you had data or a cabbage that could be replicated indefinitely and passed around the need to track it everywhere it went so people could be paid every time they consumed a new cabbage or piece of data, and that would require the tracking of any information. I could post something online that gets linked to my computer; therefore, it provides personal information, and now my speech is being tracked all over the Internet. </p><p>And so again, I think that if you want to focus on privacy you should focus on privacy protections that don't have such obvious downsides that come along with them and that is the data is property model. </p><p>BROWN: Okay, let me and then thank you Mr. Chairman, for allowing me one more question. I this again is for Mr. Ritter. I know you well enough many years ago to know you care about the wealth code(SP) gap in this country and it is getting worse. We can't continue to have an economy, although the Senate does nothing to fix this that divides Americans into the haves and have-nots. With that in mind with a system of data ownership create a world in which the rich could afford to keep their data private but those who Senator Crapo and I have talked about the challenge for low-income people and the temptation to sell all of those things would this mean the rich could afford to keep their data private but too expensive or difficult for everyone else? </p><p>RITTER: People that are underprivileged or financially disadvantaged sell their blood to be able to put food on the table for their children, and I don't think we can escape the likelihood that they would also sell their data if there was an economic return that would be useful. The bigger problem, of course, is to reduce the inequality, and we do that by being more visible of how that money is being made. </p><p>Where all of the comments that have been made about the cost of compliance there is very few advocates that assert the objection to the cost that don't knowingly talk about the revenue and when we realize how much money is being made by these corporations from the personal information without returning that back as part of the ongoing transactional relationship with the individual we are making a mistake in improving the inequality. </p><p>BROWN: Can Mr. Marlow answer that too and then I yield. I am sorry. </p><p>MARLOW: I would just quickly say that blood is a replenishable resource. When you sell your privacy it is gone, and I think that if I were to say to any member of this committee for $50 would you sell me your most intimate private personal information? You would say no, but if you could not put food on your kids table, right? If they were getting bread and water for the third night in a row and I said can I have--I will give you $50 for your most personal information I would venture a guess that you would all say yes. I am not certain that that is what we want privacy to look like in this country. </p><p>CRAPO: Thank you. Senator Tillis? </p><p>TILLIS: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you all. I think you have given--given us all a lot of good information to work on. You know I am somewhere between Senator McSally in  being a privacy zealot and Senator Toomey, who has rightfully pointed out all of the benefits of using this data responsibly. </p><p>I think that Congress and I am curious, and I have got a couple of questions for you that may go down the line, but one Mr. Marlow, I hear you talk about the laboratories of democracy. I believe in it; I was a speaker of the house. I loved the kind of stuff that I was doing in North Carolina, but I am concerned if--if we do not come up with a federal solution to this problem that deals with data breach, data privacy, and data ownership that we are creating a patchwork of laws that is going to make it more difficult for American-based innovators to really produce the next generation of value-added. Is there anyone here who thinks it's a bad idea for us to pursue federal preemption and take on those three buckets? </p><p>MARLOW: I do and the reason-- </p><p>TILLIS: Well, I asked you first. </p><p>MARLOW: So--so the reason I say that to be simply practical is this. The idea that the United States Congress would pass strong privacy laws that would set a reliable privacy floor for the entire country is exceptionally appealing. The idea that Congress would come in some states have passed even higher privacy protections for their citizens like North Carolina might and then say we are going bring that privacy ceiling down to the federal level I find less appealing because I like you Senator believe in our federal model, believe that the states have the ability to you know you may have North Carolina passing a privacy protection that turns out as we let it  exist in the world for 10 years serves to be a guiding light for Congress, but if we squelch it through preemption from the very beginning we will never learn the lesson from your state, and so that is why I am very hesitant to have Congress creating a ceiling on privacy rather than a floor. </p><p>TILLIS: Others down the line? </p><p>RITTER: Thank you. For nearly 30 years, I interacted on behalf of this country at the United Nations to write the rules that have enabled global electronic commerce to now thrive. There is one essential truth of global communication systems. Uniformity rules. Whoever writes the rules first usually wins that game and our failure to be more proactive in addressing the valuation of personal information and all data has handicapped our competitiveness. Having 50 different states is going to be adverse to our interest and in fact does not allow us to thrive. </p><p>TILLIS: I want to move on to some other--I have to say that I am-- in full disclosure at Price Waterhouse I was a partner in global sourcing, strategic sourcing and data analytics, and data privacy and worked on it quite a bit. I actually think first we have to get Congress better educated on the issue so that we are real--we really know what we are talking about, but I tend to believe we could be the jurisdiction that sets an international standard that we may miss a few nuggets in some of the states who are doing good things but at the end of the day if we don't get this right then the states that are laggards are going to expose their constituents, and our innovation opportunity may be lost for the United States. We have to understand that they are going to be aggregating data across the globe and if we set a standard we may be better off as a result of doing it. </p><p>Look, I--because I have been in technology all of my life, and I am still trying to teach all of these young folks that work for me how to use it when I want to be private I go into incognito mode, when I don't want somebody to know where I am a turn off location services, or I use VPN. When I see a platform that I don't want to share my data I don't. When I see a platform that if I do share my data I may be able to drive down the price point of something I am purchasing by 50%. </p><p>There is a website out there now where I can go put something that I want to buy, it aggregates all of the online retailers that over a period of time is when you see a price point at this point let me know and I will buy it. When you talk about narrowing the wealth gap I think there is an extreme--a great opportunity for the people who have the least amount of money to benefit from these tools if we get them right to drive down the cost and drive down the cost to the consumer. We now have someone that may be growing up in the trailer park that I grew up in in Tennessee that can get on the phone and drive a price point down. That used to be only available to large corporations that did strategic sourcing and had access to the tools, but we have really got to educate people on the various layers of data that we are talking about here. </p><p>Thom Tillis and all of my personal information, I believe is mine. I may allow someone to take it and use it. I want there to be a very clear authorization there, and I want to know whoever has it will then ultimately have a responsibility for any kind of data breach or misuse of that information. Those rules of the road need to be defined, but then we have to talk about the obstructions of data where my identity is less important than my demographic and then the aggregation of data that you actually use to gain insights and then target. </p><p>I mean all of that--all of those layers of information have different implications in terms of whether or not I own it or whether or not my behaviors are just making it more--making it easier to find people like me that says hey, you may be able to get what you are looking for for half the cost based on your--on your behaviors. We have got to better educate Congress on what layer we have to protect and what consequences there are for platforms who fail to be good stewards of the data but then recognize that these data models are also what are driving innovation that ultimately benefit consumers and I think ultimately benefit patients in healthcare. </p><p>That is the sort of stuff we have to work on, and in Congress Mr. Chairman I know right now we have got at least three committees that think that they have all control over this issue. One of the things that we have to do fairly quickly is figure out how we come together and this has to be very task-focused and have each of these committees come together and figure out how to approach this on a more holistic basis or otherwise we are going to keep talking about it and not act on it. </p><p>And Ms. Dennedy, you--I think it is remarkable that you wrote a book with your dad on data privacy manifesto. I am going to get one--I am going to get a copy of that book. What I would also like to get is the graphic novel that you were talking about, some of the other things if they are publicly available. </p><p>DENNEDY: I think Intel has taken it down, but I will get you a copy, senator. </p><p>TILLIS: I think that that would be very helpful because that is the sort of stuff that we need to get out to the individual so that they understand you use the one as the underground the map to show so that you can very quickly say that when I opt in or if I opt out you know an informed choice in that. </p><p>DENNEDY: Those are public. You can find them on trust.cisco.com. </p><p>TILLIS: I will go through that, but I think all of your testimony--all of you made very valid points. What we have got to do is synthesize it, and I think come up with a data breach, data privacy, data ownership policy that could potentially set a standard. We can be instructed by GDPR, we can be instructed by California, we can be instructed by a dozen or so other states that are considering it, but I think at the end of the day this is something that Congress is going to have to take on. Thank you all. </p><p>Senator, if I can just say one point you actually I think perhaps inadvertently made a very strong case additionally why we need privacy laws. You mentioned that one of the ways that you protect your privacy is by using incognito mode. Incognito mode despite its--its name is not private. It basically means it's private for your computer and other people in your household-- </p><p>TILLIS: Right. </p><p>MARLOW: --but if you search on Google, Google can still see where you are going. So that is part of the point. We need to make sure that not only that the Congress is educated, but consumers are educated and--actually have meaningful rights in the area. </p><p>TILLIS: Absolutely. And all of the--I mean there is a lot of other--there needs to be a suite of tools available to the consumer that can basically counter everything else that is going on after you hit enter. I get that. I think that is part of the discussion that we have to have, but I just for one think that I have been in Congress now for four and a half years. We have been talking about this for four and a half years. We actually need to take action, and we need to do it only multijurisdictional basis, and we will continue to value your input. </p><p>Mr. Chair, the only reason I went over is I was the last person, so you were the only one I inconvenienced, and I'm sorry about that. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>CRAPO: That is the only reason I let you keep going too. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>Thank you very much. That concludes the questioning. You know every senator who left told me this has been a really great hearing. The members of the panel are deeply appreciated. </p><p>We didn't even get to get as deep as any of us wanted to on a lot of what you wanted to say and what we wanted to discuss with you, but that will come, and we do have consensus that we need to move and move broadly and quickly but effectively and your testimony today and what you will continue to give us in terms of counsel and advice in response to questions will help us get that done. </p><p>So again thank you all very much. You do--you will probably get some more questions from senators, and to those senators who wish to submit questions for the record those are due by--to the committee by Thursday, October 31 and then we ask that you respond to them as quickly as you can when you do receive them. </p><p>With that again, thank you very much for being here, and this committee is adjourned. </p></bodyText></section></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">POLTRN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XBY-B6K1-JDPT-T0PY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">147909</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><publicationInfo><publicationName>CQ Transcriptions</publicationName><bodyText><p>All materials herein are protected by United States copyright law and may not be reproduced, distributed, transmitted, displayed, published or broadcast without the prior written permission of CQ Transcriptions.

KYRSTEN SINEMA (D-ARIZ.) </p><p>[*]CRAPO: Come to order. Last Congress, this committee held two hearings examining the Digital Currency Ecosystem.  In those hearings, we heard about some of the developments that have occurred within the Digital Currency Marketplace since the creation of Bitcoin in 2008. The potential benefits of digital currencies and the concerns about the value, stability, fraud, and illicit uses, market manipulation, and privacy. Since then Facebook announced its intentions to launch a Blockchain-based payment system and Digital Currency, Libra, that will be governed by an association comprised of up to 100 financial and nonfinancial members including Facebook's digital wallet service, Calibra. </p><p>Facebook's Libra project is generated renewed interest in digital currencies and blockchain generally, including how they interact with U.S. and international regulatory frameworks, the potential benefits and challenges they pose and concerns around issues like anti-money laundering and counterterrorism efforts. Including data privacy, consumer protections, commerce, and monetary policy. A few weeks ago, the head of Calibra, David Marcus, joined the committee to provide an update on Facebook's proposed digital currency. </p><p>During that hearing, Mr. Marcus emphasized some important points and commitments. Including that there are a number of regulators globally that are currently engaged on the Facebook project including the Federal Reserve, FSOC, FINCEN, Financial Conduct Authority, and the G-7 and more. Calibra and the Libra Association will have the highest standards when it comes to data privacy and no financial data or account data that is actually collected in Calibra will be shared with Facebook. And that the Libra Association will be headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland but will still register with FinCEN and have oversight from U.S. regulators. </p><p>Though, while Libra may have begun this conversation, the blockchain and cryptocurrency system is diverse. It seems to me that these technologies and other digital innovations are inevitable. They could be beneficial, and I believe the U.S. should lead in their development. That cannot happen without clear rules of the road. As the U.S. develops a more comprehensive regulatory approach, care must be taken in determining what gaps may be present in the existing framework. In mid-July, Treasury Secretary Mnuchin said, \"to be clear, the U.S. welcomes responsible innovation, including new technologies that may improve the efficiency of the financial system and expand access to financial services\". That being said, with respect to Facebook's Libra and other developments in cryptocurrencies, our overriding goal is to maintain the integrity of our financial system and protect it from abuse. </p><p>He also noted that Treasury has serious concerns regarding the growing misuse of digital currency by money launderers, terrorist financiers and other bad players. As digital currencies efforts move forward, I am particularly interested in better understanding how these technologies may impact individuals abilities to exercise control over their data, including the right to receive information about, and access their data, correct inaccuracies and delete their data. During this hearing, I look forward to hearing more about how the market for digital currencies has grown and evolved over the last decade. Different types of digital currencies in the marketplace including their differences with Facebook proposed digital currency. How other countries are approaching the regulations of digital currencies and Blockchain technology and what we might learn from their successes and failures. </p><p>Potential gaps in existing regulatory frameworks, whether distributive ledger technology can help to facilitate meaningful privacy for individual's data. And approaches Congress should consider in developing a comprehensive regulatory regime for digital currencies. Including ensuring individuals have real control over their data. With the appropriate balance of regulations, digital currencies and their innovations, and their innovative underlying technologies could provide meaningful benefits. And, I look forward to learning more about the ecosystem during this hearing. Senator Brown. </p><p>BROWN: Thank you Chairman Crapo, and welcome to our three witnesses. Thank you all for joining us, some of you, more than once, thank you. This committee hearing earlier this month, many of us in both parties, that you can hear from the chair, have voiced concern, serious concerns about Facebook's plans to run its own currency out of a Swiss bank account. By and large, we mostly heard deflections and dodging exactly what we mean when we say Facebook doesn't understand accountability. Facebook has proven over and over through scandal after scandal that it cannot be trusted. </p><p>But they just don't care. They move fast, they break things, you know, minor things like our political discourse and journalism's and journalism's relationships and privacy. Now they want to break our currency and payment systems hiding behind the phrase innovation. They want to innovate Americans right out of their hard-earned paychecks. Look around at what happens when big corporations say they want to innovate. </p><p>Before they blew up the economy in 2008 bankers were pitching an innovative new product called sub--subprime mortgages. Just like Facebook which claims its new currency will help the unbanked and the under-banked, a bit of an afterthought I think, as they were selling it, these mortgages were supposed to help people who never had access to credit, achieve the American dream of ownership. In reality, these mortgages ripped off millions of families who ended up losing their homes, they wrecked the economy, made the staggering inequality in this country even worse. The only innovative thing about the financial crisis was how the banks managed to stick everyone else with the bill, not exactly the kind of innovation most of us were hoping for. </p><p>So I'm all for innovation especially if that innovation delivers on its promises of improving people's lives. But big tech companies, Wall Street banks, are hiding behind innovation as an excuse--as an excuse to take over important public services we all benefit from and should all have a say in. There are some things, our currency, our payment system, the protections of our savings accounts, that everyone in the country has a stake in.  We shouldn't be handing those kinds of public resources over to wealthy special interests so they can squeeze more profits out of ordinary Americans. </p><p>Think how hard it is to get quality service from Comcast, to know how your privacy was invaded by Facebook, or to know how much of your personal data was--was--was leaked by Equifax and we just learned in the last 24 hours, Capital One, and who's next?  We don't know. So we should be a little suspicious when someone tells us that only big corporations can be trusted to provide critical public services. I recently moved into a new office, it was John Glenn's office when he served, ob--obviously served Ohio in the Senate, he and Annie moved there because he and Annie are long-term friends, we have known each other for 30 years. John Glenn spoke at my Eagle Scout dinner in Mansfield, Ohio 50 years ago. But I moved into that office because primarily he was an innovator, he was the first American to orbit the earth, as we know, as part of the Mercury project, which will be followed by the Gemini and Apollo missions that would eventually put Americans on the moon. </p><p>Many of us who are old enough, joined in the celebration of the 50th anniversary at least some of us on this podium are old enough joined in the 50th anniversary. We all did that, but joined- remember the day 50 years ago, that's just this month. None of the astronauts did it alone, it took the hard work of thousands of innovating scientists and engineers, most of them unknown. People like famed mathematician, Catherine Johnson or immigrants like engineer Miguel Hernandez. These Americans didn't do it for-profit, they did it to serve their country and their successes were shared by every American who saw U.S.A. emblazoned on the side of Apollo 11. </p><p>It's a reminder that some infrastructure works better as a public good and we shouldn't let big banks or big tech get their hands on those public goods. The Federal Reserve and other watchdogs need to continue to be leaders in banking innovation. If we don't move quickly to improve important infrastructure, not just roads and bridges and highways and water-sewer systems but our payment system too, if we don't move quickly to improve it, we will end up with big corporations that have broken our trust, again and again, and again. And that does not make any sense. I look forward to hearing from our witnesses today about which of these technologies might help regular Americans. </p><p>CRAPO: Thank you, Senator Brown. Today's witnesses are Mr. Jeremy Allaire, co-founder, chairman and CEO of Circle, on behalf of the Blockchain Association. Dr. Rebecca M. Nelson, specialist in International Trade and Finance at the Congressional Research Service. And Professor Mehrsa Baradaran professor of law at the University of California Irvine Law--School of Law. I'd like to assure each of you, your written testimony has been entered into the record. We encourage you to try to follow our five-minute rule by watching that clock in front you so that we have time to ask you our questions and with that let's begin in the order in which I introduced you, Mr. Allaire. </p><p>ALLAIRE: Thank you, Chairman Crapo, Ranking Member Brown, and members of the committee. It is my pleasure to appear before you today to testify about the promise of Digital Assets and Blockchain Technology. I spent the past 25 years building Internet Technology Platforms and companies in the United States. Serving millions of businesses and hundreds of millions of consumers. </p><p>In 2013, I co-founded Circle, a Global Digital Currency company seeking to make it much easier for people and businesses everywhere to create an exchange value with the same ease that we create and share information and content on the Internet. I'd like to start by touching on some of the challenges I see in the Global Financial System today. Billions of people lack basic access to financial services. Those who do have access face a system with exorbitant fees and excessive risk. </p><p>Our banking system is riddled with money laundering and crime, with annual illicit proceeds laundered through our financial system exceeding $2 trillion and with 99 percent of laundering going undetected. </p><p>Our financial system is also overwhelmed with privacy violations and data breaches. cybercriminals and hostile nations continue to take aim at our financial infrastructure the cost of this are spiraling and the situation seems to be getting worse. Access to capital for small businesses is extremely limited with capital markets reserved for only the largest companies and those with access to venture capital and very few people have a chance to even invest in these startup companies. There absolutely can be a better future ahead, one built on digital assets and blockchains. </p><p>These technologies represent one of the most significant innovations in modern history. I believe that blockchains and digital actions will be viewed as more impactful than the rise of joint-stock   Corporations, double-entry bookkeeping, and modern banking. In the coming decade, we will see a series of profound changes. Digital currencies will proliferate and become usable by billions of people on mobile devices. Payments will become a commodity free service on the Internet. A new set of Internet-based global capital markets built on digital assets will emerge, opening up capital markets for businesses and investors everywhere. </p><p>Scaling from today's thousands of companies to a world where every person and business can directly access global capital markets with the same ease that they access e-commerce marketplaces.  Commerce relationships will increasingly be running on Blockchains providing a commerce environment with greater security, efficiency, transparency, and enforceability. And new decentralized forms of digital identity will become available allowing for much safer use of digital services and which will radically improve our privacy, while more effectively thwarting financial crime. </p><p>As a new fundamental layer of Internet infrastructure, Blockchains will transform the Global Economic System. With respect to the policy and regulatory issues facing the world with the growth in digital assets, there are significant issues at stake. In the United States regulatory uncertainty in the application of laws that do not contemplate digital assets has led to the loss of significant opportunity. The Securities and Exchange Commission, for example, is forced to apply federal laws written in the 20th century to technologies created in the 21st. This has had a material impact on the competitiveness of U.S. companies with Asian-based companies beginning to dominate the market and is backward, rather than forward-looking. </p><p>Congress should consider new laws that protect consumers while not causing companies to fixate on nearly century-old definitions. The result of the uncertain and restrictive regulatory environment has led many digital asset projects and companies to domicile outside of the United States and to block U.S. persons and businesses from accessing products and technologies. In Circles case, we have received a license under Bermuda's Forward-looking Digital Asset Business Act, which provides a comprehensive regulatory framework for companies in the industry and we are in the process of moving our international facing products and services out of United States. </p><p>It is vital that we allow innovators room to grow in the United States. Congress should adopt national policies that define and established digital assets as a new asset class, including appropriate rules and exemptions. Without a national policy framework for digital assets, I'm concerned that the United States will not be the world leader in this critical new technology. That it will continue to fall behind and that it will not fully reap the benefits of economic transformation that digital assets will bring. Thank you for your increased inchen--interest and attention to this significant area of opportunity, and I look forward to hearing your questions and opinions. </p><p>CRAPO: Thank you, Mr. Allaire. Dr. Nelson. </p><p>NELSON: Good morning Chairman Crapo, Ranking Member Brown and members of the committee. Thank you for inviting the Congressional Research Service to testify on examining Regulatory Frameworks for Digital Currencies and Blockchain. My testimony focuses on international landscapes of digital currencies. I will summarize my statement with these brief remarks. In 2009, Bitcoin was launched as the first cryptocurrency. Cryptocurrencies are digital representations of value, they are generally administered using distributed ledger technology and have no status as legal tender. </p><p>Cryptocurrencies strive to make payments cheaper and faster. Today more than 2200 cryptocurrencies are in circulation. In terms of market science, however, cryptocurrencies are a small niche market. Some central banks and large multinational corporations are looking to take cryptocurrencies into the mainstream. If these initiatives move forward there could be numerous policy implications for the United States. Including for its financial stability, the role of the U.S. dollar, consumer protections, money-laundering, privacy considerations, and sanctions policy. </p><p>I will make three points today. First, the patchwork of cryptocurrency regulations around the world. Second, the growing interest of central banks and cryptocurrencies, and third, Facebook as a potential game-changer for the market. So the first point is the patchwork of cryptocurrency regulations emerging around the world. Cryptocurrencies are international in nature but they are regulated by governments at the national level. There are more than 190 countries in the world and they are taking different approaches to the regulatory issues presented by cryptocurrencies. For example, cryptocurrency regulations have permitted on, focused on permitted uses, consumer protections, securities regulations, license and reporting requirements, any money laundering regulations and tax treatment. </p><p>Widely speaking, government approaches fall across the spectrum. At one end of the spectrum, some countries such as Malta, Singapore, and Switzerland are striving to become cryptocurrency hubs. They view cryptocurrencies as a potential source of growth and they actively attract cryptocurrencies with favorable regulation and tax regimes. </p><p>At the other end of the spectrum, countries including China, India, Egypt, and Taiwan have banned or strongly restricted cryptocurrencies. Their concerns focus on government control of the financial sector, financial stability, and consumer protections. In the middle of the spectrum, some governments are allowing the development of cryptocurrencies while developing regulations to minimize risk.  Most major developed economies including the United States and the United Kingdom have adopted this approach. Differences in financial regulations across countries can lead to instability, especially if cryptocurrencies are adopted on a larger scale. </p><p>The second point is that some central banks are exploring the creation of their own cryptocurrencies. Some countries plan to--plan to develop cryptocurrencies as a second legal tender. For example, the Marshall Islands is planning to create a cryptographic called, the Sovereign, to raise government revenue. Venezuela launched the Petro, a cryptocurrency backed by oil, as a way to raise money, and evade sanctions. Iran and Russia are also reportedly considering cryptocurrencies, at least in part, to avoid sanctions. Other governments are considering making digital versions of their existing fiat currencies directly available to individuals. For example, Sweden's e-krona project strives to reduce its reliance on private payment processing companies. </p><p>The policy implications of such initiatives to the United States would largely depend on which countries are involved, and how the new currencies are structured. The central banks of most major developed countries are refraining from such initiatives at this time. The third point is that Facebook has the potential to be a game-changer for cryptocurrencies. In June, Facebook announced its proposal for a new global cryptocurrency, the Libra, to be used by billions of people. The Libra would be backed by a reserved fund of safe assets denominated in a basket of currencies. The Libra Association, the nonprofit to oversee the currency, is headquartered in Switzerland. Many of the details about how the Libra would operate remain uncertain. </p><p>The Libra has raised a number of questions due to Facebook's lack of experience in the banking sector, the size of Facebook's network and concerns about Facebook's handling of user data. There are also questions about who would regulate it and how. Earlier this month the G7 finance ministers and central bank governors agreed that the Libra raises regulatory and systemic concerns, as well as wider policy issues, that would need to be addressed before the project is implemented. Mr. Chairman this concludes my brief remarks, thank you again for the opportunity to testify, and I look forward to the committee's questions. </p><p>CRAPO: Thank you, Dr. Nelson. Professor Baradaran. </p><p>BARADARAN: Thank you, Chairman Crapo, Ranking Member Brown, and members of the committee. Thank you for the opportunity to testify today. In the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, many Americans were frustrated with our banking industry. They had engaged in reckless risk-taking and predatory practices that harmed their customers. They were frustrated again by government bailouts that seems to save just the perpetrators of the crisis. Is it any wonder that as so many people lost trust in the system, that they so enthusiastically embraced Bitcoin? </p><p>A new alternative, nonsovereign currency, introduced on the heels of the crisis to respond to the very problems of the financial sector which as Mr. Allaire wrote is rigged against average people. I wholeheartedly agree with these concerns. I spent my career trying to bring attention to issues of inequality and exclusion in banking. While I am glad the cryptocurrency industry aspires to help the unbanked, I do not believe that in the United States this is the best solution to the problem. The Blockchain ledger is a big technological leap forward, but problems of exclusion and financial marginalization in our financial system are not a result of faulty technology, but faulty policy. One stated goal of Bitcoin and digital currencies is to establish an efficient and public payment system available to all, in fact, Congress already established a public payment system, the Federal Reserve. </p><p>The Feds explicit charter is to serve the public interest and to increase the integrity, efficiency, and equity of U.S. payments. The Federal Reserve can and should seek to open its payment system to all Americans. Currently, the payment system is only open to banks. Even mobile apps and FinTech providers have to go through a bank. But for a host of reasons, banks are not serving low-income, and low- profit customers and communities. As a result, a quarter, 25 percent of Americans are unbanked or under-banked. These low-income families spend billions of dollars in valuable time paying for checks to be cashed, refilling prepaid credit--debit cards and paying bills in person. Practically speaking, the most direct path to financial inclusion is by opening the doors to our already established payment system. It can and must be updated but the system is secure and handles millions of transactions a day, is accepted by all merchants, is widely un--understood. </p><p>The alternative path to financial inclusion to cryptocurrencies relies on waiting for entirely new currencies to be developed, new and untested technological platforms, waiting for wholesale adoption and use, and waiting for technological advances to penetrate making deserts. All while unbanked populations continue to spend hard-earned wages in fees. And even if technological solutions are right around the corner and we decided this is the answer to financial inclusion we would be reserving the highly subsidized and public federal banking system for those with enough means to be banked and relegating the unbanked to the private cryptocurrency markets. This is undemocratic and unfair. The Federal Reserve and this Congress are in the best position to make this possible by offering real-time payments and retail point of contact operations such as a post office checking account. </p><p>As far as regulating these cryptocurrencies I ask that Congress and regulators approach these financial products with a healthy bit of caution. It's the innovator's job to imagine a bright and better new world of disruption and change that will benefit everyone. It is a regulators role to imagine what could go wrong to create a systemwide crisis that could hurt everyone. When it comes to regularly finance an ounce of prevention is much better than $1 trillion bailout. As innovators look forward regulators in Congress must make sure that we've learned the lessons of recent history. Though no one wants to stifle innovation or to see the U.S. lose its competitive edge we should remember that much of the deregulation that led to the financial crisis was justified on these very same worries. </p><p>Just two examples, the derivatives market was deregulated because industry experts promise innovated and complicated new products hedge risks. Investment banks and regulators relied on very sophisticated, mathematical risk models and for risk management instead of old and outdated rules. Not wanting to stifle innovation derivatives would deregulate in 2002 which led to a $600 trillion markets that no one was watching too closely. As financial regulators discovered in 2008 the complex risk models had not hedged its risk at all but had merely placed many of them on books of their counterparties. The entire sector was exposed. </p><p>The innovation, the math, and the technology was not the problem, the problem was the humans. Similar promises and assumptions were made about the new and innovative money market in the 1980s that were also similarly deregulated. Money markets were pegged to the dollar, one to one, just as Libra and digital fiat currencies are. They promised to be stable and liquid and not susceptible to runs. And they were fine until they broke the buck and threatened to potentially catastrophic run. </p><p>The Treasury had to step in to guarantee these markets. Cryptocurrencies create new money like instruments that are tradable and have inherent value. This is not significantly different from derivatives markets, commercial paper markets, repo-markets, even historic markets in private banknotes. These shadow banking markets were unregulated for too long and created big problems. So far none of the cryptocurrencies have reached the level of scale where they would present a systemic threat, but if their ambitions are believed, they will. and we have regulators for that, that should look to the safety and soundness of the financial sector. Technology has and will continue to fundamentally transform finance but there is yet to be innovative technology that is illuminated the risks and frauds and crimes the financial regulations meant to combat. </p><p>Despite many promises to the contrary, cryptocurrencies are either distorted value, tradable currencies, investment, commodities, or payment system, or some have promised they are all of the things. there's nothing about all these things being put on the Blockchain that makes it any less likely that it could lead to systemic risk, fraud, insider trading, criminal activity, panics, bubbles, etc. If our securities our commodities or our banking laws have become outdated or unnecessary, or if Congress believes that they are too cumbersome than they should be repealed or changed for all applicable parties, not just newcomers. Technology and innovation cannot undermine public policy. Thank you. </p><p>CRAPO: Thank you, professor. I might use my first section of time to talk to you, Mr. Allaire. It's been 10 years now since Bitcoin was first issued. In the digital currency marketplace has evolved and grown, I think one of you said that 2200 currencies right now--cryptocurrencies--right now. Given this innovation and their complexity, it can be difficult to understand the differences between products and their benefits and the challenges that are raised for the regulatory climate. Mr. Allaire, how can the U.S., develop a more comprehensive approach to digital currency and Blockchain regulation while still acknowledging the unique aspect of different projects? </p><p>ALLAIRE: Thank you, senator. I--I think a your-your comment is-is very accurate and that we have seen tremendous development over that period of time as noted in my testimony there is over 2300 different digital assets that are available publicly in some form. In my testimony I do outline in great detail the kind of different categories of digital assets, it's very easy when one hears about Bitcoin or Libra, to sort of assume this is all the same stuff and so I think one of the very first things for regulators and policymakers is to really distinguish between the different types of digital assets that are emerging. We see obviously these kind of non-sovereign digital monies like Bitcoin there are dozens of others like that, that have a focus on privacy-preserving, you know, the transmission of value, they implicitly have a kind of monetary policy associated with them. And these kind of new commodity monies needs to be regulated as we've regulated other commodity monies. With appropriate types of financial crimes controls as we've seen put forward with FinCEN and FATA guidance. </p><p>But also there's, I think, new things that happen in this space. The firms that store these assets, these are--these are effectively digital bearer instruments, so not unlike diamonds or gold or some other bearer instrument, but their digital what makes them very, very attractive to people who might want to steal them, hence so much of -there's been so much activity around theft on these types of cryptographically secured assets. And so, regulations are on the custody of digital assets is a really critical need and something that a number of jurisdictions have actually put forward and built very specific rules around how do we custody these types of digital assets? </p><p>I think, as I've also talked about, some of the most innovative technologies in this field are what I call Blockchain Platforms and these are really general-purpose infrastructures for record-keeping, transaction processing, writing code that executes different types of contracts and this is, I think, one of the most important breakthroughs that we've seen in frankly, in the history of modern computing and ultimately can lead to things like secure voting, new forms of governance mechanisms within firms, as well as, innovations in financial assets. These types of assets, I think, have the broadest applicability and should be encouraged in their development. I think of the same way that we encourage the rapid development of technical standards that made the commercial Internet flourish. </p><p>CRAPO: Let me interrupt and ask a further question. As I understand it, when it's been recently that Poloniex, the subsidiary of Circle, transferred its registration to Bermuda and cited in that process it was cited that there was regulatory uncertainty in the United States which was a primary motivating factor, could you explain that a little better? </p><p>ALLAIRE: Yes, Absolutely. I think that a really critical issue is that many of these digital assets do not easily fit classifications that we've had in our financial system. We'd like to say, oh this is like a currency or this is like a commodity that you'd use or utilize in some way or this is or has some feature that maybe makes it look like an investment contract. Many digital assets have features of all three. It is what makes digital assets, I think, very innovative, is that you can construct a asset that simultaneously incentivizes capital, incentivizes customer behavior, provides value in terms of access to goods or services in payments. and that's a breakthrough in-in how we can develop corporate forms, it's a breakthrough in how we can incentivize and develop businesses and technologies. </p><p>Unfortunately in the United States the guidance that the SEC has--has given is extremely let's just say narrow in terms of what they would deem to not be a security. The vast majority of digital assets if they were in fact treated as securities as the how we test application and the most recent staff guidance provides effectively would mean that those are not accessible to U.S. persons because the utility value of the asset would not be possible to function if it is treated as a security. </p><p>So there's a fundamental mismatch between the regulatory structure that--and guidance that we have here and the nature of these digital assets and so markets around the world are adopting these and not just Bermuda but Singapore, Switzerland, even jurisdictions like France introducing tailor-purposed definitions of digital assets so that issuers can feel comfortable with their obligations, there is investor protections associated with those and security and the like but which don't try and jam these into the respective classifications we have today. </p><p>CRAPO: So my time has expired but to be sure I understand your point here it would be as a part of our policy approach you are suggesting we should not regulate this set of innovations as securities? </p><p>ALLAIRE: To the contrary I--I-- </p><p>CRAPO: Oh, we should? </p><p>ALLAIRE: So I'm sorry. I misunderstood the question. Yes, we should--we should regulate these. I believe we need new definitions of digital assets as a new asset class and that there are circumstances where there are investor protection considerations, there are trading and market considerations, there are also--also circumstances that have to do with utility, commodity, and end-user usage and you have to be able to define these in a way where that can work. </p><p>CRAPO: All right. Thank you. Senator Brown? </p><p>BROWN: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Professor Baradaran, welcome. Congratulations on your move to Irvine. </p><p>BARADARAN: Thank you very much. </p><p>BROWN: You seem to--like you might be skeptical of Facebook claims of two weeks ago in this committee like the one that it is barging ahead with--with an innovation that will serve the unbanked and underbanked. Would you if you can kind of cite some history when innovators, financial service companies and others said that they wanted to bank the unbanked and the underbanked and what actually happened with those kind of innovative financial services products? </p><p>BARADARAN: Yeah, this is not the first time we have heard that the main and as Calibra says their--their fundamental mission is to serve the unbanked and underbanked and I have heard this a lot from the crypto industry over the past decade. We heard access to credit being offered earlier, and one of the ways that--that--that was offered is in the subprime crisis. </p><p>So the idea was we are going to lower underwriting standards and we are going to do the subprime market and mortgage-backed securities market and the CDL market and one of the main justifications was to provide access to credit, to increase financial inclusion. With the tech companies and some of the FinTech companies as well they--they usually list that as a prime issue. </p><p>BROWN: Thank you. Mr. Allaire address this, I would like you to is there in the reason to treat crypto currencies and other financial services offered on the blockchain to treat them differently than the products that have existed from--I want you to answer Professor Baradaran-- </p><p>BARADARAN: Oh, okay. </p><p>BROWN: You spoke to it a bit and your--your thoughts on treating them differently from what we have done over the years. </p><p>BARADARAN: No, I mean a blockchain is new technology absolutely. It is amazing and maybe we will all be on it soon. That--that is all fine but what we are talking about is the digital assets. I mean, this hearing is about the value created, the assets on the blockchain and so it is sort of a red herring to just talk about the blockchain technology. </p><p>We need to be talking about what actually is going on in these markets and so I don't think there is any reason to put whatever we are going to call it whether it's an investment, a currency, some product of value, it doesn't matter what technology undergirds it. What matters is the risk presented by this and there is nothing about the blockchain that diminishes these risk like any of the other sort of models that we had previously. That--that is not something that fundamentally changes the things that regulations are meant to combat. </p><p>BROWN: Why--discuss your skepticism of the technology alone like--like Facebook, Libra or crypto currencies could address unequal access? </p><p>BARADARAN: Yeah, I mean the--the-- </p><p>BROWN: Banking system. </p><p>BARADARAN: --the problems--the problems of unbanked like I said are not technological problems, they are policy problems. We have the technology to provide an ATM and a debit card to people. This is what the--the--the most popular product for unbanked communities is a debit card. </p><p>What they need to do is to take their cash and their paychecks to cash it someplace, right? So they need a safe and secure place to store their money and usually people want something old and dusty like a bank as opposed to some new startup to invest all of their life savings in so they need somewhere to save their money. They need a way to engage in digital commerce. So we have all of these banking deserts especially in our rural places at all we need to do is allow some bank, some access for that point of contact cash digital and none of these crypto currencies can do that until there is widescale adoption and this currency would be acceptable by every single point node that these people are using these payments and that's just it may happen but there's many easier ways to do it. </p><p>BROWN: You compare crypto currencies in some ways with going back to the gold standard. Some at the Fed have commented on that. Why is that a problem? </p><p>BARADARAN: Well, you know like Mr. Allaire said his--his company is a minority in this field. Most of it wants to rewrite monetary policy and go back to relitigate those debates about whether Fiat currency is a good idea. Our Federal Reserve has a charter to create the elastic currency. That is a debate that we have litigated in this Congress and if we want to relitigate the merits of gold versus Fiat this would be the place to do it not at some startup. </p><p>And so what--what is happening in--in the bit coin and the crypto currency market is a lot of these companies just want to create an alternative to the U.S. currency, to the U.S. dollar and I understand their frustrations. I just I can't imagine this body would want to delegate that money-making authority to the private market. </p><p>BROWN: Thank you and Mr. Chairman I will just close I--I--your comments about the Federal Reserve I think ring true that they have the authority and the ability to modernize their payment system and I am worried that if they don't move quickly Facebook or Wall Street or some tech company will use it to squeeze more profits from hard-working families and community banks and--and we will break that critical public infrastructure so thanks for your comments. </p><p>BARADARAN: Thank you. </p><p>CRAPO: Thank you. Senator Warner? </p><p>WARNER: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to say I really appreciate the fact that you and Ranking Member Brown have had this second hearing on this issue. I think it is really important. </p><p>I do think blockchain distributed ledger technology as the professor indicated, Mr. Allaire indicated, has great potential. I am a little intrigued that we are basically 10 years almost into this and even in countries that have not have the kind of regulatory oversight we've had we have not really seen a full breakout and I would like to get to that at some point. </p><p>I want to start though with professor. One of the things that Mr. Marcus from Facebook said previous hearing that if we are going to go with Libra there was going to in a sense be a one to one relationship. To me that does sound a little bit like gold standard and you know what would be the effect if this were to become an extraordinarily popular currency? How could this association, the Libra Association, acquire and hold onto enough assets to be able to allow that one to one? Would love to have a brief comment from everybody on this. </p><p>BARADARAN: It--it does seem like the gold standard or--or like money markets but one of the things that differentiates us is every time we in the United States have had a gold standard it was still backed to money created by the government. So we've never had a pure gold standard and this is what Libra would--would advise and so you have this bucket of currencies that would be worldwide. </p><p>So what happens if everyone in Greece all of the sudden invest in Libra that would sort of destabilize the U.S. dollar. So if we are going to have a basket of currencies and no sort of central issuer there are potential problems. I'm not saying they can't be solved but-- </p><p>WARNER: But wouldn't you also have to have in a sense enough basket of currencies that would be available on almost an as needed basis-- </p><p>BARADARAN: Yes. </p><p>WARNER: And again if you were talking not millions or millions but hundreds of billions or trillions potentially I don't--Mr. Allaire, do you think that really is what Marcus meant that there would be a literal one to one? </p><p>ALLAIRE: Yes. Thank you, Senator My--my understanding is that yes, it is a one to one based on a mixture of reserve currencies that they would ultimately specify. I would like to comment on this particular topic. I think it is critical which is the first wave of these private monies like bitcoin, decentralized private monies, were very much focused on establishing a--a global digital currency with a very specific monetary policy ideology and--and those will continue to grow and very likely flourish to the degree that people are interested in pursuing that form of stored value. </p><p>However the--the critical mainstream use cases for the financial services sector built on blockchains has really required the development of what we refer to and the industry refers to as the stable value tokens or stable coins, Libra being in the example of that. But these have been around for--for a number of years and two years ago with one of the other leading companies in the industry, Coinbase, we created a consortium to develop an open standard for stable value currencies to work on blockchains and we launched in Q4 of last year the U.S. dollar coin which is not a basket, it is U.S. dollar coin and it is been one for one backing model as well. </p><p>WARNER: I still don't understand how you fully aggregate that one to one backing but I want to get a couple of more questions quickly. One--one is if you've got--if the Libra approach has got a basket of currencies don't you have currency risk there? And if you've got currency risk, shouldn't there be some additional at least information in terms of consumer protections? </p><p>BARADARAN: Absolutely there is currency risk in there is also the same risk that the shadow banking market created, right? So the commercial paper markets and the repo markets and the money markets these were all dollar-denominated currency, they weren't new currencies but there is new money and value creation in a different format and that this is exactly what we have here and not to say that this--they wouldn't have 100 percent reserves just to say that what is the point, right? We have U.S. dollars, if we want more of them the Fed could do that. </p><p>WARNER: It--it also seems to me a little bit if you have 100 percent reserves where is Libra going to make money on this? If--if you've got that maintenance of that backstop all of the time. </p><p>Mr. Allaire got only a few seconds left. I mean I do I am open on this question around tokens vis-a-vis securities. You have said there ought to be a new framework, a--a new structure. Where would you put the regulatory authority in the United States if you were to be able to waive that magic wand? </p><p>ALLAIRE: Sure. My recommendation would be the development of a national policy on digital assets, definitions of digital assets, specific rules and exemptions around those and have a single supervisor over the firms that are regulated (INAUDIBLE). </p><p>WARNER: But I know that's easy to say the but you didn't answer my question. Would you create a whole new regulatory system for digital assets or are you going to pick and then you've got to--I have run out of time, the Chairman is giving me a second? Where would you place this within our existing regulatory structure or would you create something brand-new? </p><p>ALLAIRE: It is a very good question, senator. I am certainly not an expert on the efficacies of the different regulatory agencies, financial regulatory agencies and--and how to best organize those. </p><p>ALLAIRE: Thank you. I--I do think that the question about why there has not been a breakout beyond digital currencies, something that I would love to get in answer to as well. Thank you. </p><p>CRAPO: Thank you. Senator Schatz? </p><p>SCHATZ: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you to the testifiers. Professor Baradaran, I want to ask you about the federal law that says that only the government can mint a coin and of course the reason it was written that way is because that was the only way that it could be conceived that a--in entity could create a currency. And so the basic question is knowing that okay, only the government can mentally coin, but these people are trying to do something that sort of rhymes with that although it seems to comply with the statutory language which is old, what do we do now? </p><p>BARADARAN: Yeah, so I do want to differentiate that not all like--Mr. Allaire said not all crypto currencies want to establish new alternative currencies but certainly the majority of the market which is bitcoin does and we do have laws against this and I--and I want to be clear that we created these laws because we had problems. We have had problems of private you know issuance of coins. The--the UK have the Stamp Act before that so we have experienced what it's like to have alternative currencies and we have purposely put that power in the federal government. </p><p>SCHATZ: Mr. Allaire, I want to see if I can find an area of agreement between you and the professor, but I don't have a lot of time. So--so here's the thing. It sounds like you think this will democratize the use of financial products, but I'm sort of stuck on what she said and tend to agree with what she said which is to say that there is a much more straightforward way to do that. There are public policy proposals all of the time. There are things that our regulators could do under existing statute to--to democratize the process and to decentralize the process. </p><p>And so what I'm trying to get at is, do you really think that in a society where in which only 81 percent of the public currently has a smartphone that we are anywhere close to democratizing the use of these products? I mean it sounds like--what it sounds like to me is tech people wanting to wave a wand and skip a bunch of steps and avoid the tough politics of doing things for people and saying we've got a new tech that will solve all of this stuff. </p><p>So I'm just wondering whether you want to speak to the limitations societally of what you are doing. I don't doubt the importance of the technology or that we will probably all be using it in two decades, but I think that that is a different assertion than oh, and by the way, it's going to solve all of these other societal ills. Go ahead. </p><p>ALLAIRE: Well, first you know I think the motivations for founding this company in particular Circle and I think a lot of the entrepreneurs, computer scientists, economists, cryptographers and others that work in this field is not focused on financial wizardry and how to get rich quick. There is certainly a fair share of that. It is focused on how do we build a new global infrastructure for economic activity. </p><p>SCHATZ: Okay. But what do you do about like just as a start 19 percent of the American public doesn't have access to the device that you would use to execute a transaction? And what do you do about the fact that adoption is nowhere near universal? Are we just sort of supposed to place our bet on this tech as solving a bunch of problems and--and leaping over all of the existing ones? </p><p>ALLAIRE: No I--I don't think so at all. I think you know first of all these technologies develop over time you know in 19--1998 while the Internet existed, but no one had broadband access. The Internet, you know personal computers were relatively new in terms of their adoption. Should--should we not have focused on innovating in building the cloud infrastructure, higher-speed Internet connections, come up with policies that encourage broadband adoption? Should we not have made those investments and policy choices? </p><p>SCHATZ: No, but--know, but--so--so since you are asking the question let me answer the question. The--the important thing here is to understand what this tech does and what it doesn't do because if we are going to establish a regulatory framework for this tech we need to not be so triumphant about all of the problems that it's going to solve, but we also have to be clear-eyed about the problems it may create but also the potential for it. And so when--when tech executives and--and their funders talk as though all of societal ills will be solved by a new code you will forgive us if we are a little bit skeptical about all of that. I don't doubt the potential for this tech, I just don't think it's actually going to bank low-income communities, and I don't think you have persuaded anybody here that it's going to do so. </p><p>ALLAIRE: So there is no silver bullet from technology very clearly. These are human issues, and they are real policy issues. I think the--the risks that we have to address in the financial system whether it's access, criminal abuse, data security, privacy, those exist significantly. This technology actually you know does provide an avenue to improve upon those but there is no silver bullet here. This is people who have to build and innovate and collaborate with policymakers. </p><p>SCHATZ: And I will take the professor's answer for the record if you don't mind. Thank you. </p><p>CRAPO: Thank you. Senator Cortez Masto? </p><p>CORTEZ MASTO: Thank you. Thank you, Chairman Crapo and Ranking Member Brown, for this important discussion. Thank you all for being here. </p><p>Let--let me follow up on that and let me start with you, Mr. Allaire. I--I do think that blockchain technology there is potential for it. It is a future. It is a platform that has the ability to transform so many sectors of--of this country from what we're talking right now the financial sector to the energy sector, right? To healthcare records to everything, I think there is potential here and it's not going to go away. It is something that we--we have to address because if we as a country do not lead in this technology China or some other country is going to do so. </p><p>So Mr. Allaire let me talk to you about this because you talked about defining digital assets. When you were talking about but are you only talking about it as it pertains to the financial sector or are you looking at other potential areas where blockchain can be used in--in our--in our economy? </p><p>ALLAIRE: Thank you, senator. In my written testimony, I talk about this category of digital assets which are often called tokens or tokenized digital assets. </p><p>CORTEZ MASTO: So that's just as it refers to crypto currency, some sort of currency? </p><p>ALLAIRE: It is not necessarily. So you may have a token that represents votes, you may have tokens that are associated with healthcare records as you said. You know the breakthrough here is that we have a public, secure, tamperproof infrastructure that is evolving and emerging for record-keeping and processing of data that is more resilient and ultimately more private than some of the infrastructures that we have today and that can be applied in many industries in many significant ways. </p><p>A lot of the innovations that are happening with--with these digital assets that are built on blockchains may have some fundamental utility within an industry, a business, a product, a service but that digital asset also may be associated with some financial characteristic and the coupling of the utility and financial characteristics is part of what makes these innovative and it--it is the definitions there that I think really need to be more clearly defined in the United States in particular in order for businesses who want to build on this to be able to innovate and issue new types of digital tokens that can be applied very, very broadly in many, many industries. </p><p>CORTEZ MASTO: Thank you. And so professor would--would you disagree with that and is your concern more on the financial sector piece of it? </p><p>BARADARAN: Yes. My--my concern is on the digital asset side. Not--the blockchain is neutral technology, it can be used like Mr. Allaire said in voting in all of these other things. I do want to point out though that the blockchain has potential to be more secure and reliable. </p><p>So far, it has not been. It has been hackable. There--there have been security issues. I think it--it again there is a lot of potential and it has been ten years and billions of dollars of you know venture capital, and I still don't think it's better than some of the payment systems that we currently have though it could be. </p><p>CORTEZ MASTO: Okay. So when you talk about and let's go back to the unbanked because in Nevada we have the highest rate of underbanked adults in the state in--in our state as opposed to the rest of the country. But can you do me a favor and can you expand on why you think new digital currencies will not meet the banking needs several and low-income residents that are not well served by current banking system? </p><p>BARADARAN: Yeah, I mean the problems of low-income and--and underbanked customers is not that they are unsatisfied with the current technology being offered to them. The problem is that they live in banking deserts where there is no place for them to take their cash and Nevada is a huge cash-based economy. </p><p>Where do you take your cash to--to put it into a savings account that would then give you a debit card that you can use in e-commerce? There is--there is no place to do that because a variety of reasons but mainly because banks have no longer are interested in serving those customers. And so hell--my count is any technology, any digital-based currency help when people are operating in cash? </p><p>Do we need to get people off cash? Absolutely. How do we do that? This--this blockchain conversation is you know four or five steps ahead of where we need to start which is how do we get ATMs that don't charge $8 per person. </p><p>CORTEZ MASTO: And I was just going to say so the answer might be looking at why there is a charge of a fee for an ATM or why you have to have a minimum balance of $1500 or more in a bank account before you can even open a bank account. </p><p>BARADARAN: Yeah, and this is where I--I truly am grateful for this industry for bringing attention to these things because really there are problems with our payment system. I'm not trying to defend them to say that they are perfect and we should use them. There are huge problems accessibility issues; they're slow, they are inefficient, etc. But they have a public mission, and we can fix them, and we should fix them as opposed to sort of outsourcing it to the tech sector. </p><p>CORTEZ MASTO: Thank you. Appreciate that. </p><p>CRAPO: Senator Van Hollen? </p><p>VAN HOLLEN: Thank you, Mr. Chairman and Ranking Member Brown, and thank all of you for your testimony. I have been trying to listen from the TV monitors, and I want to thank all of you for your testimony, and I appreciate the series of hearings we have had on the subject of crypto currencies and new technologies, but I was listening to you Ms. Baradaran talk about the importance of planning for these technologies but also the need right now to move to a real-time payment system because our failure to have move forward with this technology as so many other countries have already done is costing millions of Americans billions of dollars every day, right? </p><p>BARADARAN: Absolutely. </p><p>VAN HOLLEN: And you know Mr. Chairman I hate to sound like a broken record on this whenever the Fed chairman or the members are here I urge them to move forward right away on building out that faster payment system. I hope that they will make a decision soon. </p><p>Let me just if I could Mr. Chairman put in the record and article and the headline; this is a Post article from a little while ago headline, a former bank CEO named his boat quote overdraft now that the bank is in hot water over the fees. </p><p>The point is that for people who are living paycheck to paycheck, the inability to access their funds in real-time is costing them a huge amount of money in fees and overdraft. Could you professor just again elaborate on what it's costing the public right now and how we have it within our power right away to move forward on it on--on this front? </p><p>BARADARAN: Yes, and if we are worried about the U.S. lagging behind this is a huge area where we are lagging behind other countries. In--in the bill that you introduced real-time processing is essential. </p><p>So if you don't have a buffer of wealth, if you don't have big bank account, you need to spend your paycheck as soon as you get it and this is why people go to check cashers. They would rather pay 10 percent of their paycheck just to be able to use it to pay the rent and buy their groceries. Instead, they go to a bank, they put their paycheck in and 3 to 5 days later, 3 to 5 business days later, they would have to go back to the bank to be able to get that. That--that is a main reason a lot of people don't use bank accounts. </p><p>And so what does it cost them? Well, not just the check-cashing fees but the money sucked out of their accounts with these fees also makes them rely on payday loans, and they are forcing a 300 percent APR and just more wealth being sucked out. These are really simple problems and I think part of being poor is that there are a lot of problems that other people don't realize that you have and--and I think we need to have a little bit more compassion about what it's like to--to not have that much money and how--how we can make lives--their lives better. </p><p>VAN HOLLEN: Thank you. As you mentioned Senator Warren and I know, and others have introduced legislation to move forward in this area, but really the Fed has it within its power and authority to do this right away. Can you just talk a little bit about how they have that authority and your view that they should move forward immediately to catch up with many of our global competitors? </p><p>BARADARAN: Yes, they have the authority. I mean they say that they are studying it. I don't know how--how high on the priority list it is, but I think it should be. As the Brookings Institute pointed out the low-income people are sort of spending billions of dollars in--in overdraft fees. We could actually just put that money back in their pockets through adopting this very simple technology, and yes, I think the Fed should definitely do it. </p><p>VAN HOLLEN: I appreciate that. Mr. Chairman I would also like to put in the record another article from FinTech entitled go slow on Libra, speed of fund faster payments and-- </p><p>CRAPO: Without objection. </p><p>VAN HOLLEN: Thank you. It--it makes the point that some of us have been trying to make which is that the Fed again could do this now and really provide relief and put billions of dollars back into the pockets of working people and I hope they will move forward quickly. In the meantime, we will continue to push for our legislation. Thank you. </p><p>CRAPO: Thank you, Senator. Senator Tester? </p><p>TESTER: Think you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Mr. Brown. Thank you--or Ranking Member Brown. Thank you to the folks who are testifying. </p><p>Dr. Nelson I guess the first question for you is--is do you believe that--do you agree that crypto currencies are leaving the U.S.? </p><p>NELSON: Sure. It is certain that other jurisdictions are sort of out ahead of the United States and trying to become crypto currency hubs, yes. </p><p>TESTER: So do you think that they are leaving because they are looking for a safe haven to avoid regulation, or is there another reason? </p><p>NELSON: Some of the crypto currency hubs are actually using regulation as a way to attract crypto currencies to their borders. It's not a-- </p><p>TESTER: So increased regulation? </p><p>NELSON: Well, not necessarily increased regulation but perhaps clarity overregulation that by giving regulatory certainty to consumers and businesses in the crypto currency market they are getting out in front on that and attracting crypto currencies to their jurisdictions. </p><p>TESTER: So one of the things that was brought up and it was just been referenced several times in the hearing with Facebook, but one of the things that is of concern I think with you and others is how do you prevent bad actors from laundering money that are financing terrorist activities or whatever. Any ideas in that vein? </p><p>NELSON: Sure. Money laundering is a huge concern for crypto currencies. Countries around the world are looking at their money laundering regulations and how to address crypto currencies. Even though crypto currency hubs like Switzerland have money laundering regulations, they are working to make those more robust. The financial action task force at the international (INAUDIBLE). </p><p>TESTER: Do you--do you believe they could be--do you believe those regulations could apply to crypto currency and have them work? </p><p>NELSON: And have them work, well, I think money laundering continues to be an issue, financial action task force is trying to update its regulations to get in front of the technology. I think it is a continuing concern. </p><p>TESTER: So the question is, is that is there a way to put a regulatory design in place that will discourage money laundering--money laundering with the crypto currency? </p><p>NELSON: I think some of the licensing and reporting requirements, transparency requirements can help address some of these concerns. </p><p>TESTER: Okay. The Facebook fellow who was here talked about--I talked about--I asked him a question about what happens if the accounts get breached the same way my credit card has happened on occasion and it hasn't cost me any money, the banks have taken care of it thank God. And I think it may have happened; it happens to everybody at some point in time through no fault of their own I might add. </p><p>So the same thing could be applied here, and his response to that was is that they have a one to one backup on the dollars. I don't know if you've watched that hearing or not. You did. And any of you can respond to that. That--that seemed to me to be I mean that's incredible to have a one to one leverage. Do you think that's real? </p><p>NELSON: I think one of the concerns about the Libra is how the reserve assets would function. They pledge to have safe assets today, but what is a safe asset today may be less safe tomorrow. So even if it's backed on a one to one ratio will that always be true in a safe asset and then what happens if there is a run on Libra if it is being used as a global currency used by billions of people. </p><p>TESTER: So since and you can answer this too, professor, if you would like. Go ahead. </p><p>BARADARAN: Yeah, I mean it is--there is what Facebook sometimes states it's going to do and then what they end up doing and then oops, sorry we were going to do that thing and we accidentally didn't. </p><p>TESTER: So would it kill crypto currency if in the laws that we are probably going to be passing because I don't think we are going to leave it entirely up to the regulators since they brought it up if we stipulated that there had to be a one to one? </p><p>BARADARAN: Crypto currencies like--like we said before there's a variety. I mean if you were just talking about crypto currencies they--they actually are trying to be alternative currencies. So they are not worried about one to one. </p><p>TESTER: Okay. Let's talk about Libra and specifically because that--that and look, I am not an expert in this field at all, but it appears to me that they are trying to take the dollar because you can buy them with the dollar and then make a transaction across country lines. In that kind of a scenario which is what I interpret them to be offering would a one to one be something that we could require without putting them out of business? Or would that be good, prudent fiscal responsibility? </p><p>BARADARAN: I mean I think we--we still are unsure. One to one to what, it's not just dollars, it's a basket of currencies so what is that other one? </p><p>TESTER: So in Libra's case one to one to every Libra they have got a--they have got the equivalent dollar amount behind it. Is there--there--I take it what you are saying is there's ways to game the system if they want to game it regardless of what we say. </p><p>BARADARAN: I mean as we say in law I mean definitions are tricky. You know you can define something as a one to one, but what does that mean? One to one to what? </p><p>TESTER: Yeah, like a--well I appreciate you all be here. I would just say that I think this is coming and we have to be ready for it, and I think that all three of you can be an incredible resource to us as we figure out how we are going to deal with it. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. </p><p>CRAPO: Thank you, senator. I will go to another round of questioning, and I want to start my questions this time with you, Dr. Nelson. </p><p>In your report, you describe the different approaches to different governments have had to crypto currency. What are some of the key attributes of countries whose regulatory frameworks are considered more accommodative? In how did their--how did they approach issues relating to money laundering and the other types of issues that we're talking about here? </p><p>NELSON: Some of the countries that are trying to build themselves as crypto currency hubs are really trying to adopt clear regulations at the outset on how crypto currencies are going to operate. This is to give regulatory certainty to consumers and businesses who want to use crypto currency regulations. That said, some of the regulations have been described as more favorable to crypto currency industries. </p><p>So for example, in Switzerland I mean they have regulations for money laundering and addressing crypto currency. They have provided guidance on how ICOs should be treated in regard to securities regulations. They provide guidance on what kind of licenses crypto currency industries need to operate within Switzerland. So it's not that these countries are trying to shirk regulations. They are trying to provide certainty while also balancing innovation to encourage the adoption of crypto currency. </p><p>CRAPO: So it's not so much that they are trying to create the Wild West sort of speak invite folks to come there because there's not really significant regulation. It is that they are providing clarity and well maybe Mr. Allaire you--you could address that. </p><p>ALLAIRE: Sure and you know as we looked at the ongoing expansion in our international business and operations we you know it was very clear to us that for our non-U.S. business the U.S. regulations are the U.S. regulations and what we do here is exactly what the law stipulates. But outside the U.S. there are opportunities for digital assets and blockchains that are larger and so we spend time to look at all of the different jurisdictions and the things that we were focused on as a firm where we wanted there to be high--an actual high bar from a regulatory perspective meaning that there needed to be you know significant serious firms where fundamental risks were being supervised, enterprise risk, cyber security risk, financial crime risk, anti-money laundering risk and most critically in--in the case of digital assets custody risk, the protection of these assets from theft, having the appropriate insurance around them. </p><p>But also clear definitions and I think this gets do what one of the other panelists has said and I have said as well which is very clear definitions about what constitutes a token or a digital asset to provide that kind of clarity to businesses that want to operate there whereas I think in some other jurisdictions including the United States there is an incredible gray area that makes it very difficult for businesses to know where they stand and where to operate. So those are some of the things that we considered and have--have found in other jurisdictions. </p><p>CRAPO: So I want to get into data privacy, and I may have to do that after Senator Brown takes it another round but in the last couple of minutes that I have here help me understand if a digital currency is to become global like Libra seeks to do how does it do that, how does it get global acceptance if it faces 190 different countries with different jurisdictional issues and different regulatory systems? </p><p>And maybe another way to ask my question is if the United States were to decide and I'm not saying that it should, but if the United States decides we didn't want crypto currency to happen in the United States and tried to ban it I am pretty confident we couldn't succeed in doing that because this is a global tech--global innovation but how would--how would a company that wants to create a crypto currency that has global reach get into the United States? How would that impact the United States? Do you see the question I'm asking? </p><p>ALLAIRE: I am happy to take part of that, Senator. You know I think that the challenge that we all face with this is some of these crypto currencies are they are literally just a piece of open source software, there is nothing else. It exists on the Internet; it is open source software, anyone can implement it. It runs anywhere the Internet runs, and these have a monetary policy where these assets are algorithmically generated, and they exist everywhere the Internet exists. They will soon exist interstellar; they will exist again anywhere the Internet exists. </p><p>That is a challenge that every government in the world now faces that money, digital money, will move frictionlessly everywhere in the world at the speed of the Internet, hopefully with a high level of security and--and data protection around it. </p><p>One of the promises of this technology very specifically is a higher standard around privacy, a higher standard around confidential transactions and--and data protection. That is one of the core infrastructure focuses of these blockchains, and so I think those--those needs can be met. There's the flip side, which is how does law enforcement get its job done and how do 190 countries getting the agreement about that. (INAUDIBLE) guidelines, for example that are specific to virtual assets have come into place which I think could be a roadmap to that as well. </p><p>CRAPO: We will have to ask Professor Baradaran and Dr. Nelson to either answer it. If I can get you another round maybe I will we can answer that question then but Senator Brown? </p><p>BROWN: Thank--thanks. Ms.--Professor Baradaran I want to have a series of questions for you. Mr. Allaire said that he didn't really know who should recognize--who should regulate digital assets and Facebook essentially said that two weeks ago. Let me ask you a series of mostly yes and no questions. Do we already have rules and regulations for currency? </p><p>BARADARAN: Yes. </p><p>BROWN: Do we have rules and regulations for securities? </p><p>BARADARAN: Yes. </p><p>BROWN: And do we have rules and regulations for payday loans? </p><p>BARADARAN: Yes. </p><p>BROWN: Sort of. </p><p>BARADARAN: Sort of. </p><p>BROWN: Rules and regulations for exchange-traded funds? </p><p>BARADARAN: Yes. </p><p>BROWN: Are there any new financial products that have been invented that we have never seen before? Are we talking about financial products that already exist but now run on blockchain? </p><p>BARADARAN: Yes--yes. I think--these are not new-- </p><p>BROWN: You can expand (INAUDIBLE). </p><p>BARADARAN: These are--they're--the technology is new, but the sort of essence of the product is--is something that we've seen before. </p><p>BROWN: So if--if there aren't really new products why would we need new rules and new regulations? </p><p>BARADARAN: I mean, I think it's important to have clarity. It's very important for--for people to understand what it is. I--I don't think we have to reinvent the wheel on any of this stuff. I think we have clarity in each of the jurisdictions so to the extent a digital asset hits the currency model or the securities model we have already sort of debated those--those models and we can enforce those rules. </p><p>BROWN: Are you concerned that tech companies seem to be pretty strongly resist--resistant to rules and regulations? </p><p>BARADARAN: I--I think--I think--I think there's a lot of faith that some of the problems that we as a society face are solved by tech and I think sometimes there is a naivety on the part of some of these tech founders in--in what tech can accomplish and what is--is better for public institutions and so I think sometimes tech is great and can solve a lot of problems. </p><p>I mean he used the Internet before, and I think nobody wants to ban--no one is saying ban blockchain. No one is saying they in these digital currencies. All we are saying is, let's just protect people in the ways that regulations are meant to protect them. So if we had said in the early days of the Internet look, Internet is going to take over education soon. </p><p>So let's just not worry about fixing public schools and the Internet will educate the young. Right? So I think it is essentially that. We still have these public institutions that are doing it, and we don't go around them just because we have a new potentially revolutionary technology. </p><p>BROWN: Does--does the resistance of big tech companies' resistance to regulation does--does it remind you of resistance by big banks to regulation? Are there are similarities there? </p><p>BARADARAN: There are similarities, there, yes. </p><p>BROWN: What does that tell you? </p><p>BARADARAN: I mean I--I just think we need to be cautious. I think we need to be again innovators dream big, and regulators just need to also imagine bad scenarios. I think we as you know regulators and Congress people don't need to just swallow it wholesale. It is good that we have innovators and entrepreneurs that have really beautiful visions of the future and I hope that they are right, but it's also good to have a counterpoint to that where regulators say hey what could go wrong here and just try to imagine those scenarios, too. </p><p>BROWN: I have said a number of times in this committee that many of my colleagues seem to have, maybe we all do to a degree a collective amnesia about what happened to our financial system ten years ago. What lessons do we learn from weakening regulations in the banking sector a decade-plus ago? What lessons do we apply to tech companies here? </p><p>BARADARAN: I think one of the things that keeps being said is we are going to lose--the U.S. is going to lose its unit leadership worldwide if we don't let these companies do whatever they want and I think that--that is I mean we can't compare the U.S. economic system to Malta or Bermuda or to Venezuela or even China. </p><p>We--we have the strongest currency worldwide for a reason. We have great technology companies for a reason. We've got a very, very strong and healthy sector not to say that it's perfect just to say that we are all going to leave to Malta I don't think that should make regulators think that okay, well-- </p><p>BROWN: Skeptics of your view say that the reason we have such strong innovation is because government gets out of the way and lets them--let's big tech or lets Wall Street invent new products and do what they want. </p><p>BARADARAN: I think we--we said that until the financial crisis and then--and then we have $1 trillion bailout and the Fed is left holding the bag and so I think we just, you know, we say that on the front end let them do it but let's remember what happens when we sort of don't regulate those things that--that matter. </p><p>And it's not just all technology, not all technology is similarly risk inducing. I mean again the Internet and email all of these things we keep complain--comparing blockchain to these things, but it's very different in a lot of ways or specifically digital assets on the blockchain. We are talking about trading in markets and finance. We are not talking about just neutral tech here. </p><p>BROWN: Thanks. (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>CRAPO: Thank you, Senator Brown. I have a few more questions. As I indicated, I would like to get into the data privacy issue a little bit here. As I am sure you know Senator Brown and I together had jointly expressed serious concerns over the collection of data on the individuals and the phenomenal, explosive growth of that collection and THEN use of data. What happens without use--without individuals usually knowing that it is happening or when it is happening or knowing what has been collected on them or how it is being used. </p><p>Will--and each of you can respond to this if you would like to, will this new technological innovation that we are seeing into digital currencies and blockchain technologies give us an ability to meaningfully enhance individuals' privacy rights and protections and if so kind of explain how so. </p><p>ALLAIRE: Be happy to start. Thank you, senator. I have addressed this somewhat in my written testimony as well. </p><p>You know if you--if you step back for a moment and you look at these public blockchain infrastructures that are being built they are designed in a way to provide a global, open record-keeping system that is highly secure, that is very tamper-resistant and which can work in an interoperable way all around the world. One of the killer apps if you will that is being explored to build on top of these, and there are many, many projects, startups, companies, governments even that are working on this is the development of essentially new standards for what is often referred to as self-sovereign digital identity; the ability to have a digital identity where you as an individual health self-sovereignty over who can access attributes of your digital identity, how they can access it, the ability to provably demonstrate something to someone say someone needs to know your age in order to conduct a transaction without having to disclose to them your address or other information. </p><p>So the ability to have much more fine-grained, selective ways to attest through attestation methods, to attest to who you are or what you do without actually having to transmit all of that sensitive personal information. The data breaches that we have today, the massive privacy violations that happen continually on centralized Internet services those are core, core issues that blockchain infrastructure is being designed to try and address. It is one of the areas I am most hopeful and when you couple that kind of digital identity model with global digital currencies you actually can imagine a financial system that both preserves privacy, provides mechanisms that are still highly useful to law enforcement to pursue the bad guys but you know keeps people--you know, keeps people in control. </p><p>And so I think those things are--are very much becoming possible in front of us. There are still needed policies around that, around who can add elements to these digital identities and how they are accessed and reporting and other things so there is absolutely the need for some very clear laws and policies, but it is a technical breakthrough that is emerging that could solve some of these issues. </p><p>CRAPO: So before I go to Dr. Nelson and Professor Baradaran going beyond financial transactions could this innovation or--or technology that you are talking about, could that be used outside financial transactions for example somebody surfing on the web or looking to buy a washing machine on the web and having their identity grabbed or having their search identified in then utilized in artificial intelligence to manipulate them? </p><p>ALLAIRE: It could be applied--it could be applied in putting people in more control over who is accessing their data and how, when they are interacting with any digital service largest financial services. So it is applicable very broadly. </p><p>CRAPO: All right. Dr. Nelson or professor, would either of you like to (INAUDIBLE)? </p><p>NELSON: Sure. I would just have that Facebook has totally changed the debate about privacy in crypto currencies. We used to focus with crypto currencies on whether they gave users too much privacy and that it allowed bad actors to engage in nefarious activities. Now with Facebook's Libra the concerns about whether use of crypto currencies will have enough privacy and the potential for our economic transaction data to be merged with other data about users on the Internet including other Facebook platforms. </p><p>And this issue then ties into the differences in regulatory approaches taken by countries around the world; countries regulate privacy differently and so if you have a local currency with different regulatory purchase relating to privacy this may be something that regulators really want to address and get in front of. </p><p>CRAPO: Thank you. Professor? </p><p>BARADARAN: I was going to say there's two different kinds of privacy there, so you know do we want to privately buy drugs, child pornography or send money to terrorists? No, and we have laws for that. So we don't want that kind of privacy but we also want the privacy of you know Facebook not using algorithms and data to target me knowing she's sad and doesn't have enough money in her bank account so I'm going to give her a payday loan when I know that she is going to take it out. </p><p>That is the kind of privacy where it's not individually maybe they don't know me personally, but they know the type of person I am and what kind of mistake I would make and so those are the kinds of things. There are two very different types of things and like she said Facebook presents a kind of a different problem than bitcoin which is popular for people who want to buy illicit and extralegal drugs and this is why you see in Venezuela, Iran and other countries with sanctions wanting to evade them using these platforms. </p><p>CRAPO: I think--anybody want to add anything else to that? </p><p>Well, there are obviously tons of questions here. I have--I have a lot more myself, and as we move forward, I am sure that we will be communicating with you to get your advice. We appreciate you all coming today and sharing your information and expertise with us. </p><p>This is obviously a very critical issue. As I said at the outset, I want the United States to stay at the forefront of essentially engaging in and hosting, managing and regulating this new creative technology and the invitation that will flow from it. I do believe that it has some incredible potential that can be utilized for good. And it does have incredible risk that can be utilized for bad and we just need to get our handles--get a handle on that. I appreciate you're coming here today helped us out on the. With that this hearing is adjourned. </p></bodyText></section></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">POLTRN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WPK-VF31-JDPT-T2G5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">147909</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-08-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><publicationInfo><publicationName>CQ Transcriptions</publicationName><bodyText><p>All materials herein are protected by United States copyright law and may not be reproduced, distributed, transmitted, displayed, published or broadcast without the prior written permission of CQ Transcriptions.

A few what should be well understood video conferencing reminders. </p><p>Once you start speaking, there will be a slight delay, before you are displayed on screen. To minimize the background noise, please click the mute button, until your turn to speak, or ask questions arises. If there's a technology issue, we will move to the next Senator, until it's resolved. I remind all senators, again, and the witnesses, that the five-minute clock still applies. You should have a box on your screens labeled \"clock\" that shows how much time is remaining. We've had a little difficulty finding that box, sometimes. And so, at about 30 seconds remaining, I'll tap the gavel to remind senators and the witnesses that the time is expiring. To simplify the speaking order process, Senator Brown and I have, again, agreed to go by seniority in this hearing. </p><p>Today, the Committee will hear testimony on the digital transformation of money and payments. We will discuss how it has enabled more efficient technologies, ushered in new players and business models, and raised important questions about what the rules of the road should be and the federal government's appropriate role. </p><p>Testifying will be The Honorable Chris Giancarlo, Senior Counsel at Willkie Farr &amp; Gallagher and the former Chairman of the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Also, Mr. Charles Cascarilla, Chief Executive Officer &amp; Co-Founder of Paxos and Professor Nakita Q. Cuttino, Visiting Professor of Law at Duke University Law School. </p><p>Welcome to our witnesses, and thank you for joining us, today. </p><p>The COVID-19 pandemic has forced us to go all digital at rapid pace, turning to our phones or computers to work, shop, communicate, and provide or receive services. This has highlighted the incredible innovation of banks, Fintech and payment companies to facilitate commerce at speed and scale. It's also challenged us to reexamine issues of financial inclusion, and consider different ways to think about money and payments. </p><p>New technologies, like digital wallets and mobile money transfers, have greatly increased the availability and ease of electronic transactions. Often, these services are layered on top of traditional payment rails and rely on core nonbank payment systems as means of settlement. Because many of these services require consumers to hold a preexisting bank account or card, some believe they may be limited in their ability to expand the population of financial services consumers. </p><p>Financial innovation has attempted to fill that need by creating entirely separate payment systems, based on their own digital currency and distributed ledger technology. Cryptocurrencies have long claimed the ability to provide faster, less-expensive payments on a global scale, with some degree of anonymity. More recently, a new type of cryptocurrency has emerged, aimed at achieving these benefits while marginalizing the volatility of some of its predecessors. </p><p>Stablecoins, which may be issued by a central entity, deliver price stability by having their value pegged to another asset, like commercial bank deposits or government-issued bonds. Still, there are legitimate questions about certain stabelcoins and digital currencies more broadly, such as the degree of oversight, impact on the transmission of monetary policy and disruption of banks' traditional financial intermediation. </p><p>The Financial Stability Board recently reported that stablecoins could pose financial stability risks if offered and used by a large, existing customer base. Nothing amplified these concerns more than Facebook's announcement of the Libra project, last year. To be sure, the cryptocurrency ecosystem is as diverse in its products and functions as the rest of financial services.    And as I said in our last digital currency hearing, it seems to me that these and similar innovations are inevitable, beneficial, and the U.S. should lead in their development. </p><p>The U.S. currently regulates digital assets, based on their activity and employs a same risks, same rules principle.  Some states have taken further steps in designing their own oversight regimes. The U.S. must have clear rules of the road in place that protect businesses and consumers without stifling future innovation. Acting OCC Comptroller Brian Brooks has recently raised the idea of a federal payments or digital currency charter. The OCC is also seeking input on a variety of areas important to FinTech and digital currency, aimed at supporting the evolution of the federal banking system and its ability to meet needs of customers and communities. </p><p>This includes barriers to further adoption of crypto-related activities and distributed ledger technologies in the banking industry; new payments technologies and processes the OCC be aware of and innovative tools for complying with regulations and supervisory expectations known as regtech. I am interested in learning more about these and the other strategies we seek toward a consistent U.S. framework. I'm interested in learning more about the adoption of electronic payments and the growing scale of digital currencies that has led to calls for digital fiat, a so-called central bank digital currency. This is being explored by many major central banks. </p><p>A CBDC could take many forms.  For example, former Chairman Giancarlo has discussed a tokenized U.S. dollar that could be issued by the Fed and function next to cash, central bank reserves and commercial bank money, which we will discuss more, today. No matter its form, a U.S. CBDC requires methodical consideration and U.S. regulators have begun this work, already. Fed Chair Jay Powell has raised several potential legal hurdles, like whether the Fed has the underlying authority to issue a tokenized dollar, how the rights and obligations of system participants would be determined and potential effects on the U.S. dollar, as the world's reserve currency. </p><p>Another critical consideration is the role traditionally filled by banks and other financial institutions. As trusted intermediaries, these firms perform several services critical to the safety and stability of the U.S. economy. As the federal government explores CBDC, it must consider the innovation and competition already demonstrated in the U.S. payments sector. And during this hearing, I look forward to hearing more about efforts being undertaken by different groups in the development of digital money and payments, design and operational and risk considerations in their development, what specific problems a CBDC should resolve that are not currently being or cannot be addressed by the litany of payments innovation already completed and underway; what the rules of the road should be. </p><p>Senator Brown. </p><p>BROWN: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Big Tech companies have made a lot of big promises about the better society they were going to allow us to build. And they have not lived up to any them. They sold us the idea that technology they'd unleashed would help us level the playing field for people whose voices have been silenced, they insisted it would democratize industries, they promised it would build a more just and equal country. </p><p>Instead, like so many corporations before them, they just created new ways to pay themselves, at the expense of everyone else. They've disrupted industries and institutions, from taxi cabs to local journalism to our democracy itself. Instead of, however, building something better, they tear things down for their own profit. And as usual, it's workers, especially, low-wage workers and black and brown workers, mostly women, getting exploited. </p><p>As we all know, essential workers clean our hospitals, feed our families, drive our public transportation, deliver our packages, so much else that we take for granted. These essential workers are the same ones most likely to get sick when people don't wear masks. We continue to see that, as cases spike again. Newsflash-four months into a pandemic, four months--four months after public health officials said we should wear masks, yesterday, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, the top healthcare person in our country, says he agrees. Even the Vice President's starting to wear a mask. Leader McConnell, yesterday, said we should wear masks. </p><p>Finally--finally, most people--most people in high places are wearing masks. </p><p>Essential workers are largely women, often people of color. They've been taken advantage of by corporations for decades. They aren't paid, so often, aren't paid a living wage, they don't have control over their schedules, they don't have good benefits or safety precautions on the jobs. They're usually sabotaged, if they try to organize a union. Big Tech has just made it easier for corporations to exploit them. </p><p>Tech companies give other corporations new tools to mine people's data, to target them with ads for predatory lending. They created facial recognition technology and sold it to law enforcement, to better target protestors. Their app-based business models have made it even more efficient to turn thousands of workers into, quote, \"independent contractors,\" with no job security or workplace protections. </p><p>Facebook even created a new tool called \"Facebook Workplace\" to let corporations censor and spy on workers trying to organize unions. They've backed off for now, and of course they claim that's not what it was intended for but it was right there in their marketing materials, selling other corporate executives on a tool that would allow them to blacklist the word \"unionize.\" So, given that history, why on earth would we trust Big Tech with our banking system? We do need some disruption in the banking system, to be sure. </p><p>As many working families in this country know, it's expensive to be poor. You have to pay to cash the check from a hard weeks' work. You have to move money around at just the right time and in just the right way. You have to pay a transfer fee pocketed by your bank. You make one misstep, you get smacked with a late fee that could have paid for food or diapers. And if you need to borrow a little money because your pay day doesn't line up with the due dates on your bills, be prepared to pay loan-shark rates. For rich people with money in the bank, the bank pays you. For everyone else, you pay the bank. </p><p>Many essential workers also interact with the economy, mostly in cash. Since the pandemic, it's only gotten harder and more dangerous, as people try to use digital platforms to pay as much as possible, to reduce contact and exposure to the virus. These are problems we need to tackle but I'm skeptical financial technology firms will solve them. Given their record, it seems more likely they'll only make the problems worse. </p><p>Yet, these FinTech firms claim that low-paid workers and communities of color stand to benefit the most from their innovation. But even with all the FinTech hype over the last decade, it's hard to think of any revolutionary products or services that have, actually, helped the people that they say it will. </p><p>Marketplace lending and small-dollar credit underwriting promised affordable and abundant credit, but if you look at the punishing terms that come with these products, they're just payday lenders with a website or an app. </p><p>We heard all kinds of promises about how cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum would, fundamentally, change our relationship with the banking system. Workers would be able to efficiently and cheaply transfer money, make online payments, buy groceries, all without a bank account. But that's not what happened. Bitcoin's primarily used by wealthy investors. </p><p>These companies promised their algorithms would guarantee innovative products and services to people locked out of the financial system. That's simply not true. The algorithms use biased data, we end up with more discrimination against the very people that they said their products will help. </p><p>And let's not forget that many of these companies have argued they should have all the benefits of a bank, but not be regulated like one, and do not provide their customers the protections they deserve. The people who really benefit are always the same, the CEOs and their wealthy investors. For corporations, the U.S. banking system is a public good. The dollar carries the full faith and credit of the government. Deposit insurance protects banks from runs. The Fed operates an enormous payment and clearing and settlement system that makes possible trillions of dollars of commerce, every year. U.S. corporations, U.S. banking system is a public good. </p><p>We need a different approach. The banking system in the United States should be a public good for everyone, all of us. That's why I introduced the Banking for All Act. It would allow every American to walk into any bank or post office in the country, or go online, and set up a free, secure bank account, backed by the Federal Reserve, hooked directly into the Fed's payment systems. Banking for All means no more check cashing fees, no more paying to use the money you already earned, no more waiting until Wednesday to use money you were paid on Friday. </p><p>It means all workers would able to fully participate in the economy that they keep being told they're so essential to. It means if you're lucky enough to have savings at the end of the month, you get the same great interest rate the big banks do. Technologies like Central Bank Digital Currencies, full digitization of the payments system can help make this a valuable tool for everyone. It doesn't require us to gut financial protections to make this system work. </p><p>This is an opportunity, Mr. Chairman, to offer real, tangible benefits to workers and their families, right now, to fight the inequality that has locked too many Black and brown Americans out of the banking system. </p><p>Thanks to the witnesses for your testimony, and thank you, Mr. Chairman, for holding this hearing. </p><p>CRAPO: Thank you, Senator Brown. We'll proceed with our witnesses now, and we will proceed in the order I introduced you. </p><p>So, Mr. Giancarlo, you may proceed. </p><p>GIANCARLO: Thank you, Chairman Crapo, Ranking Member Brown and members of the committee. </p><p>I'm Chris Giancarlo. I was last before you two years ago, as CFTC Chairman. The subject then was bitcoin. And I urged respect for a new generation's interest in virtual currency innovation, with a thoughtful and balanced policy response. </p><p>Well, today, I'm before you to talk about something that is, perhaps, more important. And that is upgrading our own national currency, the U.S. dollar, into a digital instrument for generations to come. </p><p>I begin with three observations from my time in public service. First, we know that much of America's physical infrastructure, it's bridges, tunnels, airports and mass transit systems, have been allowed to age, deteriorate and, in some cases, become obsolete. Well, sadly, the same is true about much of our financial infrastructure. Systems for payment and settlement, shareholder and proxy voting and investor access and disclosure that were global models in the 20th century, are falling behind the times in the 21st. And nothing reveals the limits of our existing financial system more starkly than the federal response to COVID-19, with tens of millions of Americans having to wait a month, or more, to receive release payments, by paper check. </p><p>My second observation is that we are entering a new era when things of value, such as contracts, stock certificates, land records and cultural assets like art and music, will be stored, managed and moved around, instantaneously, from person to person. They will move without central validators, a true collaborative cryptography and a decentralized network of computational algorithms. It will make sending money as easy and cost free as sending a photograph. </p><p>My third observation is that, by acting now, we can harness this wave of innovation for greater financial inclusion, capital and operational efficiency and economic growth for generations to come. The digital dollar project is a not-for-profit effort to encourage public discussion on the potential advantages of the U.S. Central Bank digital currency, or CBDC, as it is known. </p><p>The project's recent white paper proposes a new additional form of money, a tokenized digital bearer instrument. You have the same legal status as the dollars in one's purse but on a mobile device. And would operate alongside assisting forms of money, distributed through the existing two-tiered banking system and potentially be recorded on distributive laser technology. This type of CBDC would increase financial inclusion, by broadening access to services through digital wallets on smart phones. It would enable the sending of COVID relief, immediately, to under banked populations and expand their ability to access financial services. </p><p>Yet, this type of digital dollar is about more than financial inclusion. It is about basic financial architecture. Today, most of the world's tradable commodities, benchmarks and contracts are priced in U.S. dollars. Tomorrow, they will be digitized, tokenized and coupled with smart contracts. They are likely to be still priced and accounted for in U.S. dollars, if the dollar remains an exclusively analog instrument. We must future proof the dollar today, for a digital tomorrow. Doing so is in the national interest. It will spark creative new industries, jobs and economic growth. </p><p>Yet, it is undoubtedly an enormous undertaking. It must be done carefully, thoughtfully and deliberately. Something that is worthy of the dollars global importance cannot be rushed. It will take time to get right. But now is the time to get started. A recent launch of SpaceX reminds us that America explored outer space and the lunar surface, through a series of pilot programs, known as Mercury, Gemini and Apollo. </p><p>So, too, should the U.S. explore the digital dollar in a series of well-conceived pilot programs. A team of fine researchers at the Federal Reserve are already thinking about a U.S. CBDC. The next ship step should be a series of pilot programs, driven by the Federal Reserve and the Treasury and draw upon the innovativeness of the private sector, to test various designs, technologies and protocols. </p><p>Throughout modern history, the U.S. has been a leader in innovation, whether launching a space program or building the internet. It incorporated America's core values and the rule of law, individual liberty, free enterprise and the right to privacy. The world is asking what role America will play in the future of money. The choice is either we take the leadership role, or we accept that others will lead and that their values will be enshrined in this new technology. I say we choose to lead. And if we do, we will increase financial inclusion, enhance democratic values and future proof the dollar, for generations to come. </p><p>Thank you. </p><p>CRAPO: Thank you, Mr. Giancarlo. Mr. Cascarilla. </p><p>CASCARILLA: Thank you, Chairman Crapo, Ranking Member Brown and committee members. Thank you for the opportunity to appear before you, today. </p><p>I'm Charles Cascarilla, the CEO and Co-Founder of Paxos. I've spent my career in financial services as an analyst, investor and entrepreneur and experienced the shortcomings and systemic risks of our financial market infrastructure. I started Paxos to modernize this infrastructure and create a new open financial system for everyone, built for the 24/7 digital age, where money and assets can be transferred instantly, efficiently and fairly. </p><p>In 2015, we became the first trust company approved by the New York Department of Financial Services to manage crypto and blockchain assets, meeting the same standards as banks and other financial institutions. We believe stablecoins and a CBDC are imperative to our financial infrastructure and maintaining our leading economic position. </p><p>Today, I'll discuss the problems we're solving, how our stablecoins are designed and how CBDC should be approached. Stablecoins address the antiquated plumbing of our financial system and update it for today's world, where commerce happens in real time. We can no longer rely on a system that's available for a few hours, five days a week, with long delays. We see three urgent areas for pursuing a digital dollar. </p><p>First, financial inclusion. Stablecoins can provide equal access to financial services. Currently, money creates an unnatural digital divide. Physical cash is accessible to everyone but electronic payments are limited to those with bank accounts. There are 63 million unbanked and under banked American adults. Why reinforce disadvantage, when we can support full participation in the digital economy. Blockchain-based stablecoins allow everyone access, just like physical cash. So, people can avoid high account and overdraft fees, check cashing and cross-border remittance fees. </p><p>Second, capital mobilization and cost reduction. Stablecoins bring cost savings and speed to everyone, from the biggest financial institution to the smallest consumers. Time between trade and payment ties up trillions of dollars of capital. This contributes to the financial services industry now consuming, roughly, 8 percent of current GDP, compared to 4 percent, historically. Blockchain allows dramatic efficiencies and unlocking of capital for more productive uses. </p><p>Thirdly, technology enabled transparency and competition. Digitizing dollars reduces the gap between consumers and the Federal Reserve, enabling transparency, real-time risk monitoring and reductions in systemic risk from centralized intermediaries. As a result, improved competition benefits customers, by driving innovation and financial products. </p><p>Now, I'll share how Paxos' designed three of the top six stablecoins in the world. First, on technology. Block chain is just a database, whereas other databases are updated by one central administrator, blockchain allows for a shared verifiable, more secure and distributed ledger. Anyone with a smart phone, or the internet, can access our stablecoins. Transactions are peer to peer, instant, 24/7 and cost just a few cents. </p><p>Second, on regulation. Uniquely, both Paxos Trust Company and our stablecoins are regulated. Our stablecoin reserves are segregated and fully backed by Treasury bills and equivalents, minimizing risk. Third party auditors publicly review our reserves, monthly. Importantly, our stablecoins are not competitive to the dollar. They simply represent dollars already in circulation. </p><p>Lastly, privacy and accountability. Our stablecoins are anonymous, like cash, but transactions are publicly viewable. This allows individuals to transact freely and privately, while maintaining verifiable audit trails. All customers go through a full AML-KYC analysis at both the on ramp and off ramp. </p><p>So, how can we move forward? A central bank digital currency is a fiat stablecoin issued by the Central Bank, or Treasury. A dollar with stablecoin characteristics is a powerful mechanism to drive innovation in the financial system. It's important for this committee to deliberate over the impacts of key design decisions regarding privacy and anonymity, such as how much of the details of private transactions are disclosed and to whom. Likewise, there are questions about the level of openness and access. Should only banks have the ability to interact with the Fed to distribute a stablecoin, or could other institutions, payment companies, or even consumers? Would consumers and businesses be able to make peer to peer transactions like they can with physical cash? </p><p>Reaffirming the values of free markets, private property, privacy and freedom of speech are instrumental in growing the American economy. A well-constructed U.S. CBDC will support our preeminent economic position and the dollar's reserve currency status. Ultimately, the best mechanism to answer these design questions is safe experimentation. The right regulatory policy would be analogous to what we did with the internet, enable innovators to experiment and integrate with different implementations, within a flexible regulatory framework. </p><p>At Paxos, we are modernizing the financial system, so all Americans have equal access. A CBDC would upgrade our financial infrastructure, increase inclusion and reinforce our values and the position of the dollar. </p><p>Thank you. </p><p>CRAPO: Thank you, Mr. Cascarilla. Ms. Cuttino. </p><p>CUTTINO: Hello there, can you hear me? </p><p>CRAPO: Yes. </p><p>CUTTINO: Chairman Crapo, Ranking Member Brown, members of the committee, thank you for this opportunity to testify on this vital topic. I'm Visiting Assistant Professor of Law at Duke University, where my research focus includes consumer finance and I teach a course on FinTech and financial inclusion. </p><p>In the wake of federal efforts to quickly deliver benefits, under the CARES Act, millions of cash strapped Americans suffered weeks long delivery delays for paper checks and then saw the value of those benefits depleted by check-cashing fees, overdraft charges and short-term loan costs incurred, while waiting for payment. </p><p>Yet, these stories are not unique to the pandemic. They arise, in part, from frictions in the payment system, resulting from access barriers to banks and timely delays in payment processing that often drives demand for costly fringe services like check-cashing, payday loans and high rate prepaid debit cards that deplete already limited resources to the tune of $90 million in fees, annually. </p><p>Calls for open access to the payment system often point to the risk associated with this long-standing fringe marketplace, which risks include financial distress and insolvency. However, in my remarks, today, I will point to a novel FinTech service, the caution that these risks are likely to persist, even in a digital economy in the absence of open access to real-time payments. Despite claims of financial inclusion, some FinTech firms are low to moderate income consumers, serving low to moderate income consumers, perpetuate or exacerbate the risk these consumers already face. </p><p>Take for example, early wage access programs. These programs are mobile and internet apps that allow workers to withdraw earned but unpaid wages, before scheduled paydays. Providers claim these programs are efforts to facilitate real-time payments of wages, like an ATM for your paycheck. Offered through mobile app stores, or as an employee benefit, these programs collect payroll data to calculate approved wages and then provide early wage transfers, which are, automatically, reimbursed on the user's next payday. In the wake of COVID-19, these programs experienced increased demand to cover basic living expenses and supply, and to supply stock ups for stay at home orders. And they anticipate further demand spikes, once Americans are fully back to work. Early wage programs promised to involve the familiar time friction in payments and replace high cost credit--and replace high cost credit like payday loans. </p><p>However, this idiosyncratic market includes programs that pose unmitigated risk from descent payday loans under the guise of real-time payments. In the interest of time, I will focus on the most disconcerting program. Despite their novel form, these programs function much like payday loans by first offering funds to be repaid at a later date, a dynamic that often leads consumers to miscalculate future cost and repayment risk. And second, by having fees, limited underwriting and repayment terms akin to payday loans. </p><p>For example, these programs can have per transfer fees or even encourage tips that can be the equivalent of 470 percent APR, which is higher than some payday loan costs, though these are not disclosed in such manner. And after repayment in full on payday, these programs can result in payday wages that are reduced by 25 percent to 50 percent, which makes managing other expenses difficult. Arguably, as in the payday loan context, these characteristics can lead consumers to repeatedly use, to repeated use of the product in a manner that severely depletes their already limited resources in compounding program fees, overdraft charges and late fees. </p><p>Yet, as important payment services, rather than loan services, early wage programs enjoy limited restrictions and disclosure requirements, otherwise intended for consumer protection. Thus, the opaque risks and cost for certain programs are fully borne by consumers who lack full information. Consequently, pending state class action lawsuits, online consumer reports and investigative reports reveal a growing number of consumers who spiral into more precarious financial conditions, unaware that these payment services function much like loans. </p><p>Undoubtedly, the emerging early wage access market deserves distinct regulatory attention. Nonetheless, this illustrates that, in the absence of public policy addressing open access to payments and real-time payments, low income and moderate income Americans will continue to have their limited resources depleted, whether by traditional firm services like payday loans and check cashers, or by novel fringe tech services like some early wage access programs. </p><p>The Federal Reserve Board governor has said that everyone deserves the same ability to make and receive payments, immediately and securely. For everyone to have that same ability, however, we must bypass the high price of banks and provide public access points to have minimal transaction cost for Americans with limited resources. And we must do so, urgently, particularly in this moment when financial distress is so acute. </p><p>Because the payment infrastructure is already ubiquitous, public access to it may be the quickest way to achieve financial inclusion to address pressing economic concerns. Open access, particularly, with real-time payments could redistribute, redistribute billions in wealth to and, in turn, facilitate savings for cash strapped America. </p><p>Please consider those policy proposals that offer banking opportunities for all. </p><p>Thank you. </p><p>CRAPO: Thank you, Ms. Cuttino. I'll start the questioning and boy, there's a lot of issues I want to try to cover. I won't get it all done in my questioning. Issues like privacy and data protection, transparency and access. And frankly, the impact of our actions and how we proceed in the United States on the U.S. dollar. </p><p>Let me start with you, Mr. Giancarlo. Are other central banks in the world developing CBDCs? </p><p>GIANCARLO: Yes, indeed and are really at a remarkably fast rate. The Bank for International Settlements did a survey, I think it was in 2018, that identified the majority of central banks, around the world, are looking into CBDC. And some of them are quite advanced. </p><p>Sweden, for example, it's Riksbank, its state central bank is embarking upon a cashless program using a central bank digital currency. But most of the world's major central banks have advanced efforts in working into this. </p><p>CRAPO: And this question is for any of you but please answer it quickly because I want to--I've got a lot of questions, but is the fact that other central banks are developing CBDCs, and let's take, for example, the People's Bank of China, it's one of those that is very far down the road, I understand. </p><p>Is that a threat to the dominance of the U.S. dollar in global currency? Anybody got an opinion on that? </p><p>GIANCARLO: I'll jump in, Senator. The dollar strength in international world is a reserve currency is but on many pillars. And many of those pillars are quite durable and are not going to be undermined, anytime soon. </p><p>Nevertheless, the Chinese efforts and some other efforts are directly targeting some of those pillars. The U.S. dollar's dominance is based upon an account-based global banking system. The move toward a digital Yuan by China is meant to bypass the accounts-based system and allow for direct payments. </p><p>Coupled with their Belt and Road Initiative and a now pre-trade zone in the East that they are talking about, that is going to have an impact on a number of dollar strengths in the global market. </p><p>And then finally, there's the issue that most of the world's major commodities are priced in dollars. Major commodities, contracts and benchmarks. And as they all, themselves, move to a digital programmable format, I believe it's vitally important that the dollar also, itself, become programmable and digital and would interact with those commodities. </p><p>Otherwise, other countries' digital money will be able to interact with them. And I'll leave time for other statements to pipe in. </p><p>CRAPO: Well, thank you. I want to move on. But I would like to ask Mr. Cascarilla and Ms. Cuttino, if you have an opinion on that, please, in writing, respond to me on that, after the hearing, because I'm very interested in that issue. </p><p>Mr. Cascarilla, I wanted to move to another issue, just because of the time pressure, here. And that's privacy and data protection. </p><p>Can the digital currency model the blockchain-based models that you discussed, adequately protect--in fact, can they better protect privacy and data, as we move forward in transactions? </p><p>CASCARILLA: Yes, I think that's exactly what a block chain-based system enables. And the recent that's possible is because you are allowing access to the blockchain for anybody who has internet access. </p><p>And at the same time, that blockchain has privacy enhancing features that allows transactions to happen, basically, anonymously, very similar to cash. However, importantly, all transactions are stored on the blockchain. So, law enforcement and regulators can follow transaction trails and a verifiable audit mechanism and if ever they need to explore what transactions have happened on the chain. </p><p>And so, in the case of Paxos, we're regulated. We have a banking regulator. They come and they understand our books and our records, our policies and procedures. And they can actually look at everything that's happening. </p><p>And so, we create transparency at the same time we create privacy. </p><p>CRAPO: Alright, thank you. And again, I'll move on, quickly. I really would like all of you to respond, after the hearing, on all of these that you didn't get to answer. </p><p>But Ms. Cuttino, you talked about the fact that there were some transparency and some access issues and some abuse of these--some of these models. And let me just start out. Is it--it's my understanding that the utilization of digital currency models based on blockchain can actually reduce the transactional cost of financial transactions, if done properly and fairly? </p><p>Is that correct? </p><p>CUTTINO: I believe they can, if done properly and fairly and enforced to do so. Yes. </p><p>CRAPO: And I think that's the case, in fact, I think that's one of the benefits. </p><p>Just quickly, Mr. Giancarlo, is that correct. </p><p>GIANCARLO: Yes, and we do have some evidence of that in countries, actually, in Africa and Kenya with their M-Pesa system and in Nigeria with their cashless. We are seeing greater elements of financial inclusion, as they move to electronic. </p><p>In a society that is, that's very young and uses a lot of mobile devices, there has been improvements in financial inclusion, as they move to a cashless mobile device-based system. </p><p>CRAPO: Alright, thank you. As you can see by the clock, I'm over my time. I wanted to get back to you, Ms. Cuttino, but I will send you some questions that you can respond to, after the hearing. </p><p>Senator Brown. </p><p>BROWN: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Giancarlo, nice to see you, again. </p><p>GIANCARLO: And you, Senator. </p><p>BROWN: Professor Cuttino, welcome to the banking housing committee, one of the best places to be in the Senate. So, you've researched, Professor Cuttino, you've researched a lot of FinTech products that don't really live up to their promises. </p><p>As we talk, today, about digital cash and access to bank payment system, I'd like you to discuss innovations, in terms of what it means for the unbanked and under banked workers. I notice in your response to the chairman, you said if worse to do so. That was the last part of your statement and I know you never get enough time in these hearings. </p><p>But talk about that. I think you and I share the same interest in making sure the banked and unbanked--unbanked and under banked are served much better in this country. So, what kind of features do we need to make sure any innovations work that way. </p><p>CUTTINO: Yeah, sure. Well, I think as an initial matter--well, first as initial matter, thank you for having me here, first time. But to answer the question. We need to address the frictions that exist with the payment system now and understanding what those are resolving those. </p><p>So, first we have access friction. Those relate to cost. They relate to geographic restrictions. They relate to certain trust dynamics. And so, if we're addressing those with FinTech solutions, we have to appreciate that the transaction cost and the fee nominal for low to moderate income consumers. </p><p>There must be a way to bridge the gap from cash to the digital divide and that .5 million people are without  access, 45 million people are without smart phones. And so, there needs to be an appreciation that, if we're going to advance financial inclusion, there are some people are left out of the technological space that we are currently in. </p><p>And so, to loop them in sort of whatever the innovation is, has to contemplate that, to bridge that gap. </p><p>And I'll leave that there but just noting that, of course, with innovation there comes a reduced cost and having the range of providers advance financial inclusion or having a regulator ensure that it's not just some doing it, all of them are doing that and that some consumers aren't exposed to this, the worst side of the industry is really what I often see and I'm trying to mitigate. </p><p>BROWN: Talk further for that. Your research of some FinTech products, you've called them fringe tech, which is a pretty apt description. How does the Banking for All Act provide some of the benefits that these fringe tech products that we all are asking about, these fringe tech products offer, without the down sides? </p><p>CUTTINO: Yeah, so on that, I would say that some of these products, take for example, if we're talking about early wage access programs, the idea that is allowing you to quicker access to your income banking--the act will allow for consumers to have faster access to their income, instead of waiting for paper checks. </p><p>It would also allow for them to have more secure storage for their funds, in comparison to payment apps like Venmo where, really, they store funds like a bank but they don't have the protection, say like bank deposit insurance. </p><p>And so, in that case, they're really unsecured liabilities that you have against the unsecure claims you have against Venmo, which means that, if it goes bankrupt, you're likely to recover pennies on the dollar for what you stored there. </p><p>In contrast, having an account having under the act, it would protect consumer funds. It would also promote wealth in the sense of even nominal interest that can be accruing on the account there. And incentivize savings and keep cost low for transfer. </p><p>BROWN: So, some of the FinTech, bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have told this committee, over the years, that people don't trust the banking systems, people, some of whom you're talking about, that they would--that they would flock to bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Apparently, that's not happened. </p><p>Why have they not seen the widespread and mainstream adoption among the under banked and the unbanked? </p><p>CUTTINO: Right, so when it comes to trust, it's really hard to just what it is that particularly low- and moderate-income consumers are having issues there. But a lot them note that it's cost-based. They have had past experience with banks, hidden fees, overdraft charges. These are linked transaction costs with the banking system. </p><p>And so, any solution should have, again, low transaction cost. </p><p>In the early years of bitcoin and some of these other crypto occurrences, the transaction cost for the consumer group was extremely high and remain particularly high. And so, that's one barrier, when it comes to some of these blockchain and crypto currency technologies. </p><p>You also have the reality that they're pretty impractical for these consumers who, again, transact in their local communities. Their small businesses will not be transacting in a bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in that manner. And so, interoperability, again, the fact that many consumers are not in this group, are not operating in e-commerce in the same way or with the same savvy that requires, does require for bitcoin and certain crypto currency uses. That's why I think, in part, they weren't flocking to it. </p><p>But I would also note that, I mean, there was a lot of instability with those coins. There's a lot of uncertainty. And so, the distrust that was likely happening with that market as it was emerging, as well. </p><p>BROWN: Thank you, Professor. Thanks, Mr. Chairman. </p><p>CRAPO: Thank you. Senator Rounds. </p><p>ROUNDS: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Look, first of all, thanks for having this hearing, today. I think this is an important subject and I think the sooner that we explore it and begin the process, the better off we're going to be. </p><p>I just think about what I've seen, recently, within airports as we move back and forth and the number of individuals that are making very small transactions on credit cards for just, virtually, everything. </p><p>Ad I've wondered whether or not it was of value and whether or not the merchandisers that are out there that are receiving credit card requests for making very small purchases, whether the costs involved in that are going to cover, you know, the cost that they're going actually to pay out. </p><p>And in considering that and in looking at these other programs, the CBDC seems to bring up, at least, another alternative. But what I'd really like to ask is a question of all three of our guests, today. And I'll just start with Mr. Giancarlo and move our way down the line. </p><p>Who are the winners and who are the losers, within the financial industry, the FinTech companies, if we were to move to and begin a pilot project-project as you suggested, who would be the first ones on board and the first ones to be looking at this saying, \"there's some real negative things, here, where do the dollars move? </p><p>And I think, if you follow the money, you stat to understand really where the folks who would be in opposition to it and, also, the folks who might very well be in favor of moving in the direction of CBDC payments. And Mr. Giancarlo, can you talk a little bit about that? </p><p>GIANCARLO: Yes, Senator. The way I view a U.S. central bank digital currency as it is, as core architecture, financial architecture for the financial system. </p><p>It would be, in a sense, an alternative to the existing architecture, which is the accounts-based architecture, which despite many efforts to modernize, still inherently remains slow, expensive and rather exclusionary. </p><p>And what we're talking about with the CBDC is a new architecture on which businesses are built, on which innovation takes place and which an economy can flourish and an architecture that addresses the slowness, addresses the expansiveness and addresses, to some degree, the inclusion issue. It doesn't address every issue but addresses it. </p><p>And so, to answer your question, the winners and losers, I think, will be those who can use this new technology to increase speed, to lower cost and to address issues of inclusion. And I think the losers will be those whose business model doesn't evolve, who's wedded to that slowness, that's wedded to that expensiveness, or wedded to that exclusionary nature of the current system. </p><p>The opportunity, I think, is a social benefit, a national benefit. But there will be winners and losers, as there are in any transition from technology. </p><p>And I'll just end on this one point. We mistakenly think that Darwin said the strongest survive. The fact of the matter is, Darwin said the most adaptable survive. And I think that's true, whenever we transition to a new architecture, to adapt to it I think will help bring benefits to society, at large. </p><p>ROUNDS: Thank you. Mr. Cascarilla. </p><p>CASCARILLA: Yes, I mean, I think it's important to realize that technology, ultimately, is a tool. And so, it's how you use the tool that will, ultimately, decide whether you get certain types of benefits or certain types of costs. </p><p>And if you think about the incumbents in the current system, they have the customers. And so, if they're able to adapt, they're able to use this new technology, they would be able to offer, I think, better products, more competitive products and be able to embrace this innovation. </p><p>On the other hand, of course, if you don't embrace it and this technology is as transformative as I certainly believe, as I think we're all talking about here, today, then you would certainly be disintermediated. You could, potentially, lose. </p><p>And so, I think what happens is technology is something that accelerates the process of creating a new type of financial system, one that's more resilient, one that's more fair, one that's more inclusive and one that offers a lower cost base so that many more types of participants can use it in an efficient and fair way. </p><p>And so, that's the important concept here. </p><p>ROUNDS: Thank you. Professor Cuttino. </p><p>CUTTINO: Yes. So, on that, I think the winners and losers, not to be a professor, but it depends because I think regulation could be key in ensuing that there are minimal losers, in terms of by focus on financial inclusion with some consumers. </p><p>By that, I mean, I recently read an article that once we shift to real time payments, of course, the cost will go down. And banks were searching for other ways to recoup their overdraft fees and interchange fees that they admit they would be losing. </p><p>And so, trying to shift to whether or not they're increasing cost for accounts or something else. My point is that, once the industry is losing fees, they'll seek to recoup it in another manner. How do we protect the most vulnerable consumers against that shift that, inevitably, continues to leave them out? </p><p>ROUNDS: Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, my time has expired. </p><p>CRAPO: Thank you. Senator Tester. </p><p>TESTER: Yeah, thank you, Chairman Crapo and Ranking Member Brown for having this hearing. I think we should really do more and more of this because I don't know that anybody on this committee, I should just speak for myself. I will tell you, I need more information if we're going to figure out how we're going handle this. </p><p>So, I always apply things to where I live. And where I live, this little gizmo doesn't work too good, okay. And quite frankly, internet's probably a little slower than it should be. So, I'll start with you, Professor. </p><p>Are the folks that don't have, the folks that don't have good internet, are they just left out? Is that the deal? I mean, give me your perspective on that. </p><p>CUTTINO: Yeah, I mean, I think they could be left out, if we do not make strides to ensure they are included so that, sorry, go for it. </p><p>TESTER: That's good, that's good. Mr., either, either one of the two of you want to speak to that issue because you must have a plan for it? What is your plan? </p><p>GIANCARLO: Thank you, Senator I might speak to it because I had the pleasure of visiting your state, during my time as chairman and actually met with a number of your ag producers that are outside the urban areas and, actually, struggle with broadband access. It's a major issue, as we move forward. </p><p>And it goes beyond payments. It goes to their inclusion and so much of the knowledge economy and other areas. It's a real concern. I don't think it's one, though, that we can address by looking at digital payments. I think it's one we need to address, as a nation, and recognize that we need to make sure that all our citizens, whether they're in rural areas or inner-city areas, or elsewhere, are included in the digital economy with broadband access. Certainly, anything we can do in that area is worthy of support. </p><p>TESTER: I couldn't agree with you more. But until that happens, we're pretty much host, is what you're saying. </p><p>GIANCARLO: Well, you know-- </p><p>TESTER: It's okay, I've got to move on. But that's what I heard. Charles? </p><p>CASCARILLA: I think what we're talking about here is a way to create a transition to a different type of financial system. It's not that we'll replace cash or access for those who don't have readily available internet access-- </p><p>TESTER: --But we are talking about making deals. And there's businesses that are going to use this to be able to, to be able to do transactions. But you all said it in your testimony. That we all make transactions quicker, more efficiently, more cost-effectively. That's the advantage here. If you don't have internet, what's the solution, or is there one, until you do like Mr. Giancarlo said, make the investment in broadband that has to be made eventually, anyway? Is that your conclusion? </p><p>GIANCARLO: I would also add to that, Senator, we have had the same problem with regional banking and country banking, as well. </p><p>I think four out of five small banks have closed in the last few years. Rural areas are-- </p><p>TESTER: -- but also let me point out, in the CARES Act, the people who did the best job were those small banks. It actually works better for rural America than the big boys. But Mr. Cascarilla-- </p><p>GIANCARLO: --As did minority banks, as well. </p><p>TESTER: --I've got to ask Mr. Cascarilla because he's in this business. Tell me how we deal with areas that don't have internet. Because by the way, this isn't a small part of the country. I mean, it may be fly over parts and it may be rural but there's still businesses there that are going to need this and that are going to get, if this works as you guys have said in your statement, they're going to get outcompeted by businesses that have the broadband. </p><p>CASCARILLA: I think your point is very good, which is that you need to be able to create a much more broad-based access to the internet, similar to how we have the interstate highways and roads. </p><p>TESTER: Well, Crapo and I will make sure we get that money into rural America, right Mike? So, let me ask you this. When it comes to laundering money, now, let's put it this way. My credit card. Occasionally, somebody gets that number and buys a hover board in Ohio. Believe it or not, that actually happened. They called me up, you in Ohio, it's taken care of. I never see the problem. The bank, the credit company or the bank, the bank fixes it. </p><p>The question is, how is it fixed here? </p><p>CASCARILLA: Well, there's a couple of components. The first is, we're operating under New York banking law. We're a trust company. We onboard the customers and we're able to be able to help them and-- </p><p>TESTER: --What you're saying is, you have the same regulations as the banks do, right now? </p><p>CASCARILLA: That's exactly right. We do. We're recognized under New York banking law and we're a trust company. In fact, we're safer than a bank. We hold all of our client assets, fully. Bankruptcy, remote and segregated. We never use any client assets. </p><p>TESTER: Who is your regulator? </p><p>CASCARILLA: The New York Department of Financial Services. </p><p>TESTER: Okay, so what happens in Montana, if I get ripped off? Does New York have any obligation to take care of my problem? </p><p>CASCARILLA: Yes, they are the primary regulator for us. So, we have reciprocity across states. And so, they're a primary regulator and we have to deal with situations like this. </p><p>TESTER: Don't you have to have-- don't you have to have a national law to take care of this? </p><p>CASCARILLA: A national law can have pluses and minuses to it. You, I think national law has pluses and minuses. What's really important is being able to create portability across state lines. Even as a trust company organized under banking law, we don't have explicit reciprocity from every single state. </p><p>TESTER: Mr. Chairman, appreciate the hearing. I think we need to do more on this. Thank you very much. </p><p>CRAPO: Thank you. Senator Cotton. </p><p>COTTON: Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for this very important hearing on a vital topic. The U.S. needs a digital dollar but not exactly for the same reason that most other countries are embracing digital currencies. We don't see it so much as used within our borders, or to help reach people who struggle to get to banks or even have traditional currencies. This is more about keeping the dollars, reserve currency status and ensuring its role in global payments. </p><p>The U.S. dollar has to keep earning that place in the global payment system. It has to be better than bitcoin, or any other kind of cryptocurrency. It has to be better than a digital one. The dollar has unmatched advantages but without digitization, I worry that the dollar may end up being lightly very best flip phone in 2006, are the very best movie rental store in 2005, or the very best horse drawn carriage in the 19 teens. </p><p>So, Mr. Giancarlo, I want to offer you just a chance to give one example here. We already had a digital dollar. How differently would things look, earlier this year, when the Treasury took several weeks to send out millions of dollars of individual relief payments, under the CARES Act, including over $80 million via an old fashion paper check? </p><p>GIANCARLO: Thank you. Well, it would have been able be instantaneous delivery of those funds to those with smart phones. Now, as Professor Cuttino and others have noted, we don't have universal distribution of smart phones but we have, actually, fairly good penetration of smart phones into certain communities. That is an issue that is in itself, is worthy of further analysis. </p><p>But at least, the technology would be there for instantaneous distribution of funds in a crisis. </p><p>You know, we have, we have many communities that rely on paper checks, military families, for example, for their salary and veterans for their benefits are also, wait sometimes weeks for receipt of that, or they have difficulty getting that money to their family members. This would allow for immediate distribution of those, as well. </p><p>COTTON: Thank you. And Mr. Giancarlo, while we're with you, I just want to highlight a part of your testimony. You say that the world's most tradable commodities are contracts, significant items of value are today priced and accounted for in U.S. dollars. You also say that tomorrow, they will be rendered in digitized tradable tokens and coupled with algorithmically driven smart contracts. </p><p>You also say that we must ask ourselves whether the digital commodities in contracts of the future will still be priced and accounted for in U.S. dollars, if the dollar remains exclusively analog and does not, itself, become digitized and programmable. </p><p>Will you please elaborate further why that is the case? </p><p>GIANCARLO: Yes, thank you. And this comes directly from my experience as chairman of the CFTC. You know, the United States, one of the underpinnings of the dollar, one of that's, perhaps, not as well noted as others, is the fact that most of the world's major commodities are priced in dollars; wheat, soybeans, cotton, as well as energy, oil, natural gas, precious metals, industrial metals and some of the world's major benchmarks and contracts. </p><p>The world needs to reserve dollars because they need to buy those instruments, using dollars. Those instruments, though, are moving themselves to digital format. We saw it in soybeans, moving to blockchain technology for its global logistics. We're seeing the world's major commodities benchmarks move to a digital format, with programmability built in. This will be happening, in the next few years. </p><p>If the dollar remains analog but most of the world's key commodities and contracts become digitally programmable, others will take advantage of that. That's one of the reasons why our economic competitors are, themselves, developing digital currencies to price the world's major commodities and contracts in a digital programmable nature. </p><p>You know, currencies compete against each other. Throughout much of human history, they've competed. Error of the world's, the dollar's dominance is relatively rare in human history. And having technological innovation in a currency is going to be one of the reasons that the world is going to select one currency over another. We want to make sure they select the dollar. </p><p>COTTON: Speaking of competition, China just announced plans to create an East Asia cross border payment network, using a crypto currency based on a basket of four currencies, China's yuan, the Japanese yen, the South Korean won and the Hong Kong dollar. What's the significance of that for the United States? </p><p>GIANCARLO: Well, allow them to make direct payments in this new currency, without having to go through foreign exchange markets, many of which are based in the United States, to convert currency using dollars as settlement mechanism. </p><p>So, it will extend the R&amp;B's global importance and its entrance into the world of reserve currencies. </p><p>COTTON: Thank you. And thank you all for your appearances, today. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. My time is expired. </p><p>CRAPO: Thank you. Senator Warner. </p><p>WARNER: Thank you, Mr. Chairman and appreciate very much this hearing. You know, I think I'm a proponent of both access to capital and innovation. I think central bank digital currency really offers some exciting opportunities. </p><p>I think, though, as part of today's hearing and our testimony that we've still got a long way to kind of get this balance right between the impact of a CBDC on monetary policy privacy and financial stability. </p><p>Mr. Giancarlo, I want to start with you. Many folks sometimes mix together too much anonymity with privacy. And I think they are distinct. And we all know that information can be private but not anonymous, questions of transaction laws to personally identifiable information safeguarded by a bank. Likewise, information could be anonymous, but not private, such as the sharing or disclosure spending patterns aggregated across large numbers of users. </p><p>Mr. Giancarlo, how is this a meaningful discussion, this difference between privacy and anonymity and how we think about those two concepts, as we think about CBDCs? </p><p>GIANCARLO: Thank you for the question. It's a great question. You know, an analog environment, it's very easy to have the notion of privacy and anonymity be complicated together. As we go into a digital CBDC technology, it's possible to make programming choices based upon policy developed by, in the public sector and then, integrate that into the technology. </p><p>What the digital environment gives us is the ability to make those choices and program it into money, itself. So, we could have an environment where all transactions are recorded on a ledger but only those who are say, indicated by sort of big data analysis for, perhaps, a likelihood for criminal activity would then have the anonymity removed and identity revealed. </p><p>And so, that's why it's so important that we begin the experimentation now, so we can decide what programming choices, what policy decisions to build into this new technology and no issue is more important than the issue of privacy in the system. We want the system to be used and, therefore, we've got to get the issues of privacy and law enforcement, the balance between the two, we've got to get that right, at the outset. </p><p>WARNER: We--the chairman and the ranking member and a group of us in a bipartisan way have been traveling through this on something we've called the Illicit Cash Act on AML and beneficial learnership that move into this next realm. We've got to make sure we get this right. </p><p>Last question for both you, Mr. Giancarlo and Professor Cuttino. I'm interested in what my friend, Chair Brown's ideas are about the digital retail Fed accounts. And I--and I do think we have to think through that because I don't want to know if we want to come to the Feds in the retail commercial banks but I do think we've got to think through account holder, ID verification, also getting some of this screening for illicit activities. </p><p>But I did--once again, we have brought that up against privacy concerns. How do we get back right balance here and how close are we to having an effective digital identity tools for the purposes of programming? </p><p>Could somebody start with--I'm down to the last minute. Professor Cuttino and then, Mr. Giancarlo. </p><p>CUTTINO: I mean, candidly and not, you're talking in terms of whether or not botching technology has the tools for-- </p><p>WARNER: I'm talking about if we're talking about building in, potentially, as Senator Brown has said, this new whole system. How do we, how do we again get this balance with privacy right versus somebody upsides bank that Senator Brown has pointed out. We're talking about turning this over and engaging with the Fed. </p><p>We've got to make sure we get it right, privacy wise. We'd also want to make sure, as we build the system from the beginning, we don't end up with some of the challenges around things like beneficial ownership or to wrap around our traditional system. </p><p>CUTTINO: Got it. My answer is going to be brief because I'm going to start with, I am not a privacy scholar. And so, I will just give some quick thoughts in that I do think the Fed should, at least, work with industry to appreciate, understand whether there needs to be firewalls in place and or having accounts with industry that is better equipped for those, for the firewall. </p><p>But I will defer to Mr. Giancarlo on the rest of the analysis. </p><p>GIANCARLO: What I would say is that the analog world of fiat currency we have now, we have made policy choices. We've made policy choices that transactions of an amount greater than $10,000 are reported for anti-money laundering and other purposes. </p><p>So, we can and we must make policy choices, as we explore a new form of digital currency, as to where that balance lies. And I think there's going to be a critical role for Congress and for policymakers in getting that balance right. </p><p>But what we can't do is allow the need to make important policy choices like that frees us from moving forward, when so many of our economic competitors, around the world, are exploring this. And so many private sector actors are exploring. </p><p>So, at the end of the day, all the exploration that's going now is there to address the issue of the expense, the slowness and the exclusiveness, exclusivity of the existing system and it's time to get in the game, explore that and bring these important policy concerns up front, right in the development stage, as we explore this. </p><p>WARNER: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. </p><p>CRAPO: Thank you. Senator Kennedy, are you with us? We have a number of senators who are checked in to the hearing but who have, also, got multiple hearings going on. And so, Senator Kennedy is probably at one of those other hearings. He's coming, here he is. Okay, Senator Kennedy. </p><p>KENNEDY: As soon as I get my video working. </p><p>CRAPO: We hear your audio. There you go. We got you. </p><p>KENNEDY: Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and thank you for holding this hearing. And thanks to all the witnesses. </p><p>I take it from your testimony that none of you are opposed to a digital currency of the U.S. dollar. Is my assumption correct? </p><p>CUTTINO: Yes, Senator. </p><p>GIANCARLO: That's correct. </p><p>KENNEDY: All right, I want each of you to tell me what Congress needs to do. And why don't we start, Mr. Chairman, with whom ever you would direct to go first. </p><p>CRAPO: Well, let's go in reverse order, this time. Ms. Cuttino. </p><p>CUTTINO: Sure. Congress, sir, a host of considerations that need to be made. But at least, in terms of financial inclusion, which is what often times, these conversations are centered on. What Congress should do is ensure, again, we bridge the gap between those who have not access to the internet and mobile devices and-- </p><p>KENNEDY: --Professor, let me stop you. I understand that. I listened to your testimony, earlier. You were very eloquent. Here's--let me rephrase my question. </p><p>What does Congress need to do for the American people to have a digital currency in dollars, within three years? And if you want to pass on the answer, I understand. </p><p>CUTTINO: I'll pass on the answer. </p><p>KENNEDY: Okay, who would you like to go next, Mr. Chairman? </p><p>CRAPO: Mr. Cascarilla. </p><p>CASCARILLA: Yes, I think there's a number of things that can be done to promote this. The first is creating a passportable regulatory framework. So, the EU, there's an E-money license. You have an E-money license in one country, it works anywhere. </p><p>And having that in the U.S. between states is something that should, definitely, be possible in a federal union and would make it much easier for innovative companies to begin to help to think about how this could be deployed. </p><p>The second way, I think, is by creating access to the Federal Reserve from non-payment source providers. This is something that Bank of England has just done, in the last year or so. </p><p>KENNEDY: What--what is a non-payment source provider. </p><p>CASCARILLA: A non-bank payment provider. It could be any type of FinTech firm. It could be payment companies. And what this would allow--or wallet companies--this would allow there to be more competition, so that you could have the movement of stablecoins be distributed by anyone who has access to the Federal Reserve, not just banks. </p><p>And so, creating non-bank payment service provider access would be really important. So, I think those are two really important things that Congress can work on. </p><p>I think being able to fund and lastly, being able to fund a project, here, along the lines of what Chris was talking about, that would create pilot programs, so that there could be more testing and more understanding of how this could be used, would be crucial because I think that, realistically, a CBDC is something that needs to be understood and deliberated on. </p><p>There's important policy decisions that need to be understood by this committee and Congress, around privacy and anonymity. </p><p>KENNEDY: Well, I get that we need to deliberate. The United States Senate deliberates really well. Let's go to the last witness, Mr. Chairman. Can you tell me, once again, the steps that the United States Congress needs to take to have a digital currency in the U.S. dollar, within the next three years? </p><p>GIANCARLO: Thank you, Senator By the way, it's nice to see you, again. I was before your committee, one of the last testimonies I gave, before leaving CFTC. </p><p>KENNEDY: I remember. Nice to see you again. </p><p>GIANCARLO: Nice to see you, again. Thank you very much. </p><p>So, to answer your question, I would recommend that Congress encourage, if not authorize, the Federal Reserve and Treasury work together on a series of pilot programs the same way we used pilot programs to land a man on the moon, to explore different elements of this and that Congress make very explicit in its instructions, what areas of concern should be focused on. </p><p>Issues of privacy, which we've just discussed, issues of financial inclusion can be built in, right from the outset. Issue of cyber resilience, critically important. Issues of interoperability with other CBDCs being developed in the world are just some of the areas that Congress, I think, could instruct the Federal Reserve and Treasury to take into account, as they roll out a series of pilot programs, which could be done nationally, could be done locally. They could focus on discrete sectors. </p><p>One area to experiment with might be veterans benefit distribution, or military pay for military families. Those are areas that we could do in say, a Fed regional area, where there make it a military base or, perhaps, benefits on rural areas and say, Indian reservations. </p><p>We could look at those discrete areas, do a discrete pilot program, see what we have learned from it, just as the early space missions were, relatively, modest. They just tried to launch a satellite into orbit, before they went further to land on the moon. I think we should start small, learn what we learn then take the next step. Drop back, analyze what we've learned, go to the next step. </p><p>And each of those steps should be be reported to Congress with Congress's involvement because, at the end of the day, Congress needs to make sure that public policy is built into this new, this new future of money that our children and our grandchildren are going to be using, long after we're gone. </p><p>KENNEDY: Will you send me a letter saying just what you just said? I would be grateful. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. </p><p>GIANCARLO: I would be honored. </p><p>CRAPO: Thank you, Senator Kennedy. Senator Cortez Masto. </p><p>CORTEZ MASTO: Thank you. Let me just follow up on that line of questioning because I think that's very interesting and I thank you all for being part of this panel. </p><p>So, Mr. Giancarlo, do you think that the Treasury and the Federal Reserve are equipped to take on those public projects, do they have the necessary resources and staffing with the sophistication levels of being able to move forward in a manner that really complies with what you're trying to achieve here, which I don't agree with? </p><p>GIANCARLO: Thank you. So, I'll start with my own experience running a federal agency. </p><p>I know that, when we attempted to do larger technological initiatives, we needed to bring in expertise from the private sector. We simply didn't have the salary scale to bring in that level of expertise. We didn't have the teams. We had busy day jobs to do our mission that Congress assigned to us. </p><p>And to move in there, and we started, CFTC is trying to do some work in artificial intelligence to better understand the market data that we were receiving. And yet, it was very difficult to do with our existing resources. </p><p>So, the answer to your question is, I really believe the right way to do this is the way we did it in the space program, the we did it in the early days of the internet. And that is, the core policies driven by the official sector would be driven by the Federal Reserve. </p><p>But we would bring in the innovativeness of the private sector. The project management skills of the private sector and the sense of urgency of the private sector can drive this forward. </p><p>So, I believe it should be in the best American tradition, a public private partnership with all the core policy issues settled by the official sector but with a lot of the human power and the intellectual inventiveness of the private sector brought to bear. </p><p>CORTEZ MASTO: Thank you and I appreciate that. I do think, though, and I loved your outline of it in addressing privacy and financial inclusion. </p><p>But I also think that we already are very familiar with the fact that a portion of our country are unbanked, or under banked. And we're not doing anything about it. So, I don't think that, necessarily, leads us to be a part of this kind of discussion. </p><p>But it's something that we already have to bring along. And I can't stress that enough because Nevada, in my state, unfortunately, we are the state with the most people and the highest percentage of under banked in this country. And I see the impacts of that, right now, during this crisis, and other downturns that we've had. </p><p>And so, let me ask, I think it's Professor Cuttino. Thanks for joining us. So, is the solution to providing bank accounts to every American adult solved by giving people a bank account, or providing people access to technology to find other sources, if they can't get it with a regulated credit union or bank? </p><p>And if so, how do we get them to using that new technology and what do we need to do, now, to be able to give them those tools. </p><p>CUTTINO: That's a good question. So, giving them access to a bank account, a publicly provided one, would first reduce, potentially, eliminate any transaction cost that they have in the private market. That again, is a barrier for most people, who are unbanked. They simply do not have enough money to maintain a bank account. </p><p>And so, the public bank account option gives them recourse, when they are, when they don't have enough funds for the private market. So, that's one. </p><p>And so, I would say that they do need that at a basic level. Providing them with technology, I mean, I think that would be a next step in sort of technology meaning, we enhance broadband access. I mean, something more radical would be figuring out how to get everyone a smart phone. But those things are needed, before we get to the conversation of saying, everyone has equal access to a digitized marketplace. </p><p>And so, the first step is, of course, bank accounts and probably bridging the gap between cash to the digital economy which, again, is like a debit card access. And so, if they have bank accounts, they have debit card access, you're allowing them to transact in cash and then, transition into the digital market. </p><p>And once we have that in place then, build up the infrastructure with broadband and mobile phone access. Then, we can properly transition them to a digital economy. But we have to get them on board, first. </p><p>CORTEZ MASTO: Yeah, and I agree. I see it in my state. We have rural communities in my state, who are not connected. They cannot connect to the broadband, so, they are left out of services from healthcare to (INAUDIBLE). And now, as we move to utilize this technology and move in to 5G, we're going to leave them behind. </p><p>And we don't want to do that. There are too many that we have to bring along, right now. And there's things we could do, right now, and not study this further. So, I appreciate the discussion. And I notice my time is up. I'll submit the rest of my questions for the record. </p><p>Thank you, Mr. Chairman. </p><p>CRAPO: We have several other senators, who are signed in. but I don't believe they are actually here. I think they're at other hearings. Is there a senator who's not had an opportunity to ask questions, who is here on the digital link? </p><p>Okay, with that, Senator Brown has asked for another question. And actually, I will follow him with another question of my own. And then, that will wrap up the questioning. </p><p>Senator Brown. </p><p>BROWN: Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. This is for Professor Cuttino, again. Senator Tester mentioned that many rural communities and people without great access to internet wouldn't, necessarily, benefit from a central bank digital currency would. </p><p>But Professor, would offering access to the banking systems with post offices and rural banks, like I've proposed, help everyone benefit from a digital currency. </p><p>CUTTINO: Absolutely. That again goes to the point of bridging the gap between the cash and digital economy, those who don't have access to banks. </p><p>And everyone has access to a post office. There's one in just about every community, I think, without overstating that. I'm pretty sure everyone. </p><p>But the point there, again, is that we need access points that meet people where they are, today. The post office is one. ATMs are one. Their local bank branches are one. And then later, transition them to the digital market, once we build the infrastructure for them. </p><p>But yes, simply the proposal addresses the issue. </p><p>BROWN: Thank you. Mr. Giancarlo, would you agree this could help promote access to the benefits of a digital currency? </p><p>GIANCARLO: Well, Senator, I don't propose that a CBDC is a panacea for issues of financial under inclusion. Those are real issues. They're diverse issues. They affect different communities in different ways. And I don't propose a U.S. CBDC, as a full answer to all that. </p><p>I really view it as core architecture on which we then need to build systems to address that. Professor Christopher Brummer at Georgetown law School recently wrote a blog on how he thinks that, if we get it right, we can bridge both the concerns of those who are, primarily, focused on financial inclusion and those who are focused on core architecture, by using this new architecture on which to add services, such as a better system for identity, better systems for financial education, better approaches to credit scoring that we can build on this new architecture. </p><p>So, I propose the architecture, not as a full response to financial inclusion but as a basis to then build smart solutions for that. </p><p>BROWN: Well, thank you. And Mr. Giancarlo, thank you for your thoughtful approach with the digital dollar project and I think we have some, on your proposal and the one that Ms. Cuttino and I and others are interested in. I think we have some common ground. </p><p>Mr. Chairman, this has been an informative hearing. I'm thankful for that. We have, for years, on the banking housing committee, Senate Banking Housing Committee talked about the unbanked. </p><p>I remember in the years of the Obama Administration, we tried to make some progress. We really haven't done it very well in serving the under banked and the unbanked. And this is a real helpful hearing and I think, some significant first steps. </p><p>So, thank you, Mr. Chairman, for your work. </p><p>CRAPO: Thank you, Senator Brown. And you are right about that. And we need to move forward and make sure that, I think that this new technology and development has the capacity to help us achieve significant progress in that score. </p><p>But this has already been made clear here, that it also poses the problem if it's abused or not handled properly, it can simply continue, or even maybe even exacerbate the problem of the cost of financial services to those who are of limited income. </p><p>My last question is for you, Mr. Cascarilla. I believe it was in response to Senator Kennedy's question. But you've indicated that Paxos has a limited purpose trust charter from New York State Department of Financial Services and is subject to bank-like supervision for capital, liquidity, customer protection, cyber security and AML requirements. </p><p>My understanding is that most stablecoins or exchanges are registered with FinCEN as money services businesses and obtain money transmitter licenses from states to achieve the objective that you were talking about, about having something that works across borders in a federal union, like ours. </p><p>My question is, does MSB registration with FinCEN provide sufficient oversight for stablecoin networks with similar functionality, or would an even better solution than having them all go to one particular state department of financial services for regulation and then, trying to be sure that there's cross border recognition of that regulation, would a better solution be to create a new federal charter of some sort, a new federal system for digital currency? </p><p>CASCARILLA: Well, I think there's a couple of components to break down there. I think, firstly, we're very proud of having our trust company status in the state of New York. </p><p>And I think that the money, MSB, MTL regime is not an effective mechanism with which to regulate stablecoin issuers because, ultimately, you do not have a primary regulator. And having a primary regulator like we do, as a trust company, is very important because there's one person that oversees the issuance, oversees the way we operate, oversees how we deal with customers. </p><p>And so, I think that's very important. And of course, being this trust company is very, very safe because we don't use customer funds to fund our own business. </p><p>On the other hand, I think that, you know, trading the right type of portability at a state level is very important because it's very difficult as an innovative small company to go out and get all 50 state money transmission licenses. This is really a complex process and it's very expensive. And there's different regulatory regimes. </p><p>If there was a right type of portability, like an E-money license in the EU, I think that could be very effective. I think having a FinTech charter that the OCC has talked about is another tool in the tool kit. There's different ways to accomplish this but I think the key point is, how can we make it so that innovation and innovators in one state are able to operate in all states, without having to spend an enormous amount of time trying to manage different regulatory regimes. </p><p>CRAPO: Thank you. And Mr. Giancarlo, or Ms. Cuttino, do either of you wish to respond on that? </p><p>GIANCARLO: I don't think I could say it any better than Mr. Cascarilla did. So, I'll defer to my colleague, Ms. Cuttino. </p><p>CRAPO: Alright thank you. Alright then, that concludes our testimony, today. I again want to thank all of our witnesses. </p><p>This is a critically important issue. And we, as I said at the outset, we being the United States, need to stay n the global leadership in this arena. And your testimony is very helpful to us. </p><p>We're going to, I know, be working closely with you and other experts to make sure we get this right and develop the right approaches, in the United States. </p><p>For senators who wish to submit questions for the record, those questions are due on Tuesday, July 7. And I ask each of our witnesses, if you get additional questions from our senators, if you would respond, please, as quickly as you can. We really do appreciate the information and advice and counsel and expertise that you bring to us on this complex but critically important issue. </p><p>Again, I want to thank you all for making your time available and your efforts available to work with us on today's hearing. </p><p>And with that, the hearing is adjourned. </p></bodyText></section></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">POLTRN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:608G-1CV1-F15W-H159-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">147909</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><publicationInfo><publicationName>CQ Transcriptions</publicationName><bodyText><p>All materials herein are protected by United States copyright law and may not be reproduced, distributed, transmitted, displayed, published or broadcast without the prior written permission of CQ Transcriptions.

KYRSTEN SINEMA (D-ARIZ.) </p><p>[*]CRAPO: The committee will come to order. Today the committee will turn its focus to facilitating faster payments in the United States. Faster payments are important and yield economic benefits for both consumers and businesses by providing them with greater flexibility when managing money and making time sensitive payments on demand. Real-time payments offer efficiency and convenience helping consumers to better manage their spending and avoid unnecessary fees and penalties and helping businesses pay for goods and avoid other costly sources of funding.  </p><p>Unfortunately, the U.S. has lagged behind other countries in the development of real-time faster payments for retail. Recognizing this short coming in 2015, the Federal Reserve organized a Faster Payments Task Force made up of a diverse group of stakeholders to encourage the development of a real-time payment system in the United States. The Fed stated in its report on strategies for improving the U.S. payment system that it would not consider expanding its service provider role unless it determines that doing so is necessary to bring about significant improvements to the payment system and that actions of the private sector alone will not achieve the desired outcomes for speed, efficiency, and safety in a timely manner.  </p><p>Responding to the mission of the Faster Payments Task Force, The Clearing House announced in 2016 its intent to launch a real-time payment system, which it officially launched in November 2017. Just prior to The Clearing House launching that system, the Faster Payments Task Force in July of 2017 issued a final report, which offered several recommendations for achieving a safe, ubiquitous, and efficient faster payment system in the United States.  </p><p>One of these recommendations was for the Federal Reserve to develop its own 24/7 by 365 real-time gross settlement system for retail payments and to assess whether there were other operational roles the Fed should play in faster payments. After determining the Federal Reserve Banks should develop a new real-time gross settlement service. On August 2, 2019, the Federal Reserve Board voted on the Fed's proposal. The lone dissenter was vice chairman for supervision Randy Quarles.  </p><p>The Federal Reserve then issued a notice and request for comment on the Federal Reserve actions to support interbank settlement of faster payments, a system referred to as FedNow. In Vice Chairman Quarles's dissent, he noted that the U.S. private sector has a long history of providing efficient payment solutions to consumers and businesses. He added that the public sector should provide its own capacity only when the evidence of market failure is clear and alternative means to achieve public goals are not feasible. He added that he does not see a strong justification for the Federal Reserve to move into this area and crowd out innovation when viable private sector alternatives are available.  </p><p>Additionally, when providing a new payment service, the Federal Reserve is required to meet certain obligations and criteria before moving forward. Those criteria are the Federal Reserve must expect that it's providing the service will yield a clear public benefit. The service should be one that other providers alone cannot be expected to provide with reasonable effectiveness, scope, and equity. And the Federal Reserve must expect to achieve full recovery of costs over the long run. Throughout the Fed's process, some financial institutions have raised concerns about the Fed's analysis and its process, the cost, and amount of time it would take to develop its own real-time payment system. Its prospects for achieving interoperability, inherent conflicts of the Fed operating its own system and prospects for negatively affecting existing real-time payment systems.  </p><p>Still, other financial institutions urged the Fed to move forward due to their concerns surrounding pricing, power and competition in the marketplace. I strongly support better, safer, and faster payments in the U.S. including the work already done on existing solutions in the private market. </p><p>I look forward to learning more about the numerous issues during this hearing, including clear demonstration of the market failure or problem that the Fed believes it must solve through the development of its own real-time payment system, how the real--how the existing real-time payments platform works, how it has been impacted by the Fed so far, and the consequences of the Fed developing a competing system and how the Fed believes its proposed system could achieve interoperability, minimize negative effort effects to existing private sector participants and fully recover its costs quickly.  </p><p>I look forward to hearing from each of you on your views on these payments in the U.S. and more about the existing proposed platforms. </p><p>Senator Brown.   </p><p>BROWN: Thanks, chairman. Thank you to the a very distinguished panel with us today.  </p><p>Whether it's Facebook thinking it can run its own currency or big banks wanting a monopoly over our payment system. We can't allow corporations to take over critical public infrastructure, so they can squeeze more profits out of working families. Whether you punch a clock or swipe a badge, every working American knows how important payday is. It's often the day you know you can pay your bills and make rent but sometimes payday doesn't line up with the day your bills are due. That means a delay in paying the bills banks will pile in late fees and overdraft charges, so it's even harder for people to make ends meet.  </p><p>Recently, the Federal Reserve Board announced it will develop a system to provide payments in real-time. This is great news for millions of Americans who live paycheck to paycheck. For anyone who's waited for a check to clear or had to resort to a payday lender on Friday to tide them over until Monday. Faster payments allow Americans to actually use more of the money they've already earned.  </p><p>But while some of us see a problem to solve for working families, the biggest Wall Street and foreign banks see opportunity. They see what they always do and that's dollar signs. They see another way to squeeze more profits out of the rest of us. That's why they don't want the Fed to be involved. They built their own real-time payment system on top of existing Federal Reserve infrastructure. We really don't know how it's governed, how much it will cost, how they plan to skim more profits off the top.  </p><p>We can't trust the big banks won't charge more to community banks and credit unions. They've already they've already changed their mind on their prices once. They're--there's no guarantee they won't change their minds again. Big Banks oppose the Fed's effort because they want to be the only game in town. We know what happens when we trust Wall Street. Eleven years ago this month, Lehman Brothers failed sparking the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.  </p><p>Many of the big banks now asking for this monopoly over the real-time payment system. The same Wall Street banks that wrecked our financial system and came begging for billions of dollars in taxpayer money to save them. They haven't exactly cleaned up their act. These same banks like Wells Fargo, Bank of America, and the president's favorite Deutsche Bank, have been involved in scandal after scandal creating fake accounts for customers, illegally foreclosing on service members--service members' homes, violating U.S. sanction laws on and on and on.  </p><p>Seems like there's a new scandal every day. Capital One just suffered a huge data breach exposing millions of customers personal data. Remember those overdraft fees and late fees and transfer fees that we're trying to protect workers from? It's these same big banks that slap on these fees, they create the problem now they want to charge people to solve it. To make matters worse, the administration is rolling back the safeguards that we put in place to protect working families from the risky Wall Street activities that crashed our economy.  </p><p>It was another financial crisis over 100 years ago that led us to create the Federal Reserve to clear payments and govern our currency. Congress recognized the high fees and abuses going on in our payment system and understood that we needed a publicly run--a publicly run central bank to provide financial stability and fair access to the payment system. In the words of Representative Glass later to be the Senator Glass of Glass-Steagall, they sought to tear down these toll gates upon the highways of commerce.  </p><p>That's how we should think about the payment system as the highways of commerce that support every dollar that fuels our economy just like roads and Bridges. The payment system is critical public infrastructure, something that everyone--everyone should be able to use. We can't let profit motivated big banks, banks whose mission is to serve shareholders not ordinary Americans. We can't let them have a monopoly over it.  </p><p>This committee's heard a lot this year about big corporations taking advantage of us through the smoke screen of new technology and innovation. In our data privacy hearings, we heard about big tech companies and financial firms manipulating us into sharing our personal data so they can profit. In our hearing, Facebook dodged are questions about its plan to run its own digital currency out of a Swiss bank account. Showing yet again, that we can't trust them.  </p><p>We can't allow big corporations to take over critical public infrastructure. You would think we should know that by now. The largest banks and tech companies are not asking in the--acting in the interests of working Americans. Their interests is to turn a profit for themselves and their investors. I understand that.  </p><p>But the Fed's interest is not to make a profit. It's to make sure everyone, that all people can pay their bills on time and transfer money when they need it. Whether they live in rural America or in a metro area. The Fed's real-time payment system will benefit working families, and small banks, and credit union, small businesses, the public as a whole. Everyone, except Wall Street agrees. </p><p>Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  </p><p>CRAPO: Thank you, Senator Brown.  </p><p>Today's witnesses are Ms. Esther George, president and chief executive officer of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas. Mr. Robert Hunter, executive managing director and deputy general counsel of The Clearing House. Mr. Bob Steen, president and chief executive officer, of Bridge Community Bank on behalf of the Independent Community Bankers of America. Mr. George Selgin, senior fellow and director of Cato Institute. And the Honorable Sheila Bair, former chair of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.  </p><p>Again, I want to thank all of our witnesses for being here and sharing with us your expertise today. Your written testimony has been entered into the record, we will take your testimony in the order I introduced you. And you may start, Ms. George. </p><p>GEORGE: Chairman Crapo, Ranking Member Brown, and members of the committee, thank you for this opportunity. Chair Powell has asked me to speak to you today in my role as the Federal Reserve Bank leader responsible for our Payments Improvement Initiative since its beginning and as chair of the Financial Services Policy Committee, which oversees the provision of payment services, to depository institutions and the United States Treasury by the 12 Federal Reserve Banks.  </p><p>I'm pleased to offer my statement for the record as well as an in-depth statement on the role of the Federal Reserve in the payment system. And the recently announced proposal to support faster payments through the development of a new service called the FedNow service. Since the Federal Reserve's founding more than a century ago. It has provided payment and settlement services as part of its core function of promoting an accessible, safe, and efficient payment system.  </p><p>Today, the Federal Reserve is continuing this important operational role in preparing to support the modernization of our nation's payment system with capabilities that allow payments to move quickly through a safe and efficient foundation. On top of which innovation and competition can flourish. This decision was made only after three criteria were met. The first of these criteria is that other providers alone cannot be expected to provide the service with reasonable effectiveness, scope, and equity. of notable importance related to this criterion is the Federal Reserve's ability to connect to more than 10,000 financial institutions.  </p><p>Through these connections, our existing payment services allow banks of every size to serve the needs of thousands of communities across the United States with competitive, fair, and transparent access. Providing comprehensive nationwide reach is something that we believe will present significant challenges to other providers in the current market landscape. Coming from a region of the country with a significant number of small community banks serving rural areas of the central United States, I can tell you the Board's decision to provide this new service has been very well received.  </p><p>The second criterion is that there will be a clear public benefit including promoting the integrity of the payment system and reducing payment system risk. The Federal Reserve must continue to play an important role in promoting the safety of the U.S. payment system by providing liquidity and operational continuity in response to financial turmoil, terrorist attacks, natural disasters, and another crisis.  </p><p>The FedNow service will allow the Federal Reserve to retain its ability to provide stability and support to the banking system, as well as promote the development and implementation of industry-wide fraud mitigation standards. Development of the service will also enhance safety of the U.S. payment system by promoting resiliency through redundancy.  </p><p>The third and final criterion is that the Fed be able to fully recover its cost over the long run. The U.S. payments infrastructure today includes alternative payment choices and providers. The Federal Reserve and The Clearing House currently operate competing and interoperable services, which bring important benefits for resiliency and competition. In all of our services, we have been able to meet the requirements of the Monetary Control Act for cost recovery that ensures competitive fairness while fulfilling our public policy goals. We fully expect this will be the case with the FedNow service.  </p><p>As was explained in the 2016 GAO study, the Federal Reserve's role as an operator has long been judged as effective in promoting accessibility, safety, and efficiency for the nation's payment system and its customers. Last summer, the U.S. Treasury recommended that the Federal Reserve move quickly to facilitate a faster retail payment system. We are engaging now with stakeholders for their input on features of the FedNow service through the federal register notice issued last month. And I'm confident that together we can achieve our public policy objectives for broadly accessible, safe, and efficient faster payments.  </p><p>Thank you. I'm happy to respond to your questions. </p><p>CRAPO: Thank you, Mr. Hunter. </p><p>HUNTER: Chairman Crapo, Ranking Member Brown, and distinguished members of the committee. My name is Rob Hunter, and I'm the Deputy General Counsel of The Clearing House based in our North Carolina facility. I've worked at The Clearing House for more than 10 years providing senior legal report to our payment systems, including our focus today the RTP network, which I was privileged to be involved in developing.  </p><p>I'm also the past chair of the subcommittee on electronic payments of the American Bar Association and have been involved in payments throughout my career. The RTP network is a new and exciting part of our national payment infrastructure. It was launched in 2017 by The Clearing House, is fully operational, and today reaches over 50 percent of the transaction accounts in the U.S. One of the most distinguishing features of the RTP network is that it operates in real-time and all the time. There are no bankers hours, it functions 24/7.  </p><p>The RTP network also delivers on the vision of faster, more efficient and more secure payments that will benefit every American consumer and business. This innovation is consistent with The Clearing Houses long history of providing core payments infrastructure that is efficient, safe, and reliable. Founded in 1853, for over a century and a half, The Clearing House has served as the leading private sector operator of payments infrastructure in the United States.  </p><p>On an average business day, The Clearing House clears and settles nearly $2 trillion over its wire transfer, automated clearing house and check clearing networks. Created to provide the payment services required by the nation's economy, The Clearing House exists to serve depository institutions of all sizes. In fact, more than 80 percent of the participants in our ACH and check clearing services are institutions under $10 billion in assets.  </p><p>The Clearing House prices its services on a cost recovery basis and there is no special pricing for owner banks. The Clearing House also has a remarkable history of operational resiliency, clearing and settling payments every day without fail through World Wars, financial crises, and natural and man-made disasters including 9/11 and the Great Recession.  </p><p>This morning, I'd like to briefly focus on the committee's request that I described the RTP network and in doing so will focus on the Fed's faster payments task force as well as touch on FedNow. My written comments expand on these topics as well as other questions posed in your invitation letter. The payments landscape in the United States is highly competitive. Although there has been tremendous innovation in end user products during the last decade. What has been lacking is modernization of what we often refer to as the payments rails that undergird the system.  </p><p>The Federal Reserve recognized the need for faster payments, used its convening power to urge the private sector to make real-time payments a reality and established a Faster Payments Task Force. Not only did the industry respond by designing, building, and bringing to market the RTP network, investing over a billion dollars to do so. But according to the ratings it received from the task force, it did so extremely well. Of the 16 different private sector proposals submitted to the task force, the RTP network was rated the highest including in such key areas as accessibility and path to ubiquity or nationwide reach.  </p><p>As I speak to you today, the RTP network is operating, delivering the real-time capabilities that Americans want and need. Payment recipients receive final good funds immediately and payments senders receive real-time confirmation that the funds have been received. The benefits to consumers, small businesses, and the nation's economy are transformational. The committee has requested our views on the Feds decision to enter the real-time payments market. As provided in my written testimony, The Clearing House is concerned that the Feds actions may hinder The Clearing House and achieving the full potential of the RTP network.  </p><p>When the Fed competes with the private sector, it must do so in a manner that minimizes the competitive advantages that a government system would have both inherently and as a direct byproduct of the Fed's role as supervisor, the supplier of liquidity the financial system, and the central bank. This is not the--the usual competitive question of impact on profitability because The Clearing House does not seek to operate at a profit, rather it is question of The Clearing House's ability to provide the most effective and efficient real-time payment system to consumers and businesses to the ultimate benefit of the overall economy.  </p><p>To help The Clearing House achieve this objective, we believe there are several actions that Fed--the Fed could take now before launching its FedNow service that would help to create competitive equality between the private sector and the government. These are detailed in my written statement. In conclusion, The Clearing House RTP network is the most advanced payment system in the world. And we are working hard to extend its benefits to banks and credit unions of all sizes so consumers and businesses across America can realize the benefits of faster, more efficient, and more secure real-time payments.  </p><p>We appreciate your interest in this topic, and I look forward to answering your questions. </p><p>CRAPO: Thank you. Mr. Steen. </p><p>STEEN: Chairman Crapo, Ranking Member Brown, members of the Committee, I'm Bob Steen, chairman and CEO of Bridge Community Bank in Melbourne in Iowa. I testify today on behalf of the independent community bankers of America where I've played an active role over the years, including service on the payment committee. Thank you for the opportunity to testify today.  </p><p>I believe it is imperative that the U.S. develop a robust real-time payment system to meet consumer and business demand and stay competitive with the rest of the world. The system must create access for customers of all financial institutions and regardless of size in every American community.  </p><p>How we achieve this goal is critical. A real-time payment system is too important to be entrusted to a private monopoly. The two dozen largest banks simply cannot own and operate the U.S. payment system. ICBA strongly supports the Federal Reserve's decision to build FedNow, a real-time payment system that will give direct access to all financial institutions and their customers.  </p><p>Bridge Community Bank is a $96 million Community Bank founded in 1903 and is owned by our 20 employees. We serve rural communities and growth markets in and around Cedar Rapids, Iowa City with small business, agriculture, and consumer banking. Our business model is relationship banking, which we serve the totality of a family's business and personal banking needs both deposits and lending.  </p><p>The transaction account is the key to the customer relationship. And it is at the heart of community banking. We've long recognized that the payment innovation is critical to the long-term prosperity and independence of our bank and community banking. This is why I've invested so much of my career in payments innovation and develop multiple payment projects in our small bank.  </p><p>Only the Fed can guarantee competition and choice. The U.S. does not need another closed loop payment system in which some financial institutions participate and others are excluded. All financial institutions and all customers must have access to real-time payments. Even those that live in small and rural communities exclusively served by community banks. I believe--firmly believe this simply cannot happen without the Fed's role in real-time settlement.  </p><p>The Fed is uniquely positioned to provide access to all 11,000 financial institutions because these--these institutions have access to settlement account and a service connection with the Fed. The Fed already operates a universally accessible check, ACH, and wire transfer service. If history is any guide, the Fed will maintain affordable as well as universal access to faster payments. The Fed offers a fair and affordable pricing structure today, even to the smallest of the small financial institutions like our small bank.  </p><p>The Fed is trusted among humanity banks. Each community bank has a relationship manager and the opportunity for direct access to the payment system. I know our representative's name. I know his cell number and he answers the phone. As a community bank, I know that I have direct and easy access to the Fed support services, even after our banking hours and I place a high volume on that access.  </p><p>As I stated at the outset, payments innovation offering customers what they want, when they want, it is critical to the prosperity and continued independence of our community banks. As a neutral real-time settlement network, FedNow will be critical in our ability to--to continue to innovate. For example, my bank in partnership with another community bank developed a mobile app called X-Check (SP), which allows a user to send money to anyone in the U.S. that has an account at any other financial institution with--without a payment application on the receiver's mobile device.  </p><p>Once FedNow is fully operational, X-Check will allow real-time transactions without being dependent on our core banking. That by itself is transformational. Once ubiquity is achieved through FedNow new use cases and opportunities for innovation will emerge. The Feds the entry into real-time payments as part of a natural evolution from its involvement in check clearing, ACH payments, and wire transfers. The Fed has strengthened the payment system by providing safety, integrity choice, equitable access to all financial institutions. I'm confident the Fed will bring the same critical benefits to real-time payments.  </p><p>Thank you again for convening the hearing. And I will try to answer any questions. </p><p>CRAPO: Thank you. Mr. Selgin. </p><p>SELGIN: Thank you Chairman, Ranking Member Brown, and distinguished committee members. I'm the director of Cato's Center for Monetary and Financial Alternatives. But before I came to Cato, I was for 30 years an academic economist specializing in monetary and payments theory in history.  </p><p>The slow pace of payments in this country is a disgrace that's taking a large toll on U.S. citizens, and particularly on those who live paycheck to paycheck. So I very much appreciate this opportunity to address you and offer suggestions for helping to speed payments up in this country. I particularly want to discuss steps that Congress might take to assure that outcome.  </p><p>The Fed claims that the best way to solve the problem of expediting payments is for it to compete directly with existing retail payments networks and RTP, The Clearing House fast payment system, by establishing its own fast payment system, FedNow. And competition from the Fed certainly could help to promote faster payments. But it only will do so if the Fed competes on an even or level playing field with existing private sector service providers.  </p><p>However, the Fed enjoys many very special privileges that can allow it to slant the playing field in its favor. And when it does that, the outcome can be not a faster--not to facilitate the achievement of faster payments. But to hinder its achievement. I want to talk about several ways in which the Fed can slant the playing field in its favor that can harm progress toward faster payments.  </p><p>One of them is by failing to offer 24/7/365 interbank settlement services. You have all--you have heard--heard before and you heard from Senator Brown, how many persons live paycheck to paycheck and when their checks don't clear quickly or their payments don't clear quickly they may wait days in order for funds to be made available to them. And many resort to payday lenders for that reason.  </p><p>Real-time payments can of course help solve that problem real-time retail payment--payments but actually they're not necessary. Those workers would benefit just from having payments available on the same day that is having funds released on the same day. The problem they face isn't that their funds aren't released instantly, it's that they take several days sometimes to be released. Now why is that? It's not been because we don't have a real-time payment system. It's because the Feds own net settlement services Fedwire and the National Settlement Service don't operate on weekends, don't operate on holidays.  </p><p>Now the Fed has known about this problem and has talked about fixing it for years and NACHA has encouraged it to do so but it has been dragging its feet. And that means that it's making it harder for existing payment systems to compete effectively with it. I asked Congress to take the crucial step of making sure that the Fed fixes this problem. By the way, when it decided to launch FedNow it amazingly decided not to proceed with 24/7 settlement services on its existing networks. And there's no excuse for that because the support for that reform is unanimous.  </p><p>A second point in my written testimony, I talk about for concerns the pricing of settlement of payment services, faster payment services. You've all been told that the Fed needs to compete because it's worried that The Clearing House will abuse its monopoly. But in fact, the facts are otherwise. The Clearing House as it said, and I know this from studying its history doesn't charge in order to make profits. It's providing a service to its members through the payments facilities that administers for them. It doesn't pay dividends. And it's--this has been true throughout its history, it's verifiable.  </p><p>The problem is that the Fed can charge volume discounts and the ACH--sorry, TCH is planning to charge flat fees. Now why does the TCH want to allow itself to go to volume discounts if it needs to? It's because in competing with the Fed in ACH services, it found the Fed resorted to steep volume fees in the 90s. And it had to follow suit. The only reason it has a loophole in its pricing policy is that the Fed might resort to volume payments itself. Congress can prevent the Fed from doing that by making it make the same commitment to flat fees that are equitable to small banks as The Clearing House has made.  </p><p>I'll stop there. There's more in my testimony along the same lines. Thank you. </p><p>CRAPO: Thank you. Sheila. </p><p>BAIR: Mr. Chairman, members of the committee, thank you so much. It's been a while since I've been before this committee, it's nice to be back.  </p><p>I'm here in a personal capacity as someone who has spent most of my career in financial services most of that time as a regulator. And as you know, who led the FDIC during the financial crisis and I saw firsthand how concentrations of financial power and a handful of so-called too big to fail institutions almost ran our economy into a ditch and forced trillions of dollars in government support.  </p><p>To be sure mega banks are safer now, but I don't think they're safe enough. And post-crisis reforms have been untested so far. We don't know how well they're going to work. And even now, there's subject to unrelenting challenge by industry groups, including my--I might add TCH. The sector remains heavily concentrated over half of deposits are in the largest 15 institutions, nearly half of all assets are concentrated in the top five. Given the continued dominance of mega banks in our financial system, do we also really want to see to them control of the infrastructure supporting the next generation of payment services?  </p><p>You'll be hearing competing arguments today about whether FedNow will promote or hinder competition, whether it will foster inhibit innovation to meet demand for real-time payments, whether it will broaden access and equitable pricing or result in additional unnecessary costs. In evaluating these arguments, I hope we can all apply some basic common sense.  </p><p>Which kind of payment infrastructure is more likely to promote competition? A single system controlled by an entity that's owned by already dominant for-profit banks are one that is supported by two parallel systems. One of which is operated by a government agency whose mandate is to ensure equity and fairness and the provision of payment services. Which payments' infrastructure would better promote innovation? One dominated by a single monopoly or one resting on two systems from which financial institutions and their fintech partners can choose in offering their customer facing platforms and services.  </p><p>Which payments infrastructure is most likely to promote resiliency? One solely reliant on the stability and operational integrity of large banks? Payments would still operate with high-levels of leverage and have failed in the past and times of stress. Or one that can also rely on a system operated by government entity like the Fed with a proven track record of success in managing through the most distressed of economic conditions?  </p><p>And finally, which payments' infrastructure is most likely to achieve ubiquity and reach and access among all depository institutions, regardless of size or geographic location? One run by an organization whose owners are heavily located in East Coast urban areas? Or one which includes a second system like the Fed that has pre-existing trust relationships with virtually every depository institution in the country?  </p><p>Some have tried to portray the Fed is a bureaucratic heavy interfering with private sector innovations to provide real-time payments, motivated not by public interest but self-interest in preserving their power in the payment system. I frankly think that's nonsense. The truth is that the Fed has taken a major deliberative approach to whether they should build their own real-time interbank settlement system. They have waited for private sector, they've let the private sector try to innovate to make market demand for faster payments and indeed the U.S. has fallen behind.  </p><p>So while I congratulate TCH on developing the RTP system, the truth is it has not gained significant traction. And the overwhelming majority of public commenters who the Fed solicited, support the Fed building its own system. The Fed has worked hard to support TCH's efforts, it's not that the TCH's RTP system is going to go away. And they're committed to using a process and building FedNow that will incorporate the views of TCH and others and hopefully eventually achieve interoperability.  </p><p>But again, the Fed is determined based on a consensus that pretty much includes everyone other than the big banks, that their operational participation is required to ensure a next generation payment system that is ubiquitous, fair, inclusive, and resilient. We saw in 2008 what happens when a handful of very large institutions are allowed to dominate basic financial infrastructure. And I for one, never again want to see a gun placed against the head of taxpayers, bail the banks out or watch your economy go down.  </p><p>2008 was bad enough, I shudder to think if those same banks had sole control of our payment system of the future. When it comes to payments, infrastructure two is definitely better than one. I think the Fed is right to step in. And I hope that the Congress will support them.  </p><p>Thank you. </p><p>CRAPO: Thank you. I'm going to focus my questions on Ms. George and Mr. Hunter. And just ask you each to respond to the concerns that have been raised by those who are--are worried about your particular approach. For example, Ms. George, first, what do you say to those who say that the Fed has an unfair advantage and would actually operate from an unbalanced playing field in a way that would reduce the effectiveness of both payment systems? </p><p>GEORGE: So I would point to the Federal Reserve's history and operating payment services across a variety of rails. There has been no instance when the Federal Reserve has not operated alongside with the private sector and have been very transparent in meeting the requirements that we offer competitive and transparent pricing on our transactions. That history was confirmed with a GAO report, which looked at this very issue of what the Feds role has been, what has happened to innovation in the economy, consumer prices related to those payment services, and concluded that the Fed's role has been beneficial in operating in that space. So the history would support our intent, even with this new Fed service to continue in that tradition. </p><p>CRAPO: All right, thank you.  </p><p>And Mr. Hunter, what do you say to those who indicate that they don't understand why there would be a concern about having a--a competitive alternative in the payment system? </p><p>HUNTER: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  </p><p>We are not--we are not against competition in the payment system. But if there is going to be competition, the payment system between us and the Fed, we want to make sure that--that's a level playing field between the private sector and the government. There are two particular issues that the Fed could address to ensure that there is a level playing field between the private sector and the government.  </p><p>One is, was briefly touched upon by Mr. Selgin, the Fed is--has architected FedNow, what little we know about it to effectuate settlement through master accounts at the Federal Reserve, which--which only the Fed can--can offer. Those accounts count towards reserve balances and they bear interest. The Fed could accord this same treatment to the RTP account that we use for settlement that is sitting at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. So that's one issue.  </p><p>The other issue deals with the potential liquidity that's needed by the system on nights and weekends. The Federal Reserve has--has indicated that it's architecting its system so that the system itself will not enforce net debit caps on nights and weekends when the Fed--Federal Reserve Fedwire services is not available and NSS is not available. That can put banks in--in credit positions. It is an architecture that--that frankly, the Federal Reserve, under the requirements that we have for establishing the account, is not--not available to us. We wouldn't probably do it anyway because we consider it unsafe and unsound for banks to get into large credit positions or potentially large credit positions during times when Fedwire and NSS are not available.  </p><p>As Mr. Selgin noted the--the one recommendation that came out of the Faster Payments Task Force that was--that was unequivocal and upon which everyone agreed in the comment letter process was for the Fed to extend the operating hours for Fedwire and NSS. It is the single most important thing that the Fed can do to encourage private sector competition and we would urge the Fed to--to do that.  </p><p>In addition to that, we are committed to level pricing for banks of all sizes, we've made that commitment publicly, we understand the history of the ACH where we had a level pricing structure. But the Fed came in and offered steep volume discounts in order to try to lure banks away from The--The Clearing House's ACH service. That's the source of the caveat that we've made.  </p><p>And--and we've wanted to be transparent with the market and indicate that we are committed to a level pricing structure, whether you're the JPMorgan Chase or you're the little Bank of Oak Ridge, North Carolina where I live, you'll pay exactly the same. But I think we need a commitment from the Federal Reserve to engage in that same level pricing structure so that community banks and banks of all sizes can pay the same amount regardless of--of the service. </p><p>CRAPO: All right, thank you. Senator Brown. </p><p>BROWN: Thanks, Chairman.  </p><p>Mr.--Mr. Hunter, thank you for those last comments. Your website says The Clearing House is owned by 25, quote, \"of the world's largest commercial banks.\" As we all know, painfully 10 years ago, a lot of those banks needed to be rescued by taxpayers. You know, how much taxpayer money your member banks needed to stay afloat? </p><p>HUNTER: I--I do not, Ranking Member Brown. But I will tell you there is one sector of the economy that functioned of flawlessly throughout the financial crisis.  </p><p>BROWN: I--I (INAUDIBLE--) </p><p>HUNTER: (--INAUDIBLE) settlements-- </p><p>BROWN: --The answer's--the answer to my question is $194 billion. And to think that you then want a monopoly on the payment system is--just doesn't seem wise.  </p><p>President George, let me start with you. Thanks for your work on this question. Is part of the Fed's proposal specifically benefit The Clearing Houses real-time payment system? </p><p>GEORGE: At the start of our work on looking at faster payments, we were very interested in making sure the private sector was able to participate in this effort and created a special account that would allow for them to operate their real-time payment system. </p><p>BROWN: So logically then it's fair to say The Clearing House wants the Fed to support real-time payments but only in a way that helps their private payment systems owned by the--by the big banks. </p><p>GEORGE: We have worked alongside The Clearing House in many payment services and it would be unusual for us not to work alongside them. Even in this new rail. </p><p>BROWN: Okay, Ms. Bair--sorry, I missed the beginning your statement I heard people describe it behind me. I--I am--I'm in and out of--I apologize, I don't usually do this. But we're doing an Agent Orange and burn pit hearing that I asked Chairman Isaacson to hold and so I--I need to return but I--so I apologize.  </p><p>As FDIC chair during the crisis, you saw firsthand the big bank failures and the havoc they wreaked on our financial system and economy. How does the concentration of critical public infrastructure and that's what this is in the hands of the biggest banks pose a risk to our economy? What would happen to small banks? And what would happen to working families during a crisis if large banks controlled the payment system? </p><p>BAIR: Well, I think first of all, I'd like to say that if you count all government support, including FDIC debt guarantees and Fed lending, we're well into the tray and the taxpayer number is was--was one you cited but it was quite a massive-- </p><p>BROWN: --I was being conservative. </p><p>BAIR: Yes. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>Being very conservative.  </p><p>Look, I think you have centralization of risk, you have a single point of failure, you have operational risk with--with just having one system. You also have the--the system is backed by joint accounts which are funded by these large banks. So if the--one or more of the large banks could no longer fund into the joint account, we don't know what will happen. I think eventually, if there's a disruption to--if we have this monopoly payments provider, that--and there's a disruption, the Fed's going to have to come in anyway.  </p><p>And it will probably be a lot more--less efficient and costly and potentially disruptive for they have to take two or three steps to come into support and bailout the--the monopoly system that the large banks are running. So we need two systems. Nobody's saying that we shouldn't have RTP. That's fine. But we need two systems. And it's much more I think--you know the--the public confidence, the equity issues in terms of the Fed's willingness to work with all parties and be accessible and price fairly with all parties is also a significant policy benefit of having two systems. </p><p>BROWN: Okay, thank you.  </p><p>Mr. Steen, I thank you for being here. I--I admire the that you run an employee-owned bank, where workers have a stake in the company. Thank you for that. With increasing consolidation in the industry and the growing number of non-banks and fintechs engage in traditional banking, it seems to be harder--getting harder for community banks to compete. Why is the Fed's decision to operate a faster payment system so critical for community banks like--like yours, employee-owned, but obviously other community banks as part of the ICBA? </p><p>STEEN: Well, Senator, thank you.  </p><p>As I indicated in my statement, we--we believe that transaction accounts are the basic core relationship with our customers. And we believe we have to provide them the technology and the faster payment that they need. Many of our customers do need money sooner than they're getting it today. We provide availability early, as early as we possibly can on Thursday night. At midnight, they get their Friday pay. We do everything we can do to get them the money but we can make it better. And this--we believe FedNow will do that. </p><p>BROWN: Thank you to all--to all of you. </p><p>CRAPO: Thank you. Senator Moran. </p><p>MORAN: Mr. Chairman, thank you. Thank you for hosting this hearing, you and the ranking member. When you introduce Ms. George, you introduced her as the president and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas and I appreciate your thriftiness in-- </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>--in choice of words.  </p><p>And I also would like to pay tribute to Ms. Bair, a highly respected Kansan, a native and who is highly regarded, she had the benefit of working for a highly regarded senator, and I appreciate your work throughout your life.  </p><p>Let me start with Ms. George. Generally, I would say in Kansas, this proposal is popular with Kansas bankers. The interoperability is important in addition to prompt payment. And I want to see if you can assure me that whether a bank chooses FedNow or the RTP system to provide those faster payments, that their business will flow to any institution in either network.  </p><p>Today, both institutions run retail and wholesale payment services that are inoperable. Is the Fed committed and confident that it will be able to continue the same with these faster payments? </p><p>GEORGE: Senator Moran, having interoperability will be a desirable outcome of this effort. We are focused on gaining nationwide reach. We think it's important that every financial institution gain access to real-time payment services. And then we can begin as we designed the system to look at what the nature of interoperability will be. We are out now for comment asking for features and design and will be including interoperability and getting feedback on how that would work today relative to how it works with our other payment services.  </p><p>MORAN: Mr. Hunter, how do you see this issue? </p><p>HUNTER: Thank you, Senator. I appreciate the question.  </p><p>We do not envision that--that the systems will be interoperable. Real-time payments are--are fundamentally different in terms of how they work than the ACH or the wire transfer system. And if--if you look at Europe, for example, where the central bank came out with its own real-time payment system, it is not interoperable with TIPS, which is the private sector's real-time payment system.  </p><p>In real-time payment system clearing which is the transmission of the payment message happens alongside settlement. They--they are not bifurcated at all. They happen at the same time and they happen instantaneously. So from the time I hit send to send you money, Senator Moran, to the time that money is in your account and you've got access to it is literally milliseconds. Because of that architecture, which is architected in the way that the Federal Reserve's Faster Payments Task Force sort of set out the criteria, it wanted a real-time payment system, you can't bifurcate those processes.  </p><p>So it's not like the ACH, which is interoperable for transmission of the message only. But settlement happens at a later time because clearing and settlement transmission of the message and final payment happened immediately. Those two things aren't separated. And you can't interoperate in that regard. Both--both the sending bank and the receiving bank have to be on the same system. They have to be able to talk to each other instantaneously. And they have to work in such a way that those funds are transferred and available immediately. So we are not optimistic that these two systems will be interoperable. </p><p>MORAN: Thank you for your--your comments.  </p><p>Again, Ms. George, Mr. Selgin's comments about holidays, weekends, and 24/7 caught my attention. What is the Fed response in that regard? </p><p>GEORGE: So a real-time payment system will be operating 24/7 by 365 and that will include holidays and weekend. The question that Mr. Selgin raised is one of how expanding hours for Funds Transfer might facilitate the private sector service in providing real-time payments. Because that is a systemically important system, we will have to look and do the operational analysis on what it means to provide that kind of real-time expanded hours. And we have committed to do that in the public notice that we've put out to see what issues that raises, recognizing that there would be benefits to the private solution. </p><p>MORAN: Mr. Hunter, let me return to you quickly. I think the RTP system has been up and running for about a year and a half. What benefits are consumers and businesses seeing as a result of that? And what can we expect in the future those benefits to then be?  </p><p>HUNTER: Thank you, Senator.  </p><p>Let me start with--with consumers first and then go to businesses. For consumers it--it really fundamentally is a safer, more efficient way to--to make payments. From the sender's side, they--they can get immediate--immediate confirmation that the recipient of that payment actually has the funds. So think about if you're paying your power bill and you're late and you want to make sure that payment gets there today, you've got immediate confirmation that you've been able to do so.  </p><p>We also have extensive rules in place so that consumers who use alias, so if you type in a--a phone number or you're using a directory of some kind, the consumer gets confirmation of the real name. So if somebody types in or fat fingers my email address, they're going to get a message back that says, \"Do you want to send that payment to Rob Smith?\" It's \"Well, no. I didn't.\"  </p><p>So--so very, very important in terms of folks who are being paid and have to go to payday lenders or check-cashing services. If--if their employers are using the RTP system to make payment, they'll have immediate access to the--those funds, they won't have to--to go to those services anymore.  </p><p>On the business side, also incredibly transformational, they can get payments into the hands of a supplier, for example, for real-time inventory. They don't have to rely on credit anymore. And that supplier can ship those goods with confidence that they've been paid. They can attach just about anything that you can send over the internet, an invoice, a picture showing that work's been done.  </p><p>So if you're a plumber and--and you want to convince your--your customer that hey, I've installed this faucet and it works, here's the video, here's the--here's the photo. If you attach the invoice to the what's called a request for payment, you--you can automatically associate that payment with the invoice and you don't have to do reconciliation on--on--on the back end. </p><p>MORAN: Thank you. My time's expired. I will ask some other witnesses questions for the record. And I too need to join the ranking member and the Veterans Committee. I'll try to return--to return, Mr.--Mr. President--Mr. Chairman. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>CRAPO: Thank you. Senator Jones. </p><p>JONES: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you for our panelists to be here. Ms. George, I'd--I'd kind of like to focus a question here on--on timing. Frankly, it's a little embarrassing, I think that we're so far behind. And the Fed's payment obviously is going to be a complicated, really technical endeavor. And I believe your deadline is like 2024, which is, in technological terms, seemingly a lifetime away. It's only short if you're planning on one of the legions who are running for president and you're already making your plans.  </p><p>What are you going to do? What is the Fed going to do to--you know, have benchmarks? Do you have benchmarks already in place that you're going to be setting that you're also going to deliver to Congress to keep us apprised of what's going on between 2024 to make sure that you're on track? Do you have those? </p><p>GEORGE: So we are beginning now to define what the features and design of the system is, which will guide our delivery times. And we do intend to be very transparent with how that plan comes together, making available to the public our intentions and we will certainly be coming back with future public comment as we design that system. And that will include our delivery and planned implementation.  </p><p>JONES: I take it that you really don't--and I'm not being critical. But the benchmarks haven't been set yet. You haven't set that timeline just yet. But you plan on doing that sometime after the comments within the next--what, six months maybe? </p><p>GEORGE: We're working on that immediately. So-- </p><p>JONES: --Okay.-- </p><p>GEORGE: --we're beginning that phase even now. And as those comments--as the comment period ends in November, we will be compiling the input that we get from the industry on how that system should look that will inform our delivery. </p><p>JONES: All right, fine. Thank you. For the panel, anybody that can answer this, we--we've obviously seen these kind of payment systems in other countries that have been up and running and they've--there's been the good, the bad, the ugly seen with these. What lessons are we learning from examining those? What--what lessons are we taking that we can incorporate? What lessons are we learning where mistakes are made? Mistakes that we want to avoid? And now I'll--I'll just kind of open that up to the--to the panel. </p><p>GEORGE: So I'd be happy to start that core to this work we've been doing has been looking at what other countries have done and their experiences. And we have learned from those. One thing that makes it challenging to compare for us is we have a very complex and diverse financial system. Some countries have a smaller number of institutions and so the issues have varied. I think one thing we have taken away from is the importance of getting input from the financial institutions themselves to understand their ability to adopt the technology to connect to it. And to think about security around that. And those have been two areas of our focus throughout this work. </p><p>JONES: Okay. Mr. Hunter? </p><p>HUNTER: Yes, Senator. So we've--we've had extensive dialogue with the payment system operators of real-time payments around--around the globe. One of the--excuse me, one of the benefits of--of coming late to the market actually is the ability to--to learn from other countries and--and their experience. Our--the design and operation of our payment system is--is absolutely informed by lessons learned around--around the globe.  </p><p>One of the things that you'll see in our payment system is that it's a credit push system only. And let me explain what--what that means. There--there are no debit--debit polls. So if somebody gets a hold of your account credentials, sometimes they can try to defeat bank fraud systems and draw money out of your account. With the RTP system, the only way that you can send a payment is you have to authenticate into your banking platform. And you have to affirmatively tell the bank, once you've been authenticated by the bank, that you want to push money out to somebody else. So nobody can pull money out of your account.  </p><p>We've incorporated what's called ISO 20022 messaging. That's a little bit technical. But it's a--it's a global messaging standard that at some point in time in the future if we want to make--you know, connect to these real-time payment systems around the globe, it's a messaging standard that--that allows us to--to try to do that. Also, the way that we settle in terms of the settlement account that we use at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and the pre-funding of that account eliminates credit risk from any institution.  </p><p>So to Ms. Bair's point, if an institution fails to fund that account, their payments don't flow, there is absolutely no credit risk to the system or any other financial institution as the result of the failure of any bank. </p><p>JONES: All right. Anybody else want to take a shot at that or respond? </p><p>STEEN: I would just use an example of our small bank. We have leveraged a real-time payment over the Spain network in Mexico so I would--where a family member could arrange for a payment in Mexico, from--from having lunch in Solon, Iowa from a mobile device to an ATM withdrawal in real-time in--so we were--so we learned that things are possible. And those funds are pre-funded in Mexico. So there's no credit risk. But it would be much better if we could link up our--our real-time capability on this side of the border.  </p><p>JONES: Yes, sir.  </p><p>SELGIN: Yes, the British system which is often treated as a model of a--of a early fast payment system offers an interesting example of the challenges involved when you don't have central bank settlement services that are working on weekends. And here, that's a challenge for real-time payments.  </p><p>What that means is that they can have transactions real-time all weekend but they don't actually finally settle up until the--the CHAP system which is their equivalent to Fedwire is open again on Monday. Now that means that banks that are releasing funds, funds are made available instantly. But there's credit risk assumed. The way they solve that problem in England is through something called the liquidity and loan--pardon me, liquidity and loan sharing agreement. And all the banks contribute to a collateral, to a fund so that if any bank were to fail over the weekend, there's this fund that they can draw on.  </p><p>In the U.S. you couldn't do that with all the banks involved. You couldn't possibly get them all on an agreement like this. And that's a reason why 24/7 settlement on Fedwire really is important to avoid risk. In our case, what the Fed would do, if it doesn't have those facilities for Fedwire with its FedNow system, it would incur the risk, which means we would incur the risk of these overdrafts that essentially would be taking place sometimes for long weekends.  </p><p>CRAPO: All right. Thank you. Senator Toomey. </p><p>TOOMEY: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you to the witnesses.  </p><p>I just want to try to see if we get some a little bit more clarity about something that's come up. Mr. Hunter, my understanding is that the RTP has made an explicit commitment to provide flat fees on the transactions. As I understand it that means regardless of the size of the transaction, the volume of the transaction, the size of the institution, all transactions would be treated the same with one caveat. And that caveat is if the Fed operates a parallel system and starts to offer a discriminatory pricing structure that the RTP may have to move in that direction under that. Is that about right? </p><p>HUNTER: That--that--that's correct, Senator. </p><p>TOOMEY: Okay.  </p><p>HUNTER: It's similar to what happened in the ACH. </p><p>TOOMEY: Okay, so Ms. George, let me ask you a question. Has the Fed made an explicit commitment that its system will guarantee to offer only a flat fee payment of fee structure? </p><p>GEORGE: We are in the process of designing the system. We have not identified the pricing that will be associated with it. Although once we do, we will make that public when that's decided. I would just say on the issue of pricing, volume pricing is common in the marketplace today. And it is often a way to take high-fixed cost and make sure that you were able to maintain-- </p><p>TOOMEY: --So-- </p><p>GEORGE: --the adequacy of a system. And that pricing today has allowed for market share to expand with private sector operators and has been viewed as being a fair pricing structure through numerous reviews. </p><p>TOOMEY: Thanks so but this is very interesting because what we have is the existing system is committing to not introducing a discriminatory pricing mechanism. The Fed is not making that commitment at this point. In fact, our representative from the Fed is observing that sometimes there are benefits in having pricing discrimination, which I acknowledge that can--that's entirely possible.  </p><p>But for those who are concerned about which of these two is going to have discriminatory pricing, it's a little bit ironic. It's the RTP that is committed not to doing so.  </p><p>Another concern that I have is interoperability. Mr. Hunter, I'm going to give an example that I think of and--and maybe I've got this wrong, so maybe you could help me make it be clearer. Let's say an Allentown manufacturer has 1,000 employees and they're scattered around the country. They inevitably have different banks that they use for their personal banking. The Allentown manufacturer has a bank that they use to process their payroll and the Allentown manufacturer would like to be able to deliver payroll in real-time so that their employees get the money instantaneously when it's available.  </p><p>If some of the employees use banks that are part of a Fed system, while the Allentown manufacturer has a bank that's plugged into the RPT system and the two systems are not interoperable, is it still possible for everybody to get their paycheck in real-time, on time? Is a system or--or does that create a problem? </p><p>HUNTER: So it's--it's certainly not easy, Senator. What--what the manufacturer would have to do is they would have to work through to two--two different banks that would have to form it and it would have to format that payroll according to the specifications of--of either system. So it we'll have to work through a FedNow bank to reach the endpoints on FedNow and--and their customers and it will have to work through an RTP Bank to reach the endpoints on--on that system, those banks, and--and their customers. So it creates a lot of inefficiency and probably added expense. </p><p>TOOMEY: The added cost, added inefficiency to have a second bank playing this role.  </p><p>One of the things I hear from time to time is that the RTP has not achieved ubiquity yet. With the likelihood that there will be a Fed run alternative in the not too distant future. Could that be contributing to the reason that some banks are holding back and participating with the RTP system? </p><p>HUNTER: So Senator, we certainly saw a chilling effect of the original Fed proposal which came out 11 months after we launched. So I think the--the initial reaction to that was we don't know what the Fed's going to be doing. We need to wait and figure--figure that out.  </p><p>Since the--the Fed has come out with the--the FedNow proposal and indicated that they won't be in the market for another four or five years, I think it's really sort of splitting the market. And--and it remains to be seen how financial institutions are going to react. There are certainly some financial institutions who have indicated that they don't feel that they can or should wait four or five years to bring the benefits of real-time payments to their customers. There are others who-- who may wait. </p><p>TOOMEY: One last quick question. This is for Mr. Selgin. </p><p>It was back in 2013, as I understand it that the Fed launched what they call the strategies for improving the U.S. payment systems and set up the Faster Payment Task Force. And effectively, the Fed, it seems to me was calling out the private sector to improve the payment infrastructure. The private sector responds, spends over a billion dollars on this project, more money individually to integrate with the system and went live in 2017. And then two years later, the Fed announces its kind of stand up a competitor.  </p><p>Given that sequence of events. Do you think that has a chilling effect on the private sector's willingness to invest in the future and innovation certainly in the payment space but perhaps in other spaces as well? </p><p>SELGIN: I should think so, Senator. Mr. Hunter can answer better than I can. But I can't see how it could have but a chilling effect. This--this effort by The Clearing House was undertaken entirely in response to that initiative. And with the Federal Reserve's blessing and ultimately with its complete approval of the scheme that--that The Clearing House had come up with. Then only after that and after the system was up and running, the Fed decided it was going to compete head-on in this same payment service.  </p><p>I want to add since it's relevant that the idea that what--what's happening with what The Clearing House is doing is taking over an infrastructure that belongs to the public sector, that's a complete misunderstanding of the history of payments in this country. The Clearing House is much older than the Federal Reserve. And in many countries, not just the United States, most payments services are provided by the private sector, many of them at least.  </p><p>Sometimes in combination with central banks but often alone, central banks have their specialty, which is providing cash and also the ultimate settlement services. And as I said earlier, the Fed's not doing that last job very well because it's limiting--after years of being asked to do otherwise, still limiting the availability of final settlement services. And by doing that, and this is extremely important, it is not the case that you need fast payments in the sense of instantaneous to solve the problem of it taking days for workers to have their checks clear, etc. That problem can be solved just by making the existing Fed settlement wholesale settlement systems 24/7/365.  </p><p>The plan that would solve that problem that the Fed is now pursuing, will take five years. That's all those people waiting for those checks to clear or those payments to clear for that long for at least that much--many years, except to the extent that they can turn to RTP. And that is--shouldn't be the case. That's a terrible dereliction of the Federal Reserve's duties to the public. </p><p>Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  </p><p>CRAPO: Senator Cortez Masto. </p><p>CORTEZ MASTO: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you all for being here this morning.  </p><p>President George, let me start with you. I want to follow up on the questions that Senator Brown had asked. Do you think it's important to consider the possibility that the Fed would have to bailout one or more of the TCH banks if they were the only real-time people system? </p><p>GEORGE: I think our experiences that we do not for the smooth functioning of the U.S. payment system want a single point of failure. And history has shown during times of stress that having the central bank as a provider of payments has served the country well. </p><p>CORTEZ MASTO: Okay. And so and as we talk about cost recovery because that's part of the conversation as well. And because of your concern, because you don't want that single point of failure, should that factor into the Fed's cost recovery estimate? </p><p>GEORGE: It will factor into any cost of our system is required under the Monetary Control Act to be fully recovered. And we intend to do that with FedNow. </p><p>CORTEZ MASTO: Thank you. And so Ms. Bair--Chair Bair, can--can you add your thoughts on the potential risk of a bailout in the conversation we're having today? </p><p>BAIR: Yeah, so I think as--as President George said, you have a single point of failure if you have just one system and payments is--is kind of important. You disrupt payments, you've got a catastrophic situation with--with commercial activity and--and consumer activity as well.  </p><p>It's not clarity the--the RTP system is untested. They've designed it to prevent credit risk, I give them that but they--they maintain a centralized ledger. And we've got to have confidence that centralized ledger will prevent negative balances in their joint account. We--and there, it is possible, like everybody acknowledges, it is possible for a large bank to lose the capacity to continue to fund the joint account. So maybe the other banks participating in the joint account are still okay.  </p><p>But my question is what happens to the customers of that bank that are using it? So I think there are a lot of unanswered question about how resilient it will be during a crisis. And so nobody's saying we shouldn't have RTP. Good, I'm glad we have our RTP but we should have another system too. Competition is always good. And the Fed is--is much better equipped to continue to function and its track record is such to operate in good times and bad under extremely stressed conditions.  </p><p>And if we just had this one system, if it does disrupt, the Fed's going to have to come in anyway, with a much messier and inefficient way of trying to stabilize the system again. </p><p>CORTEZ MASTO: Right. Thank you.  </p><p>While I have you here, we've been having conversations here in this committee on this issue. And Chair Bair, in your testimony, you urge the Fed to fully explore the use of digital currency-- </p><p>BAIR: --Right.-- </p><p>CORTEZ MASTO: --including cryptocurrency based on a distributed ledger technology and effectuating real-time settlement between banks. Why do you think the Fed should consider developing a central bank digital currency that could eventually be used by members of the public to transfer money directly between? </p><p>BAIR: Well, it's still maturing technology but it's maturing rapidly. And it is clear having a distributed ledger that all banks would have access to that you don't need an intermediary, you don't need a TCH, you don't need a centralized ledger. And that single point of failure the triggers the digital transfer is directly from one--the sending bank to the recipient bank. So yes, I think it needs to be explored is still maturing notice central banks have done it but a lot of other central banks are looking at and my hope that'll that is something that they will continue to explore, as they--as they build this system.  </p><p>It also helps address some of the interoperability issues that we've been discussing earlier. But I--I would like to just--you know, Mr. Hunter has insisted that RTP cannot be interoperable. And--and I would just note that--that kind of reinforces their monopoly position if his--if his view is--is that their system--real-time payment system and incompatible interoperability. An interoperability is a two-way street. And I would hope that TCH, would sit down with the Fed and try to agree on common standards and figure out a way these systems can most efficiently interact.  </p><p>If he wants to say, \"No, nobody else can play.\" Then--you know, if you don't have the Fed, then that just solidifies their monopoly position as a single provider of this crucial function. </p><p>CORTEZ MASTO: Thank you.  </p><p>And President George, to what extent is digital currency and the future of it being--are you considering that as you move forward with this payments? </p><p>GEORGE: I know reserve and other central banks are looking closely at how this evolving technology is affecting the financial system and will continue to do so.  </p><p>CORTEZ MASTO: Are you watching what's going on with Libra? </p><p>GEORGE: We are watching that also. So the--the full range from distributed ledger to digital currencies very much understudy as we see how those unfold. </p><p>CORTEZ MASTO: Thank you. Thank you all again for being here. </p><p>CRAPO: Thank you. Senator Tillis. </p><p>TILLIS: Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for holding this hearing. And thank you all for being here. Mr. Steen, I want to let you know that I joined with a group of Republicans and Democrats that recognize that small banks and community banks have regulatory burdens on that we thought were inappropriate. That's why we joined together against the objection of the ranking member of this committee to provide you all with regulatory relief, this may be an issue where you and I want the same ends but maybe achieve it through a different means. And that's really what I want to talk about. </p><p>Ms. Blair, you mentioned in your opening statement that this was a measured and deliberative approach to decide to come up with the payment system. I understand that a part of that was engaging an outside firm to try and figure out what's wrong with RTP and The Clearing House and that the conclusion that those outside consultants made was that most of its working right, some of it needed to be addressed. And so I'm wondering why we seem to be going with this alla prima approach versus trying to address some of the legitimate concerns Mr. Steen and other would have with using RTP.  </p><p>And Mr. Hunter, Ms. Blair also mentioned in her opening statements about the private sector approach could subject in future crisis subject us to a bailout. So under what scenario would--would The Clearing House or RTP be--be in a position to where it would need to get a--I understand the investment. I know the banks that that stood this up and understand them. But I'm trying to understand, under what scenario? I understand that you perform very well, during the crisis. I don't think that you require to bailout. I don't think there were any outages. I do believe that Fedwire has experienced some outages and does have some resiliency challenges that they need to deal with and availability. But under what scenario would you actually be subject to a bailout request?  </p><p>HUNTER: Senator, there--there--there is no circumstance where we would be subject to a bailout request. I mean, we--we have detailed processes in place to deal with banks that are on our systems that have been worked out with the FDIC for resolution of those banks. And Ms. Bair may not be aware of those given--given the--her position at the FDIC but we work very, very closely on bank resolutions and there is no risk to the system. They're architected in such a way that that just doesn't happen. So those circumstances, Senator, simply do not exist. </p><p>TILLIS: I had another--another question really going back to the measured and deliberative approach. It's my understanding--and Ms. George and Mr. Hunter, maybe you can illuminate but under the Bank Service Company Act of 1999, it provides fairly significant or broad authority. But for some reason, it appears as though the Fed does not think that it has the authority to engage with the private sector to engage with The Clearing House or RTP to address some of the concerns you may have maybe concerns Mr. Steen has.  </p><p>So why wouldn't a part of that deliberative approach be a discussion about expanding the regulatory parameters so that you could address those concerns with the private sector solution? And I'll start with you, Ms. George. </p><p>GEORGE: Thank you, Senator, the--the Board of Governors explored this issue and highlights it in the Federal Register notice that they believe those authorities were not adequate and clearly the Federal Reserve-- </p><p>TILLIS: --Okay, but why not a discussion about expanding the authorities to the extent that you could address what we're now thinking about a--a major undertaking that will take five to seven years. I'm a technology person. I think it's probably plus five, closer to seven and a lot of cost. So why wouldn't there have been a discussion of--if--if you've concluded that you do not have sufficient regulatory authority to come back and come to Congress and asked what they may be? </p><p>GEORGE: I think because our experience under our existing authorities of Congress of providing these services as an operator have been so effective throughout history, that it led us to rely on those existing authorities and provide the competition that has served the country well. And that was the conclusion I think that you see in the Board of Governor's analysis. </p><p>TILLIS: Mr. Hunter? </p><p>HUNTER: Senator, thank you for the question. The Federal Reserve, not only the Federal Reserve but frankly, the OCC and the FDIC have broad regulatory authority over The Clearing House. Basically, any regulatory authority they have over a bank that they supervise is the same regulatory authority that they have over The Clearing House. And I quote extensively from the Bank Service Company Act in my written testimony and I would direct you to those statements.  </p><p>But in addition into that, as--as--as Congress has enacted in this country, we have a--a detailed competition laws that we are subject to and the Federal Reserve is not but the private sector is subject to and the Department of Justice stands ready to enforce. So when you talk about anything related to pricing, or monopoly power or acting in an anti-competitive way, which the Federal Reserve speculates that the private sector could potentially do at some point in time. Those are illegal activities under the laws of this country. We have never engaged in those activities. But if we ever did or if any other private sector ever did, there are laws in this country that protect against that. </p><p>TILLIS: I have a--a number of questions. I too have to go to the Veterans Committee. This is very important to me because I think in some respects, I view the current Fed proposal as $100 saddle on a $10 horse. I think that there are some things that we may be able to do to address some of the concerns and make sure community banks are treated properly to avoid potential future discriminatory practices on pricing, resiliency questions, interoperability questions, the kinds of things that you're going to have to get into. So I will be submitting a number of questions for the record for you all and appreciate y'all being there. </p><p>CRAPO: Senator Van Hollen.  </p><p>VAN HOLLEN: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank all of you for your testimony today, moving as fast as possible to real-time payments has been a priority for mine. I've talked to lots of witnesses that have come before this committee on this matter because the lack of a real-time payment system is costing millions of Americans billions of dollars every year.  </p><p>So President George, I commend you for your leadership in this issue. I know it's an issue you have thought about a lot. And you've been very thoughtful in developing these proposals. I've listened to the testimony, a lot of ground has been covered. I do think the fundamental question gets down to this issue of competition. And I--I realized that the Clearing House says it welcomes competition on the one hand but on the other hand, all the testimony here today is let's not have a separate, FedNow system. And it seems to me that keeping that monopoly position in the hands of 15 biggest banks, is not necessarily in the long run, the best deal for consumers and a little competition is a good thing in my view.  </p><p>Mr. Steen, you represent lots of financial institutions. And you're obviously looking out for your consumers and your customers here. And you've expressed a real fear, in your testimony and earlier statements about handing over this kind of monopoly power to this kind of monopoly. And you--you actually raised before this hearing the same issue that Senator Toomey raised here, which is when the Fed said it might get into the space.  </p><p>The Clearing House then said, \"Well--you know, we made this promise about not engaging and--you know, not--not changing pricing in a discriminatory way. But--you know, we're gonna have to reconsider that.\" Which, in fact, in my view, just underscored the need to have an alternative here. So can you--you're--you're someone who's working this issue on the ground every day, if you can just--you know, how--how would you explain to one of your customers coming into your bank, why you think it's important for the FedNow system to be put in the operation? </p><p>STEEN: Well, Senator, thank you. </p><p>You know, my customers are--are looking to us to provide them the--the fastest payment possible and I need to ride that train. And the one constant in my career has been the Federal Reserve. And I--from a pricing standpoint, they've demonstrated when technology improves, they can lower my cost. And they explain that to us and we understand it.  </p><p>So I just know that we cannot lose that. And we, I know, accessibility to every small financial institution is just so critical. And we're one of those. And so I--I'm absolutely confident the Fed is doing the right thing. And we've been asking them to do it. I was on the task force. I was on a steering committee, I was on a directory workgroup. And I've been pounding the table for them to do this all the way along the way. And they are and I'm confident it will move along very quickly.  </p><p>I saw what they did, Check 21, and how fast that revolution took place. And I was part of that. And so I'm confident we can accomplish this. Thank you.  </p><p>VAN HOLLEN: And I would point out, as the chairman knows, it was--it was a four to one vote on the board of the Federal Reserve, right?  </p><p>Ms. Bair, you've been in the middle of this during really tough times, in terms of--you know, financial institutions in our country. And in response to a question you just--you just pointed out that this suggestion that we could not make these systems interoperable, was kind of like the statement on monopoly and discriminatory pricing. Another example, actually, of why it's important to have an alternative, right? Because otherwise, the system with monopoly power can use that leverage-- </p><p>BAIR: --Yes.-- </p><p>VAN HOLLEN: --in certain ways. So can you expand upon your concerns-- </p><p>BAIR: --Yeah.-- </p><p>VAN HOLLEN: --there?  </p><p>BAIR: This is--I think it's important to understand, we're talking about interbank--interbank settlement. So there--there are a lot of banks working with financial technology companies, trying to come up with new innovative ways to help people send and manage payments that are customer-facing, but you still have the problem of getting the money from one bank to another. And so if you have a monopoly provider, for that piece of it, all these innovators, they are working on customer interfacing services and applications will have to go to that single provider.  </p><p>This is why--you know, I know the big banks love this, but pretty much nobody else does. There's not trust, the small banks don't trust them, the financial technology companies don't trust them because this will be giving them monopoly pricing power. And they may say today, \"We won't do it, we'll be fair and equitable.\" But the Fed has no authority to regulate rates. I--I also agree though with President George that the best way to address this is through competition and giving smaller institutions, giving financial technology innovators working with--with those institutions an alternative giving them two places to--to work with, to deal with, to support their innovation.  </p><p>So and I would also say that the problem of trust is one of the reasons why I don't think RTP has gotten traction, if there was trust, it was a great service, who--who would care whether the Fed's going to come in any way? People will be jumping for it. But that's not happening. The public comment processes has overwhelmingly said that pretty much everybody outside the big banks who own TCH want an alternative system. </p><p>VAN HOLLEN: Thank you. I look, I think the history shows that competition actually spurs innovation not stifles innovation.  </p><p>Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  </p><p>CRAPO: Thank you. Senator Kennedy. </p><p>KENNEDY: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  </p><p>This debate and I haven't made up my mind on this, that this debate reminds me a lot of the debate we're having in health care about whether--whether the United States government should set up its--its own health insurance program to compete with the private sector. That's just an observation.  </p><p>Second observation, Mr. Steen, I have great respect for the Fed. And I would remind you, though, that it was the Fed, or at least people influencing the Fed, who decided in 2008, that the community banks were just as responsible as the too big to fail banks for the meltdown, which was patently untrue. And some people around here decided to try to regulate you and your colleagues half to death. And which, I think--I think hurt the banking system.  So I'd be-- I'd just caution you up here in Washington, don't trust anybody too much.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>President George, let me ask you this. And this is honestly a question. I don't mean the question to suggest an answer. Tell me what's wrong with RTP? Right? Is it not working? Can it not work? What's your concern? </p><p>GEORGE: So I have no insight to the functioning of RTP. But we have encouraged private sector innovation in this space. And for many years-- </p><p>KENNEDY: --Well can I stop you a second? If you have no insight into RTP, then why do you want to set up something to compete with it? </p><p>GEORGE: Because our interest in making sure under our public policy goals, that access is broadly achieved for this service extends to some 10,000 institutions in this country and we have an existing network reach and relationship with those institutions. </p><p>KENNEDY: I get that and I'm sorry to interrupt you. But I don't know--what--what I want to understand. I mean, doesn't Fed have enough to do? It would just seem to me that--that if RTP can work, if you want to compete with it, that may be the right approach. But what I'm trying to understand is why?  </p><p>GEORGE: Our interest-- </p><p>KENNEDY: --I understand you have the power to do it. But why does it make sense to spend taxpayer money for the RTP--for the Fed to go set up a competitor for something that may be working? Unless it isn't, if it didn't work then tell me. </p><p>GEORGE: The information we took from the Private Sector Task Force came to the Fed and said, \"We need the Fed to get into providing real-time payments with the private sector.\"  </p><p>KENNEDY: Why?  </p><p>GEORGE: The reason was to achieve broad reach. We have many community banks in this country that are in rural and remote areas that would not otherwise be profitable places to provide services. They need these services for their communities. They need to be able to attach to systems that might otherwise be out of their reach.  </p><p>KENNEDY: May I stop you a minute because my--I'm not trying to be rude. Our time goes so fast.  </p><p>GEORGE: Yes, sir.  </p><p>KENNEDY: So why don't I mean, the Fed has the power to punish banks the rest of their natural lives. You and I both know that. I know you don't put it in those terms. And I'm not suggesting anything untoward. But so why don't you turn to our RTP and saying, \"Look, here's some changes we would like to respectfully ask you to make. You don't have to make them but our advice is you should.\" They're not going to ignore you. Are they? </p><p>GEORGE: I think our experiences as operating alongside the private sector has produced the best outcomes for the payment system. </p><p>KENNEDY: Yeah, but--but--but--but--but my question is, if you see a way to improve the--I'm trying to understand, if you see a way to improve RTP, why don't you just sit down with them and say, \"Folks, here we want you to--we want you to extend your reach, we want you to--to give us jurisdiction over the prices are going to charge and we want to make sure that you make your service available to everybody\"? Boom, problem solved.  </p><p>GEORGE: The Board of Governors don't-- </p><p>KENNEDY: --And you save a bunch of time and money and you don't have to set up a competing system because taxpayers are going to pay for what you gonna set up. And I know you have enough to do. </p><p>GEORGE: We certainly have enough to do and we are intent on fulfilling our public policy authorities as Congress has granted us in this arena, which is to make sure that that system is accessible, that it's provided equitably, and that it is safe. And we will continue to operate alongside the private sector in achieving those outcomes for the public. </p><p>KENNEDY: Okay. Can I ask one more, Mr. Chairman, since it's just you? Oh, I'm sorry. I don't want to cut into Senator Smith's time. </p><p>But I thank-- </p><p>SMITH: --Go ahead, Senator. One more, just one more. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>KENNEDY: Well, Ms. Bair, is raising her hand. </p><p>BAIR: Well, I did. I just wanted to--to strongly support what President George said and indicate that I hear get what you're saying about--so first of all, they don't have regulatory authority, I think. So there is no direct authority to do rate regulation and access controls and all the kinds-- </p><p>KENNEDY: --Yeah, but they're not-- </p><p>BAIR: --you would find with the public utility.-- </p><p>KENNEDY: --We live in the real world. The--the banks aren't going to ignore-- </p><p>BAIR: --Mr.--if I could just-- </p><p>KENNEDY: The banks aren't going to ignore the Fed-- </p><p>BAIR: --Well-- </p><p>KENNEDY: --if the Fed tells them to do something.  </p><p>BAIR: --I wish that was true. But as--as a Republican and as somebody who I consider myself market-oriented, I think competition is a much better discipline on pricing, equity, and efficiency, and broadening customer bases, than trying to prescriptively, regulate this. </p><p>KENNEDY: So that's one-- </p><p>BAIR: --The problem-- </p><p>KENNEDY: --view. Another point of view is you just want to expand government. </p><p>BAIR: No, I--I don't think that's what the Fed's--look I've worked with the Fed for a long time. And I've criticized--you know, other parts of the Fed, I advocated for limits on the Fed's bailout authority. They probably weren't happy with me. Chairman Crapo remembers that in Dodd-Frank. So in other context--you know, sure, the Fed's got a lot of power. But this is like bread and butter of what they do. And they are the only ones who can come in with it with an alternative parallel system because of the--the costs and--and the--and the resources that are required to do this. If you just rely on private enterprise, there will be a single monopoly provider without the regulatory authority to impose pricing and access controls.  </p><p>So I do think that the Fed is absolutely--this is in the public interest to do and it will be more efficient than just trying to regulate it with authority they don't have and--and I think big banks push back quite a bit against the Fed and the FDIC, so I would not say that they always do what the regulator asked them to.  </p><p>KENNEDY: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'm sorry, Senator. </p><p>CRAPO: Senator Smith.  </p><p>SMITH: Thank you, Mr. Chair, and I just realized I might have accidentally taken some of your authority by ceding time to Senator Kennedy without your permission. I'm-- </p><p>CRAPO: --No problem. You're welcome. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>KENNEDY: You're--you're on double-secret probation. </p><p>(LAUGHTER)  </p><p>SMITH: I want to thank all the panelists for being here today. And I'm sorry, I missed the back and forth with my colleagues because as you no doubt heard we have lots of committee hearings today. But--so I just have--I'm sure the ground has been well plowed here.  </p><p>Let me just ask a question of President George. President George, the Fed operates several payment systems already. And I'm wondering what you've learned about fraud prevention, from that experience. You know, one of the--there are many upsides to real-time payments. But of course, one of the possible downsides is real-time fraud. So could you just share a little bit about what you've learned about that? </p><p>GEORGE: So the security of the payment system is essential. And I think, as you've noted, in particular, when payments are moving this quickly, so we would see as part of our initiative, and as we did with the Private Sector Task Force is thinking about security, and what fraud mitigation standards will be important. And I think that will include education efforts-- </p><p>SMITH: --Okay.-- </p><p>GEORGE: --the banking system, making sure that their customers understand what role they play in that. </p><p>SMITH: Thank you. Would anybody else like to comment on that fraud question? </p><p>HUNTER: Absolutely, Senator. So we--we take consumer protection very seriously. We worked closely with the CFPB in our design and--and establishment of the system. And we've learned a lot about fraud from our interactions with--with other real-time payment systems around the world.  </p><p>Fundamentally, the way we've architected this system is a much better, much more safe, much more secure experience for consumers and businesses because these are credit push payments only. So the consumer or the business actually have to actually authenticate into their banking system. And the only way that they can make a payment is to push those funds out.  </p><p>There are no debit polls where if somebody gets a hold of your account information and they can defeat the fraud control systems at the bank, they can get money out of your account.  So fundamentally, this is a much more safe, much more efficient, much more sound way for consumers to make payments.  </p><p>And if I can, Senator, I just want to say that--that--you know, we will certainly work and to have discussions with the Fed about interoperability, I don't mean to imply to anyone that we are not concerned and wouldn't want to get there. When we talked about designing the system, we had hoped that interoperability could be achieved. We're not optimistic but we are certainly willing to do everything possible to discuss with the Fed and try to reach that result. </p><p>SMITH: Thank you.  </p><p>Just another question that is very specific. It was raised to me specifically from Minnesota credit unions, of which we have many, and they're very important to communities in Minnesota, is small credit unions are trying to figure out--you know, they don't have staff available 24 hours a day, to monitor transactions and troubleshoot problems. And so my question to the panel is how can small institutions prepare to handle a payment system that would be on 24 hours a day? Like what would be the solutions, just the operability solutions for small institutions? </p><p>HUNTER: Senator, if I--if I may, we have worked very, very closely with third-party service providers. And one of the things that we've recognized is that they are going to need banks like Mr. Steen's bank, other community banks, we want all of those banks to be on the--on the RTP network because the network is only as valuable as the banks that it can reach. So third-party service providers, bankers, banks, corporate credit unions, other institutions that provide critical services, back-office services to small community banks and credit unions have been on our radar ever since we designed the system, what you have seen are large banks who--who handle their own technology coming onto the system to date. What you haven't seen but is equally important and what is maturing, is the work that we've done with those third-party service providers to bring small financial institutions onto the system. They have begun to be in a position to--to activate those core back-office systems. And they're going to start bringing on small community banks and credit unions in the next several months. </p><p>SMITH: Thank you. President George, would you like to respond? </p><p>GEORGE: So this is a real issue for smaller institutions, credit unions, small banks, and we will be working carefully around standards, which I think helped them in adhering to things that protect them and protect their customers.  </p><p>SMITH: Thank you. And just one last question. So I'm just--let's say--let's say I'm just a person, which I am. And I'm trying to--and I can see that real-time payments--you know, whether I'm a small business and it's going to be helpful to me. So can anybody explain to me what is the harm of more competition? If I'm--to me, how am I harmed as an individual if there is more competition, rather than less competition in this--in this market?  </p><p>HUNTER: Senator--  </p><p>SMITH: I'm just--asked Ms.--Ms. Bair about this. </p><p>BAIR: Well, I think consumers are helped. It will result in more innovation, more competition, better pricing, wider access. I think absolutely two systems will support consumers and their ability to--to have a choice of real-time payment services and for all banks of all sizes of depository institutions, including credit unions of all sizes, to be able to participate in and--and this is the future. We will have real-time payments. And so that the challenge is to make sure-- make sure everybody's included. Having these two systems is the best way to do that. </p><p>HUNTER: Senator, if I'm may-- </p><p>SMITH: --I'm sorry but I think Mr. Selgin was going to speak. </p><p>SELGIN: Oh, yes, I was going to say-- </p><p>SMITH: --I'll let you.  </p><p>SELGIN: Yes, I'm not one of those who opposes competition between the Fed and the private sector, including The Clearing House. What I--what I'm concerned with is that the competition has to be fair, if any of the players can cheat, or can compete unfairly, to put it a little bit more mildly, that can upset the competitive process that normally leads to good results. That's why we have the antitrust division, for example, to make sure private firms don't compete. In the Fed's case, we have to take--there are other precautions that are needed, some are taken already. But there are many ways in which presently the Fed can compete unfairly. And a few have been mentioned.  </p><p>One of them is not paying interest on reserves held in joint accounts that serve the same purpose as other reserves, not--not classifying--sorry, funds in those accounts as reserves. They should be classified that way. Another is by not making its essential clearing services, settlement services on Fedwire and on NSS available 24/7. That allows other non-real-time payment systems to compete more effectively by having faster payments but not necessarily not real-time payments. And there's competition on that margin too.  </p><p>So there are a lot of steps Congress can take to assure that competition is even--is played on--on an even playing field, a level playing field between the Fed and the private sector. That's the key, not preventing competition.   </p><p>HUNTER:</p><p> --And Senator, if--if I may, we are not against competition, let me make that perfectly clear. What we are concerned about is an unlevel playing field between the private sector and--and the government. We are also concerned that if we can't figure out interoperability and no, no systems worldwide interoperate in real-time gross settlement payments like we've set up here. They haven't--nobody's figured out how to do that yet. That will lead to a very suboptimal result in this country for consumers and businesses where the participants and their customers on one system aren't going to be able to complete payments to the participants and their customers on another system. </p><p>SMITH: Thank you, Mr. Chair. </p><p>CRAPO: Thank you. And that completes the questioning, although I'm going to ask for a brief response from all of you on an issue that Senator Cortez Masto raised. But first, let me thank you all for bringing this perspective here. We have the obvious divergence of opinions on the committee here about this issue. I find it interesting, I think Senator Kennedy, probably focused on the dichotomy.  </p><p>We--we all believe in competition, we also all talk about how we believe in not having the government be too large. And--and having the government step in here. What we're talking about is the government competing with the private sector. And--and that kind of puts an interesting twist on the competition discussion is--and then the reverse of that is the discussion about well, you have a monopoly if you have only one provider in the private sector. And so how do we deal with that?  </p><p>And these are--these are difficult questions. And as you can see, we have different perspectives on that on the committee. I encourage the Fed as it moves forward here, which apparently it is doing to take these kinds of considerations carefully into mind. And hopefully, we'll be able to work this out.  </p><p>The question I want to address, however, is the one of digital currencies. As you're all aware that this committee right now is dealing with the Libra proposal from Facebook, which is only one of the more recent utilizations of blockchain technology on the internet. But in the context of creating a digital currency. And we have many examples of this technological development on the internet, Bitcoin and many others. But they raised the question as, I understand it, of whether we are moving technologically to a whole different world than the one which we spent this entire hearing discussing. And that that world is digital currency-related technology, which perhaps, are central banks, as well as all of our financial institutions, small banks, and large banks alike, credit card companies, every--every kind of transaction, need to be more focused on.  </p><p>And I know that I just asked a very huge question and asked you all to--to respond very briefly. And I really mean, perhaps what you could do is respond to me on this, just your--your thoughts about this issue in general, in writing, following the hearing. But am I right, am I correct that we need to start looking at this entire transition to or whether there really is a transition? Is this a--a technological change that we should consider as being transformative in the way that we deal with currency and with financial transactions?  </p><p>Why don't we just go down the line? Ms. George?  </p><p>GEORGE: Thank you, Senator. It's a very important issue, I think because it's hard to forecast where this is going. And it's one of the reasons that we study carefully, what does it mean? Because one thing we know is, we've invested heavily in trying to have a banking system that is sound, that serves the economy that serves the American public. And of course, with that has come safety nets, consumer protections, thinking about access to credit, many of those things.  </p><p>As we look at what disruption may come to the existing framework, I think that's why it's important we study to see how will any of the, those safeguards be disrupted? How will they apply in a new world with different technologies? And I think at this stage requires us to be very cautious and look carefully to make sure that we gain the benefits of innovation, gain the benefits that can come from new technological approaches without undermining I think what has been hard-earned and won safeties for the economy. </p><p>CRAPO: Thank you. Anybody else want to comment? </p><p>HUNTER: Senator, Mr. Chairman, I--I appreciate the question. We certainly share Ms. Bair's and--and other folks' concern about unregulated and largely unsupervised social media companies getting into setting up digital currencies that could threaten the--the prominence and the value of the U.S. dollar. That said, we've looked at digital currencies or blockchain as a technology through--throughout its--its--its--its development and deployment across the U.S.  </p><p>And it really is not terribly fit for purpose, when you think about using it as a payment system, it takes an enormous amount of processing power, it's relatively slow, it doesn't sort of process the number of transactions that you need to process, and the speed, and the volume that you need to really serve--serve the country.  </p><p>I think it's one of the reasons why--I mean, this concept has been around for a long time. You don't really see it being deployed and used a lot for payment system. It's sort of deployed around the edges. It's not really caught on. It's a blockchain is--is a great solution for the register of deeds office where you want records that go back until the beginning of time and you can create lots of information, but it's not terribly fit for purpose in--in the payment space.  </p><p>CRAPO: All right. Anyone else? </p><p>STEEN: I would--I do have some thoughts on that. And I would like to submit them to--  </p><p>CRAPO: --I'd appreciate that. Yeah. </p><p>BAIR: No, I just--I appreciate the question. I think you're right to focus on it and face--something like the Facebook's Libra would take payments completely outside of the banking system. We would--we would lose substantial control. So whether it's technologically feasible or not, I mean, Facebook's pretty smart company. And they've been a lot of time and they seem to think it would. I think the lack of any kind of regulatory structure around that.  </p><p>I think--you know, and I--I encourage the committee continue looking at that because I--the last thing we want is to lose control of our--our fiat currency. Which is why I think ultimately, central banks, including the Fed need to get ahead of this technology and capture it themselves so that they cannot be disrupted by a--a large non-bank entity like a Facebook. </p><p>SELGIN: Yes, I would add, Senator, to that. We've all been talking about the benefits of competition in the payment system. And these digital currencies are part of that potential competition. And they're a particularly important part because they represent some very intriguing innovations, that it's an--it's have not come from government, have come from the private sector. We don't know the full potential benefits that may be had from these technologies.  </p><p>Ultimately, Mr. Hunter's quite correct that so far, they have not been particularly useful for payments, although people think of them as being used in that connection. They have a lot of disadvantages but I think it's desirable that they too be part of the process.  </p><p>As for central banks providing digital currencies themselves. Well, it must be said that the paper notes that the Federal Reserve issues are the horse and buggies-- </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>--of the modern pavement system. And that digital substitutes for these could well be an improvement.  </p><p>But there once again, we would want the Fed to be competing with private sector providers and not monopolizing the provision of these substitutes. And there's no reason why you could not have some private digital monies that are dollar-based. And we have things that are close to that so far. The main thing is that competition has to be allowed to work itself out amongst parties participating in a--on a level playing field.  </p><p>CRAPO: Well, thank you, and I appreciate the--these insights. I would welcome any further insights you'd like to share with me on this issue. It seems to me that this is--unless it becomes clear that it's such a cumbersome innovation that it just can't be utilized in the payments system or in the currency systems of the world, it seems to me that this could be a truly a disruptive influence in and I don't say that in a negative sense. I mean, in the context of--of its impact on--on literally currency transactions of all types in the world.  </p><p>And--and some of those impacts can be very positive impacts, some can be very dangerous impacts, you think of things from eliminating cost to consumer in the system, to expanding opportunity for money laundering and--and all kinds of other different potential impacts of--of the expansion of this new type of innovation. So I'd love your thoughts on it. As we move forward. This is an--obviously another issue that the committee is currently struggling with.  </p><p>With that, I want to conclude this hearing. Again, I welcome--I thank you for all of your--your input and welcome your further input on this. For senators who wish to submit questions for the record. Those questions are due to the committee by Wednesday, October 2. I'll ask the witnesses if you would all respond to those questions as promptly as you can. We'd appreciate it. And again, thank you for being here. This hearing is adjourned. </p></bodyText></section></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">POLTRN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X56-46R1-F15W-H047-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">147909</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><publicationInfo><publicationName>CQ Transcriptions</publicationName><bodyText><p>All materials herein are protected by United States copyright law and may not be reproduced, distributed, transmitted, displayed, published or broadcast without the prior written permission of CQ Transcriptions.

KYRSTEN SINEMA (D-ARIZ.) </p><p>[*]CRAPO: This hearing will come to order. Providing testimony to the committee today are experts who have researched and written extensively on big data--Dr. Alicia Cackley, the director of the Financial Markets and Community Investment at the Government Accountability Office and Ms. Pam Dixon, executive director of the World Privacy Forum. We appreciate both of you being here. </p><p>As a result of increasingly digital--an increasingly digital economy, more personal information is available to companies and others than ever before. I've been troubled by government agencies and private companies collection of personally identifiable information for a long time. There have been many questions about how individuals or groups of individuals information is collected, with whom it is shared or sold, how it is used and how it is secured. Private companies are collecting, processing, analyzing and sharing massive data on individuals for all kinds of purposes. </p><p>Even more troubling is that the vast majority of Americans do not even know what data is being collected, when it's being collected, how it's being collected, by whom and for what purpose. In particularly, data brokers and technology companies including large social media platforms and search engines play a central role in gathering vast amounts of personal information and often without interacting with individuals specifically in the case of data brokers. </p><p>In 2013, the GAO issued a report on information resellers which includes data brokers and the need for the consumer privacy framework to reflect changes in technology in the marketplace. The report that the current statutory consumer privacy framework fails to address fully new technologies and the growing marketplace for personal information. The GAO also provided several recommendations to Congress on how to approach the issue to provide consumers with more control over their data. </p><p>In 2018--five years later--GAO published a blog summarizing its 2013 report highlighting the continued relevance of the report's findings. The Federal Trade Commission also released a report in 2014 that emphasized the big row of data brokers in the economy. The FTC observed in its report that data brokers collect and store billions of data elements covering nearly every U.S. consumer and that data brokers collect data from numerous sources largely without consumers knowledge. </p><p>In her report \"The Scoring of America\", Pam Dixon discusses predictive consumer scoring across the country--across the economy including the big role that data brokers play. She stresses that today, no protections exist for most consumer scores similar to those that apply to credit scores under the Fair Credit Reporting Act. </p><p>Dixon says, \"Consumer scores are today where credit scores were in the 1950's. Data brokers, merchants, government entities and others can create or use a consumer score without notice to consumers.\" </p><p>Dr. Cackley has also issued several reports on consumer privacy and technology including a report in September 2013 on information resellers which includes data brokers. She says in her report that the current consumer privacy framework does not fully address new technologies and the vastly increased marketplace for personal information. She also discusses potential gaps in current federal law including the Fair Credit Reporting Act. </p><p>The Banking Committee has been examining the data issue in both the private and public sectors from regulators to financial companies, to other companies who gather vast amounts of personal information on individuals or groups of individuals to see what can be done through legislation, regulation, or by instituting best practices. </p><p>Enacted in 1970, the Fair Credit Reporting Act is a law in the Banking Committee's jurisdiction which aims to promote the accuracy, fairness, and privacy of consumer information contained in the files of consumer reporting agencies. Given the exponential growth and use of data since that time, the rise of entities that appear to serve a similar function as the original credit reporting agencies, it's worth examining how the Fair Credit Reporting Act should work in a digital economy. </p><p>During today's hearing, I look forward to hearing more about the structure and practices of the data broker industry and technology companies such as large social media platforms, how data broker--the data broker industry has evolved within the development of new technologies and their interaction with technological--technology companies, what information these entities collect, how it is collected, and whom it is shared with, and for what purposes. What gaps exist in federal privacy law and what changes to federal law should be considered to give individuals real control over their data. </p><p>I appreciate each of you joining us today and look forward to getting some further information about these questions. Senator Brown? </p><p>BROWN: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate your continuing these important bipartisan efforts to protect Americans since it's sensitive personal information. We're looking today at a shadow injury known as data brokers. Most of us--most of you probably haven't heard of these companies. The biggest ones include names like Axiom, Encore Logic, and Spokio, and Zoom Info, and maybe one you've heard of called Oracle. </p><p>According to some estimates, 4,000 of these companies collect and sell private information. But stunningly--and I'm not sure I've ever used that word in this committee--stunningly, not one of them has been willing to show up and speak in front of this committee today. Not one. </p><p>These companies expected--expect to be trusted with the most personal and private information you could imagine about a--about millions and millions of Americans. They're not even willing to show up and explain how their industry works. Some define this as cowardice. It's hard to disagree with that. I think it tells you all you need to know about how much they want their own faces and names associated with that industry. </p><p>As Mache Zagorsky (PH) told us in our last hearing, \"The daily activities of most Americans are now tracked and permanently recorded by automated systems at Google or Facebook.\" Most of that private activity isn't useful without data that anchors it to the real world. Facebook, Google, Amazon want to know where you're using your credit cards, where you buy your brand name appliances, if you're recently divorced, how big your life insurance policy is--the kind of data that big tech gets from data brokers. </p><p>They then combine it with your social media activity to feed into their algorithms. You might've noticed it seems like every product or service you buy comes with a survey or a warning card that asks for--asks for strangely personal information. Why are all these non-tech companies so interested in your data? </p><p>It's simple. Data brokers will pay these companies for any of your personal information they can get their hands on, so they can turn around and sell it to the--to Silicon Valley. It's hard for ordinary consumers to have any power when unbeknownst to them, they're actually--they are actually the product bought and sold. </p><p>It reminds me of a time when corporations that had no business being in the lending industry decided to start making loans and selling them off to Wall Street. We know what happened. Manufacturers or car companies decided that consumer credit would be a great way to boost their profits. When big banks and big tech are willing to pay for something, everyone else will find a way to sell it to them often with devastating results. </p><p>For example, Amazon's undermining retailers and manufacturing across the country through NI competitive practices. The same time it scoops up information from the very businesses it's pushing out of the market. There's Facebook almost singlehandedly undermining the profitability of newspapers across the country. It also gobbles up personal information. </p><p>The New York Times allows data brokers to collect from its leaders. Just like in the financial crisis, a group of shadowy players sits at the center of the market exercising enormous influence over consumers in the economy while facing little or no rules at all. Then they don't share up. </p><p>Jeremy Crapo and I are committing to shining a light on these companies to keep an unregulated data economy from spiraling out of control. </p><p>Yesterday it was reported a Department of Homeland Security contractor allowed unauthorized access to photos of travelers and their license plates to be exposed to potential identity thieves. One of the principal differences between the two political parties in this town is the suspicion that democrats have of private power and the suspicion republicans typically have of government power. I think you're seeing two parties come together on our suspicion of what these data brokers are doing. </p><p>The chairman and I agree that protecting sensitive information like this is timely and important. I look forward to the witness's testimony. Thanks. </p><p>CRAPO: Thank you, Senator Brown and I appreciate our partnership on this issue. We will go in the order I introduced you. And Dr. Cackley, you may begin. But before you do, let me just remind both of you that we would like you to keep your initial remarks to five minutes, so that we can have plenty of time for the senators to engage with you. Dr. Cackley? </p><p>CACKLEY: Thank you, Chairman Crapo, Ranking Member Brown and members of the committee. I'm pleased to be here today to discuss GAO's work on consumer privacy and information resellers also known as data brokers. My remarks are primarily based on our September 2013 report on privacy--privacy issues related to information resellers, as well as more recent work on internet privacy, data protection, facial recognition, and financial technology. </p><p>My statement will focus on two main issues--the lack of an overarching federal privacy law and gaps that exist in the current consumer privacy framework. No overarching federal privacy law governs the collection, use and sale of personal information among private sector companies including information resellers. </p><p>There are also no federal laws designed specifically to address all the products sold and information maintained by information resellers. Instead, federal privacy laws covering the private sector are narrowly tailored to specific purposes, situations, types of information and/or entities such as data related to financial transactions, personal health and eligibility for credit. </p><p>For example, the Fair Credit Reporting Act requires that sensitive consumer information be protected and restricts how it is shared. But the law only applies to information used to determine eligibility for things like credit, insurance and employment. </p><p>Similarly, the Gramm Leach Bliley Act restricts how certain financial information is shared, but it only applies to entities that fall under the law specific definition of a financial institution. Other privacy statutes address other specific circumstances, but there is no federal statute that comprehensively addresses privacy issues in the private sector. </p><p>GAO has stated previously that gaps exist in the U.S consumer privacy framework. We've reported that federal law provides consumers with limited ability to access, control and correct their personal data--particularly data used for marketing purposes. </p><p>Similarly, individuals generally cannot prevent their personal information from being collected, used and shared. Yet information that resellers collect and share for marketing purposes can be very personal or sensitive. For example, it can include information about physical and mental health, income and assets, political affiliations, and sexual habits, and orientation. </p><p>Another area where there are gaps in the consumer privacy framework is with respect to new technologies. For example, federal law does not address expressly when companies can use facial recognition technology to identify or track individuals, nor does it address when consumer knowledge or consent should be required for its use. </p><p>Similarly, no federal privacy law explicitly addresses the full range of practices for tracking or collecting data from consumers online activity, or the application software from mobile devices. And the rise of financial services technologies--known as FinTech--raises new privacy concerns. For example, because new sources of personal data are being used to determine credit worthiness. </p><p>In summary, new markets and technologies have vastly changed the amount of personal information private companies collect and how they use it. But our current privacy framework does not fully address these changes. Laws protecting privacy interests are tailored to specific sectors and uses. And consumers have little control over how their information is collected, used and shared with third parties for marketing purposes. </p><p>As a result, the current privacy framework warrants reconsideration by Congress in relation to consumer interests, new technologies and other issues. Chairman Crapo, Ranking Member Brown, and members of the committee, this concludes my statement. I would be pleased to answer any questions you may have. </p><p>CRAPO: Thank you. Ms. Dixon? </p><p>DIXON: Thank you, Chairman Crapo, Ranking Member Brown, and members of the committee. Thank you for your invitation and for the opportunity to talk about something very, very meaningful today--the Fair Credit Reporting Act, data brokers and privacy. </p><p>Fifty years ago, this committee struck a blow for consumers, for transparency and for fairness when it passed the Fair Credit Reporting Act. This committee talked with stakeholders. They found best practices and before the Hugh--the famous Hugh Report came out--the committee report that defined what became fair information practices--this committee created the Fair Credit Reporting Act. </p><p>It was and still is the most important American privacy law that we have. But it's not as important as it was. There are three reasons why. </p><p>First, credit scores and other scores are being sold and used in consumers lives and these are unregulated. </p><p>Second, the technology of prediction--what can be called predictive analytics otherwise known as AI and machine learning. This technology--and suite of technologies--has advanced profoundly and especially in the last 3-4 years. New kinds of predictabilities have come forth and we have new levels of accuracy in prediction, so that what used to be the accuracy of the credit score now is also the accuracy of an unregulated credit score. And this introduces new problems for consumers. </p><p>Third, these scores are created without due process for consumers. How on earth do we deal with this? </p><p>This is why Congress must expand the Fair Credit Reporting Act to regulate currently unregulated scores especially in the financial sector that are being used in meaningful ways in consumers lives. </p><p>We have other solutions to discuss and other issues to discuss. I look forward to your questions. Thank you. </p><p>CRAPO: Thank you very much, Ms. Dixon. I'd like to ask each of you to answer my first three questions and then I want to get into more discussion. But I would like you--if you possibly can--to limit your answers to yes or no answers to the first three. I know you'll be tempted to elaborate, but I'll give you that chance. </p><p>First, do you agree that data brokers collect and process vast amounts of personal information on nearly every American to the extent that they hold more information about individuals than the U.S. government, or traditional credit, and bureaus? </p><p>CACKLEY: Yes. </p><p>DIXON: Yes. </p><p>CRAPO: Second, do you both agree that most Americans have no knowledge of these activities and in most cases no rights to access, correct, or control the information collected about them? </p><p>DIXON: Yes. </p><p>CACKLEY: Yes. </p><p>CRAPO: And then, third, can certain processing and uses of this information have significant impacts on their financial lives? </p><p>CACKLEY: Yes. </p><p>DIXON: Yes, absolutely. </p><p>CRAPO: All right, now we'll get to where you can elaborate. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>You have both authored reports as the FTC in 2014 that highlighted the gaps in the Fair Credit Reporting Act and other privacy laws. You've both testified about that in your introductory remarks. </p><p>These gaps allow data brokers to evade certain requirements that shouldn't be implied--imposed on them. What are the steps that we can take? You indicated Ms. Dixon that we need to expand the Fair Credit Reporting Act and you essentially said the same thing, Dr. Cackley. But what specifically does this committee need to do with regard to that? </p><p>DIXON: Thank you. In regards to the Fair Credit Reporting Act, it--it--I think very small changes would be very meaningful. Let me give you an example. Right now, as you know--as you well know, the Fair Credit Reporting Act in regards to credit scores applies to individuals. So, when we are, you know, that is regulated the--at the individual level. </p><p>However, if you look at the new forms of credit scores that are available, they are scored at the household level where the Fair Credit Reporting Act does not apply. So, you take a zip plus four and you--you score a household, and give them let's say a score of 720. The household has a very accurate score of 720, then that becomes an unregulated form of credit score. And, you now, these scores were quasi-accurate. That's changed. </p><p>CRAPO: Thank you. Dr. Cackley? </p><p>CACKLEY: The Fair Credit Reporting Act has a--a certain number of--of elements to it that are--that are very helpful. It gives consumers access, control, the ability to correct information and--and safeguards privacy. But it only applies for certain--in certain situations for eligibility decisions. It would be possible to think about looking at a broader set of personal, sensitive information that--that the Fair Credit Reporting Act could cover that would give consumers more of those things--access control, ability to correct--over more sensitive--personal sensitive information than is currently available. </p><p>CRAPO: All right. And--and I'm going to use the term--well, Ms. Dixon you used--you used the term \"unregulated credit scores.\" There is a set of data that is collected about individuals and as you indicate, households. And this data is turned into some kind of an analysis that allows those who use the data to influence and manipulate individuals in--in the marketplace. </p><p>Historically--as you've both indicated--the Fair Credit Reporting Act has focused primarily on credit bureaus. But the scope of who is collecting this data, and how it is being used has exploded as you've both also discussed. The question I have is, isn't this unregulated score that we're talking about that is created for people and then managed by AI--isn't that impacting people's credit? Isn't it impacting their financial decisions? Isn't it significantly focused on that type of influence and manipulation of individuals? </p><p>CACKLEY: I--I think it--it certainly can be. The--the scores can--may not be credit scores, but they may apply to decisions that companies are making about what kinds of products they offer people, at what price they offer things based on a score that the consumer doesn't necessarily see and can't--can't even tell if it's correct or can't make any--any attempt to--to approve that score if they don't even know it exists. </p><p>CRAPO: And to influence them to make such a transaction, yeah. I'll let you go ahead, Ms. Dixon. I'm running out of time here, but go ahead please. </p><p>DIXON: Thank you. It's--we call any score that is not regulated by the Federal Credit Reporting Act consumer scores and we define that. It's in the written testimony. Consumer scores are quite dangerous when they're used in eligibility circumstances. </p><p>So, for example, the--the line between a lead generation which is allowable. You don't have to pull a credit score to--to create a lead generation for a marketing product or a financial product. However, if you are just maybe marketing a financial product and you have something that is equivalent in accuracy to a credit score, all the sudden this changes the equation. There's--there's not even a micrometer in between what a, you know, a regulation would be and a non-regulated score. </p><p>So, if you have essentially something that looks like a credit score, and that acts like a credit score, and is being used like a credit score, well it's the same thing as a duck. If it quacks, it's a duck. So, I think we have to look at the financial products that are being marketed with quasi credit scores very closely. That's of high concern, but there's other categories. </p><p>In the scoring of America, we identified literally hundreds of types of scores. Consumer lifetime value scores where consumers are segmented according to how valuable they are in terms of their purchasing power. There's frailty scores which is more of a medical score. But the scores abound and the concern I have is when people lose opportunities that are meaningful in their lives. For example, scores that are used in eligibility circumstances not described by the Fair Credit Reporting Act such as admissions to colleges and whatnot. </p><p>Imagine having a wonderful high school background and working very hard to achieve the American dream. And then, all of a sudden, some score says that you won't be as qualified as a candidate having nothing to do with your academic achievements, but just somehow with maybe the neighborhood you grew up in. I find this disturbing. </p><p>CRAPO: Agreed. Senator Brown? </p><p>BROWN: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Now Ms. Dixon, you noted that tens of thousands of consumers' scores affecting millions and millions of consumers are used to predict--are used to predict our behaviors or secrets you said. Are you--are you surprised that I mean, Chairman Crapo was not able--nor were we able to bring in data brokers to speak and testify? Are you surprised they weren't willing to testify about their business practices before this Committee today? </p><p>DIXON: Actually, I am surprised and I'm actually--I--I wish they were here and I wish the credit bureaus were here as well because we need to have good industries step forward and to give us their best practices that they use. If there's no good industry to step forward with best practices, then this committee cannot rearticulate what it did 50 years ago. </p><p>BROWN: Well-- </p><p>DIXON: And I don't understand why these industries are not willing to discuss what's happening. And I-- </p><p>BROWN: I think-- </p><p>DIXON: --also don't understand why we can't see our scores. Why? </p><p>BROWN: I am not sure that they didn't show up. I guess I'd like to--I'm not sure I've done this anymore before either. I'd like to ask anybody in the room that represents the data brokers to raise their hand. Lobbyists?  Lawyers?  People paid by the data broker industry?  Any of you here?  Any of you here that want to raise your hand I guess is what I should say. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>Okay. I--I--and if you are, I mean, I--I will give you an opportunity of a lifetime if you are. We'll set up a different chair. And you can set up next to Ms. Dixon and Dr. Cackley. Would you? </p><p>Okay, all right. I guess no surprise there, Mr. Chairman and that--that does illustrate how as I--I know they're watching. I mean, this is really important to their industry. It's very important to their bottom line whether they're watching here or they're watching livestream by, but we'll move on. </p><p>Ms. Dixon, it seems that data predictions create a vicious cycle where the predictions end up often dictating the outcomes. For example, could people who've been systematically targeted by predatory lenders which have lower--having lower credit scores therefore, be likely only to see advertisements for other predatory financial products--is that--I assume that happens. Are there other examples you can think of quickly? </p><p>DIXON: Yes, the predatory example is one we get phone calls about in our office from people who received advertisements for financial products and they didn't understand that they could've gone out on the market and affirmatively looked for the best offer. So, these predatory marketing devices based on unregulated scores are very significant. </p><p>Other significant scores are scores that predict repayment of debt. So, for example, it is the poorest consumers who are targeted the most for debt repayment--all sorts of things like this. The consumer lifetime value scores impact how well you're treated by businesses by how long you're standing in line. </p><p>But the most meaningful circumstances that I can think of is when kids are applying to schools and they are getting scores that dictate whether or not they're going to be accepted to a school based not on their academics, but based on all of these other things like a pseudo credit score, like how--what neighborhood they grew up in. There are neighborhood risk scores which are the modern-day redlining. And I find them deeply objectionable because if we are going to be scored by where we live, how have we advanced and how have all the laws that have been meant to protect from such things--how are they operating if this is still happening today? </p><p>BROWN: So, companies--thank you for that. Companies that particularly--an analogy to redlining--banking redlining, insurance redlining, these companies redlining's--if companies--are you worried that companies would offer discounts for products and services in exchange for sensitive data which would lead you--sort of implied this would lead to a two-tiered system where the wealthy can afford privacy and everyone else will have to sacrifice sensitive information to get access to basic internet services? </p><p>DIXON: That's certainly part of it. I think it goes even broad--more broadly than that. One of the big issues is that you get locked into a big filter bubble of sorts--a marketing bubble and it's not that people mean to get locked into these. But if you are receiving offers--especially for financial tools and services and--and a consumer does not go outside of the offers they receive, they can pay more for autos. They can pay more for products. They can pay more for example, a TV--simple things. Simple things, but if you are a consumer on a fixed income, a television that costs $2,000 instead of 200 makes a meaningful difference in a person's life. That's what worries me the most. </p><p>BROWN: There's a--there's a--one follow-up. Not a question, but just comment, Mr. Chairman. Thanks for--for your forbearance. I--and the whole idea of--that--that people prey on people that are less able to fight back. Yesterday, I was in Des Moines--not running for President, but in Des Moines. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>And I--I was--I was at a manufactured house--manufactured housing neighborhood. And a large hedge fund from--from Salt Lake City has begun to buy up manufacturing housing neighborhoods. There are six of them in the state. There are a number of them in Iowa. They're in a half dozen states at least. </p><p>They come and they buy these. People have paid 50, or 60, or 70,000 for their manufactured home. They pay $200-300 for the--for the rent when the land in these hedge funds is raising rents over a period of about a year--year and a half up to 70 percent and people have nowhere to turn. And it's just--it's like these companies out there are just looking. \"Where--where can we come in, extract the most money at the lowest cost against people that have the most--have the least ability to fight back without political connections?\" And it's just happening across our economy. Thank you. </p><p>CRAPO: Thank you, Senator Brown. Senator Scott? </p><p>SCOTT: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I will note that some people go to Des Moines not to run for president, but perhaps vice president. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>Back over here. So-- </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>I apologize. I meant-- </p><p>BROWN: Mr. Chairman, Senator Scott's a smart guy, but that was not the smartest thing he ever said. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>SCOTT: Senator Brown, I realize you don't actually run for vice president by the number of votes you get-- </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>--but I think there is a process by which people say they are qualified to do things like ask Ms. Dixon a question. </p><p>So, one of the--your comments that you made sounded--I spent about 25 years in the insurance industry. So, one of the comments you made sounded a little bit like redlining. And I'd love for you to unpack that a little bit, but just to make sure I heard you. So, an unregulated--in unregulated ways, credit scores that consumers themselves don't know about that consumers haven't seen, heard or contributed to are being used in ways that will impact their financial well-being to include perhaps even the likelihood of jobs that they may or may not be qualified for. </p><p>That to me, sounds fairly nefarious, but it sounds a whole lot like redlining. Can you unpack, if that's not what you meant please clarify what you did mean and if it did--if it is what you meant, please drill down a little bit, so that we can have a little more clarity to what you're talking about? </p><p>DIXON: Thank you. It's a really complex issue. And in the scoring of America and in my--in my written testimony, I have articulated more fully with footnotes, so. </p><p>SCOTT: We have that part, but. </p><p>DIXON: Yes. So, thank you for your question because it is complex and it's difficult to abstract into a few words. Let me try and make a big effort here. </p><p>All right, so-- </p><p>SCOTT: I'll give you three minutes if you need. </p><p>DIXON: All right, let's go for it. </p><p>SCOTT: Okay. </p><p>DIXON: So, there are amazing real-time analytic products. I've--actually in our update to the scoring, we have looked at this. </p><p>So, for example, financial service companies--you can look across the United States and see pretty much real-time the marketplace activity of people who are spending, and buying, and what that looks like in real time. You can drill down to the census block level and see how well a neighborhood is performing. </p><p>There is a--for example, a product that gives you what's called an up-front score of what the score of that neighborhood is. So--and I will send on follow-up, a series of screenshots of this to you-- </p><p>SCOTT: Thank you. </p><p>DIXON: --so you can see it. </p><p>But it--let's say that you were applying for a university position and your neighborhood has a very poor score. Well, now that can be taken into consideration. We have the college board doing this. They have an adversity score that is doing exactly this. </p><p>So, I find this difficult. The--the lines are narrow. </p><p>SCOTT: Let me interrupt you, Ms. Dixon. So, I read an article I guess a couple of weeks ago, Mr. Chairman about this new SAT score that would take into consideration challenges. Are--are you suggesting that that score could--and the neighborhood score could have an impact on one's SAT score in college admittance? </p><p>DIXON: I do not believe it will have an impact on a person's SAT score. I do believe that it can have a much further and much larger-- </p><p>SCOTT: Ms. Dixon, are you familiar with the--the--the new iteration of the SAT score which takes into consideration the family challenges and-- </p><p>DIXON: Yes. </p><p>SCOTT: Okay. </p><p>DIXON: Yes, I am and that's what I'm referring to. </p><p>SCOTT: Great. </p><p>DIXON: So, while that score is meant to provide context, here's the problem. One of the factors that it uses is a neighborhood risk score and that neighborhood risk score is a secret score. Consumers do not get to see it. </p><p>Currently, the--the college board adversity score--the student's score--they are not allowed to see it. It is a secret score. </p><p>Now let's bring this score into transparency. Let's apply some of the principles of the Fair Credit Reporting Act. Let's give people access to the score. Let them know what factors went into the score. Let's make it fair. That's my point. </p><p>And right now, this does not fall under the Fair Credit Reporting Act by all law. It does not fall into any eligibility circumstance. Not yet, but that's what I am saying. We need to have fairness. Technology is going to advance and it's important that it does. We need to stay competitive in the United States within machine learning and AI. It's very, very crucial for our economic future. But we need fairness and transparency. And we really need the Fair Credit Reporting Act to be guiding best practices and saying, \"Look, technology, yes. Uses need to be right. That's--that's the deal.\" </p><p>SCOTT: Thank you. Mr. Chairman and Ranking Member, I would love for us to do all that we can to compel some of the companies in the industry to participate in a future hearing. </p><p>CRAPO: You have both of our agreement on that already, Senator Scott. </p><p>SCOTT: Thank you. </p><p>CRAPO: Thank you. Senator Reed? </p><p>REED: Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you to the witnesses for their testimony. On previous hearings, it's--and I'm echoing some of the comments of my colleagues particularly Senator Kennedy where a lot of the information should be used as being owned by the person, not by these data brokers. And we have to create real opportunities to protect your data. </p><p>We've got some legal statutes in place, but the Fair Credit Reporting Act, HIPAA, etc. where it's clear by statute. And then, we've got some information that's very public, you know. It's published and it's--it's late notices in newspapers, etc. </p><p>And then, there's the--all the information that's just accumulated by being on a computer. It comes back down to I think three principles in my view. One is that consumers--people should have the ability to opt out of any information collection system. </p><p>And second, that this information should be at some point expunged six months, a year, etc. And then, if it's violated by anybody--a data broker, or a collector, or anyone else, then they should have the right to go to court and say, \"You've ruined me\". So, let's start with both your comments on how do we get sort of an effective opt-out? </p><p>How, you know, my sense is that it's once I'm using a--going to a website, it's hard to figure out where the opt-out is. Sometimes they don't even offer that. Should we in  U.S. Congress say we have to have a very prominent opt out, \"Don't collect my data\"? </p><p>So, let's start with Dr. Cackley and-- </p><p>CACKLEY: So, an opt-out possibility is certainly something that--that is--is available and--and is used in certain circumstances. I think--I think it--there are--there are more circumstances where it could be helpful. I don't know that it--it would be the--that that as a solution alone would--would do the trick in terms of--of if you think about all of the times when you--when you go online and--and you're supposed to read the--the disclosures, and--and click on things. </p><p>REED: No one reads the disclosures. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>CACKLEY: Yeah, exactly. </p><p>REED: That-- </p><p>CACKLEY: And so, it may be that no one will read the opt-out. </p><p>REED: That's why the opt-out can't be hidden in disclosures. It has to be--pop right up here saying-- </p><p>CACKLEY: Absolutely. </p><p>REED: --\"Click yes or no.\" </p><p>CACKLEY: Right, yeah. And I think if someone knows that they don't want their data to be--to be collected and they can opt-out right away, that's a--that's a way to do it. And in other circumstances, people may not understand-- </p><p>REED: Well, I-- </p><p>CACKLEY: --what it is the opt-out is really doing with that. </p><p>REED: I think if you start with the major platforms--the Googles and etc.--if they cannot collect the data-- </p><p>CACKLEY: Right. </p><p>REED: --that data's not going to get down the road-- </p><p>CACKLEY: Sure. </p><p>REED: --to the brokers because they--they don't have it. </p><p>CACKLEY: Absolutely. </p><p>REED: And that's the first place I think to begin. Ms. Dixon? </p><p>DIXON: Thank you. I was honored to serve at the OECD as part of their AI expert group. I just finished helping them write the global guidelines on AI. And something that I learned in that process even more so than I already had is that our data world--our data ecosystems have become so profoundly complex that I am not at all persuaded anymore that opt-out is possible because if--if you recall, the, you know, the Russian nesting dolls where you have the big doll and then all that? </p><p>REED: Uh-huh. </p><p>DIXON: You open the doll and then there's another doll. And then, you open it up again, there's another doll. This is what data is like. </p><p>So, let's say we do opt out of, you know, a platform. Well, what about all of the financial transactions? </p><p>The financial transactions and our retail history purchase--purchase histories are actually the basis of a lot of data broker analysis and then it gets worse. As you get into the dolls, here's one that really is very, very challenging and that's this. </p><p>Data brokers right now, if they didn't collect another piece of data on us, here's something really to think about. They could simply create data about us because that is the state of the technology and I do not know how to create an opt-out that is that far removed from us. </p><p>However, that being the case, I do believe there are things we can do especially if we focus on restricting negative uses that harm consumers and really look at the end points of that process. And also, at the beginning and say, \"Hey, what are the standards you are using? What can we do to make good standards? And at the end, what are the standards for use? How can we control these two points?\" </p><p>But I think there's a role for opt-out for example, especially in for example, human subject research must have meaningful consent. As a tool, I think it's lost a lot of its power. </p><p>REED: I--I--you've studied this longer than I, but I think it's a place to begin and it's an--it's not a perfect solution. But, you know, you--you can't make the perfect enemy of the good. If it gives us--people a little more protection I think it should be pursued. </p><p>And I--the other aspect is too--is as you've pointed out with this synthetic data--they create this synthetic data. And sort of purging it periodically might also help us. Again, I think you've put your finger on this dilemma now that the complexity--the ability to take together indirectly--not directly data is profound. But if we don't take some simple steps, it gets worse. It doesn't get better. Thank you. </p><p>CRAPO: Thank you. Senator Schatz. </p><p>SCHATZ: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you to the testifiers. Ms. Dixon, you know, we're--we're talking about some reforms to the Fair Credit Reporting Act and what worries me a bit is that as important as I think it is to bring data brokers back into the fold in terms of how the statute governs their behavior, the Fair Credit Reporting Act doesn't actually work as it relates to the credit bureaus. </p><p>The credit bureaus put the onus on the consumer. The consumer has to pay to correct or monitor his or her own data. And so, that statute is broken. And so, to the extent that we're going to put all of these shadow data brokers under FCRA, I think we have to be clear-eyed about how imperfect that system is for millions and millions of Americans. I'd like you to comment on that. </p><p>DIXON: Well, I agree with you. That's why I said that the--even our best American privacy law isn't as important as it used to be. It is--it does have cracks and fissures. However, it does something very important. It makes it so that things aren't secret. </p><p>You and I, we can look at our credit score. This is huge. This is a huge improvement from pre-2000 when it was illegal to do so. We can see our bureau report and correct it. We can't see our other scores and this is-- </p><p>SCHATZ: Fair enough. </p><p>DIXON: --problematic. Yeah. </p><p>SCHATZ: Fair enough. Let me--let me ask you a sort of technical question. What's the relationship between data broker and credit bureaus? In other words, are some of these credit bureaus getting into the data broker business? Did--have some of them acquired data brokers?  What is their relationship? </p><p>DIXON: Yes. So, for example, Equifax-Experian, a lot of times what they'll do is they'll have part of their business as a formal, regulated credit reporting business. And then, other aspects of their business are unregulated-- </p><p>SCHATZ: Which is-- </p><p>DIXON: --scoring. </p><p>SCHATZ: --we would characterize as the marketing side. </p><p>DIXON: Yes, I am aware that they call it marketing. However, I call it the consumer scoring side. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>But yes, your point is absolutely correct. </p><p>And additionally, you--you mentioned that there is, you know, also first-party. One of the things that's been happening is there's a lot of data privacy concerns and there is a--a real move now for a lot of--a lot of different types of businesses to purchase data brokers and bring them in, so that they are dealing with first party data. </p><p>So, now we have a fracture in the data broker business model where you can't just say, \"Well, here are the data brokers. Let's regulate them.\" That's not possible anymore. Maybe 25-30 years ago, but not now. I think we really have to look at practices and say, \"Hey, are you using the data for these purposes especially in regards to eligibility?\" </p><p>SCHATZ: But--but the challenge--to follow-up on what Senator Scott talked about in terms of digital redlining-- </p><p>DIXON: Yeah. </p><p>SCHATZ: --is that to the extent that they're using data sets that are essentially in combination a proxy for race-- </p><p>DIXON: Right. </p><p>SCHATZ: --and to the extent that those algorithms are not transparent, it is incredibly difficult to imagine that even if we put them under FCRA and even if the FTC were authorized to go after CFB--were authorized to go after them, just to make the case would be incredibly difficult. Am I--am I correct there? </p><p>DIXON: I believe you're correct and that's why--that's why we proposed a standards bill that really looks at creating new standards to start to build a mesh network to fill in these gaps because you are correct. There are important gaps here. </p><p>SCHATZ: And under FCRA, and in the sort of old days, you used to have sort of shadow shoppers-- </p><p>DIXON: Yes. </p><p>SCHATZ: --to try to figure out whether it was discrimination in terms of impact as opposed to in terms of intent. And it seems to me that it could be a--a--a way where we could subject all of these data brokers to a regime where they had to--they didn't have to provide the code for their algorithm, but they--they had to provide a regulator with the ability to utilize the algorithm and see if the--and run a bunch of reps, and figure out if statistically speaking it was in fact a proxy--proxy for race or if there was a--a--a desperate impact on--on--on protected classes. </p><p>DIXON: I think that's right. And, you know, it's not that algorithms are bad. It's not that scoring is bad. It's how it's used. </p><p>SCHATZ: No, and some of-- </p><p>DIXON: Yeah. </p><p>SCHATZ: And some of this could actually alleviate the problem of the credit bureaus in terms of the three or four million people who have bad credit scores that are--that are-- </p><p>DIXON: Uh-huh. </p><p>SCHATZ: --that are correct. And so, if you can come up with an alternative that is non-discriminatory, it--it--it provides a real opportunity. I'll just offer one last thought and I'd like your--both of your comments for the record. We are working on legislation--and I'm working on legislation to--to establish a duty of care because I think the problem is in a sectoral approach, some of these companies are--I don't know if they're a thin tech company, or a tech company, or under the HIPAA regime. And they sort of evade the various regulations because it's not clear where they belong. </p><p>And in any case, once the data has been collected either voluntarily or not, either through the internet of things or at one point you clicked \"I agree\" because you signed up for a social platform. The question is what is the obligation of the company who's in possession of your data? </p><p>And the duty of care is the most simple way to say cross-sectorally, \"You may not intentionally harm any person who's data you're in possession of.\" And that's why the duty of care is such a clean way to address all of this because otherwise, we're going to be always a decade behind whatever these newfangled companies are attempting to do to us. </p><p>But if I could take that for the record please. </p><p>DIXON: Yes, I think that that is a potentially very good approach. I think Vermont did something like this at the state level where they said, \"You cannot purchase data with the intent to defraud or discriminate.\" </p><p>So, I do think that ensuring that fairness is percolating throughout the system is a really good remedy. </p><p>SCHATZ: Thank you. </p><p>CRAPO: Senator Cortez Masto? Oh, did you want to have Dr. </p><p>CORTEZ MASTO: (OFF MIC) </p><p>SCHATZ: I'll take those for the record. </p><p>CRAPO: So, he'll let you respond in writing is what he's saying. </p><p>SCHATZ: Thank you, that's fine. </p><p>CRAPO: Senator Cortez Masto? </p><p>CORTEZ MASTO: Thank you. I appreciate that, but I would like to hear what Dr. Cackley had to say as well. </p><p>CRAPO: All right. </p><p>CACKLEY: So, in terms of I think a duty of care, that a basic part of a comprehensive privacy law, that would--that would be a--a--a good--a good element to include what--what we have with--have reported on is--is be given the gaps that the sectoral approach allows. </p><p>In--in terms of privacy, we--we have--have recommended that Congress really consider a more comprehensive approach and--and include within it several different elements. And a duty of care element would--would--would certainly--should certainly be--be part of that consideration. </p><p>CORTEZ MASTO: Yeah. No, I like that idea too. I think it's very innovative. Along with that would--transparency would be key, right? </p><p>The consumer knows that whatever regulated credit score or unregulated credit score, whatever's being used, that's based on an algorithm that is identifying their factors. They should have access to that, correct? </p><p>CACKLEY: Absolutely. Access, control, ability to-- </p><p>CORTEZ MASTO: Right. </p><p>CACKLEY: Correct. All of those are--are important elements, yes. </p><p>CORTEZ MASTO: Okay. So, Dr.--or excuse me, Ms. Dixon., I understand in 2015, Allstate Insurance began selling consumer driving data. And Allstate Chairman CEO Tom Wilson said that the Property Casualty Insurance Company hopes to profit from the sell of telematics data and then pass on savings to consumers by lowering premiums. Is Allstate unusual in its plans to capture this information about people's driving data to earn additional profit? And I'm just curious, how many insurers have adopted telematics and what's been the impact if you know? </p><p>DIXON: So, my understanding is that they are no longer the only insurance company doing this. </p><p>CORTEZ MASTO: Uh-huh. </p><p>DIXON: There are now several insurance companies and there are also health insurance companies who are saying, \"Hey, give us access to a variety of your data and we will, you know, give you commemorate lower rates when applicable.\" </p><p>So, I think that these are rather uncomfortable things and--to put it mildly. I would really like to see guardrails on how these are used. I don't think we can stop what's happening in prediction. Prediction is getting cheaper-- </p><p>CORTEZ MASTO: Right. </p><p>DIXON: --and it's getting more accurate. So, we can't stop it. However, I think we can take a multifactorial approach to the problems that--the real problems that these situations impose. Do we want consumers giving way their data in order to, you know, have a--a better premium? </p><p>And I--I think that you should be able to--to have protections without giving away your data. You should--we need--we need good rights here. </p><p>CORTEZ MASTO: Right. </p><p>DIXON: And to do that, we're going to have to have good rules of the road that encompass new technology, but keep the values. Let us make a decision and not be financially penalized for it. And should an insurance company be able to sell this data? </p><p>That's a question we need to have as a matter of public discussion. It shouldn't just be decided just by industry. It needs to be a multi-stake holder conversation about that. </p><p>CORTEZ MASTO: And this type of data is what goes into what you've identified as the neighborhood risk scores that-- </p><p>DIXON: That's part of it. </p><p>CORTEZ MASTO: --that companies could use, correct? </p><p>DIXON: Oh, there's so many scores, but yes. </p><p>CORTEZ MASTO: Right, but that could be part of it. </p><p>DIXON: That's exactly right. </p><p>CORTEZ MASTO: There's so much data. </p><p>And the other concern I'm understanding is that because of the--because of the new technology and the algorithms, the concern is that this is--this information with respect to unregulated--unregulated credit scores could end up providing a higher accuracy level than the regulated credit scores such that's the--such that the banks or other financial institutions would start using those unregulated credit scores more so than the regulated. Is that right? </p><p>DIXON: Well, I think that you'll find that banks in particular are very, very careful about these kinds of uses. Of the people that we've interviewed, they've been very, very careful. It's actually--some of the people I worry about the most are the people who are not in banks and who want to pull a credit score product to do marketing. </p><p>And instead of actually going through the regulation and making a firm offer of credit, for insurance they'll just kind of skirt around the edges, and pull the--the, you know, unregulated credit score, and then make these offers. And I--someone discussed today especially if it's a predatory offer. This is where things get very problematic. </p><p>If you have a--a consumer who's identified in the credit score 400-500 level and someone doesn't want to make a firm offer of credit or insurance, but they want that number and they want to use that number to market a product maybe for bill consolidation or payday loans, then I think we all need to be very interested in protections for that. </p><p>CORTEZ MASTO: Thank you. And I--I notice my time is almost also up. I will also just submit this for the record--facial recognition and data that comes from that. It's topical right now and the question would be should that information be shared with third-party--parties like data brokers to be utilized? </p><p>I'm curious your thoughts on--on us or companies in general. I think it was just in the paper today. Airlines were looking at using this type of facial recognition data. So, I--I--I'll submit that for the record. Thank you so much for this conversation today. I appreciate it, Mr. Chairman. </p><p>CRAPO: Thank you. Senator Warner? </p><p>WARNER: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Let me first of all just associate myself with both your comments and the ranking member's comments. It's pretty remarkable that you invited the data industry or data brokers to come and they didn't show up. I think that's--that's a very telling statement. </p><p>I know folks have talked a--about the Fair Credit Reporting Act. I know we've talked about a variety of issues. I--I've been thinking a lot about this in terms of the social media companies, you know. The data brokers are really just one piece of the overall growing data economy and we're talking a lot about third-party vendors. </p><p>Obviously, I've got concerns as well about first party vendors--the Amazon's, the Facebook's, the Google's. And would you both agree that candidly--or that most Americans don't have the slightest idea of what kind of data's being collected about them and what that data is worth? </p><p>CACKLEY: I think it's definitely true that most Americans don't understand the breadth of data that is collected about them. They may have--be aware in certain instances where they have checked yes or--or provided something. But--but they don't--they don't know the--the--the true extent of it. </p><p>WARNER: Ms. Dixon, to you? </p><p>DIXON: Thank you. The--the complexity of data flows right now is--is extraordinary and you are correct. First parties, third parties--everything is blending. And if you look at even just identity, you can have an identity that overlaps in--in 20 different data ecosystems. </p><p>And as a result, it's--it's become very difficult for anyone-- </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>--to map the data. There's this amazing chart that was produced by the advertising industry for itself actually and it--it maps this extraordinarily. It looks like the Tokyo subway lines. I mean, it's incredibly complex and I don't know that it's possible to fully map our data anymore. </p><p>So, if that's the case, how on earth do we cabin practices, so that there is a--a--almost like a routine--a set of routine uses where, \"Here are the acceptable uses for companies. End of discussion.\" Boom. And then, outside of this not acceptable uses. </p><p>We're going to have to find our way to something like that and we might have to distinguish it by sector and by even--perhaps even individual companies. But I'd like to see that very fairly adjudicated. I'm really interested in seeing people talk with each other to figure this out. We need to have very meaningful discussions to figure out where the data's going and how we can best protect it, but I don't think people know how. </p><p>WARNER: Well, one of the things that I'm--that you've touched on--briefly on one of the areas I've got some bipartisan legislation on that would try to focus on some of the manipulative practices--so-called \"dark patterns\" you use where, you know, in laymen's terms you have six sets of arrows clicking on, you know, pointing you towards the \"I agree\" button and you can never find the \"unsubscribe\" button. </p><p>And there are a host of practices that go on in the industry where people give up this information oftentimes unwittingly and through extraordinarily sophisticated psychological tools being used by the companies and others to get this information. </p><p>I--I know my time's getting down. I would just like your commentary. I--I believe consumers ought to have a right to know what data is being collected about them. I believe we need to take it a step further and also have some basic evaluation in terms of how much that--that data is worth and I'm an old Telecom guy. For a long time, it used to be really hard to bring competition in--in the Telco market until we instituted--by government regulation--number portability. </p><p>I believe that same concept--data portability--ought to be brought into the data economy, so that if you are not liking how you're being treated I think about it mostly in the social media context. But there are a variety of areas in the credit scoring areas as well where, you know, if we had that knowledge of what data was being collected, what it's worth--and then, if you didn't like the way Facebook was treating you or some other enterprise, you were easily able to move your--your--all of your data in one swipe to--to a new co or a new platform. I think you could bring some additional competitive practices to--to the area. </p><p>In these last couple of seconds, data evaluation, data knowledge, and data portability--ideas, comments, suggestions? </p><p>DIXON: I really like the idea of data interoperability's, so that there's more freedom. </p><p>WARNER: With portability you've got to have interoperability or it doesn't-- </p><p>DIXON: Yes, but it's--I think it's going to be something that will end up working out in time, but it should be a good priority. </p><p>CACKLEY: So, this isn't something that we've looked at specifically. But I think that to the degree that you're talking about, comprehensive legislation that really covers all of the different platforms and--and parties, then--then that kind of interoperability would--would--would be part of it. </p><p>WARNER: We'd like to share with both of you some of the work we've been doing and I think there's a-- </p><p>CACKLEY: Yeah. </p><p>WARNER: --could be broad-based bipartisan support. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. </p><p>CRAPO: Thank you. Senator Kennedy? </p><p>KENNEDY: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. If I go on the internet, and I search, and I look at social media, and I buy something on Amazon let's say, who--I mean, my--my actions--my behavior is recorded. We call it data. Who owns it? </p><p>DIXON: I have a whitepaper I'm going to send to you. We've spent a lot of time thinking about this issue. So, the issue of data ownership is quite difficult to parse. But let me give you my best shot-- </p><p>KENNEDY: Yes, ma'am. </p><p>DIXON: --and let's have a discussion. </p><p>KENNEDY: If--if--well-- </p><p>DIXON: So-- </p><p>KENNEDY: --I'd like to have a discussion, but first I'd like to have an answer. </p><p>DIXON: Here's the answer. I view data as--in our current data ecosystems--as a common pool resource. I think a lot of different entities can lay claim to that data. However, no one gets to own it. And--well, in some cases-- </p><p>KENNEDY: You don't think that I own my data? </p><p>DIXON: --you can. It depends on where you've used it and where it is. I think there's some-- </p><p>KENNEDY: Not on how much you-- </p><p>DIXON: Yeah. </p><p>CACKLEY: I don't think there is a--an answer to--to who owns that--your data when once you've--you've taken an action especially in--in some ways interacted with a--with another company. </p><p>KENNEDY: Well let's suppose that Congress passed a law that said the consumer owns his data and he or she can knowingly license it. What would be wrong with that? </p><p>CACKLEY: I--I don't think there--there be anything wrong with it. I think it would--it would have impact on--on who could then collect that your data or whether data could be collected. </p><p>KENNEDY: No, I can--I can--I could license my data knowingly. </p><p>CACKLEY: Right. </p><p>KENNEDY: Now, what--what--in--in--in terms of knowingly licensing my data that I own, what sort of disclosures should a social media company for example make to me in terms of how it's going to use my data? Right now, they make disclosures but--but they're--there--they're--they don't inform the consumer. I've said before, some of those things are seven, eight, nine, ten pages written by lawyers. You could hide a dead body in them and nobody would find them--find the body, I mean nobody reads them. That's not knowing consent. What--what does a social media company have to tell me in order for me to know what they're doing? </p><p>DIXON: May I offer an example from the--the medical field? So under--under HIPAA, there are very meaningful mechanisms prior to a consumer agreeing to release their information outside of the protection of HIPPA. However, one of the concerns that's come up with this is that it's become very, very easy for consumers patients to \"donate their data.\" And what's happened is that people have donated their data and taken it out of the protections of HIPPA without meaningful consent. </p><p>KENNEDY: I'm not--I'm not trying to be rude, I'm trying to get answers. Here's my question. If I own my data and I license it, I need to understand what license it--licensing it means. What needs to be disclosed to me? </p><p>DIXON: My understanding, looking at other fields because this is not something I have studied at length. My understanding is that the--that is a serious agreement and it would require massive disclosures. I think you could almost put a graveyard in that disclosure, you know, compared to-- </p><p>KENNEDY: And you don't--you don't think it's possible to--to write a disclosure that the consumer would understand. Is that what you imply? </p><p>DIXON: In this area, I'd have to really look at that--that--again, this is not an area of research for me but I--I-- </p><p>KENNEDY: What do you think (INAUDIBLE)? </p><p>CACKLEY: I think it--it would be--it would be very complicated. So it is not an area that we've looked at either but--but just in--if--if Congress were to pass a law that allowed consumers to license their own data, that would just create a large amount of--of regulations to go along with that. </p><p>KENNEDY: So you both think that we should just allow companies to do what they want with our data, that this is a--this is a problem this problem is impossible to solve? </p><p>CACKLEY: No, no, and I don't think I meant that at all. I just meant that it would--it would have to be worked through, it--it's not an easy fix. It's--it's-- </p><p>KENNEDY: No, I don't think an easy fix is around here. </p><p>DIXON: And I don't mean that either. I--I believe that we should have rules of the road and we should have agreed upon rules on what-- </p><p>KENNEDY: That--that's--I agree with that too and--and everybody--I mean, we've had a lot of interesting discussions about this but--but no offense to you two, but then the experts never offer a solution. So to me, the solution is consumer owns his data, you can license it, the licensing has to be knowing and--and intentional. You can move your data, portability should--should be an option. I can change my mind about licensing it and--and companies will adapt to that, they'll have no choice. Thank you, Mr. chairman. </p><p>CRAPO: Senator Menendez. </p><p>MENENDEZ: Thank you Mr. Chairman. I had the same concerns as Senator Kennedy because we seem to be living and in age of data breaches. Just last week, we learned of a breach concerning a medical billing company, America Medical Coalition Agency that may have exposed the personal financial and even medical data of 20 million patients who are customers of Quest Diagnostics and LabCorp. </p><p>So let me ask you, Ms. Dixon, people are rightly concerned that some of their personal data is now exposed and could be used against them. Can data brokers legally compile aggregate or sell data that has been acquired through an illegal hack? </p><p>DIXON: I haven't, I am not an attorney. So I think that's a question that an attorney could better answer you. But my first best guess is I don't think you can use improperly inferme--information that has been disclosed in an unauthorized manner for your own business purposes. That seems like that would be really out of balance. </p><p>MENENDEZ: Dr. Cackley, do you have any idea? </p><p>CACKLEY: I don't know the answer but I can certainly find out. </p><p>MENENDEZ: Yeah, well I appreciate that. Should people be concerned the data not otherwise covered by HIPAA is ending up in the hands of data brokers even in the absence of a hack? Are billing companies like America Medical Coalition Agencies selling non-HIPAA data to brokers? </p><p>DIXON: This is an ongoing area of grave concern for us. There are actual scores of health data. There's a frailty score that can predict very closely how sick you are and when you might possibly die. I think that there are all sorts of scores and products so related to-- </p><p>MENENDEZ: Not sure I want to check on that data myself but-- </p><p>DIXON: Yeah me either. But--but-- </p><p>MENENDEZ: But that's--that's pretty frightening, isn't it? </p><p>DIXON: It is and health--you know, health data that is not covered under HIPAA is become an increasing area so-- </p><p>MENENDEZ: Let me ask you this. When hackers gained access to non-HIPAA data like in the Quest data breach, can data brokers apply machine learning to these data points to infer or reconstruct sensitive HIPPA protected medical data? </p><p>DIXON: I actually don't think that they need to acquire unauthorized data in order to do that. They can just look at our purchase histories and get an awful lot of data about us. But in terms of what's happening with this entire area, the data breaches of medical data actually can lead to forms of identity theft and medical identity theft that are very, very difficult to cure and you can have extremely meaningful consequences in people's life. </p><p>MENENDEZ: Let me ask you then. HIPAA's nearly 25 years old and in 2009, high tech provided updates which were concerning health information technology, but I'm still concerned that we're playing catch-up when it comes to protecting patients. And, you know, of all the information that should be private and privileged to you, your health standing should be extraordinary. There are all types of consequences in that in employment, in discrimination and a whole host of things. Are there gaps in HIPAA and other data security laws that need to be addressed to better protect people today in this 21st century threat? What's coordination is missing between existing legal protections? </p><p>DIXON: I--I do think there's gaps and the biggest gaps that exist right now are the gaps that exist between the sectoral protections. And I don't think the answer is to just rip out the sector protections that exist such as a Fair Credit Reporting Act or HIPAA or Sarbanes-Oxley etc, but to find a way to fill those gaps in. For example, victims of medical identity theft can use their Fair Credit Reporting Act rights to get their financial information corrected, but under HIPAA they are--it is--it's not possible for them because it doesn't exist in this statute. </p><p>It's not possible for them to get a deletion similar to the FCRA in their health files so they could actually carry around inaccurate information which can really have an impact on their treatment and insurance costs and there's not a solution yet. So this is the kind of gap we need to address. </p><p>MENENDEZ: Lastly there's one breach that compromises the personal information of 20 million pra--patients, that's pretty troubling. One data broker has data on 300 million consumers. We're still reeling from the Equifax breach which affected 145.5 million consumers. If the information of 300 million consumers were to be compromised, we might start calling for private information, public information because at the end of the day, that's the result of it. </p><p>What's the ramifications for consumer if a data broker is breached and should we hold them to a higher standard of security especially because their volume is so consequential? </p><p>DIXON: Data broker breaches are very significant. So my--my assessment of this is that the--the various state data breach laws are doing a pretty good job especially in some cases where the data breach law is quite strong in forcing disclosures and--and notices but I think we need to do more to ensure that all of the information held that is sensitive and health related etc, is duly notified to the consumer. </p><p>The problem with the data brokers is what they will say is, oh wait, wait, we don't have a direct relationship with the consumers, we can't notify them. And I think that is a gap that needs to be resolved. Now, the state of Vermont has resolved that gap. </p><p>MENENDEZ: They could--they could--they could reach back to the entity that provided them the data in the first place and they could notify. Could they not? </p><p>DIXON: I believe that that could happen and it has happened-- </p><p>MENENDEZ: I just think--I just think they should be held to a higher standard of security because the consequences of incredible numbers of Americans that are subject to having their privacy breached and their healthcare breached is just beyond acceptance. Thank you, Mr. chairman. </p><p>CRAPO: Thank you. Senator Rounds. </p><p>ROUNDS: Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you for holding this--this hearing today. I--I--I'd like to see if I--in--in listening to this, if I've picked up the grasp of some of the challenges we have here. It would appear to me that--that we're talking about first of all the question of the security of the data that's actually being collected. Second of all, it appears that we're questioning whether or not, there is an appropriate way for individual consumers or individuals to actually find out and to have access to what these organizations, these non-regulated organizations actually have. </p><p>And Finally, that this appears that may very well be a workaround with regard to the information that's being collected and then disseminated from what a regulated entity would have. In a nutshell, are those the three areas and would there be other areas that you would also identify? I would ask each of you for your thoughts. </p><p>CACKLEY: Those are certainly three of the--of the main points that have come up today. I think the oth--other piece that we haven't touched on maybe as much is outside of--of the--the data brokers themselves. There are--there are other technologies where--where privacy issues that have to do with--with, you know, mobile devices, with facial recognition technology, we did mention that, with financial technology that are--that are also areas of concern that--that are--fall outside potentially the--the protections of FCRA in particular. </p><p>ROUNDS: The use of machine learning and artificial intelligence in this process. Okay, miss Dixon. </p><p>DIXON: So my focus has really never been on the technologies as an endpoint. My focus has always been on okay, so we have technological processes that are going to continue through time but what does that actually mean in practice that I've always looked at the practice? So your--your assessment of where the sticking points are is accurate. The thing I would add is this. </p><p>I think it's going to become as we move forward and prediction gets cheaper, I think prediction is going to be coming to a mobile phone near us like ours, and I think we have to be very cautious about looking at categories of technologies and label--labeling them as bad. Similarly, in industry, I think we have to be very careful and say okay, what are the practices that we want to go after here and want to address because they're harming consumers? And if we can do that in a truly multifactorial way, I think that will be helpful. </p><p>Wherever these practices exist, wherever they are, we need to be addressing them because they're meaningful and they have impact. </p><p>ROUNDS: There's a difference between the way that we have looked at data and data collection and privacy in the United States versus the way that it's been done in some other parts of the world. Here, we follow and we use Gramm-Leach-Bliley within the United States but in Europe they take a different approach, the GDPR which seeks to really achieve a--a different and more comprehensive approach but would be rather challenging. </p><p>Can you share with me the thought process or your analysis of the differences or the advantages one versus the other between the way that we handle it today in the United States versus what they have--what they're doing in Europe with the GDPR in its current form? </p><p>CACKLEY: So we haven't looked at GDPR directly yet but I can say that that there are definitely some elements of GDPR that are--are already embodied in the--the fair information practices principles that--that are the basis of--of some of our privacy regulation already. There are other pieces that--that--that are not and--and one of the main ones I would say is the right to be forgotten which is a part of GDPR that--that really doesn't--it isn't encompassed in--in anything here. </p><p>ROUNDS: (INAUDIBLE) Ms. Dixon. </p><p>DIXON: Sorry. The GDPR, the--as you know it's--it--it was built on the EU 9546. So it's--it's--it has a lot of bureaucratic history behind it. If you look at what they were trying to do in all the derogations and whatnot, it's a really complex and thoughtful structure. I think that it does provide for baseline privacy protections, but they don't have the sectoral system and they don't have government privacy. So I think there is one thing I'll say, in--in--in our country the Privacy Act is very effective in--in regulating certain aspects of government information collection, they don't have anything like that. </p><p>ROUNDS: Thank you and I see my time has expired, Mr. chairman. Thank you both of you for your--for your answers today and Mr. chairman once again, thank you for the--the opportunity here today with the--this--this hearing on this very important topic. </p><p>CRAPO: Thank You senator Rounds. Senator Sinema. </p><p>SINEMA: Thank you Mr. chairman and--and thank you to our witnesses for being here today. At the committee's last hearing on privacy, I spoke about the importance of privacy to Arizonans. We are practical people who want the modern conveniences that technology brings but we value our privacy. So I'm committed to making sure that Arizonans know how our data is being used so that we can make informed decisions. </p><p>Arizonans also don't like assumptions being made about us or how we choose to live our lives particularly if some of those assumptions are wrong, which is why current privacy and consumer scoring laws concern both me and many Arizonans. In 2013, the FTC competed and published a 10-year congressionally mandated study on the accuracy of credit reports. The FTC found that one in five consumers had an error on at least one of their three credit reports. </p><p>So Ms. Dixon, first thank you for being here. I want you to talk quickly about credit scores as a starting point and what happens if you and I were one of those consumers. How drastically could an error in a credit report negatively affect an Arizonans credit score? </p><p>DIXON: Yes. That--that effect would be profound. So for example, for victims of identity theft, if someone has run up your credit and it's not actually your error, you could be seen as not making your payments, etc., and you can literally move from a 780 score to a 620 in very short order, only takes about a month. And then what you have is a situation where if you are about to buy a home and this is--these are from the calls we get. This isn't just a hypothesis here- the--the home you're about to buy all of a sudden, you can't qualify for a mortgage you because of identity theft. So yes, any error from any source that's in your credit report, it is a piece of serious business. </p><p>SINEMA: So Ms. Dixon, you said this could potentially prevent an Arizonian from buying a home. Would it also get in the way of financing an education or starting a small business or expanding one's business? </p><p>DIXON: Absolutely. </p><p>SINEMA: Wow, that's really troubling. Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, if an Arizonan thinks his or her credit report or score's inaccurate, they can appeal it with the bureau, is that correct? And if so, how? </p><p>DIXON: Yes, there is a--there is a very specific procedure outlined in law where the--the bureaus must respond and there is a series of steps that they can take and both the--the Federal Trade Commission and the CFPB have numerous help and hotlines to help everyone through and the state AG's also do as well but they're--they're very well documented recourses for consumers in this situation. </p><p>SINEMA: Well that's good. So we've established it's important to have an accurate credit score and there's a process to appeal it and fix it. But increasingly, businesses are using so called consumer scores that rank, rate, and segment consumers based on public private and government data that's packaged and sold by data brokers and others. So sometimes, as public data is inaccurate, it's often outdated or it could be incomplete. So are all consumer scores made available to consumers just like credit scores are? </p><p>DIXON: Actually, almost none of them are. In fact, I've had almost no success despite trying to get consumer scores and asking companies for my consumer score. It is almost impossible to get them. </p><p>SINEMA: But then how would an Arizonan know if his or her consumer score was inaccurate if they can't get access to it? </p><p>DIXON: That's the same question I have. They would not know. </p><p>SINEMA: Well, so let's say that an Arizonan were able to find out that his or her consumer score is inaccurate. Are all consumer scores covered under the FCRA so that there's a similar appeals process to resolve inaccuracies? </p><p>DIXON: No consumer scores are that are unregulated are currently covered under the FCRA unless it is a formal credit score as articulated by the FCRA and it used in an eligibility circumstance and it's not covered. </p><p>SINEMA: Well, that's very concerning but thank you for sharing that information with us. Mr. Chairman and ranking member Brown, it's clear that we have a lot of work to do here. We've got to update our privacy laws to reflect new trends that are occurring in both business and technology to make sure that Americans have the right to correct their record, whether it's their credit score or their consumer score on who they are, how they live their lives and what mistakes or inaccuracies that might be over occurring in their lives. </p><p>So I thank you for being here our witnesses and I look forward to working with the committee on this and Mr. chairman, I yield back. </p><p>CRAPO: Thank you. That concludes the first round but Senator--Senator Brown and I would like to do a second round and you're welcome to join in with us senators if you would like. </p><p>There's so many questions. One of them I want to get back to which has been brought up by several senators is this notion of the tension between doing a comprehensive bill like the GDPR in Europe or a sectoral approach like we do in the United States, and I think we all can understand there's sort of a push and a pull on both sides of that question. </p><p>It seems to me though that we don't have a choice at least at a basic level to deal with all data collection in the same way. I think one of you mentioned earlier that it's all blending. It used to be that we could clearly distinguish what a credit bureau did and the credit report that a credit bureau prepared. Now, we have massive amounts. I think Senator Brown referenced the 4,000 number. But I don't even know what the number is of entities that are collecting data. </p><p>My understanding is that the apps on my iPhone, many of them collect data even when I'm not using them to report further to others about whatever it is, data that's not even often related to the app. And it seems to me that all of that data is in one way or another not just blending, but being utilized for many, many different purposes. One of which is credit, one of which is retail sales one of which is college applications, one of it is mortgages. I mean the list can go on and on and on. </p><p>So I guess I'd like to have each of you just briefly, because I have got some more questions but briefly indicate. Do you believe that--that's--that at some basic point, the United States needs to have a comprehensive set of standards and requirements that would cover some basics like when data is being collected, who's collecting it, whether there's an opt-in or an opt-out, what rights to manage or even remove if once data exists? </p><p>CACKLEY: Yes, I think that's--that is where we are right now is--is that the sectoral approach is--it leaves too many gaps and a comprehensive framework. Maybe not completely changing to--to only a comprehensive framework. You could--you could merge the two in some ways but a comprehensive framework that gives a basic privacy rights and--and abilities for consumers to know what their data is and--and how to correct it, how to control it is--is definitely something that needs to be--to be addressed. </p><p>CRAPO: Thank you. Ms. Dixon. </p><p>DIXON: Let me share with you that I've been seeking an answer to the question you just asked for about 27 years. So here's what I've come up with and it's just--it's my opinion. What if the sectoral system was a feature, not a bug born from thoughtful deliberation about very focused issue areas with a lot of buy-in? What if we have not been able to pass comprehensive legislation because our system requires more buy-in than other systems? </p><p>These are just the hypotheses that I'm working with. So if that is the case and also, I have to tell you, I'm quite concerned about the deep disruption to privacy law that would occur if there was massive preemption. But be that the case, what if there was a way to do a surgical strike and provide guardrails in the areas that need it the most that would fill in the sectoral grant--gaps? That's what I'm very interested in. </p><p>So I think that something that had really important principles, Fair Information practices principles, and then the adaptation of those principles for the gaps that exist. So I do think that standards have been a neglected part of the privacy conversation. I have no idea why we don't have more standards in privacy. This mobile phone has loads of standards that attach to it but for our privacy and for data brokers, where are the standards? Well, let's create some, let's start there. </p><p>I'm all for starting cautiously and working with best practices too but to give things teeth and to abide by the--the larger principle. So a nice amalgamation of all the above, something that's multifactorial. I don't think we have silver bullets available to us anymore. </p><p>CRAPO: Well, thank you and just one other quick question and I'll turn to Senator Brown. We've talked a lot about the problems we're trying to address there, whether harm is caused by the use of data, whether credit is impacted, whether people are redlined or denied access to products or opportunities. It seems to me that when you--when you approach the issue from that perspective which is a very legitimate approach, that there is another issue that is--I don't know if I would call it a harm, maybe it is. But there's simply a privacy issue. </p><p>A lot of Americans I believe don't want to have to prove that they were harmed. They don't want people collecting data on them or they don't want certain data collected. It's sort of the right to be forgotten or the right to opt out of certain segments of data collection. Is that a legitimate right that we should try to protect? </p><p>DIXON: It's a legitimate option that we need to be able to have, the--the adversity score. I think that any child who's applying for college should be able to say, hey wait, I don't want my neighborhood being part of that. Do they have to prove harm? I don't think they should have to. They should be able to say, hey no, this is not something I want, it's legitimate. </p><p>CRAPO: Dr. Cackley. </p><p>CACKLEY: I think that's right that--that it's important for people to be able to make a choice about what data they share and what--and what data they don't. </p><p>CRAPO: Senator Brown. </p><p>BROWN: Thank you. Ms. Dixon, this is your last round of questions, blessedly for both of you and please be really brief on these because I have some trouble questions. Should federal regulators and supervisors have full access to every company's predictive models so they can evaluate them for bias and other legal compliance? </p><p>DIXON: I believe they would have to hire about a million people if they did that. I'm not sure of the answer to that question but I have a lot of thoughts on this and I will send you a written follow up. </p><p>BROWN: That would be good including is there a list of companies whose models you believe should be available to regulators for review maybe-- </p><p>DIXON: Send that to you. </p><p>BROWN: Okay, technology expert our last hearing stated while our online economy depends on collection and permanent storage of highly personal data, we don't have the capacity to keep such large collections of user data safe over time. Do you agree with that statement? </p><p>DIXON: I think it's very difficult to keep user data safe 100 percent of the time. </p><p>BROWN: Should they be require--should companies be required to expunge certain types of user data after say 60 or 90 days? </p><p>DIXON: You know, there--I think there are very good arguments for that and there's a--there's a continuum for that and I will respond to that in writing. </p><p>BROWN: Okay thanks. Do companies who personally use--who currently use personal data for profit see existing penalties as little more than the cost of doing business that's--that's often the case in this town that a few million dollar fine on a multi-million dollar company is the cost of doing business. Did this strong--how strong do penalties and other enforcement mechanisms need to be in order to hold these companies accountable? </p><p>DIXON: I don't know the answer to that question. However, I do think that having very good enforcement is an important stick and I think we needs carrots and sticks to make things right. </p><p>BROWN: To holding executives account personally accountable one way? </p><p>DIXON: I don't know about that. </p><p>BROWN: (INAUDIBLE) or you just don't know? </p><p>DIXON: I literally don't know the answer to that. </p><p>BROWN: Okay, okay. A technology expert in our last hearing state was possible in principle to throw one's laptop into the sea and renounce all technology. It's no longer possible to opt out of a surveillance society. Do you believe that statement? </p><p>DIXON: Absolutely. I don't believe that an opt-out village exists. </p><p>BROWN: So what would a meaningful consent contract between users and tech companies or users and data brokers or meaningful opt-out policy look like? </p><p>DIXON: So it needs to be multifactorial and not just rely on consent because consent is a really difficult vehicle for that. I have a lot of very complete thoughts on that and I will follow up in writing. </p><p>BROWN: Okay, you're gonna be busy in the next few days. </p><p>DIXON: That's right. I have a lot on this so. </p><p>BROWN: And last question, you point out in your testimony household data can serve as a proxy for an individual credit score. Some data that seems innocuous like Instagram posts can actually yield predictive data about a user's mental health. How do we know what data is inherently sensitive and what data is innocuous but become--can become sensitive when it's used to make predictions? </p><p>DIXON: Right. One of the most difficult things that I've had to grapple with as a privacy expert and someone who cares so much about privacy is that it's so difficult to say here, this is sensitive data, here this is sensitive data. It's all becoming sensitive depending on how its analyzed and that's why privacy protections have had to become much more multifactorial and much more subtle and in responding to this new issue. </p><p>BROWN: In--in part, that--that that movement if you will from--that is initially not sensitive but becomes that as--as a result of just the--the power of computer--companies--the--the quantity and quality of computer--of computing power, correct? </p><p>DIXON: We were in a digital era. We're really moving into the predictive era and it changes everything. </p><p>BROWN: Okay, very good thank you, Mr. Chairman. </p><p>CRAPO: Thank you. And that does conclude the question for today's hearing. For senators who wish to submit questions for the record, those questions are due to the committee by Tuesday June 18th and we ask the witnesses to respond to those questions as quickly as you can once you receive them. Again, we thank you both for not only your time here today but the attention and--and analysis that you've given to this issue and we'll give to the issue as we proceed. With that, this hearing is adjourned. </p></bodyText></section></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">POLTRN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WCN-2NG1-JDPT-T4F0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">147909</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><publicationInfo><publicationName>CQ Transcriptions</publicationName><bodyText><p>All materials herein are protected by United States copyright law and may not be reproduced, distributed, transmitted, displayed, published or broadcast without the prior written permission of CQ Transcriptions.

Providing testimony to the committee today are experts who have researched and written extensively on big data--Dr. Alicia Cackley, the director of the Financial Markets and Community Investment at the Government Accountability Office and Ms. Pam Dixon, executive director of the World Privacy Forum. We appreciate both of you being here. </p><p>As a result of increasingly digital--an increasingly digital economy, more personal information is available to companies and others than ever before. I've been troubled by government agencies and private companies collection of personally identifiable information for a long time. There have been many questions about how individuals or groups of individuals information is collected, with whom it is shared or sold, how it is used and how it is secured. Private companies are collecting, processing, analyzing and sharing massive data on individuals for all kinds of purposes. </p><p>Even more troubling is that the vast majority of Americans do not even know what data is being collected, when it's being collected, how it's being collected, by whom and for what purpose. In particularly, data brokers and technology companies including large social media platforms and search engines play a central role in gathering vast amounts of personal information and often without interacting with individuals specifically in the case of data brokers. </p><p>In 2013, the GAO issued a report on information resellers which includes data brokers and the need for the consumer privacy framework to reflect changes in technology in the marketplace. The report that the current statutory consumer privacy framework fails to address fully new technologies and the growing marketplace for personal information. The GAO also provided several recommendations to Congress on how to approach the issue to provide consumers with more control over their data. </p><p>In 2018--five years later--GAO published a blog summarizing its 2013 report highlighting the continued relevance of the report's findings. The Federal Trade Commission also released a report in 2014 that emphasized the big row of data brokers in the economy. The FTC observed in its report that data brokers collect and store billions of data elements covering nearly every U.S. consumer and that data brokers collect data from numerous sources largely without consumers knowledge. </p><p>In her report \"The Scoring of America\", Pam Dixon discusses predictive consumer scoring across the country--across the economy including the big role that data brokers play. She stresses that today, no protections exist for most consumer scores similar to those that apply to credit scores under the Fair Credit Reporting Act. </p><p>Dixon says, \"Consumer scores are today where credit scores were in the 1950's. Data brokers, merchants, government entities and others can create or use a consumer score without notice to consumers.\" </p><p>Dr. Cackley has also issued several reports on consumer privacy and technology including a report in September 2013 on information resellers which includes data brokers. She says in her report that the current consumer privacy framework does not fully address new technologies and the vastly increased marketplace for personal information. She also discusses potential gaps in current federal law including the Fair Credit Reporting Act. </p><p>The Banking Committee has been examining the data issue in both the private and public sectors from regulators to financial companies, to other companies who gather vast amounts of personal information on individuals or groups of individuals to see what can be done through legislation, regulation, or by instituting best practices. </p><p>Enacted in 1970, the Fair Credit Reporting Act is a law in the Banking Committee's jurisdiction which aims to promote the accuracy, fairness, and privacy of consumer information contained in the files of consumer reporting agencies. Given the exponential growth and use of data since that time, the rise of entities that appear to serve a similar function as the original credit reporting agencies, it's worth examining how the Fair Credit Reporting Act should work in a digital economy. </p><p>During today's hearing, I look forward to hearing more about the structure and practices of the data broker industry and technology companies such as large social media platforms, how data broker--the data broker industry has evolved within the development of new technologies and their interaction with technological--technology companies, what information these entities collect, how it is collected, and whom it is shared with, and for what purposes. What gaps exist in federal privacy law and what changes to federal law should be considered to give individuals real control over their data. </p><p>I appreciate each of you joining us today and look forward to getting some further information about these questions. Senator Brown? </p><p>BROWN: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate your continuing these important bipartisan efforts to protect Americans since it's sensitive personal information. We're looking today at a shadow injury known as data brokers. Most of us--most of you probably haven't heard of these companies. The biggest ones include names like Axiom, Encore Logic, and Spokio, and Zoom Info, and maybe one you've heard of called Oracle. </p><p>According to some estimates, 4,000 of these companies collect and sell private information. But stunningly--and I'm not sure I've ever used that word in this committee--stunningly, not one of them has been willing to show up and speak in front of this committee today. Not one. </p><p>These companies expected--expect to be trusted with the most personal and private information you could imagine about a--about millions and millions of Americans. They're not even willing to show up and explain how their industry works. Some define this as cowardice. It's hard to disagree with that. I think it tells you all you need to know about how much they want their own faces and names associated with that industry. </p><p>As Mache Zagorsky (PH) told us in our last hearing, \"The daily activities of most Americans are now tracked and permanently recorded by automated systems at Google or Facebook.\" Most of that private activity isn't useful without data that anchors it to the real world. Facebook, Google, Amazon want to know where you're using your credit cards, where you buy your brand name appliances, if you're recently divorced, how big your life insurance policy is--the kind of data that big tech gets from data brokers. </p><p>They then combine it with your social media activity to feed into their algorithms. You might've noticed it seems like every product or service you buy comes with a survey or a warning card that asks for--asks for strangely personal information. Why are all these non-tech companies so interested in your data? </p><p>It's simple. Data brokers will pay these companies for any of your personal information they can get their hands on, so they can turn around and sell it to the--to Silicon Valley. It's hard for ordinary consumers to have any power when unbeknownst to them, they're actually--they are actually the product bought and sold. </p><p>It reminds me of a time when corporations that had no business being in the lending industry decided to start making loans and selling them off to Wall Street. We know what happened. Manufacturers or car companies decided that consumer credit would be a great way to boost their profits. When big banks and big tech are willing to pay for something, everyone else will find a way to sell it to them often with devastating results. </p><p>For example, Amazon's undermining retailers and manufacturing across the country through NI competitive practices. The same time it scoops up information from the very businesses it's pushing out of the market. There's Facebook almost singlehandedly undermining the profitability of newspapers across the country. It also gobbles up personal information. </p><p>The New York Times allows data brokers to collect from its leaders. Just like in the financial crisis, a group of shadowy players sits at the center of the market exercising enormous influence over consumers in the economy while facing little or no rules at all. Then they don't share up. </p><p>Jeremy Crapo and I are committing to shining a light on these companies to keep an unregulated data economy from spiraling out of control. </p><p>Yesterday it was reported a Department of Homeland Security contractor allowed unauthorized access to photos of travelers and their license plates to be exposed to potential identity thieves. One of the principal differences between the two political parties in this town is the suspicion that democrats have of private power and the suspicion republicans typically have of government power. I think you're seeing two parties come together on our suspicion of what these data brokers are doing. </p><p>The chairman and I agree that protecting sensitive information like this is timely and important. I look forward to the witness's testimony. Thanks. </p><p>CRAPO: Thank you, Senator Brown and I appreciate our partnership on this issue. We will go in the order I introduced you. And Dr. Cackley, you may begin. But before you do, let me just remind both of you that we would like you to keep your initial remarks to five minutes, so that we can have plenty of time for the senators to engage with you. Dr. Cackley? </p><p>CACKLEY: Thank you, Chairman Crapo, Ranking Member Brown and members of the committee. I'm pleased to be here today to discuss GAO's work on consumer privacy and information resellers also known as data brokers. My remarks are primarily based on our September 2013 report on privacy--privacy issues related to information resellers, as well as more recent work on internet privacy, data protection, facial recognition, and financial technology. </p><p>My statement will focus on two main issues--the lack of an overarching federal privacy law and gaps that exist in the current consumer privacy framework. No overarching federal privacy law governs the collection, use and sale of personal information among private sector companies including information resellers. </p><p>There are also no federal laws designed specifically to address all the products sold and information maintained by information resellers. Instead, federal privacy laws covering the private sector are narrowly tailored to specific purposes, situations, types of information and/or entities such as data related to financial transactions, personal health and eligibility for credit. </p><p>For example, the Fair Credit Reporting Act requires that sensitive consumer information be protected and restricts how it is shared. But the law only applies to information used to determine eligibility for things like credit, insurance and employment. </p><p>Similarly, the Gramm Leach Bliley Act restricts how certain financial information is shared, but it only applies to entities that fall under the law specific definition of a financial institution. Other privacy statutes address other specific circumstances, but there is no federal statute that comprehensively addresses privacy issues in the private sector. </p><p>GAO has stated previously that gaps exist in the U.S consumer privacy framework. We've reported that federal law provides consumers with limited ability to access, control and correct their personal data--particularly data used for marketing purposes. </p><p>Similarly, individuals generally cannot prevent their personal information from being collected, used and shared. Yet information that resellers collect and share for marketing purposes can be very personal or sensitive. For example, it can include information about physical and mental health, income and assets, political affiliations, and sexual habits, and orientation. </p><p>Another area where there are gaps in the consumer privacy framework is with respect to new technologies. For example, federal law does not address expressly when companies can use facial recognition technology to identify or track individuals, nor does it address when consumer knowledge or consent should be required for its use. </p><p>Similarly, no federal privacy law explicitly addresses the full range of practices for tracking or collecting data from consumers online activity, or the application software from mobile devices. And the rise of financial services technologies--known as FinTech--raises new privacy concerns. For example, because new sources of personal data are being used to determine credit worthiness. </p><p>In summary, new markets and technologies have vastly changed the amount of personal information private companies collect and how they use it. But our current privacy framework does not fully address these changes. Laws protecting privacy interests are tailored to specific sectors and uses. And consumers have little control over how their information is collected, used and shared with third parties for marketing purposes. </p><p>As a result, the current privacy framework warrants reconsideration by Congress in relation to consumer interests, new technologies and other issues. Chairman Crapo, Ranking Member Brown, and members of the committee, this concludes my statement. I would be pleased to answer any questions you may have. </p><p>CRAPO: Thank you. Ms. Dixon? </p><p>DIXON: Thank you, Chairman Crapo, Ranking Member Brown, and members of the committee. Thank you for your invitation and for the opportunity to talk about something very, very meaningful today--the Fair Credit Reporting Act, data brokers and privacy. </p><p>Fifty years ago, this committee struck a blow for consumers, for transparency and for fairness when it passed the Fair Credit Reporting Act. This committee talked with stakeholders. They found best practices and before the Hugh--the famous Hugh Report came out--the committee report that defined what became fair information practices--this committee created the Fair Credit Reporting Act. </p><p>It was and still is the most important American privacy law that we have. But it's not as important as it was. There are three reasons why. </p><p>First, credit scores and other scores are being sold and used in consumers lives and these are unregulated. </p><p>Second, the technology of prediction--what can be called predictive analytics otherwise known as AI and machine learning. This technology--and suite of technologies--has advanced profoundly and especially in the last 3-4 years. New kinds of predictabilities have come forth and we have new levels of accuracy in prediction, so that what used to be the accuracy of the credit score now is also the accuracy of an unregulated credit score. And this introduces new problems for consumers. </p><p>Third, these scores are created without due process for consumers. How on earth do we deal with this? </p><p>This is why Congress must expand the Fair Credit Reporting Act to regulate currently unregulated scores especially in the financial sector that are being used in meaningful ways in consumers lives. </p><p>We have other solutions to discuss and other issues to discuss. I look forward to your questions. Thank you. </p><p>CRAPO: Thank you very much, Ms. Dixon. I'd like to ask each of you to answer my first three questions and then I want to get into more discussion. But I would like you--if you possibly can--to limit your answers to yes or no answers to the first three. I know you'll be tempted to elaborate, but I'll give you that chance. </p><p>First, do you agree that data brokers collect and process vast amounts of personal information on nearly every American to the extent that they hold more information about individuals than the U.S. government, or traditional credit, and bureaus? </p><p>CACKLEY: Yes. </p><p>DIXON: Yes. </p><p>CRAPO: Second, do you both agree that most Americans have no knowledge of these activities and in most cases no rights to access, correct, or control the information collected about them? </p><p>DIXON: Yes. </p><p>CACKLEY: Yes. </p><p>CRAPO: And then, third, can certain processing and uses of this information have significant impacts on their financial lives? </p><p>CACKLEY: Yes. </p><p>DIXON: Yes, absolutely. </p><p>CRAPO: All right, now we'll get to where you can elaborate. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>You have both authored reports as the FTC in 2014 that highlighted the gaps in the Fair Credit Reporting Act and other privacy laws. You've both testified about that in your introductory remarks. </p><p>These gaps allow data brokers to evade certain requirements that shouldn't be implied--imposed on them. What are the steps that we can take? You indicated Ms. Dixon that we need to expand the Fair Credit Reporting Act and you essentially said the same thing, Dr. Cackley. But what specifically does this committee need to do with regard to that? </p><p>DIXON: Thank you. In regards to the Fair Credit Reporting Act, it--it--I think very small changes would be very meaningful. Let me give you an example. Right now, as you know--as you well know, the Fair Credit Reporting Act in regards to credit scores applies to individuals. So, when we are, you know, that is regulated the--at the individual level. </p><p>However, if you look at the new forms of credit scores that are available, they are scored at the household level where the Fair Credit Reporting Act does not apply. So, you take a zip plus four and you--you score a household, and give them let's say a score of 720. The household has a very accurate score of 720, then that becomes an unregulated form of credit score. And, you now, these scores were quasi-accurate. That's changed. </p><p>CRAPO: Thank you. Dr. Cackley? </p><p>CACKLEY: The Fair Credit Reporting Act has a--a certain number of--of elements to it that are--that are very helpful. It gives consumers access, control, the ability to correct information and--and safeguards privacy. But it only applies for certain--in certain situations for eligibility decisions. It would be possible to think about looking at a broader set of personal, sensitive information that--that the Fair Credit Reporting Act could cover that would give consumers more of those things--access control, ability to correct--over more sensitive--personal sensitive information than is currently available. </p><p>CRAPO: All right. And--and I'm going to use the term--well, Ms. Dixon you used--you used the term \"unregulated credit scores.\" There is a set of data that is collected about individuals and as you indicate, households. And this data is turned into some kind of an analysis that allows those who use the data to influence and manipulate individuals in--in the marketplace. </p><p>Historically--as you've both indicated--the Fair Credit Reporting Act has focused primarily on credit bureaus. But the scope of who is collecting this data, and how it is being used has exploded as you've both also discussed. The question I have is, isn't this unregulated score that we're talking about that is created for people and then managed by AI--isn't that impacting people's credit? Isn't it impacting their financial decisions? Isn't it significantly focused on that type of influence and manipulation of individuals? </p><p>CACKLEY: I--I think it--it certainly can be. The--the scores can--may not be credit scores, but they may apply to decisions that companies are making about what kinds of products they offer people, at what price they offer things based on a score that the consumer doesn't necessarily see and can't--can't even tell if it's correct or can't make any--any attempt to--to approve that score if they don't even know it exists. </p><p>CRAPO: And to influence them to make such a transaction, yeah. I'll let you go ahead, Ms. Dixon. I'm running out of time here, but go ahead please. </p><p>DIXON: Thank you. It's--we call any score that is not regulated by the Federal Credit Reporting Act consumer scores and we define that. It's in the written testimony. Consumer scores are quite dangerous when they're used in eligibility circumstances. </p><p>So, for example, the--the line between a lead generation which is allowable. You don't have to pull a credit score to--to create a lead generation for a marketing product or a financial product. However, if you are just maybe marketing a financial product and you have something that is equivalent in accuracy to a credit score, all the sudden this changes the equation. There's--there's not even a micrometer in between what a, you know, a regulation would be and a non-regulated score. </p><p>So, if you have essentially something that looks like a credit score, and that acts like a credit score, and is being used like a credit score, well it's the same thing as a duck. If it quacks, it's a duck. So, I think we have to look at the financial products that are being marketed with quasi credit scores very closely. That's of high concern, but there's other categories. </p><p>In the scoring of America, we identified literally hundreds of types of scores. Consumer lifetime value scores where consumers are segmented according to how valuable they are in terms of their purchasing power. There's frailty scores which is more of a medical score. But the scores abound and the concern I have is when people lose opportunities that are meaningful in their lives. For example, scores that are used in eligibility circumstances not described by the Fair Credit Reporting Act such as admissions to colleges and whatnot. </p><p>Imagine having a wonderful high school background and working very hard to achieve the American dream. And then, all of a sudden, some score says that you won't be as qualified as a candidate having nothing to do with your academic achievements, but just somehow with maybe the neighborhood you grew up in. I find this disturbing. </p><p>CRAPO: Agreed. Senator Brown? </p><p>BROWN: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Now Ms. Dixon, you noted that tens of thousands of consumers' scores affecting millions and millions of consumers are used to predict--are used to predict our behaviors or secrets you said. Are you--are you surprised that I mean, Chairman Crapo was not able--nor were we able to bring in data brokers to speak and testify? Are you surprised they weren't willing to testify about their business practices before this Committee today? </p><p>DIXON: Actually, I am surprised and I'm actually--I--I wish they were here and I wish the credit bureaus were here as well because we need to have good industries step forward and to give us their best practices that they use. If there's no good industry to step forward with best practices, then this committee cannot rearticulate what it did 50 years ago. </p><p>BROWN: Well-- </p><p>DIXON: And I don't understand why these industries are not willing to discuss what's happening. And I-- </p><p>BROWN: I think-- </p><p>DIXON: --also don't understand why we can't see our scores. Why? </p><p>BROWN: I am not sure that they didn't show up. I guess I'd like to--I'm not sure I've done this anymore before either. I'd like to ask anybody in the room that represents the data brokers to raise their hand. Lobbyists?  Lawyers?  People paid by the data broker industry?  Any of you here?  Any of you here that want to raise your hand I guess is what I should say. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>Okay. I--I--and if you are, I mean, I--I will give you an opportunity of a lifetime if you are. We'll set up a different chair. And you can set up next to Ms. Dixon and Dr. Cackley. Would you? </p><p>Okay, all right. I guess no surprise there, Mr. Chairman and that--that does illustrate how as I--I know they're watching. I mean, this is really important to their industry. It's very important to their bottom line whether they're watching here or they're watching livestream by, but we'll move on. </p><p>Ms. Dixon, it seems that data predictions create a vicious cycle where the predictions end up often dictating the outcomes. For example, could people who've been systematically targeted by predatory lenders which have lower--having lower credit scores therefore, be likely only to see advertisements for other predatory financial products--is that--I assume that happens. Are there other examples you can think of quickly? </p><p>DIXON: Yes, the predatory example is one we get phone calls about in our office from people who received advertisements for financial products and they didn't understand that they could've gone out on the market and affirmatively looked for the best offer. So, these predatory marketing devices based on unregulated scores are very significant. </p><p>Other significant scores are scores that predict repayment of debt. So, for example, it is the poorest consumers who are targeted the most for debt repayment--all sorts of things like this. The consumer lifetime value scores impact how well you're treated by businesses by how long you're standing in line. </p><p>But the most meaningful circumstances that I can think of is when kids are applying to schools and they are getting scores that dictate whether or not they're going to be accepted to a school based not on their academics, but based on all of these other things like a pseudo credit score, like how--what neighborhood they grew up in. There are neighborhood risk scores which are the modern-day redlining. And I find them deeply objectionable because if we are going to be scored by where we live, how have we advanced and how have all the laws that have been meant to protect from such things--how are they operating if this is still happening today? </p><p>BROWN: So, companies--thank you for that. Companies that particularly--an analogy to redlining--banking redlining, insurance redlining, these companies redlining's--if companies--are you worried that companies would offer discounts for products and services in exchange for sensitive data which would lead you--sort of implied this would lead to a two-tiered system where the wealthy can afford privacy and everyone else will have to sacrifice sensitive information to get access to basic internet services? </p><p>DIXON: That's certainly part of it. I think it goes even broad--more broadly than that. One of the big issues is that you get locked into a big filter bubble of sorts--a marketing bubble and it's not that people mean to get locked into these. But if you are receiving offers--especially for financial tools and services and--and a consumer does not go outside of the offers they receive, they can pay more for autos. They can pay more for products. They can pay more for example, a TV--simple things. Simple things, but if you are a consumer on a fixed income, a television that costs $2,000 instead of 200 makes a meaningful difference in a person's life. That's what worries me the most. </p><p>BROWN: There's a--there's a--one follow-up. Not a question, but just comment, Mr. Chairman. Thanks for--for your forbearance. I--and the whole idea of--that--that people prey on people that are less able to fight back. Yesterday, I was in Des Moines--not running for President, but in Des Moines. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>And I--I was--I was at a manufactured house--manufactured housing neighborhood. And a large hedge fund from--from Salt Lake City has begun to buy up manufacturing housing neighborhoods. There are six of them in the state. There are a number of them in Iowa. They're in a half dozen states at least. </p><p>They come and they buy these. People have paid 50, or 60, or 70,000 for their manufactured home. They pay $200-300 for the--for the rent when the land in these hedge funds is raising rents over a period of about a year--year and a half up to 70 percent and people have nowhere to turn. And it's just--it's like these companies out there are just looking. \"Where--where can we come in, extract the most money at the lowest cost against people that have the most--have the least ability to fight back without political connections?\" And it's just happening across our economy. Thank you. </p><p>CRAPO: Thank you, Senator Brown. Senator Scott? </p><p>SCOTT: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I will note that some people go to Des Moines not to run for president, but perhaps vice president. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>Back over here. So-- </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>I apologize. I meant-- </p><p>BROWN: Mr. Chairman, Senator Scott's a smart guy, but that was not the smartest thing he ever said. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>SCOTT: Senator Brown, I realize you don't actually run for vice president by the number of votes you get-- </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>--but I think there is a process by which people say they are qualified to do things like ask Ms. Dixon a question. </p><p>So, one of the--your comments that you made sounded--I spent about 25 years in the insurance industry. So, one of the comments you made sounded a little bit like redlining. And I'd love for you to unpack that a little bit, but just to make sure I heard you. So, an unregulated--in unregulated ways, credit scores that consumers themselves don't know about that consumers haven't seen, heard or contributed to are being used in ways that will impact their financial well-being to include perhaps even the likelihood of jobs that they may or may not be qualified for. </p><p>That to me, sounds fairly nefarious, but it sounds a whole lot like redlining. Can you unpack, if that's not what you meant please clarify what you did mean and if it did--if it is what you meant, please drill down a little bit, so that we can have a little more clarity to what you're talking about? </p><p>DIXON: Thank you. It's a really complex issue. And in the scoring of America and in my--in my written testimony, I have articulated more fully with footnotes, so. </p><p>SCOTT: We have that part, but. </p><p>DIXON: Yes. So, thank you for your question because it is complex and it's difficult to abstract into a few words. Let me try and make a big effort here. </p><p>All right, so-- </p><p>SCOTT: I'll give you three minutes if you need. </p><p>DIXON: All right, let's go for it. </p><p>SCOTT: Okay. </p><p>DIXON: So, there are amazing real-time analytic products. I've--actually in our update to the scoring, we have looked at this. </p><p>So, for example, financial service companies--you can look across the United States and see pretty much real-time the marketplace activity of people who are spending, and buying, and what that looks like in real time. You can drill down to the census block level and see how well a neighborhood is performing. </p><p>There is a--for example, a product that gives you what's called an up-front score of what the score of that neighborhood is. So--and I will send on follow-up, a series of screenshots of this to you-- </p><p>SCOTT: Thank you. </p><p>DIXON: --so you can see it. </p><p>But it--let's say that you were applying for a university position and your neighborhood has a very poor score. Well, now that can be taken into consideration. We have the college board doing this. They have an adversity score that is doing exactly this. </p><p>So, I find this difficult. The--the lines are narrow. </p><p>SCOTT: Let me interrupt you, Ms. Dixon. So, I read an article I guess a couple of weeks ago, Mr. Chairman about this new SAT score that would take into consideration challenges. Are--are you suggesting that that score could--and the neighborhood score could have an impact on one's SAT score in college admittance? </p><p>DIXON: I do not believe it will have an impact on a person's SAT score. I do believe that it can have a much further and much larger-- </p><p>SCOTT: Ms. Dixon, are you familiar with the--the--the new iteration of the SAT score which takes into consideration the family challenges and-- </p><p>DIXON: Yes. </p><p>SCOTT: Okay. </p><p>DIXON: Yes, I am and that's what I'm referring to. </p><p>SCOTT: Great. </p><p>DIXON: So, while that score is meant to provide context, here's the problem. One of the factors that it uses is a neighborhood risk score and that neighborhood risk score is a secret score. Consumers do not get to see it. </p><p>Currently, the--the college board adversity score--the student's score--they are not allowed to see it. It is a secret score. </p><p>Now let's bring this score into transparency. Let's apply some of the principles of the Fair Credit Reporting Act. Let's give people access to the score. Let them know what factors went into the score. Let's make it fair. That's my point. </p><p>And right now, this does not fall under the Fair Credit Reporting Act by all law. It does not fall into any eligibility circumstance. Not yet, but that's what I am saying. We need to have fairness. Technology is going to advance and it's important that it does. We need to stay competitive in the United States within machine learning and AI. It's very, very crucial for our economic future. But we need fairness and transparency. And we really need the Fair Credit Reporting Act to be guiding best practices and saying, \"Look, technology, yes. Uses need to be right. That's--that's the deal.\" </p><p>SCOTT: Thank you. Mr. Chairman and Ranking Member, I would love for us to do all that we can to compel some of the companies in the industry to participate in a future hearing. </p><p>CRAPO: You have both of our agreement on that already, Senator Scott. </p><p>SCOTT: Thank you. </p><p>CRAPO: Thank you. Senator Reed? </p><p>REED: Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you to the witnesses for their testimony. On previous hearings, it's--and I'm echoing some of the comments of my colleagues particularly Senator Kennedy where a lot of the information should be used as being owned by the person, not by these data brokers. And we have to create real opportunities to protect your data. </p><p>We've got some legal statutes in place, but the Fair Credit Reporting Act, HIPAA, etc. where it's clear by statute. And then, we've got some information that's very public, you know. It's published and it's--it's late notices in newspapers, etc. </p><p>And then, there's the--all the information that's just accumulated by being on a computer. It comes back down to I think three principles in my view. One is that consumers--people should have the ability to opt out of any information collection system. </p><p>And second, that this information should be at some point expunged six months, a year, etc. And then, if it's violated by anybody--a data broker, or a collector, or anyone else, then they should have the right to go to court and say, \"You've ruined me\". So, let's start with both your comments on how do we get sort of an effective opt-out? </p><p>How, you know, my sense is that it's once I'm using a--going to a website, it's hard to figure out where the opt-out is. Sometimes they don't even offer that. Should we in  U.S. Congress say we have to have a very prominent opt out, \"Don't collect my data\"? </p><p>So, let's start with Dr. Cackley and-- </p><p>CACKLEY: So, an opt-out possibility is certainly something that--that is--is available and--and is used in certain circumstances. I think--I think it--there are--there are more circumstances where it could be helpful. I don't know that it--it would be the--that that as a solution alone would--would do the trick in terms of--of if you think about all of the times when you--when you go online and--and you're supposed to read the--the disclosures, and--and click on things. </p><p>REED: No one reads the disclosures. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>CACKLEY: Yeah, exactly. </p><p>REED: That-- </p><p>CACKLEY: And so, it may be that no one will read the opt-out. </p><p>REED: That's why the opt-out can't be hidden in disclosures. It has to be--pop right up here saying-- </p><p>CACKLEY: Absolutely. </p><p>REED: --\"Click yes or no.\" </p><p>CACKLEY: Right, yeah. And I think if someone knows that they don't want their data to be--to be collected and they can opt-out right away, that's a--that's a way to do it. And in other circumstances, people may not understand-- </p><p>REED: Well, I-- </p><p>CACKLEY: --what it is the opt-out is really doing with that. </p><p>REED: I think if you start with the major platforms--the Googles and etc.--if they cannot collect the data-- </p><p>CACKLEY: Right. </p><p>REED: --that data's not going to get down the road-- </p><p>CACKLEY: Sure. </p><p>REED: --to the brokers because they--they don't have it. </p><p>CACKLEY: Absolutely. </p><p>REED: And that's the first place I think to begin. Ms. Dixon? </p><p>DIXON: Thank you. I was honored to serve at the OECD as part of their AI expert group. I just finished helping them write the global guidelines on AI. And something that I learned in that process even more so than I already had is that our data world--our data ecosystems have become so profoundly complex that I am not at all persuaded anymore that opt-out is possible because if--if you recall, the, you know, the Russian nesting dolls where you have the big doll and then all that? </p><p>REED: Uh-huh. </p><p>DIXON: You open the doll and then there's another doll. And then, you open it up again, there's another doll. This is what data is like. </p><p>So, let's say we do opt out of, you know, a platform. Well, what about all of the financial transactions? </p><p>The financial transactions and our retail history purchase--purchase histories are actually the basis of a lot of data broker analysis and then it gets worse. As you get into the dolls, here's one that really is very, very challenging and that's this. </p><p>Data brokers right now, if they didn't collect another piece of data on us, here's something really to think about. They could simply create data about us because that is the state of the technology and I do not know how to create an opt-out that is that far removed from us. </p><p>However, that being the case, I do believe there are things we can do especially if we focus on restricting negative uses that harm consumers and really look at the end points of that process. And also, at the beginning and say, \"Hey, what are the standards you are using? What can we do to make good standards? And at the end, what are the standards for use? How can we control these two points?\" </p><p>But I think there's a role for opt-out for example, especially in for example, human subject research must have meaningful consent. As a tool, I think it's lost a lot of its power. </p><p>REED: I--I--you've studied this longer than I, but I think it's a place to begin and it's an--it's not a perfect solution. But, you know, you--you can't make the perfect enemy of the good. If it gives us--people a little more protection I think it should be pursued. </p><p>And I--the other aspect is too--is as you've pointed out with this synthetic data--they create this synthetic data. And sort of purging it periodically might also help us. Again, I think you've put your finger on this dilemma now that the complexity--the ability to take together indirectly--not directly data is profound. But if we don't take some simple steps, it gets worse. It doesn't get better. Thank you. </p><p>CRAPO: Thank you. Senator Schatz. </p><p>SCHATZ: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you to the testifiers. Ms. Dixon, you know, we're--we're talking about some reforms to the Fair Credit Reporting Act and what worries me a bit is that as important as I think it is to bring data brokers back into the fold in terms of how the statute governs their behavior, the Fair Credit Reporting Act doesn't actually work as it relates to the credit bureaus. </p><p>The credit bureaus put the onus on the consumer. The consumer has to pay to correct or monitor his or her own data. And so, that statute is broken. And so, to the extent that we're going to put all of these shadow data brokers under FCRA, I think we have to be clear-eyed about how imperfect that system is for millions and millions of Americans. I'd like you to comment on that. </p><p>DIXON: Well, I agree with you. That's why I said that the--even our best American privacy law isn't as important as it used to be. It is--it does have cracks and fissures. However, it does something very important. It makes it so that things aren't secret. </p><p>You and I, we can look at our credit score. This is huge. This is a huge improvement from pre-2000 when it was illegal to do so. We can see our bureau report and correct it. We can't see our other scores and this is-- </p><p>SCHATZ: Fair enough. </p><p>DIXON: --problematic. Yeah. </p><p>SCHATZ: Fair enough. Let me--let me ask you a sort of technical question. What's the relationship between data broker and credit bureaus? In other words, are some of these credit bureaus getting into the data broker business? Did--have some of them acquired data brokers?  What is their relationship? </p><p>DIXON: Yes. So, for example, Equifax-Experian, a lot of times what they'll do is they'll have part of their business as a formal, regulated credit reporting business. And then, other aspects of their business are unregulated-- </p><p>SCHATZ: Which is-- </p><p>DIXON: --scoring. </p><p>SCHATZ: --we would characterize as the marketing side. </p><p>DIXON: Yes, I am aware that they call it marketing. However, I call it the consumer scoring side. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>But yes, your point is absolutely correct. </p><p>And additionally, you--you mentioned that there is, you know, also first-party. One of the things that's been happening is there's a lot of data privacy concerns and there is a--a real move now for a lot of--a lot of different types of businesses to purchase data brokers and bring them in, so that they are dealing with first party data. </p><p>So, now we have a fracture in the data broker business model where you can't just say, \"Well, here are the data brokers. Let's regulate them.\" That's not possible anymore. Maybe 25-30 years ago, but not now. I think we really have to look at practices and say, \"Hey, are you using the data for these purposes especially in regards to eligibility?\" </p><p>SCHATZ: But--but the challenge--to follow-up on what Senator Scott talked about in terms of digital redlining-- </p><p>DIXON: Yeah. </p><p>SCHATZ: --is that to the extent that they're using data sets that are essentially in combination a proxy for race-- </p><p>DIXON: Right. </p><p>SCHATZ: --and to the extent that those algorithms are not transparent, it is incredibly difficult to imagine that even if we put them under FCRA and even if the FTC were authorized to go after CFB--were authorized to go after them, just to make the case would be incredibly difficult. Am I--am I correct there? </p><p>DIXON: I believe you're correct and that's why--that's why we proposed a standards bill that really looks at creating new standards to start to build a mesh network to fill in these gaps because you are correct. There are important gaps here. </p><p>SCHATZ: And under FCRA, and in the sort of old days, you used to have sort of shadow shoppers-- </p><p>DIXON: Yes. </p><p>SCHATZ: --to try to figure out whether it was discrimination in terms of impact as opposed to in terms of intent. And it seems to me that it could be a--a--a way where we could subject all of these data brokers to a regime where they had to--they didn't have to provide the code for their algorithm, but they--they had to provide a regulator with the ability to utilize the algorithm and see if the--and run a bunch of reps, and figure out if statistically speaking it was in fact a proxy--proxy for race or if there was a--a--a desperate impact on--on--on protected classes. </p><p>DIXON: I think that's right. And, you know, it's not that algorithms are bad. It's not that scoring is bad. It's how it's used. </p><p>SCHATZ: No, and some of-- </p><p>DIXON: Yeah. </p><p>SCHATZ: And some of this could actually alleviate the problem of the credit bureaus in terms of the three or four million people who have bad credit scores that are--that are-- </p><p>DIXON: Uh-huh. </p><p>SCHATZ: --that are correct. And so, if you can come up with an alternative that is non-discriminatory, it--it--it provides a real opportunity. I'll just offer one last thought and I'd like your--both of your comments for the record. We are working on legislation--and I'm working on legislation to--to establish a duty of care because I think the problem is in a sectoral approach, some of these companies are--I don't know if they're a thin tech company, or a tech company, or under the HIPAA regime. And they sort of evade the various regulations because it's not clear where they belong. </p><p>And in any case, once the data has been collected either voluntarily or not, either through the internet of things or at one point you clicked \"I agree\" because you signed up for a social platform. The question is what is the obligation of the company who's in possession of your data? </p><p>And the duty of care is the most simple way to say cross-sectorally, \"You may not intentionally harm any person who's data you're in possession of.\" And that's why the duty of care is such a clean way to address all of this because otherwise, we're going to be always a decade behind whatever these newfangled companies are attempting to do to us. </p><p>But if I could take that for the record please. </p><p>DIXON: Yes, I think that that is a potentially very good approach. I think Vermont did something like this at the state level where they said, \"You cannot purchase data with the intent to defraud or discriminate.\" </p><p>So, I do think that ensuring that fairness is percolating throughout the system is a really good remedy. </p><p>SCHATZ: Thank you. </p><p>CRAPO: Senator Cortez Masto? Oh, did you want to have Dr. </p><p>CORTEZ MASTO: (OFF MIC) </p><p>SCHATZ: I'll take those for the record. </p><p>CRAPO: So, he'll let you respond in writing is what he's saying. </p><p>SCHATZ: Thank you, that's fine. </p><p>CRAPO: Senator Cortez Masto? </p><p>CORTEZ MASTO: Thank you. I appreciate that, but I would like to hear what Dr. Cackley had to say as well. </p><p>CRAPO: All right. </p><p>CACKLEY: So, in terms of I think a duty of care, that a basic part of a comprehensive privacy law, that would--that would be a--a--a good--a good element to include what--what we have with--have reported on is--is be given the gaps that the sectoral approach allows. </p><p>In--in terms of privacy, we--we have--have recommended that Congress really consider a more comprehensive approach and--and include within it several different elements. And a duty of care element would--would--would certainly--should certainly be--be part of that consideration. </p><p>CORTEZ MASTO: Yeah. No, I like that idea too. I think it's very innovative. Along with that would--transparency would be key, right? </p><p>The consumer knows that whatever regulated credit score or unregulated credit score, whatever's being used, that's based on an algorithm that is identifying their factors. They should have access to that, correct? </p><p>CACKLEY: Absolutely. Access, control, ability to-- </p><p>CORTEZ MASTO: Right. </p><p>CACKLEY: Correct. All of those are--are important elements, yes. </p><p>CORTEZ MASTO: Okay. So, Dr.--or excuse me, Ms. Dixon., I understand in 2015, Allstate Insurance began selling consumer driving data. And Allstate Chairman CEO Tom Wilson said that the Property Casualty Insurance Company hopes to profit from the sell of telematics data and then pass on savings to consumers by lowering premiums. Is Allstate unusual in its plans to capture this information about people's driving data to earn additional profit? And I'm just curious, how many insurers have adopted telematics and what's been the impact if you know? </p><p>DIXON: So, my understanding is that they are no longer the only insurance company doing this. </p><p>CORTEZ MASTO: Uh-huh. </p><p>DIXON: There are now several insurance companies and there are also health insurance companies who are saying, \"Hey, give us access to a variety of your data and we will, you know, give you commemorate lower rates when applicable.\" </p><p>So, I think that these are rather uncomfortable things and--to put it mildly. I would really like to see guardrails on how these are used. I don't think we can stop what's happening in prediction. Prediction is getting cheaper-- </p><p>CORTEZ MASTO: Right. </p><p>DIXON: --and it's getting more accurate. So, we can't stop it. However, I think we can take a multifactorial approach to the problems that--the real problems that these situations impose. Do we want consumers giving way their data in order to, you know, have a--a better premium? </p><p>And I--I think that you should be able to--to have protections without giving away your data. You should--we need--we need good rights here. </p><p>CORTEZ MASTO: Right. </p><p>DIXON: And to do that, we're going to have to have good rules of the road that encompass new technology, but keep the values. Let us make a decision and not be financially penalized for it. And should an insurance company be able to sell this data? </p><p>That's a question we need to have as a matter of public discussion. It shouldn't just be decided just by industry. It needs to be a multi-stake holder conversation about that. </p><p>CORTEZ MASTO: And this type of data is what goes into what you've identified as the neighborhood risk scores that-- </p><p>DIXON: That's part of it. </p><p>CORTEZ MASTO: --that companies could use, correct? </p><p>DIXON: Oh, there's so many scores, but yes. </p><p>CORTEZ MASTO: Right, but that could be part of it. </p><p>DIXON: That's exactly right. </p><p>CORTEZ MASTO: There's so much data. </p><p>And the other concern I'm understanding is that because of the--because of the new technology and the algorithms, the concern is that this is--this information with respect to unregulated--unregulated credit scores could end up providing a higher accuracy level than the regulated credit scores such that's the--such that the banks or other financial institutions would start using those unregulated credit scores more so than the regulated. Is that right? </p><p>DIXON: Well, I think that you'll find that banks in particular are very, very careful about these kinds of uses. Of the people that we've interviewed, they've been very, very careful. It's actually--some of the people I worry about the most are the people who are not in banks and who want to pull a credit score product to do marketing. </p><p>And instead of actually going through the regulation and making a firm offer of credit, for insurance they'll just kind of skirt around the edges, and pull the--the, you know, unregulated credit score, and then make these offers. And I--someone discussed today especially if it's a predatory offer. This is where things get very problematic. </p><p>If you have a--a consumer who's identified in the credit score 400-500 level and someone doesn't want to make a firm offer of credit or insurance, but they want that number and they want to use that number to market a product maybe for bill consolidation or payday loans, then I think we all need to be very interested in protections for that. </p><p>CORTEZ MASTO: Thank you. And I--I notice my time is almost also up. I will also just submit this for the record--facial recognition and data that comes from that. It's topical right now and the question would be should that information be shared with third-party--parties like data brokers to be utilized? </p><p>I'm curious your thoughts on--on us or companies in general. I think it was just in the paper today. Airlines were looking at using this type of facial recognition data. So, I--I--I'll submit that for the record. Thank you so much for this conversation today. I appreciate it, Mr. Chairman. </p><p>CRAPO: Thank you. Senator Warner? </p><p>WARNER: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Let me first of all just associate myself with both your comments and the ranking member's comments. It's pretty remarkable that you invited the data industry or data brokers to come and they didn't show up. I think that's--that's a very telling statement. </p><p>I know folks have talked a--about the Fair Credit Reporting Act. I know we've talked about a variety of issues. I--I've been thinking a lot about this in terms of the social media companies, you know. The data brokers are really just one piece of the overall growing data economy and we're talking a lot about third-party vendors. </p><p>Obviously, I've got concerns as well about first party vendors--the Amazon's, the Facebook's, the Google's. And would you both agree that candidly--or that most Americans don't have the slightest idea of what kind of data's being collected about them and what that data is worth? </p><p>CACKLEY: I think it's definitely true that most Americans don't understand the breadth of data that is collected about them. They may have--be aware in certain instances where they have checked yes or--or provided something. But--but they don't--they don't know the--the--the true extent of it. </p><p>WARNER: Ms. Dixon, to you? </p><p>DIXON: Thank you. The--the complexity of data flows right now is--is extraordinary and you are correct. First parties, third parties--everything is blending. And if you look at even just identity, you can have an identity that overlaps in--in 20 different data ecosystems. </p><p>And as a result, it's--it's become very difficult for anyone-- </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>--to map the data. There's this amazing chart that was produced by the advertising industry for itself actually and it--it maps this extraordinarily. It looks like the Tokyo subway lines. I mean, it's incredibly complex and I don't know that it's possible to fully map our data anymore. </p><p>So, if that's the case, how on earth do we cabin practices, so that there is a--a--almost like a routine--a set of routine uses where, \"Here are the acceptable uses for companies. End of discussion.\" Boom. And then, outside of this not acceptable uses. </p><p>We're going to have to find our way to something like that and we might have to distinguish it by sector and by even--perhaps even individual companies. But I'd like to see that very fairly adjudicated. I'm really interested in seeing people talk with each other to figure this out. We need to have very meaningful discussions to figure out where the data's going and how we can best protect it, but I don't think people know how. </p><p>WARNER: Well, one of the things that I'm--that you've touched on--briefly on one of the areas I've got some bipartisan legislation on that would try to focus on some of the manipulative practices--so-called \"dark patterns\" you use where, you know, in laymen's terms you have six sets of arrows clicking on, you know, pointing you towards the \"I agree\" button and you can never find the \"unsubscribe\" button. </p><p>And there are a host of practices that go on in the industry where people give up this information oftentimes unwittingly and through extraordinarily sophisticated psychological tools being used by the companies and others to get this information. </p><p>I--I know my time's getting down. I would just like your commentary. I--I believe consumers ought to have a right to know what data is being collected about them. I believe we need to take it a step further and also have some basic evaluation in terms of how much that--that data is worth and I'm an old Telecom guy. For a long time, it used to be really hard to bring competition in--in the Telco market until we instituted--by government regulation--number portability. </p><p>I believe that same concept--data portability--ought to be brought into the data economy, so that if you are not liking how you're being treated I think about it mostly in the social media context. But there are a variety of areas in the credit scoring areas as well where, you know, if we had that knowledge of what data was being collected, what it's worth--and then, if you didn't like the way Facebook was treating you or some other enterprise, you were easily able to move your--your--all of your data in one swipe to--to a new co or a new platform. I think you could bring some additional competitive practices to--to the area. </p><p>In these last couple of seconds, data evaluation, data knowledge, and data portability--ideas, comments, suggestions? </p><p>DIXON: I really like the idea of data interoperability's, so that there's more freedom. </p><p>WARNER: With portability you've got to have interoperability or it doesn't-- </p><p>DIXON: Yes, but it's--I think it's going to be something that will end up working out in time, but it should be a good priority. </p><p>CACKLEY: So, this isn't something that we've looked at specifically. But I think that to the degree that you're talking about, comprehensive legislation that really covers all of the different platforms and--and parties, then--then that kind of interoperability would--would--would be part of it. </p><p>WARNER: We'd like to share with both of you some of the work we've been doing and I think there's a-- </p><p>CACKLEY: Yeah. </p><p>WARNER: --could be broad-based bipartisan support. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. </p><p>CRAPO: Thank you. Senator Kennedy? </p><p>KENNEDY: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. If I go on the internet, and I search, and I look at social media, and I buy something on Amazon let's say, who--I mean, my--my actions--my behavior is recorded. We call it data. Who owns it? </p><p>DIXON: I have a whitepaper I'm going to send to you. We've spent a lot of time thinking about this issue. So, the issue of data ownership is quite difficult to parse. But let me give you my best shot-- </p><p>KENNEDY: Yes, ma'am. </p><p>DIXON: --and let's have a discussion. </p><p>KENNEDY: If--if--well-- </p><p>DIXON: So-- </p><p>KENNEDY: --I'd like to have a discussion, but first I'd like to have an answer. </p><p>DIXON: Here's the answer. I view data as--in our current data ecosystems--as a common pool resource. I think a lot of different entities can lay claim to that data. However, no one gets to own it. And--well, in some cases-- </p><p>KENNEDY: You don't think that I own my data? </p><p>DIXON: --you can. It depends on where you've used it and where it is. I think there's some-- </p><p>KENNEDY: Not on how much you-- </p><p>DIXON: Yeah. </p><p>CACKLEY: I don't think there is a--an answer to--to who owns that--your data when once you've--you've taken an action especially in--in some ways interacted with a--with another company. </p><p>KENNEDY: Well let's suppose that Congress passed a law that said the consumer owns his data and he or she can knowingly license it. What would be wrong with that? </p><p>CACKLEY: I--I don't think there--there be anything wrong with it. I think it would--it would have impact on--on who could then collect that your data or whether data could be collected. </p><p>KENNEDY: No, I can--I can--I could license my data knowingly. </p><p>CACKLEY: Right. </p><p>KENNEDY: Now, what--what--in--in--in terms of knowingly licensing my data that I own, what sort of disclosures should a social media company for example make to me in terms of how it's going to use my data? Right now, they make disclosures but--but they're--there--they're--they don't inform the consumer. I've said before, some of those things are seven, eight, nine, ten pages written by lawyers. You could hide a dead body in them and nobody would find them--find the body, I mean nobody reads them. That's not knowing consent. What--what does a social media company have to tell me in order for me to know what they're doing? </p><p>DIXON: May I offer an example from the--the medical field? So under--under HIPAA, there are very meaningful mechanisms prior to a consumer agreeing to release their information outside of the protection of HIPPA. However, one of the concerns that's come up with this is that it's become very, very easy for consumers patients to \"donate their data.\" And what's happened is that people have donated their data and taken it out of the protections of HIPPA without meaningful consent. </p><p>KENNEDY: I'm not--I'm not trying to be rude, I'm trying to get answers. Here's my question. If I own my data and I license it, I need to understand what license it--licensing it means. What needs to be disclosed to me? </p><p>DIXON: My understanding, looking at other fields because this is not something I have studied at length. My understanding is that the--that is a serious agreement and it would require massive disclosures. I think you could almost put a graveyard in that disclosure, you know, compared to-- </p><p>KENNEDY: And you don't--you don't think it's possible to--to write a disclosure that the consumer would understand. Is that what you imply? </p><p>DIXON: In this area, I'd have to really look at that--that--again, this is not an area of research for me but I--I-- </p><p>KENNEDY: What do you think (INAUDIBLE)? </p><p>CACKLEY: I think it--it would be--it would be very complicated. So it is not an area that we've looked at either but--but just in--if--if Congress were to pass a law that allowed consumers to license their own data, that would just create a large amount of--of regulations to go along with that. </p><p>KENNEDY: So you both think that we should just allow companies to do what they want with our data, that this is a--this is a problem this problem is impossible to solve? </p><p>CACKLEY: No, no, and I don't think I meant that at all. I just meant that it would--it would have to be worked through, it--it's not an easy fix. It's--it's-- </p><p>KENNEDY: No, I don't think an easy fix is around here. </p><p>DIXON: And I don't mean that either. I--I believe that we should have rules of the road and we should have agreed upon rules on what-- </p><p>KENNEDY: That--that's--I agree with that too and--and everybody--I mean, we've had a lot of interesting discussions about this but--but no offense to you two, but then the experts never offer a solution. So to me, the solution is consumer owns his data, you can license it, the licensing has to be knowing and--and intentional. You can move your data, portability should--should be an option. I can change my mind about licensing it and--and companies will adapt to that, they'll have no choice. Thank you, Mr. chairman. </p><p>CRAPO: Senator Menendez. </p><p>MENENDEZ: Thank you Mr. Chairman. I had the same concerns as Senator Kennedy because we seem to be living and in age of data breaches. Just last week, we learned of a breach concerning a medical billing company, America Medical Coalition Agency that may have exposed the personal financial and even medical data of 20 million patients who are customers of Quest Diagnostics and LabCorp. </p><p>So let me ask you, Ms. Dixon, people are rightly concerned that some of their personal data is now exposed and could be used against them. Can data brokers legally compile aggregate or sell data that has been acquired through an illegal hack? </p><p>DIXON: I haven't, I am not an attorney. So I think that's a question that an attorney could better answer you. But my first best guess is I don't think you can use improperly inferme--information that has been disclosed in an unauthorized manner for your own business purposes. That seems like that would be really out of balance. </p><p>MENENDEZ: Dr. Cackley, do you have any idea? </p><p>CACKLEY: I don't know the answer but I can certainly find out. </p><p>MENENDEZ: Yeah, well I appreciate that. Should people be concerned the data not otherwise covered by HIPAA is ending up in the hands of data brokers even in the absence of a hack? Are billing companies like America Medical Coalition Agencies selling non-HIPAA data to brokers? </p><p>DIXON: This is an ongoing area of grave concern for us. There are actual scores of health data. There's a frailty score that can predict very closely how sick you are and when you might possibly die. I think that there are all sorts of scores and products so related to-- </p><p>MENENDEZ: Not sure I want to check on that data myself but-- </p><p>DIXON: Yeah me either. But--but-- </p><p>MENENDEZ: But that's--that's pretty frightening, isn't it? </p><p>DIXON: It is and health--you know, health data that is not covered under HIPAA is become an increasing area so-- </p><p>MENENDEZ: Let me ask you this. When hackers gained access to non-HIPAA data like in the Quest data breach, can data brokers apply machine learning to these data points to infer or reconstruct sensitive HIPPA protected medical data? </p><p>DIXON: I actually don't think that they need to acquire unauthorized data in order to do that. They can just look at our purchase histories and get an awful lot of data about us. But in terms of what's happening with this entire area, the data breaches of medical data actually can lead to forms of identity theft and medical identity theft that are very, very difficult to cure and you can have extremely meaningful consequences in people's life. </p><p>MENENDEZ: Let me ask you then. HIPAA's nearly 25 years old and in 2009, high tech provided updates which were concerning health information technology, but I'm still concerned that we're playing catch-up when it comes to protecting patients. And, you know, of all the information that should be private and privileged to you, your health standing should be extraordinary. There are all types of consequences in that in employment, in discrimination and a whole host of things. Are there gaps in HIPAA and other data security laws that need to be addressed to better protect people today in this 21st century threat? What's coordination is missing between existing legal protections? </p><p>DIXON: I--I do think there's gaps and the biggest gaps that exist right now are the gaps that exist between the sectoral protections. And I don't think the answer is to just rip out the sector protections that exist such as a Fair Credit Reporting Act or HIPAA or Sarbanes-Oxley etc, but to find a way to fill those gaps in. For example, victims of medical identity theft can use their Fair Credit Reporting Act rights to get their financial information corrected, but under HIPAA they are--it is--it's not possible for them because it doesn't exist in this statute. </p><p>It's not possible for them to get a deletion similar to the FCRA in their health files so they could actually carry around inaccurate information which can really have an impact on their treatment and insurance costs and there's not a solution yet. So this is the kind of gap we need to address. </p><p>MENENDEZ: Lastly there's one breach that compromises the personal information of 20 million pra--patients, that's pretty troubling. One data broker has data on 300 million consumers. We're still reeling from the Equifax breach which affected 145.5 million consumers. If the information of 300 million consumers were to be compromised, we might start calling for private information, public information because at the end of the day, that's the result of it. </p><p>What's the ramifications for consumer if a data broker is breached and should we hold them to a higher standard of security especially because their volume is so consequential? </p><p>DIXON: Data broker breaches are very significant. So my--my assessment of this is that the--the various state data breach laws are doing a pretty good job especially in some cases where the data breach law is quite strong in forcing disclosures and--and notices but I think we need to do more to ensure that all of the information held that is sensitive and health related etc, is duly notified to the consumer. </p><p>The problem with the data brokers is what they will say is, oh wait, wait, we don't have a direct relationship with the consumers, we can't notify them. And I think that is a gap that needs to be resolved. Now, the state of Vermont has resolved that gap. </p><p>MENENDEZ: They could--they could--they could reach back to the entity that provided them the data in the first place and they could notify. Could they not? </p><p>DIXON: I believe that that could happen and it has happened-- </p><p>MENENDEZ: I just think--I just think they should be held to a higher standard of security because the consequences of incredible numbers of Americans that are subject to having their privacy breached and their healthcare breached is just beyond acceptance. Thank you, Mr. chairman. </p><p>CRAPO: Thank you. Senator Rounds. </p><p>ROUNDS: Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you for holding this--this hearing today. I--I--I'd like to see if I--in--in listening to this, if I've picked up the grasp of some of the challenges we have here. It would appear to me that--that we're talking about first of all the question of the security of the data that's actually being collected. Second of all, it appears that we're questioning whether or not, there is an appropriate way for individual consumers or individuals to actually find out and to have access to what these organizations, these non-regulated organizations actually have. </p><p>And Finally, that this appears that may very well be a workaround with regard to the information that's being collected and then disseminated from what a regulated entity would have. In a nutshell, are those the three areas and would there be other areas that you would also identify? I would ask each of you for your thoughts. </p><p>CACKLEY: Those are certainly three of the--of the main points that have come up today. I think the oth--other piece that we haven't touched on maybe as much is outside of--of the--the data brokers themselves. There are--there are other technologies where--where privacy issues that have to do with--with, you know, mobile devices, with facial recognition technology, we did mention that, with financial technology that are--that are also areas of concern that--that are--fall outside potentially the--the protections of FCRA in particular. </p><p>ROUNDS: The use of machine learning and artificial intelligence in this process. Okay, miss Dixon. </p><p>DIXON: So my focus has really never been on the technologies as an endpoint. My focus has always been on okay, so we have technological processes that are going to continue through time but what does that actually mean in practice that I've always looked at the practice? So your--your assessment of where the sticking points are is accurate. The thing I would add is this. </p><p>I think it's going to become as we move forward and prediction gets cheaper, I think prediction is going to be coming to a mobile phone near us like ours, and I think we have to be very cautious about looking at categories of technologies and label--labeling them as bad. Similarly, in industry, I think we have to be very careful and say okay, what are the practices that we want to go after here and want to address because they're harming consumers? And if we can do that in a truly multifactorial way, I think that will be helpful. </p><p>Wherever these practices exist, wherever they are, we need to be addressing them because they're meaningful and they have impact. </p><p>ROUNDS: There's a difference between the way that we have looked at data and data collection and privacy in the United States versus the way that it's been done in some other parts of the world. Here, we follow and we use Gramm-Leach-Bliley within the United States but in Europe they take a different approach, the GDPR which seeks to really achieve a--a different and more comprehensive approach but would be rather challenging. </p><p>Can you share with me the thought process or your analysis of the differences or the advantages one versus the other between the way that we handle it today in the United States versus what they have--what they're doing in Europe with the GDPR in its current form? </p><p>CACKLEY: So we haven't looked at GDPR directly yet but I can say that that there are definitely some elements of GDPR that are--are already embodied in the--the fair information practices principles that--that are the basis of--of some of our privacy regulation already. There are other pieces that--that--that are not and--and one of the main ones I would say is the right to be forgotten which is a part of GDPR that--that really doesn't--it isn't encompassed in--in anything here. </p><p>ROUNDS: (INAUDIBLE) Ms. Dixon. </p><p>DIXON: Sorry. The GDPR, the--as you know it's--it--it was built on the EU 9546. So it's--it's--it has a lot of bureaucratic history behind it. If you look at what they were trying to do in all the derogations and whatnot, it's a really complex and thoughtful structure. I think that it does provide for baseline privacy protections, but they don't have the sectoral system and they don't have government privacy. So I think there is one thing I'll say, in--in--in our country the Privacy Act is very effective in--in regulating certain aspects of government information collection, they don't have anything like that. </p><p>ROUNDS: Thank you and I see my time has expired, Mr. chairman. Thank you both of you for your--for your answers today and Mr. chairman once again, thank you for the--the opportunity here today with the--this--this hearing on this very important topic. </p><p>CRAPO: Thank You senator Rounds. Senator Sinema. </p><p>SINEMA: Thank you Mr. chairman and--and thank you to our witnesses for being here today. At the committee's last hearing on privacy, I spoke about the importance of privacy to Arizonans. We are practical people who want the modern conveniences that technology brings but we value our privacy. So I'm committed to making sure that Arizonans know how our data is being used so that we can make informed decisions. </p><p>Arizonans also don't like assumptions being made about us or how we choose to live our lives particularly if some of those assumptions are wrong, which is why current privacy and consumer scoring laws concern both me and many Arizonans. In 2013, the FTC competed and published a 10-year congressionally mandated study on the accuracy of credit reports. The FTC found that one in five consumers had an error on at least one of their three credit reports. </p><p>So Ms. Dixon, first thank you for being here. I want you to talk quickly about credit scores as a starting point and what happens if you and I were one of those consumers. How drastically could an error in a credit report negatively affect an Arizonans credit score? </p><p>DIXON: Yes. That--that effect would be profound. So for example, for victims of identity theft, if someone has run up your credit and it's not actually your error, you could be seen as not making your payments, etc., and you can literally move from a 780 score to a 620 in very short order, only takes about a month. And then what you have is a situation where if you are about to buy a home and this is--these are from the calls we get. This isn't just a hypothesis here- the--the home you're about to buy all of a sudden, you can't qualify for a mortgage you because of identity theft. So yes, any error from any source that's in your credit report, it is a piece of serious business. </p><p>SINEMA: So Ms. Dixon, you said this could potentially prevent an Arizonian from buying a home. Would it also get in the way of financing an education or starting a small business or expanding one's business? </p><p>DIXON: Absolutely. </p><p>SINEMA: Wow, that's really troubling. Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, if an Arizonan thinks his or her credit report or score's inaccurate, they can appeal it with the bureau, is that correct? And if so, how? </p><p>DIXON: Yes, there is a--there is a very specific procedure outlined in law where the--the bureaus must respond and there is a series of steps that they can take and both the--the Federal Trade Commission and the CFPB have numerous help and hotlines to help everyone through and the state AG's also do as well but they're--they're very well documented recourses for consumers in this situation. </p><p>SINEMA: Well that's good. So we've established it's important to have an accurate credit score and there's a process to appeal it and fix it. But increasingly, businesses are using so called consumer scores that rank, rate, and segment consumers based on public private and government data that's packaged and sold by data brokers and others. So sometimes, as public data is inaccurate, it's often outdated or it could be incomplete. So are all consumer scores made available to consumers just like credit scores are? </p><p>DIXON: Actually, almost none of them are. In fact, I've had almost no success despite trying to get consumer scores and asking companies for my consumer score. It is almost impossible to get them. </p><p>SINEMA: But then how would an Arizonan know if his or her consumer score was inaccurate if they can't get access to it? </p><p>DIXON: That's the same question I have. They would not know. </p><p>SINEMA: Well, so let's say that an Arizonan were able to find out that his or her consumer score is inaccurate. Are all consumer scores covered under the FCRA so that there's a similar appeals process to resolve inaccuracies? </p><p>DIXON: No consumer scores are that are unregulated are currently covered under the FCRA unless it is a formal credit score as articulated by the FCRA and it used in an eligibility circumstance and it's not covered. </p><p>SINEMA: Well, that's very concerning but thank you for sharing that information with us. Mr. Chairman and ranking member Brown, it's clear that we have a lot of work to do here. We've got to update our privacy laws to reflect new trends that are occurring in both business and technology to make sure that Americans have the right to correct their record, whether it's their credit score or their consumer score on who they are, how they live their lives and what mistakes or inaccuracies that might be over occurring in their lives. </p><p>So I thank you for being here our witnesses and I look forward to working with the committee on this and Mr. chairman, I yield back. </p><p>CRAPO: Thank you. That concludes the first round but Senator--Senator Brown and I would like to do a second round and you're welcome to join in with us senators if you would like. </p><p>There's so many questions. One of them I want to get back to which has been brought up by several senators is this notion of the tension between doing a comprehensive bill like the GDPR in Europe or a sectoral approach like we do in the United States, and I think we all can understand there's sort of a push and a pull on both sides of that question. </p><p>It seems to me though that we don't have a choice at least at a basic level to deal with all data collection in the same way. I think one of you mentioned earlier that it's all blending. It used to be that we could clearly distinguish what a credit bureau did and the credit report that a credit bureau prepared. Now, we have massive amounts. I think Senator Brown referenced the 4,000 number. But I don't even know what the number is of entities that are collecting data. </p><p>My understanding is that the apps on my iPhone, many of them collect data even when I'm not using them to report further to others about whatever it is, data that's not even often related to the app. And it seems to me that all of that data is in one way or another not just blending, but being utilized for many, many different purposes. One of which is credit, one of which is retail sales one of which is college applications, one of it is mortgages. I mean the list can go on and on and on. </p><p>So I guess I'd like to have each of you just briefly, because I have got some more questions but briefly indicate. Do you believe that--that's--that at some basic point, the United States needs to have a comprehensive set of standards and requirements that would cover some basics like when data is being collected, who's collecting it, whether there's an opt-in or an opt-out, what rights to manage or even remove if once data exists? </p><p>CACKLEY: Yes, I think that's--that is where we are right now is--is that the sectoral approach is--it leaves too many gaps and a comprehensive framework. Maybe not completely changing to--to only a comprehensive framework. You could--you could merge the two in some ways but a comprehensive framework that gives a basic privacy rights and--and abilities for consumers to know what their data is and--and how to correct it, how to control it is--is definitely something that needs to be--to be addressed. </p><p>CRAPO: Thank you. Ms. Dixon. </p><p>DIXON: Let me share with you that I've been seeking an answer to the question you just asked for about 27 years. So here's what I've come up with and it's just--it's my opinion. What if the sectoral system was a feature, not a bug born from thoughtful deliberation about very focused issue areas with a lot of buy-in? What if we have not been able to pass comprehensive legislation because our system requires more buy-in than other systems? </p><p>These are just the hypotheses that I'm working with. So if that is the case and also, I have to tell you, I'm quite concerned about the deep disruption to privacy law that would occur if there was massive preemption. But be that the case, what if there was a way to do a surgical strike and provide guardrails in the areas that need it the most that would fill in the sectoral grant--gaps? That's what I'm very interested in. </p><p>So I think that something that had really important principles, Fair Information practices principles, and then the adaptation of those principles for the gaps that exist. So I do think that standards have been a neglected part of the privacy conversation. I have no idea why we don't have more standards in privacy. This mobile phone has loads of standards that attach to it but for our privacy and for data brokers, where are the standards? Well, let's create some, let's start there. </p><p>I'm all for starting cautiously and working with best practices too but to give things teeth and to abide by the--the larger principle. So a nice amalgamation of all the above, something that's multifactorial. I don't think we have silver bullets available to us anymore. </p><p>CRAPO: Well, thank you and just one other quick question and I'll turn to Senator Brown. We've talked a lot about the problems we're trying to address there, whether harm is caused by the use of data, whether credit is impacted, whether people are redlined or denied access to products or opportunities. It seems to me that when you--when you approach the issue from that perspective which is a very legitimate approach, that there is another issue that is--I don't know if I would call it a harm, maybe it is. But there's simply a privacy issue. </p><p>A lot of Americans I believe don't want to have to prove that they were harmed. They don't want people collecting data on them or they don't want certain data collected. It's sort of the right to be forgotten or the right to opt out of certain segments of data collection. Is that a legitimate right that we should try to protect? </p><p>DIXON: It's a legitimate option that we need to be able to have, the--the adversity score. I think that any child who's applying for college should be able to say, hey wait, I don't want my neighborhood being part of that. Do they have to prove harm? I don't think they should have to. They should be able to say, hey no, this is not something I want, it's legitimate. </p><p>CRAPO: Dr. Cackley. </p><p>CACKLEY: I think that's right that--that it's important for people to be able to make a choice about what data they share and what--and what data they don't. </p><p>CRAPO: Senator Brown. </p><p>BROWN: Thank you. Ms. Dixon, this is your last round of questions, blessedly for both of you and please be really brief on these because I have some trouble questions. Should federal regulators and supervisors have full access to every company's predictive models so they can evaluate them for bias and other legal compliance? </p><p>DIXON: I believe they would have to hire about a million people if they did that. I'm not sure of the answer to that question but I have a lot of thoughts on this and I will send you a written follow up. </p><p>BROWN: That would be good including is there a list of companies whose models you believe should be available to regulators for review maybe-- </p><p>DIXON: Send that to you. </p><p>BROWN: Okay, technology expert our last hearing stated while our online economy depends on collection and permanent storage of highly personal data, we don't have the capacity to keep such large collections of user data safe over time. Do you agree with that statement? </p><p>DIXON: I think it's very difficult to keep user data safe 100 percent of the time. </p><p>BROWN: Should they be require--should companies be required to expunge certain types of user data after say 60 or 90 days? </p><p>DIXON: You know, there--I think there are very good arguments for that and there's a--there's a continuum for that and I will respond to that in writing. </p><p>BROWN: Okay thanks. Do companies who personally use--who currently use personal data for profit see existing penalties as little more than the cost of doing business that's--that's often the case in this town that a few million dollar fine on a multi-million dollar company is the cost of doing business. Did this strong--how strong do penalties and other enforcement mechanisms need to be in order to hold these companies accountable? </p><p>DIXON: I don't know the answer to that question. However, I do think that having very good enforcement is an important stick and I think we needs carrots and sticks to make things right. </p><p>BROWN: To holding executives account personally accountable one way? </p><p>DIXON: I don't know about that. </p><p>BROWN: (INAUDIBLE) or you just don't know? </p><p>DIXON: I literally don't know the answer to that. </p><p>BROWN: Okay, okay. A technology expert in our last hearing state was possible in principle to throw one's laptop into the sea and renounce all technology. It's no longer possible to opt out of a surveillance society. Do you believe that statement? </p><p>DIXON: Absolutely. I don't believe that an opt-out village exists. </p><p>BROWN: So what would a meaningful consent contract between users and tech companies or users and data brokers or meaningful opt-out policy look like? </p><p>DIXON: So it needs to be multifactorial and not just rely on consent because consent is a really difficult vehicle for that. I have a lot of very complete thoughts on that and I will follow up in writing. </p><p>BROWN: Okay, you're gonna be busy in the next few days. </p><p>DIXON: That's right. I have a lot on this so. </p><p>BROWN: And last question, you point out in your testimony household data can serve as a proxy for an individual credit score. Some data that seems innocuous like Instagram posts can actually yield predictive data about a user's mental health. How do we know what data is inherently sensitive and what data is innocuous but become--can become sensitive when it's used to make predictions? </p><p>DIXON: Right. One of the most difficult things that I've had to grapple with as a privacy expert and someone who cares so much about privacy is that it's so difficult to say here, this is sensitive data, here this is sensitive data. It's all becoming sensitive depending on how its analyzed and that's why privacy protections have had to become much more multifactorial and much more subtle and in responding to this new issue. </p><p>BROWN: In--in part, that--that that movement if you will from--that is initially not sensitive but becomes that as--as a result of just the--the power of computer--companies--the--the quantity and quality of computer--of computing power, correct? </p><p>DIXON: We were in a digital era. We're really moving into the predictive era and it changes everything. </p><p>BROWN: Okay, very good thank you, Mr. Chairman. </p><p>CRAPO: Thank you. And that does conclude the question for today's hearing. For senators who wish to submit questions for the record, those questions are due to the committee by Tuesday June 18th and we ask the witnesses to respond to those questions as quickly as you can once you receive them. Again, we thank you both for not only your time here today but the attention and--and analysis that you've given to this issue and we'll give to the issue as we proceed. With that, this hearing is adjourned. </p></bodyText></section></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">POLTRN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WCF-3JN1-F15W-H52X-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">147909</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><publicationInfo><publicationName>CQ Transcriptions</publicationName><bodyText><p>All materials herein are protected by United States copyright law and may not be reproduced, distributed, transmitted, displayed, published or broadcast without the prior written permission of CQ Transcriptions.

Providing testimony to the committee today are experts who have researched and written extensively on big data--Dr. Alicia Cackley, the director of the Financial Markets and Community Investment at the Government Accountability Office and Ms. Pam Dixon, executive director of the World Privacy Forum. We appreciate both of you being here. </p><p>As a result of increasingly digital--an increasingly digital economy, more personal information is available to companies and others than ever before. I've been troubled by government agencies and private companies collection of personally identifiable information for a long time. There have been many questions about how individuals or groups of individuals information is collected, with whom it is shared or sold, how it is used and how it is secured. Private companies are collecting, processing, analyzing and sharing massive data on individuals for all kinds of purposes. </p><p>Even more troubling is that the vast majority of Americans do not even know what data is being collected, when it's being collected, how it's being collected, by whom and for what purpose. In particularly, data brokers and technology companies including large social media platforms and search engines play a central role in gathering vast amounts of personal information and often without interacting with individuals specifically in the case of data brokers. </p><p>In 2013, the GAO issued a report on information resellers which includes data brokers and the need for the consumer privacy framework to reflect changes in technology in the marketplace. The report that the current statutory consumer privacy framework fails to address fully new technologies and the growing marketplace for personal information. The GAO also provided several recommendations to Congress on how to approach the issue to provide consumers with more control over their data. </p><p>In 2018--five years later--GAO published a blog summarizing its 2013 report highlighting the continued relevance of the report's findings. The Federal Trade Commission also released a report in 2014 that emphasized the big row of data brokers in the economy. The FTC observed in its report that data brokers collect and store billions of data elements covering nearly every U.S. consumer and that data brokers collect data from numerous sources largely without consumers knowledge. </p><p>In her report \"The Scoring of America\", Pam Dixon discusses predictive consumer scoring across the country--across the economy including the big role that data brokers play. She stresses that today, no protections exist for most consumer scores similar to those that apply to credit scores under the Fair Credit Reporting Act. </p><p>Dixon says, \"Consumer scores are today where credit scores were in the 1950's. Data brokers, merchants, government entities and others can create or use a consumer score without notice to consumers.\" </p><p>Dr. Cackley has also issued several reports on consumer privacy and technology including a report in September 2013 on information resellers which includes data brokers. She says in her report that the current consumer privacy framework does not fully address new technologies and the vastly increased marketplace for personal information. She also discusses potential gaps in current federal law including the Fair Credit Reporting Act. </p><p>The Banking Committee has been examining the data issue in both the private and public sectors from regulators to financial companies, to other companies who gather vast amounts of personal information on individuals or groups of individuals to see what can be done through legislation, regulation, or by instituting best practices. </p><p>Enacted in 1970, the Fair Credit Reporting Act is a law in the Banking Committee's jurisdiction which aims to promote the accuracy, fairness, and privacy of consumer information contained in the files of consumer reporting agencies. Given the exponential growth and use of data since that time, the rise of entities that appear to serve a similar function as the original credit reporting agencies, it's worth examining how the Fair Credit Reporting Act should work in a digital economy. </p><p>During today's hearing, I look forward to hearing more about the structure and practices of the data broker industry and technology companies such as large social media platforms, how data broker--the data broker industry has evolved within the development of new technologies and their interaction with technological--technology companies, what information these entities collect, how it is collected, and whom it is shared with, and for what purposes. What gaps exist in federal privacy law and what changes to federal law should be considered to give individuals real control over their data. </p><p>I appreciate each of you joining us today and look forward to getting some further information about these questions. Senator Brown? </p><p>BROWN: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate your continuing these important bipartisan efforts to protect Americans since it's sensitive personal information. We're looking today at a shadow injury known as data brokers. Most of us--most of you probably haven't heard of these companies. The biggest ones include names like Axiom, Encore Logic, and Spokio, and Zoom Info, and maybe one you've heard of called Oracle. </p><p>According to some estimates, 4,000 of these companies collect and sell private information. But stunningly--and I'm not sure I've ever used that word in this committee--stunningly, not one of them has been willing to show up and speak in front of this committee today. Not one. </p><p>These companies expected--expect to be trusted with the most personal and private information you could imagine about a--about millions and millions of Americans. They're not even willing to show up and explain how their industry works. Some define this as cowardice. It's hard to disagree with that. I think it tells you all you need to know about how much they want their own faces and names associated with that industry. </p><p>As Mache Zagorsky (PH) told us in our last hearing, \"The daily activities of most Americans are now tracked and permanently recorded by automated systems at Google or Facebook.\" Most of that private activity isn't useful without data that anchors it to the real world. Facebook, Google, Amazon want to know where you're using your credit cards, where you buy your brand name appliances, if you're recently divorced, how big your life insurance policy is--the kind of data that big tech gets from data brokers. </p><p>They then combine it with your social media activity to feed into their algorithms. You might've noticed it seems like every product or service you buy comes with a survey or a warning card that asks for--asks for strangely personal information. Why are all these non-tech companies so interested in your data? </p><p>It's simple. Data brokers will pay these companies for any of your personal information they can get their hands on, so they can turn around and sell it to the--to Silicon Valley. It's hard for ordinary consumers to have any power when unbeknownst to them, they're actually--they are actually the product bought and sold. </p><p>It reminds me of a time when corporations that had no business being in the lending industry decided to start making loans and selling them off to Wall Street. We know what happened. Manufacturers or car companies decided that consumer credit would be a great way to boost their profits. When big banks and big tech are willing to pay for something, everyone else will find a way to sell it to them often with devastating results. </p><p>For example, Amazon's undermining retailers and manufacturing across the country through NI competitive practices. The same time it scoops up information from the very businesses it's pushing out of the market. There's Facebook almost singlehandedly undermining the profitability of newspapers across the country. It also gobbles up personal information. </p><p>The New York Times allows data brokers to collect from its leaders. Just like in the financial crisis, a group of shadowy players sits at the center of the market exercising enormous influence over consumers in the economy while facing little or no rules at all. Then they don't share up. </p><p>Jeremy Crapo and I are committing to shining a light on these companies to keep an unregulated data economy from spiraling out of control. </p><p>Yesterday it was reported a Department of Homeland Security contractor allowed unauthorized access to photos of travelers and their license plates to be exposed to potential identity thieves. One of the principal differences between the two political parties in this town is the suspicion that democrats have of private power and the suspicion republicans typically have of government power. I think you're seeing two parties come together on our suspicion of what these data brokers are doing. </p><p>The chairman and I agree that protecting sensitive information like this is timely and important. I look forward to the witness's testimony. Thanks. </p><p>CRAPO: Thank you, Senator Brown and I appreciate our partnership on this issue. We will go in the order I introduced you. And Dr. Cackley, you may begin. But before you do, let me just remind both of you that we would like you to keep your initial remarks to five minutes, so that we can have plenty of time for the senators to engage with you. Dr. Cackley? </p><p>CACKLEY: Thank you, Chairman Crapo, Ranking Member Brown and members of the committee. I'm pleased to be here today to discuss GAO's work on consumer privacy and information resellers also known as data brokers. My remarks are primarily based on our September 2013 report on privacy--privacy issues related to information resellers, as well as more recent work on internet privacy, data protection, facial recognition, and financial technology. </p><p>My statement will focus on two main issues--the lack of an overarching federal privacy law and gaps that exist in the current consumer privacy framework. No overarching federal privacy law governs the collection, use and sale of personal information among private sector companies including information resellers. </p><p>There are also no federal laws designed specifically to address all the products sold and information maintained by information resellers. Instead, federal privacy laws covering the private sector are narrowly tailored to specific purposes, situations, types of information and/or entities such as data related to financial transactions, personal health and eligibility for credit. </p><p>For example, the Fair Credit Reporting Act requires that sensitive consumer information be protected and restricts how it is shared. But the law only applies to information used to determine eligibility for things like credit, insurance and employment. </p><p>Similarly, the Gramm Leach Bliley Act restricts how certain financial information is shared, but it only applies to entities that fall under the law specific definition of a financial institution. Other privacy statutes address other specific circumstances, but there is no federal statute that comprehensively addresses privacy issues in the private sector. </p><p>GAO has stated previously that gaps exist in the U.S consumer privacy framework. We've reported that federal law provides consumers with limited ability to access, control and correct their personal data--particularly data used for marketing purposes. </p><p>Similarly, individuals generally cannot prevent their personal information from being collected, used and shared. Yet information that resellers collect and share for marketing purposes can be very personal or sensitive. For example, it can include information about physical and mental health, income and assets, political affiliations, and sexual habits, and orientation. </p><p>Another area where there are gaps in the consumer privacy framework is with respect to new technologies. For example, federal law does not address expressly when companies can use facial recognition technology to identify or track individuals, nor does it address when consumer knowledge or consent should be required for its use. </p><p>Similarly, no federal privacy law explicitly addresses the full range of practices for tracking or collecting data from consumers online activity, or the application software from mobile devices. And the rise of financial services technologies--known as FinTech--raises new privacy concerns. For example, because new sources of personal data are being used to determine credit worthiness. </p><p>In summary, new markets and technologies have vastly changed the amount of personal information private companies collect and how they use it. But our current privacy framework does not fully address these changes. Laws protecting privacy interests are tailored to specific sectors and uses. And consumers have little control over how their information is collected, used and shared with third parties for marketing purposes. </p><p>As a result, the current privacy framework warrants reconsideration by Congress in relation to consumer interests, new technologies and other issues. Chairman Crapo, Ranking Member Brown, and members of the committee, this concludes my statement. I would be pleased to answer any questions you may have. </p><p>CRAPO: Thank you. Ms. Dixon? </p><p>DIXON: Thank you, Chairman Crapo, Ranking Member Brown, and members of the committee. Thank you for your invitation and for the opportunity to talk about something very, very meaningful today--the Fair Credit Reporting Act, data brokers and privacy. </p><p>Fifty years ago, this committee struck a blow for consumers, for transparency and for fairness when it passed the Fair Credit Reporting Act. This committee talked with stakeholders. They found best practices and before the Hugh--the famous Hugh Report came out--the committee report that defined what became fair information practices--this committee created the Fair Credit Reporting Act. </p><p>It was and still is the most important American privacy law that we have. But it's not as important as it was. There are three reasons why. </p><p>First, credit scores and other scores are being sold and used in consumers lives and these are unregulated. </p><p>Second, the technology of prediction--what can be called predictive analytics otherwise known as AI and machine learning. This technology--and suite of technologies--has advanced profoundly and especially in the last 3-4 years. New kinds of predictabilities have come forth and we have new levels of accuracy in prediction, so that what used to be the accuracy of the credit score now is also the accuracy of an unregulated credit score. And this introduces new problems for consumers. </p><p>Third, these scores are created without due process for consumers. How on earth do we deal with this? </p><p>This is why Congress must expand the Fair Credit Reporting Act to regulate currently unregulated scores especially in the financial sector that are being used in meaningful ways in consumers lives. </p><p>We have other solutions to discuss and other issues to discuss. I look forward to your questions. Thank you. </p><p>CRAPO: Thank you very much, Ms. Dixon. I'd like to ask each of you to answer my first three questions and then I want to get into more discussion. But I would like you--if you possibly can--to limit your answers to yes or no answers to the first three. I know you'll be tempted to elaborate, but I'll give you that chance. </p><p>First, do you agree that data brokers collect and process vast amounts of personal information on nearly every American to the extent that they hold more information about individuals than the U.S. government, or traditional credit, and bureaus? </p><p>CACKLEY: Yes. </p><p>DIXON: Yes. </p><p>CRAPO: Second, do you both agree that most Americans have no knowledge of these activities and in most cases no rights to access, correct, or control the information collected about them? </p><p>DIXON: Yes. </p><p>CACKLEY: Yes. </p><p>CRAPO: And then, third, can certain processing and uses of this information have significant impacts on their financial lives? </p><p>CACKLEY: Yes. </p><p>DIXON: Yes, absolutely. </p><p>CRAPO: All right, now we'll get to where you can elaborate. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>You have both authored reports as the FTC in 2014 that highlighted the gaps in the Fair Credit Reporting Act and other privacy laws. You've both testified about that in your introductory remarks. </p><p>These gaps allow data brokers to evade certain requirements that shouldn't be implied--imposed on them. What are the steps that we can take? You indicated Ms. Dixon that we need to expand the Fair Credit Reporting Act and you essentially said the same thing, Dr. Cackley. But what specifically does this committee need to do with regard to that? </p><p>DIXON: Thank you. In regards to the Fair Credit Reporting Act, it--it--I think very small changes would be very meaningful. Let me give you an example. Right now, as you know--as you well know, the Fair Credit Reporting Act in regards to credit scores applies to individuals. So, when we are, you know, that is regulated the--at the individual level. </p><p>However, if you look at the new forms of credit scores that are available, they are scored at the household level where the Fair Credit Reporting Act does not apply. So, you take a zip plus four and you--you score a household, and give them let's say a score of 720. The household has a very accurate score of 720, then that becomes an unregulated form of credit score. And, you now, these scores were quasi-accurate. That's changed. </p><p>CRAPO: Thank you. Dr. Cackley? </p><p>CACKLEY: The Fair Credit Reporting Act has a--a certain number of--of elements to it that are--that are very helpful. It gives consumers access, control, the ability to correct information and--and safeguards privacy. But it only applies for certain--in certain situations for eligibility decisions. It would be possible to think about looking at a broader set of personal, sensitive information that--that the Fair Credit Reporting Act could cover that would give consumers more of those things--access control, ability to correct--over more sensitive--personal sensitive information than is currently available. </p><p>CRAPO: All right. And--and I'm going to use the term--well, Ms. Dixon you used--you used the term \"unregulated credit scores.\" There is a set of data that is collected about individuals and as you indicate, households. And this data is turned into some kind of an analysis that allows those who use the data to influence and manipulate individuals in--in the marketplace. </p><p>Historically--as you've both indicated--the Fair Credit Reporting Act has focused primarily on credit bureaus. But the scope of who is collecting this data, and how it is being used has exploded as you've both also discussed. The question I have is, isn't this unregulated score that we're talking about that is created for people and then managed by AI--isn't that impacting people's credit? Isn't it impacting their financial decisions? Isn't it significantly focused on that type of influence and manipulation of individuals? </p><p>CACKLEY: I--I think it--it certainly can be. The--the scores can--may not be credit scores, but they may apply to decisions that companies are making about what kinds of products they offer people, at what price they offer things based on a score that the consumer doesn't necessarily see and can't--can't even tell if it's correct or can't make any--any attempt to--to approve that score if they don't even know it exists. </p><p>CRAPO: And to influence them to make such a transaction, yeah. I'll let you go ahead, Ms. Dixon. I'm running out of time here, but go ahead please. </p><p>DIXON: Thank you. It's--we call any score that is not regulated by the Federal Credit Reporting Act consumer scores and we define that. It's in the written testimony. Consumer scores are quite dangerous when they're used in eligibility circumstances. </p><p>So, for example, the--the line between a lead generation which is allowable. You don't have to pull a credit score to--to create a lead generation for a marketing product or a financial product. However, if you are just maybe marketing a financial product and you have something that is equivalent in accuracy to a credit score, all the sudden this changes the equation. There's--there's not even a micrometer in between what a, you know, a regulation would be and a non-regulated score. </p><p>So, if you have essentially something that looks like a credit score, and that acts like a credit score, and is being used like a credit score, well it's the same thing as a duck. If it quacks, it's a duck. So, I think we have to look at the financial products that are being marketed with quasi credit scores very closely. That's of high concern, but there's other categories. </p><p>In the scoring of America, we identified literally hundreds of types of scores. Consumer lifetime value scores where consumers are segmented according to how valuable they are in terms of their purchasing power. There's frailty scores which is more of a medical score. But the scores abound and the concern I have is when people lose opportunities that are meaningful in their lives. For example, scores that are used in eligibility circumstances not described by the Fair Credit Reporting Act such as admissions to colleges and whatnot. </p><p>Imagine having a wonderful high school background and working very hard to achieve the American dream. And then, all of a sudden, some score says that you won't be as qualified as a candidate having nothing to do with your academic achievements, but just somehow with maybe the neighborhood you grew up in. I find this disturbing. </p><p>CRAPO: Agreed. Senator Brown? </p><p>BROWN: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Now Ms. Dixon, you noted that tens of thousands of consumers' scores affecting millions and millions of consumers are used to predict--are used to predict our behaviors or secrets you said. Are you--are you surprised that I mean, Chairman Crapo was not able--nor were we able to bring in data brokers to speak and testify? Are you surprised they weren't willing to testify about their business practices before this Committee today? </p><p>DIXON: Actually, I am surprised and I'm actually--I--I wish they were here and I wish the credit bureaus were here as well because we need to have good industries step forward and to give us their best practices that they use. If there's no good industry to step forward with best practices, then this committee cannot rearticulate what it did 50 years ago. </p><p>BROWN: Well-- </p><p>DIXON: And I don't understand why these industries are not willing to discuss what's happening. And I-- </p><p>BROWN: I think-- </p><p>DIXON: --also don't understand why we can't see our scores. Why? </p><p>BROWN: I am not sure that they didn't show up. I guess I'd like to--I'm not sure I've done this anymore before either. I'd like to ask anybody in the room that represents the data brokers to raise their hand. Lobbyists?  Lawyers?  People paid by the data broker industry?  Any of you here?  Any of you here that want to raise your hand I guess is what I should say. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>Okay. I--I--and if you are, I mean, I--I will give you an opportunity of a lifetime if you are. We'll set up a different chair. And you can set up next to Ms. Dixon and Dr. Cackley. Would you? </p><p>Okay, all right. I guess no surprise there, Mr. Chairman and that--that does illustrate how as I--I know they're watching. I mean, this is really important to their industry. It's very important to their bottom line whether they're watching here or they're watching livestream by, but we'll move on. </p><p>Ms. Dixon, it seems that data predictions create a vicious cycle where the predictions end up often dictating the outcomes. For example, could people who've been systematically targeted by predatory lenders which have lower--having lower credit scores therefore, be likely only to see advertisements for other predatory financial products--is that--I assume that happens. Are there other examples you can think of quickly? </p><p>DIXON: Yes, the predatory example is one we get phone calls about in our office from people who received advertisements for financial products and they didn't understand that they could've gone out on the market and affirmatively looked for the best offer. So, these predatory marketing devices based on unregulated scores are very significant. </p><p>Other significant scores are scores that predict repayment of debt. So, for example, it is the poorest consumers who are targeted the most for debt repayment--all sorts of things like this. The consumer lifetime value scores impact how well you're treated by businesses by how long you're standing in line. </p><p>But the most meaningful circumstances that I can think of is when kids are applying to schools and they are getting scores that dictate whether or not they're going to be accepted to a school based not on their academics, but based on all of these other things like a pseudo credit score, like how--what neighborhood they grew up in. There are neighborhood risk scores which are the modern-day redlining. And I find them deeply objectionable because if we are going to be scored by where we live, how have we advanced and how have all the laws that have been meant to protect from such things--how are they operating if this is still happening today? </p><p>BROWN: So, companies--thank you for that. Companies that particularly--an analogy to redlining--banking redlining, insurance redlining, these companies redlining's--if companies--are you worried that companies would offer discounts for products and services in exchange for sensitive data which would lead you--sort of implied this would lead to a two-tiered system where the wealthy can afford privacy and everyone else will have to sacrifice sensitive information to get access to basic internet services? </p><p>DIXON: That's certainly part of it. I think it goes even broad--more broadly than that. One of the big issues is that you get locked into a big filter bubble of sorts--a marketing bubble and it's not that people mean to get locked into these. But if you are receiving offers--especially for financial tools and services and--and a consumer does not go outside of the offers they receive, they can pay more for autos. They can pay more for products. They can pay more for example, a TV--simple things. Simple things, but if you are a consumer on a fixed income, a television that costs $2,000 instead of 200 makes a meaningful difference in a person's life. That's what worries me the most. </p><p>BROWN: There's a--there's a--one follow-up. Not a question, but just comment, Mr. Chairman. Thanks for--for your forbearance. I--and the whole idea of--that--that people prey on people that are less able to fight back. Yesterday, I was in Des Moines--not running for President, but in Des Moines. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>And I--I was--I was at a manufactured house--manufactured housing neighborhood. And a large hedge fund from--from Salt Lake City has begun to buy up manufacturing housing neighborhoods. There are six of them in the state. There are a number of them in Iowa. They're in a half dozen states at least. </p><p>They come and they buy these. People have paid 50, or 60, or 70,000 for their manufactured home. They pay $200-300 for the--for the rent when the land in these hedge funds is raising rents over a period of about a year--year and a half up to 70 percent and people have nowhere to turn. And it's just--it's like these companies out there are just looking. \"Where--where can we come in, extract the most money at the lowest cost against people that have the most--have the least ability to fight back without political connections?\" And it's just happening across our economy. Thank you. </p><p>CRAPO: Thank you, Senator Brown. Senator Scott? </p><p>SCOTT: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I will note that some people go to Des Moines not to run for president, but perhaps vice president. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>Back over here. So-- </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>I apologize. I meant-- </p><p>BROWN: Mr. Chairman, Senator Scott's a smart guy, but that was not the smartest thing he ever said. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>SCOTT: Senator Brown, I realize you don't actually run for vice president by the number of votes you get-- </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>--but I think there is a process by which people say they are qualified to do things like ask Ms. Dixon a question. </p><p>So, one of the--your comments that you made sounded--I spent about 25 years in the insurance industry. So, one of the comments you made sounded a little bit like redlining. And I'd love for you to unpack that a little bit, but just to make sure I heard you. So, an unregulated--in unregulated ways, credit scores that consumers themselves don't know about that consumers haven't seen, heard or contributed to are being used in ways that will impact their financial well-being to include perhaps even the likelihood of jobs that they may or may not be qualified for. </p><p>That to me, sounds fairly nefarious, but it sounds a whole lot like redlining. Can you unpack, if that's not what you meant please clarify what you did mean and if it did--if it is what you meant, please drill down a little bit, so that we can have a little more clarity to what you're talking about? </p><p>DIXON: Thank you. It's a really complex issue. And in the scoring of America and in my--in my written testimony, I have articulated more fully with footnotes, so. </p><p>SCOTT: We have that part, but. </p><p>DIXON: Yes. So, thank you for your question because it is complex and it's difficult to abstract into a few words. Let me try and make a big effort here. </p><p>All right, so-- </p><p>SCOTT: I'll give you three minutes if you need. </p><p>DIXON: All right, let's go for it. </p><p>SCOTT: Okay. </p><p>DIXON: So, there are amazing real-time analytic products. I've--actually in our update to the scoring, we have looked at this. </p><p>So, for example, financial service companies--you can look across the United States and see pretty much real-time the marketplace activity of people who are spending, and buying, and what that looks like in real time. You can drill down to the census block level and see how well a neighborhood is performing. </p><p>There is a--for example, a product that gives you what's called an up-front score of what the score of that neighborhood is. So--and I will send on follow-up, a series of screenshots of this to you-- </p><p>SCOTT: Thank you. </p><p>DIXON: --so you can see it. </p><p>But it--let's say that you were applying for a university position and your neighborhood has a very poor score. Well, now that can be taken into consideration. We have the college board doing this. They have an adversity score that is doing exactly this. </p><p>So, I find this difficult. The--the lines are narrow. </p><p>SCOTT: Let me interrupt you, Ms. Dixon. So, I read an article I guess a couple of weeks ago, Mr. Chairman about this new SAT score that would take into consideration challenges. Are--are you suggesting that that score could--and the neighborhood score could have an impact on one's SAT score in college admittance? </p><p>DIXON: I do not believe it will have an impact on a person's SAT score. I do believe that it can have a much further and much larger-- </p><p>SCOTT: Ms. Dixon, are you familiar with the--the--the new iteration of the SAT score which takes into consideration the family challenges and-- </p><p>DIXON: Yes. </p><p>SCOTT: Okay. </p><p>DIXON: Yes, I am and that's what I'm referring to. </p><p>SCOTT: Great. </p><p>DIXON: So, while that score is meant to provide context, here's the problem. One of the factors that it uses is a neighborhood risk score and that neighborhood risk score is a secret score. Consumers do not get to see it. </p><p>Currently, the--the college board adversity score--the student's score--they are not allowed to see it. It is a secret score. </p><p>Now let's bring this score into transparency. Let's apply some of the principles of the Fair Credit Reporting Act. Let's give people access to the score. Let them know what factors went into the score. Let's make it fair. That's my point. </p><p>And right now, this does not fall under the Fair Credit Reporting Act by all law. It does not fall into any eligibility circumstance. Not yet, but that's what I am saying. We need to have fairness. Technology is going to advance and it's important that it does. We need to stay competitive in the United States within machine learning and AI. It's very, very crucial for our economic future. But we need fairness and transparency. And we really need the Fair Credit Reporting Act to be guiding best practices and saying, \"Look, technology, yes. Uses need to be right. That's--that's the deal.\" </p><p>SCOTT: Thank you. Mr. Chairman and Ranking Member, I would love for us to do all that we can to compel some of the companies in the industry to participate in a future hearing. </p><p>CRAPO: You have both of our agreement on that already, Senator Scott. </p><p>SCOTT: Thank you. </p><p>CRAPO: Thank you. Senator Reed? </p><p>REED: Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you to the witnesses for their testimony. On previous hearings, it's--and I'm echoing some of the comments of my colleagues particularly Senator Kennedy where a lot of the information should be used as being owned by the person, not by these data brokers. And we have to create real opportunities to protect your data. </p><p>We've got some legal statutes in place, but the Fair Credit Reporting Act, HIPAA, etc. where it's clear by statute. And then, we've got some information that's very public, you know. It's published and it's--it's late notices in newspapers, etc. </p><p>And then, there's the--all the information that's just accumulated by being on a computer. It comes back down to I think three principles in my view. One is that consumers--people should have the ability to opt out of any information collection system. </p><p>And second, that this information should be at some point expunged six months, a year, etc. And then, if it's violated by anybody--a data broker, or a collector, or anyone else, then they should have the right to go to court and say, \"You've ruined me\". So, let's start with both your comments on how do we get sort of an effective opt-out? </p><p>How, you know, my sense is that it's once I'm using a--going to a website, it's hard to figure out where the opt-out is. Sometimes they don't even offer that. Should we in  U.S. Congress say we have to have a very prominent opt out, \"Don't collect my data\"? </p><p>So, let's start with Dr. Cackley and-- </p><p>CACKLEY: So, an opt-out possibility is certainly something that--that is--is available and--and is used in certain circumstances. I think--I think it--there are--there are more circumstances where it could be helpful. I don't know that it--it would be the--that that as a solution alone would--would do the trick in terms of--of if you think about all of the times when you--when you go online and--and you're supposed to read the--the disclosures, and--and click on things. </p><p>REED: No one reads the disclosures. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>CACKLEY: Yeah, exactly. </p><p>REED: That-- </p><p>CACKLEY: And so, it may be that no one will read the opt-out. </p><p>REED: That's why the opt-out can't be hidden in disclosures. It has to be--pop right up here saying-- </p><p>CACKLEY: Absolutely. </p><p>REED: --\"Click yes or no.\" </p><p>CACKLEY: Right, yeah. And I think if someone knows that they don't want their data to be--to be collected and they can opt-out right away, that's a--that's a way to do it. And in other circumstances, people may not understand-- </p><p>REED: Well, I-- </p><p>CACKLEY: --what it is the opt-out is really doing with that. </p><p>REED: I think if you start with the major platforms--the Googles and etc.--if they cannot collect the data-- </p><p>CACKLEY: Right. </p><p>REED: --that data's not going to get down the road-- </p><p>CACKLEY: Sure. </p><p>REED: --to the brokers because they--they don't have it. </p><p>CACKLEY: Absolutely. </p><p>REED: And that's the first place I think to begin. Ms. Dixon? </p><p>DIXON: Thank you. I was honored to serve at the OECD as part of their AI expert group. I just finished helping them write the global guidelines on AI. And something that I learned in that process even more so than I already had is that our data world--our data ecosystems have become so profoundly complex that I am not at all persuaded anymore that opt-out is possible because if--if you recall, the, you know, the Russian nesting dolls where you have the big doll and then all that? </p><p>REED: Uh-huh. </p><p>DIXON: You open the doll and then there's another doll. And then, you open it up again, there's another doll. This is what data is like. </p><p>So, let's say we do opt out of, you know, a platform. Well, what about all of the financial transactions? </p><p>The financial transactions and our retail history purchase--purchase histories are actually the basis of a lot of data broker analysis and then it gets worse. As you get into the dolls, here's one that really is very, very challenging and that's this. </p><p>Data brokers right now, if they didn't collect another piece of data on us, here's something really to think about. They could simply create data about us because that is the state of the technology and I do not know how to create an opt-out that is that far removed from us. </p><p>However, that being the case, I do believe there are things we can do especially if we focus on restricting negative uses that harm consumers and really look at the end points of that process. And also, at the beginning and say, \"Hey, what are the standards you are using? What can we do to make good standards? And at the end, what are the standards for use? How can we control these two points?\" </p><p>But I think there's a role for opt-out for example, especially in for example, human subject research must have meaningful consent. As a tool, I think it's lost a lot of its power. </p><p>REED: I--I--you've studied this longer than I, but I think it's a place to begin and it's an--it's not a perfect solution. But, you know, you--you can't make the perfect enemy of the good. If it gives us--people a little more protection I think it should be pursued. </p><p>And I--the other aspect is too--is as you've pointed out with this synthetic data--they create this synthetic data. And sort of purging it periodically might also help us. Again, I think you've put your finger on this dilemma now that the complexity--the ability to take together indirectly--not directly data is profound. But if we don't take some simple steps, it gets worse. It doesn't get better. Thank you. </p><p>CRAPO: Thank you. Senator Schatz. </p><p>SCHATZ: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you to the testifiers. Ms. Dixon, you know, we're--we're talking about some reforms to the Fair Credit Reporting Act and what worries me a bit is that as important as I think it is to bring data brokers back into the fold in terms of how the statute governs their behavior, the Fair Credit Reporting Act doesn't actually work as it relates to the credit bureaus. </p><p>The credit bureaus put the onus on the consumer. The consumer has to pay to correct or monitor his or her own data. And so, that statute is broken. And so, to the extent that we're going to put all of these shadow data brokers under FCRA, I think we have to be clear-eyed about how imperfect that system is for millions and millions of Americans. I'd like you to comment on that. </p><p>DIXON: Well, I agree with you. That's why I said that the--even our best American privacy law isn't as important as it used to be. It is--it does have cracks and fissures. However, it does something very important. It makes it so that things aren't secret. </p><p>You and I, we can look at our credit score. This is huge. This is a huge improvement from pre-2000 when it was illegal to do so. We can see our bureau report and correct it. We can't see our other scores and this is-- </p><p>SCHATZ: Fair enough. </p><p>DIXON: --problematic. Yeah. </p><p>SCHATZ: Fair enough. Let me--let me ask you a sort of technical question. What's the relationship between data broker and credit bureaus? In other words, are some of these credit bureaus getting into the data broker business? Did--have some of them acquired data brokers?  What is their relationship? </p><p>DIXON: Yes. So, for example, Equifax-Experian, a lot of times what they'll do is they'll have part of their business as a formal, regulated credit reporting business. And then, other aspects of their business are unregulated-- </p><p>SCHATZ: Which is-- </p><p>DIXON: --scoring. </p><p>SCHATZ: --we would characterize as the marketing side. </p><p>DIXON: Yes, I am aware that they call it marketing. However, I call it the consumer scoring side. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>But yes, your point is absolutely correct. </p><p>And additionally, you--you mentioned that there is, you know, also first-party. One of the things that's been happening is there's a lot of data privacy concerns and there is a--a real move now for a lot of--a lot of different types of businesses to purchase data brokers and bring them in, so that they are dealing with first party data. </p><p>So, now we have a fracture in the data broker business model where you can't just say, \"Well, here are the data brokers. Let's regulate them.\" That's not possible anymore. Maybe 25-30 years ago, but not now. I think we really have to look at practices and say, \"Hey, are you using the data for these purposes especially in regards to eligibility?\" </p><p>SCHATZ: But--but the challenge--to follow-up on what Senator Scott talked about in terms of digital redlining-- </p><p>DIXON: Yeah. </p><p>SCHATZ: --is that to the extent that they're using data sets that are essentially in combination a proxy for race-- </p><p>DIXON: Right. </p><p>SCHATZ: --and to the extent that those algorithms are not transparent, it is incredibly difficult to imagine that even if we put them under FCRA and even if the FTC were authorized to go after CFB--were authorized to go after them, just to make the case would be incredibly difficult. Am I--am I correct there? </p><p>DIXON: I believe you're correct and that's why--that's why we proposed a standards bill that really looks at creating new standards to start to build a mesh network to fill in these gaps because you are correct. There are important gaps here. </p><p>SCHATZ: And under FCRA, and in the sort of old days, you used to have sort of shadow shoppers-- </p><p>DIXON: Yes. </p><p>SCHATZ: --to try to figure out whether it was discrimination in terms of impact as opposed to in terms of intent. And it seems to me that it could be a--a--a way where we could subject all of these data brokers to a regime where they had to--they didn't have to provide the code for their algorithm, but they--they had to provide a regulator with the ability to utilize the algorithm and see if the--and run a bunch of reps, and figure out if statistically speaking it was in fact a proxy--proxy for race or if there was a--a--a desperate impact on--on--on protected classes. </p><p>DIXON: I think that's right. And, you know, it's not that algorithms are bad. It's not that scoring is bad. It's how it's used. </p><p>SCHATZ: No, and some of-- </p><p>DIXON: Yeah. </p><p>SCHATZ: And some of this could actually alleviate the problem of the credit bureaus in terms of the three or four million people who have bad credit scores that are--that are-- </p><p>DIXON: Uh-huh. </p><p>SCHATZ: --that are correct. And so, if you can come up with an alternative that is non-discriminatory, it--it--it provides a real opportunity. I'll just offer one last thought and I'd like your--both of your comments for the record. We are working on legislation--and I'm working on legislation to--to establish a duty of care because I think the problem is in a sectoral approach, some of these companies are--I don't know if they're a thin tech company, or a tech company, or under the HIPAA regime. And they sort of evade the various regulations because it's not clear where they belong. </p><p>And in any case, once the data has been collected either voluntarily or not, either through the internet of things or at one point you clicked \"I agree\" because you signed up for a social platform. The question is what is the obligation of the company who's in possession of your data? </p><p>And the duty of care is the most simple way to say cross-sectorally, \"You may not intentionally harm any person who's data you're in possession of.\" And that's why the duty of care is such a clean way to address all of this because otherwise, we're going to be always a decade behind whatever these newfangled companies are attempting to do to us. </p><p>But if I could take that for the record please. </p><p>DIXON: Yes, I think that that is a potentially very good approach. I think Vermont did something like this at the state level where they said, \"You cannot purchase data with the intent to defraud or discriminate.\" </p><p>So, I do think that ensuring that fairness is percolating throughout the system is a really good remedy. </p><p>SCHATZ: Thank you. </p><p>CRAPO: Senator Cortez Masto? Oh, did you want to have Dr. </p><p>CORTEZ MASTO: (OFF MIC) </p><p>SCHATZ: I'll take those for the record. </p><p>CRAPO: So, he'll let you respond in writing is what he's saying. </p><p>SCHATZ: Thank you, that's fine. </p><p>CRAPO: Senator Cortez Masto? </p><p>CORTEZ MASTO: Thank you. I appreciate that, but I would like to hear what Dr. Cackley had to say as well. </p><p>CRAPO: All right. </p><p>CACKLEY: So, in terms of I think a duty of care, that a basic part of a comprehensive privacy law, that would--that would be a--a--a good--a good element to include what--what we have with--have reported on is--is be given the gaps that the sectoral approach allows. </p><p>In--in terms of privacy, we--we have--have recommended that Congress really consider a more comprehensive approach and--and include within it several different elements. And a duty of care element would--would--would certainly--should certainly be--be part of that consideration. </p><p>CORTEZ MASTO: Yeah. No, I like that idea too. I think it's very innovative. Along with that would--transparency would be key, right? </p><p>The consumer knows that whatever regulated credit score or unregulated credit score, whatever's being used, that's based on an algorithm that is identifying their factors. They should have access to that, correct? </p><p>CACKLEY: Absolutely. Access, control, ability to-- </p><p>CORTEZ MASTO: Right. </p><p>CACKLEY: Correct. All of those are--are important elements, yes. </p><p>CORTEZ MASTO: Okay. So, Dr.--or excuse me, Ms. Dixon., I understand in 2015, Allstate Insurance began selling consumer driving data. And Allstate Chairman CEO Tom Wilson said that the Property Casualty Insurance Company hopes to profit from the sell of telematics data and then pass on savings to consumers by lowering premiums. Is Allstate unusual in its plans to capture this information about people's driving data to earn additional profit? And I'm just curious, how many insurers have adopted telematics and what's been the impact if you know? </p><p>DIXON: So, my understanding is that they are no longer the only insurance company doing this. </p><p>CORTEZ MASTO: Uh-huh. </p><p>DIXON: There are now several insurance companies and there are also health insurance companies who are saying, \"Hey, give us access to a variety of your data and we will, you know, give you commemorate lower rates when applicable.\" </p><p>So, I think that these are rather uncomfortable things and--to put it mildly. I would really like to see guardrails on how these are used. I don't think we can stop what's happening in prediction. Prediction is getting cheaper-- </p><p>CORTEZ MASTO: Right. </p><p>DIXON: --and it's getting more accurate. So, we can't stop it. However, I think we can take a multifactorial approach to the problems that--the real problems that these situations impose. Do we want consumers giving way their data in order to, you know, have a--a better premium? </p><p>And I--I think that you should be able to--to have protections without giving away your data. You should--we need--we need good rights here. </p><p>CORTEZ MASTO: Right. </p><p>DIXON: And to do that, we're going to have to have good rules of the road that encompass new technology, but keep the values. Let us make a decision and not be financially penalized for it. And should an insurance company be able to sell this data? </p><p>That's a question we need to have as a matter of public discussion. It shouldn't just be decided just by industry. It needs to be a multi-stake holder conversation about that. </p><p>CORTEZ MASTO: And this type of data is what goes into what you've identified as the neighborhood risk scores that-- </p><p>DIXON: That's part of it. </p><p>CORTEZ MASTO: --that companies could use, correct? </p><p>DIXON: Oh, there's so many scores, but yes. </p><p>CORTEZ MASTO: Right, but that could be part of it. </p><p>DIXON: That's exactly right. </p><p>CORTEZ MASTO: There's so much data. </p><p>And the other concern I'm understanding is that because of the--because of the new technology and the algorithms, the concern is that this is--this information with respect to unregulated--unregulated credit scores could end up providing a higher accuracy level than the regulated credit scores such that's the--such that the banks or other financial institutions would start using those unregulated credit scores more so than the regulated. Is that right? </p><p>DIXON: Well, I think that you'll find that banks in particular are very, very careful about these kinds of uses. Of the people that we've interviewed, they've been very, very careful. It's actually--some of the people I worry about the most are the people who are not in banks and who want to pull a credit score product to do marketing. </p><p>And instead of actually going through the regulation and making a firm offer of credit, for insurance they'll just kind of skirt around the edges, and pull the--the, you know, unregulated credit score, and then make these offers. And I--someone discussed today especially if it's a predatory offer. This is where things get very problematic. </p><p>If you have a--a consumer who's identified in the credit score 400-500 level and someone doesn't want to make a firm offer of credit or insurance, but they want that number and they want to use that number to market a product maybe for bill consolidation or payday loans, then I think we all need to be very interested in protections for that. </p><p>CORTEZ MASTO: Thank you. And I--I notice my time is almost also up. I will also just submit this for the record--facial recognition and data that comes from that. It's topical right now and the question would be should that information be shared with third-party--parties like data brokers to be utilized? </p><p>I'm curious your thoughts on--on us or companies in general. I think it was just in the paper today. Airlines were looking at using this type of facial recognition data. So, I--I--I'll submit that for the record. Thank you so much for this conversation today. I appreciate it, Mr. Chairman. </p><p>CRAPO: Thank you. Senator Warner? </p><p>WARNER: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Let me first of all just associate myself with both your comments and the ranking member's comments. It's pretty remarkable that you invited the data industry or data brokers to come and they didn't show up. I think that's--that's a very telling statement. </p><p>I know folks have talked a--about the Fair Credit Reporting Act. I know we've talked about a variety of issues. I--I've been thinking a lot about this in terms of the social media companies, you know. The data brokers are really just one piece of the overall growing data economy and we're talking a lot about third-party vendors. </p><p>Obviously, I've got concerns as well about first party vendors--the Amazon's, the Facebook's, the Google's. And would you both agree that candidly--or that most Americans don't have the slightest idea of what kind of data's being collected about them and what that data is worth? </p><p>CACKLEY: I think it's definitely true that most Americans don't understand the breadth of data that is collected about them. They may have--be aware in certain instances where they have checked yes or--or provided something. But--but they don't--they don't know the--the--the true extent of it. </p><p>WARNER: Ms. Dixon, to you? </p><p>DIXON: Thank you. The--the complexity of data flows right now is--is extraordinary and you are correct. First parties, third parties--everything is blending. And if you look at even just identity, you can have an identity that overlaps in--in 20 different data ecosystems. </p><p>And as a result, it's--it's become very difficult for anyone-- </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>--to map the data. There's this amazing chart that was produced by the advertising industry for itself actually and it--it maps this extraordinarily. It looks like the Tokyo subway lines. I mean, it's incredibly complex and I don't know that it's possible to fully map our data anymore. </p><p>So, if that's the case, how on earth do we cabin practices, so that there is a--a--almost like a routine--a set of routine uses where, \"Here are the acceptable uses for companies. End of discussion.\" Boom. And then, outside of this not acceptable uses. </p><p>We're going to have to find our way to something like that and we might have to distinguish it by sector and by even--perhaps even individual companies. But I'd like to see that very fairly adjudicated. I'm really interested in seeing people talk with each other to figure this out. We need to have very meaningful discussions to figure out where the data's going and how we can best protect it, but I don't think people know how. </p><p>WARNER: Well, one of the things that I'm--that you've touched on--briefly on one of the areas I've got some bipartisan legislation on that would try to focus on some of the manipulative practices--so-called \"dark patterns\" you use where, you know, in laymen's terms you have six sets of arrows clicking on, you know, pointing you towards the \"I agree\" button and you can never find the \"unsubscribe\" button. </p><p>And there are a host of practices that go on in the industry where people give up this information oftentimes unwittingly and through extraordinarily sophisticated psychological tools being used by the companies and others to get this information. </p><p>I--I know my time's getting down. I would just like your commentary. I--I believe consumers ought to have a right to know what data is being collected about them. I believe we need to take it a step further and also have some basic evaluation in terms of how much that--that data is worth and I'm an old Telecom guy. For a long time, it used to be really hard to bring competition in--in the Telco market until we instituted--by government regulation--number portability. </p><p>I believe that same concept--data portability--ought to be brought into the data economy, so that if you are not liking how you're being treated I think about it mostly in the social media context. But there are a variety of areas in the credit scoring areas as well where, you know, if we had that knowledge of what data was being collected, what it's worth--and then, if you didn't like the way Facebook was treating you or some other enterprise, you were easily able to move your--your--all of your data in one swipe to--to a new co or a new platform. I think you could bring some additional competitive practices to--to the area. </p><p>In these last couple of seconds, data evaluation, data knowledge, and data portability--ideas, comments, suggestions? </p><p>DIXON: I really like the idea of data interoperability's, so that there's more freedom. </p><p>WARNER: With portability you've got to have interoperability or it doesn't-- </p><p>DIXON: Yes, but it's--I think it's going to be something that will end up working out in time, but it should be a good priority. </p><p>CACKLEY: So, this isn't something that we've looked at specifically. But I think that to the degree that you're talking about, comprehensive legislation that really covers all of the different platforms and--and parties, then--then that kind of interoperability would--would--would be part of it. </p><p>WARNER: We'd like to share with both of you some of the work we've been doing and I think there's a-- </p><p>CACKLEY: Yeah. </p><p>WARNER: --could be broad-based bipartisan support. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. </p><p>CRAPO: Thank you. Senator Kennedy? </p><p>KENNEDY: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. If I go on the internet, and I search, and I look at social media, and I buy something on Amazon let's say, who--I mean, my--my actions--my behavior is recorded. We call it data. Who owns it? </p><p>DIXON: I have a whitepaper I'm going to send to you. We've spent a lot of time thinking about this issue. So, the issue of data ownership is quite difficult to parse. But let me give you my best shot-- </p><p>KENNEDY: Yes, ma'am. </p><p>DIXON: --and let's have a discussion. </p><p>KENNEDY: If--if--well-- </p><p>DIXON: So-- </p><p>KENNEDY: --I'd like to have a discussion, but first I'd like to have an answer. </p><p>DIXON: Here's the answer. I view data as--in our current data ecosystems--as a common pool resource. I think a lot of different entities can lay claim to that data. However, no one gets to own it. And--well, in some cases-- </p><p>KENNEDY: You don't think that I own my data? </p><p>DIXON: --you can. It depends on where you've used it and where it is. I think there's some-- </p><p>KENNEDY: Not on how much you-- </p><p>DIXON: Yeah. </p><p>CACKLEY: I don't think there is a--an answer to--to who owns that--your data when once you've--you've taken an action especially in--in some ways interacted with a--with another company. </p><p>KENNEDY: Well let's suppose that Congress passed a law that said the consumer owns his data and he or she can knowingly license it. What would be wrong with that? </p><p>CACKLEY: I--I don't think there--there be anything wrong with it. I think it would--it would have impact on--on who could then collect that your data or whether data could be collected. </p><p>KENNEDY: No, I can--I can--I could license my data knowingly. </p><p>CACKLEY: Right. </p><p>KENNEDY: Now, what--what--in--in--in terms of knowingly licensing my data that I own, what sort of disclosures should a social media company for example make to me in terms of how it's going to use my data? Right now, they make disclosures but--but they're--there--they're--they don't inform the consumer. I've said before, some of those things are seven, eight, nine, ten pages written by lawyers. You could hide a dead body in them and nobody would find them--find the body, I mean nobody reads them. That's not knowing consent. What--what does a social media company have to tell me in order for me to know what they're doing? </p><p>DIXON: May I offer an example from the--the medical field? So under--under HIPAA, there are very meaningful mechanisms prior to a consumer agreeing to release their information outside of the protection of HIPPA. However, one of the concerns that's come up with this is that it's become very, very easy for consumers patients to \"donate their data.\" And what's happened is that people have donated their data and taken it out of the protections of HIPPA without meaningful consent. </p><p>KENNEDY: I'm not--I'm not trying to be rude, I'm trying to get answers. Here's my question. If I own my data and I license it, I need to understand what license it--licensing it means. What needs to be disclosed to me? </p><p>DIXON: My understanding, looking at other fields because this is not something I have studied at length. My understanding is that the--that is a serious agreement and it would require massive disclosures. I think you could almost put a graveyard in that disclosure, you know, compared to-- </p><p>KENNEDY: And you don't--you don't think it's possible to--to write a disclosure that the consumer would understand. Is that what you imply? </p><p>DIXON: In this area, I'd have to really look at that--that--again, this is not an area of research for me but I--I-- </p><p>KENNEDY: What do you think (INAUDIBLE)? </p><p>CACKLEY: I think it--it would be--it would be very complicated. So it is not an area that we've looked at either but--but just in--if--if Congress were to pass a law that allowed consumers to license their own data, that would just create a large amount of--of regulations to go along with that. </p><p>KENNEDY: So you both think that we should just allow companies to do what they want with our data, that this is a--this is a problem this problem is impossible to solve? </p><p>CACKLEY: No, no, and I don't think I meant that at all. I just meant that it would--it would have to be worked through, it--it's not an easy fix. It's--it's-- </p><p>KENNEDY: No, I don't think an easy fix is around here. </p><p>DIXON: And I don't mean that either. I--I believe that we should have rules of the road and we should have agreed upon rules on what-- </p><p>KENNEDY: That--that's--I agree with that too and--and everybody--I mean, we've had a lot of interesting discussions about this but--but no offense to you two, but then the experts never offer a solution. So to me, the solution is consumer owns his data, you can license it, the licensing has to be knowing and--and intentional. You can move your data, portability should--should be an option. I can change my mind about licensing it and--and companies will adapt to that, they'll have no choice. Thank you, Mr. chairman. </p><p>CRAPO: Senator Menendez. </p><p>MENENDEZ: Thank you Mr. Chairman. I had the same concerns as Senator Kennedy because we seem to be living and in age of data breaches. Just last week, we learned of a breach concerning a medical billing company, America Medical Coalition Agency that may have exposed the personal financial and even medical data of 20 million patients who are customers of Quest Diagnostics and LabCorp. </p><p>So let me ask you, Ms. Dixon, people are rightly concerned that some of their personal data is now exposed and could be used against them. Can data brokers legally compile aggregate or sell data that has been acquired through an illegal hack? </p><p>DIXON: I haven't, I am not an attorney. So I think that's a question that an attorney could better answer you. But my first best guess is I don't think you can use improperly inferme--information that has been disclosed in an unauthorized manner for your own business purposes. That seems like that would be really out of balance. </p><p>MENENDEZ: Dr. Cackley, do you have any idea? </p><p>CACKLEY: I don't know the answer but I can certainly find out. </p><p>MENENDEZ: Yeah, well I appreciate that. Should people be concerned the data not otherwise covered by HIPAA is ending up in the hands of data brokers even in the absence of a hack? Are billing companies like America Medical Coalition Agencies selling non-HIPAA data to brokers? </p><p>DIXON: This is an ongoing area of grave concern for us. There are actual scores of health data. There's a frailty score that can predict very closely how sick you are and when you might possibly die. I think that there are all sorts of scores and products so related to-- </p><p>MENENDEZ: Not sure I want to check on that data myself but-- </p><p>DIXON: Yeah me either. But--but-- </p><p>MENENDEZ: But that's--that's pretty frightening, isn't it? </p><p>DIXON: It is and health--you know, health data that is not covered under HIPAA is become an increasing area so-- </p><p>MENENDEZ: Let me ask you this. When hackers gained access to non-HIPAA data like in the Quest data breach, can data brokers apply machine learning to these data points to infer or reconstruct sensitive HIPPA protected medical data? </p><p>DIXON: I actually don't think that they need to acquire unauthorized data in order to do that. They can just look at our purchase histories and get an awful lot of data about us. But in terms of what's happening with this entire area, the data breaches of medical data actually can lead to forms of identity theft and medical identity theft that are very, very difficult to cure and you can have extremely meaningful consequences in people's life. </p><p>MENENDEZ: Let me ask you then. HIPAA's nearly 25 years old and in 2009, high tech provided updates which were concerning health information technology, but I'm still concerned that we're playing catch-up when it comes to protecting patients. And, you know, of all the information that should be private and privileged to you, your health standing should be extraordinary. There are all types of consequences in that in employment, in discrimination and a whole host of things. Are there gaps in HIPAA and other data security laws that need to be addressed to better protect people today in this 21st century threat? What's coordination is missing between existing legal protections? </p><p>DIXON: I--I do think there's gaps and the biggest gaps that exist right now are the gaps that exist between the sectoral protections. And I don't think the answer is to just rip out the sector protections that exist such as a Fair Credit Reporting Act or HIPAA or Sarbanes-Oxley etc, but to find a way to fill those gaps in. For example, victims of medical identity theft can use their Fair Credit Reporting Act rights to get their financial information corrected, but under HIPAA they are--it is--it's not possible for them because it doesn't exist in this statute. </p><p>It's not possible for them to get a deletion similar to the FCRA in their health files so they could actually carry around inaccurate information which can really have an impact on their treatment and insurance costs and there's not a solution yet. So this is the kind of gap we need to address. </p><p>MENENDEZ: Lastly there's one breach that compromises the personal information of 20 million pra--patients, that's pretty troubling. One data broker has data on 300 million consumers. We're still reeling from the Equifax breach which affected 145.5 million consumers. If the information of 300 million consumers were to be compromised, we might start calling for private information, public information because at the end of the day, that's the result of it. </p><p>What's the ramifications for consumer if a data broker is breached and should we hold them to a higher standard of security especially because their volume is so consequential? </p><p>DIXON: Data broker breaches are very significant. So my--my assessment of this is that the--the various state data breach laws are doing a pretty good job especially in some cases where the data breach law is quite strong in forcing disclosures and--and notices but I think we need to do more to ensure that all of the information held that is sensitive and health related etc, is duly notified to the consumer. </p><p>The problem with the data brokers is what they will say is, oh wait, wait, we don't have a direct relationship with the consumers, we can't notify them. And I think that is a gap that needs to be resolved. Now, the state of Vermont has resolved that gap. </p><p>MENENDEZ: They could--they could--they could reach back to the entity that provided them the data in the first place and they could notify. Could they not? </p><p>DIXON: I believe that that could happen and it has happened-- </p><p>MENENDEZ: I just think--I just think they should be held to a higher standard of security because the consequences of incredible numbers of Americans that are subject to having their privacy breached and their healthcare breached is just beyond acceptance. Thank you, Mr. chairman. </p><p>CRAPO: Thank you. Senator Rounds. </p><p>ROUNDS: Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you for holding this--this hearing today. I--I--I'd like to see if I--in--in listening to this, if I've picked up the grasp of some of the challenges we have here. It would appear to me that--that we're talking about first of all the question of the security of the data that's actually being collected. Second of all, it appears that we're questioning whether or not, there is an appropriate way for individual consumers or individuals to actually find out and to have access to what these organizations, these non-regulated organizations actually have. </p><p>And Finally, that this appears that may very well be a workaround with regard to the information that's being collected and then disseminated from what a regulated entity would have. In a nutshell, are those the three areas and would there be other areas that you would also identify? I would ask each of you for your thoughts. </p><p>CACKLEY: Those are certainly three of the--of the main points that have come up today. I think the oth--other piece that we haven't touched on maybe as much is outside of--of the--the data brokers themselves. There are--there are other technologies where--where privacy issues that have to do with--with, you know, mobile devices, with facial recognition technology, we did mention that, with financial technology that are--that are also areas of concern that--that are--fall outside potentially the--the protections of FCRA in particular. </p><p>ROUNDS: The use of machine learning and artificial intelligence in this process. Okay, miss Dixon. </p><p>DIXON: So my focus has really never been on the technologies as an endpoint. My focus has always been on okay, so we have technological processes that are going to continue through time but what does that actually mean in practice that I've always looked at the practice? So your--your assessment of where the sticking points are is accurate. The thing I would add is this. </p><p>I think it's going to become as we move forward and prediction gets cheaper, I think prediction is going to be coming to a mobile phone near us like ours, and I think we have to be very cautious about looking at categories of technologies and label--labeling them as bad. Similarly, in industry, I think we have to be very careful and say okay, what are the practices that we want to go after here and want to address because they're harming consumers? And if we can do that in a truly multifactorial way, I think that will be helpful. </p><p>Wherever these practices exist, wherever they are, we need to be addressing them because they're meaningful and they have impact. </p><p>ROUNDS: There's a difference between the way that we have looked at data and data collection and privacy in the United States versus the way that it's been done in some other parts of the world. Here, we follow and we use Gramm-Leach-Bliley within the United States but in Europe they take a different approach, the GDPR which seeks to really achieve a--a different and more comprehensive approach but would be rather challenging. </p><p>Can you share with me the thought process or your analysis of the differences or the advantages one versus the other between the way that we handle it today in the United States versus what they have--what they're doing in Europe with the GDPR in its current form? </p><p>CACKLEY: So we haven't looked at GDPR directly yet but I can say that that there are definitely some elements of GDPR that are--are already embodied in the--the fair information practices principles that--that are the basis of--of some of our privacy regulation already. There are other pieces that--that--that are not and--and one of the main ones I would say is the right to be forgotten which is a part of GDPR that--that really doesn't--it isn't encompassed in--in anything here. </p><p>ROUNDS: (INAUDIBLE) Ms. Dixon. </p><p>DIXON: Sorry. The GDPR, the--as you know it's--it--it was built on the EU 9546. So it's--it's--it has a lot of bureaucratic history behind it. If you look at what they were trying to do in all the derogations and whatnot, it's a really complex and thoughtful structure. I think that it does provide for baseline privacy protections, but they don't have the sectoral system and they don't have government privacy. So I think there is one thing I'll say, in--in--in our country the Privacy Act is very effective in--in regulating certain aspects of government information collection, they don't have anything like that. </p><p>ROUNDS: Thank you and I see my time has expired, Mr. chairman. Thank you both of you for your--for your answers today and Mr. chairman once again, thank you for the--the opportunity here today with the--this--this hearing on this very important topic. </p><p>CRAPO: Thank You senator Rounds. Senator Sinema. </p><p>SINEMA: Thank you Mr. chairman and--and thank you to our witnesses for being here today. At the committee's last hearing on privacy, I spoke about the importance of privacy to Arizonans. We are practical people who want the modern conveniences that technology brings but we value our privacy. So I'm committed to making sure that Arizonans know how our data is being used so that we can make informed decisions. </p><p>Arizonans also don't like assumptions being made about us or how we choose to live our lives particularly if some of those assumptions are wrong, which is why current privacy and consumer scoring laws concern both me and many Arizonans. In 2013, the FTC competed and published a 10-year congressionally mandated study on the accuracy of credit reports. The FTC found that one in five consumers had an error on at least one of their three credit reports. </p><p>So Ms. Dixon, first thank you for being here. I want you to talk quickly about credit scores as a starting point and what happens if you and I were one of those consumers. How drastically could an error in a credit report negatively affect an Arizonans credit score? </p><p>DIXON: Yes. That--that effect would be profound. So for example, for victims of identity theft, if someone has run up your credit and it's not actually your error, you could be seen as not making your payments, etc., and you can literally move from a 780 score to a 620 in very short order, only takes about a month. And then what you have is a situation where if you are about to buy a home and this is--these are from the calls we get. This isn't just a hypothesis here- the--the home you're about to buy all of a sudden, you can't qualify for a mortgage you because of identity theft. So yes, any error from any source that's in your credit report, it is a piece of serious business. </p><p>SINEMA: So Ms. Dixon, you said this could potentially prevent an Arizonian from buying a home. Would it also get in the way of financing an education or starting a small business or expanding one's business? </p><p>DIXON: Absolutely. </p><p>SINEMA: Wow, that's really troubling. Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, if an Arizonan thinks his or her credit report or score's inaccurate, they can appeal it with the bureau, is that correct? And if so, how? </p><p>DIXON: Yes, there is a--there is a very specific procedure outlined in law where the--the bureaus must respond and there is a series of steps that they can take and both the--the Federal Trade Commission and the CFPB have numerous help and hotlines to help everyone through and the state AG's also do as well but they're--they're very well documented recourses for consumers in this situation. </p><p>SINEMA: Well that's good. So we've established it's important to have an accurate credit score and there's a process to appeal it and fix it. But increasingly, businesses are using so called consumer scores that rank, rate, and segment consumers based on public private and government data that's packaged and sold by data brokers and others. So sometimes, as public data is inaccurate, it's often outdated or it could be incomplete. So are all consumer scores made available to consumers just like credit scores are? </p><p>DIXON: Actually, almost none of them are. In fact, I've had almost no success despite trying to get consumer scores and asking companies for my consumer score. It is almost impossible to get them. </p><p>SINEMA: But then how would an Arizonan know if his or her consumer score was inaccurate if they can't get access to it? </p><p>DIXON: That's the same question I have. They would not know. </p><p>SINEMA: Well, so let's say that an Arizonan were able to find out that his or her consumer score is inaccurate. Are all consumer scores covered under the FCRA so that there's a similar appeals process to resolve inaccuracies? </p><p>DIXON: No consumer scores are that are unregulated are currently covered under the FCRA unless it is a formal credit score as articulated by the FCRA and it used in an eligibility circumstance and it's not covered. </p><p>SINEMA: Well, that's very concerning but thank you for sharing that information with us. Mr. Chairman and ranking member Brown, it's clear that we have a lot of work to do here. We've got to update our privacy laws to reflect new trends that are occurring in both business and technology to make sure that Americans have the right to correct their record, whether it's their credit score or their consumer score on who they are, how they live their lives and what mistakes or inaccuracies that might be over occurring in their lives. </p><p>So I thank you for being here our witnesses and I look forward to working with the committee on this and Mr. chairman, I yield back. </p><p>CRAPO: Thank you. That concludes the first round but Senator--Senator Brown and I would like to do a second round and you're welcome to join in with us senators if you would like. </p><p>There's so many questions. One of them I want to get back to which has been brought up by several senators is this notion of the tension between doing a comprehensive bill like the GDPR in Europe or a sectoral approach like we do in the United States, and I think we all can understand there's sort of a push and a pull on both sides of that question. </p><p>It seems to me though that we don't have a choice at least at a basic level to deal with all data collection in the same way. I think one of you mentioned earlier that it's all blending. It used to be that we could clearly distinguish what a credit bureau did and the credit report that a credit bureau prepared. Now, we have massive amounts. I think Senator Brown referenced the 4,000 number. But I don't even know what the number is of entities that are collecting data. </p><p>My understanding is that the apps on my iPhone, many of them collect data even when I'm not using them to report further to others about whatever it is, data that's not even often related to the app. And it seems to me that all of that data is in one way or another not just blending, but being utilized for many, many different purposes. One of which is credit, one of which is retail sales one of which is college applications, one of it is mortgages. I mean the list can go on and on and on. </p><p>So I guess I'd like to have each of you just briefly, because I have got some more questions but briefly indicate. Do you believe that--that's--that at some basic point, the United States needs to have a comprehensive set of standards and requirements that would cover some basics like when data is being collected, who's collecting it, whether there's an opt-in or an opt-out, what rights to manage or even remove if once data exists? </p><p>CACKLEY: Yes, I think that's--that is where we are right now is--is that the sectoral approach is--it leaves too many gaps and a comprehensive framework. Maybe not completely changing to--to only a comprehensive framework. You could--you could merge the two in some ways but a comprehensive framework that gives a basic privacy rights and--and abilities for consumers to know what their data is and--and how to correct it, how to control it is--is definitely something that needs to be--to be addressed. </p><p>CRAPO: Thank you. Ms. Dixon. </p><p>DIXON: Let me share with you that I've been seeking an answer to the question you just asked for about 27 years. So here's what I've come up with and it's just--it's my opinion. What if the sectoral system was a feature, not a bug born from thoughtful deliberation about very focused issue areas with a lot of buy-in? What if we have not been able to pass comprehensive legislation because our system requires more buy-in than other systems? </p><p>These are just the hypotheses that I'm working with. So if that is the case and also, I have to tell you, I'm quite concerned about the deep disruption to privacy law that would occur if there was massive preemption. But be that the case, what if there was a way to do a surgical strike and provide guardrails in the areas that need it the most that would fill in the sectoral grant--gaps? That's what I'm very interested in. </p><p>So I think that something that had really important principles, Fair Information practices principles, and then the adaptation of those principles for the gaps that exist. So I do think that standards have been a neglected part of the privacy conversation. I have no idea why we don't have more standards in privacy. This mobile phone has loads of standards that attach to it but for our privacy and for data brokers, where are the standards? Well, let's create some, let's start there. </p><p>I'm all for starting cautiously and working with best practices too but to give things teeth and to abide by the--the larger principle. So a nice amalgamation of all the above, something that's multifactorial. I don't think we have silver bullets available to us anymore. </p><p>CRAPO: Well, thank you and just one other quick question and I'll turn to Senator Brown. We've talked a lot about the problems we're trying to address there, whether harm is caused by the use of data, whether credit is impacted, whether people are redlined or denied access to products or opportunities. It seems to me that when you--when you approach the issue from that perspective which is a very legitimate approach, that there is another issue that is--I don't know if I would call it a harm, maybe it is. But there's simply a privacy issue. </p><p>A lot of Americans I believe don't want to have to prove that they were harmed. They don't want people collecting data on them or they don't want certain data collected. It's sort of the right to be forgotten or the right to opt out of certain segments of data collection. Is that a legitimate right that we should try to protect? </p><p>DIXON: It's a legitimate option that we need to be able to have, the--the adversity score. I think that any child who's applying for college should be able to say, hey wait, I don't want my neighborhood being part of that. Do they have to prove harm? I don't think they should have to. They should be able to say, hey no, this is not something I want, it's legitimate. </p><p>CRAPO: Dr. Cackley. </p><p>CACKLEY: I think that's right that--that it's important for people to be able to make a choice about what data they share and what--and what data they don't. </p><p>CRAPO: Senator Brown. </p><p>BROWN: Thank you. Ms. Dixon, this is your last round of questions, blessedly for both of you and please be really brief on these because I have some trouble questions. Should federal regulators and supervisors have full access to every company's predictive models so they can evaluate them for bias and other legal compliance? </p><p>DIXON: I believe they would have to hire about a million people if they did that. I'm not sure of the answer to that question but I have a lot of thoughts on this and I will send you a written follow up. </p><p>BROWN: That would be good including is there a list of companies whose models you believe should be available to regulators for review maybe-- </p><p>DIXON: Send that to you. </p><p>BROWN: Okay, technology expert our last hearing stated while our online economy depends on collection and permanent storage of highly personal data, we don't have the capacity to keep such large collections of user data safe over time. Do you agree with that statement? </p><p>DIXON: I think it's very difficult to keep user data safe 100 percent of the time. </p><p>BROWN: Should they be require--should companies be required to expunge certain types of user data after say 60 or 90 days? </p><p>DIXON: You know, there--I think there are very good arguments for that and there's a--there's a continuum for that and I will respond to that in writing. </p><p>BROWN: Okay thanks. Do companies who personally use--who currently use personal data for profit see existing penalties as little more than the cost of doing business that's--that's often the case in this town that a few million dollar fine on a multi-million dollar company is the cost of doing business. Did this strong--how strong do penalties and other enforcement mechanisms need to be in order to hold these companies accountable? </p><p>DIXON: I don't know the answer to that question. However, I do think that having very good enforcement is an important stick and I think we needs carrots and sticks to make things right. </p><p>BROWN: To holding executives account personally accountable one way? </p><p>DIXON: I don't know about that. </p><p>BROWN: (INAUDIBLE) or you just don't know? </p><p>DIXON: I literally don't know the answer to that. </p><p>BROWN: Okay, okay. A technology expert in our last hearing state was possible in principle to throw one's laptop into the sea and renounce all technology. It's no longer possible to opt out of a surveillance society. Do you believe that statement? </p><p>DIXON: Absolutely. I don't believe that an opt-out village exists. </p><p>BROWN: So what would a meaningful consent contract between users and tech companies or users and data brokers or meaningful opt-out policy look like? </p><p>DIXON: So it needs to be multifactorial and not just rely on consent because consent is a really difficult vehicle for that. I have a lot of very complete thoughts on that and I will follow up in writing. </p><p>BROWN: Okay, you're gonna be busy in the next few days. </p><p>DIXON: That's right. I have a lot on this so. </p><p>BROWN: And last question, you point out in your testimony household data can serve as a proxy for an individual credit score. Some data that seems innocuous like Instagram posts can actually yield predictive data about a user's mental health. How do we know what data is inherently sensitive and what data is innocuous but become--can become sensitive when it's used to make predictions? </p><p>DIXON: Right. One of the most difficult things that I've had to grapple with as a privacy expert and someone who cares so much about privacy is that it's so difficult to say here, this is sensitive data, here this is sensitive data. It's all becoming sensitive depending on how its analyzed and that's why privacy protections have had to become much more multifactorial and much more subtle and in responding to this new issue. </p><p>BROWN: In--in part, that--that that movement if you will from--that is initially not sensitive but becomes that as--as a result of just the--the power of computer--companies--the--the quantity and quality of computer--of computing power, correct? </p><p>DIXON: We were in a digital era. We're really moving into the predictive era and it changes everything. </p><p>BROWN: Okay, very good thank you, Mr. Chairman. </p><p>CRAPO: Thank you. And that does conclude the question for today's hearing. For senators who wish to submit questions for the record, those questions are due to the committee by Tuesday June 18th and we ask the witnesses to respond to those questions as quickly as you can once you receive them. Again, we thank you both for not only your time here today but the attention and--and analysis that you've given to this issue and we'll give to the issue as we proceed. With that, this hearing is adjourned. </p></bodyText></section></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">POLTRN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WCF-WT61-F15W-H15G-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">147909</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><publicationInfo><publicationName>CQ Transcriptions</publicationName><bodyText><p>All materials herein are protected by United States copyright law and may not be reproduced, distributed, transmitted, displayed, published or broadcast without the prior written permission of CQ Transcriptions.
