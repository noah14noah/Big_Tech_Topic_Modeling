The United States Congress is back in session, and it's up to serious mischief in the arenas of privacy, innovation and corporate accounting. In each case, powerful interests are backing bad legislation.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Here's a rundown, in order of the most immediate threats:</p><p>- In one of the most dishonestly named bills of all time, the House recently passed the Junk Fax Prevention Act of 2004. The legislation would, in fact, open the floodgates for these intrusions into our lives.</p><p>The bill, S2603, would allow anyone who's done any kind of business with you during the past seven years -- seven years! -- to send you faxes without getting your permission first. You would have to opt out each time.</p><p>The FCC's latest regulations, which proposed to tighten the current rules against junk faxes, were too much for corporate America and its marketing wizards, who continue to invade every corner of our lives. Their power with Congress is far greater than yours, so far.</p><p>At least they could tell the truth, naming S2603 the \"Junk Fax Enabling Act.\"</p><p>- There's surprising, but unfortunate, movement in the entertainment industry's most-desired legislation, also known as the \"Induce Act.\" In the name of halting copyright infringement, it would threaten all kinds of technological innovation.</p><p>The tech industry, after snoozing at first, finally did start complaining about S2560. The bill was drawing bipartisan support, mostly from lawmakers who are taking megabucks in campaign contributions from Hollywood and its friends.</p><p>The aim of the bill is mainly to kill off peer-to-peer technology the copyright industry doesn't control. That's bad enough, given that there are entirely legitimate reasons for using such services -- which might well be outlawed in the process. But the legislation could be used to threaten or kill some useful technologies.</p><p>After Internet service providers and some big tech companies objected, the chief sponsor, Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, challenged the opponents to come up with a better bill.</p><p>The opponents did just that, writing a draft that would target big-time commercial piracy while protecting innocent people and useful technology. Of course, they were immediately rebuffed by the copyright lobby. I'm sorry to say the co-sponsors include Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif. She should know better.</p><p>- Even as it moves to pass other ill-considered legislation, the Senate is considering whether to back the House's passage of a bill on stock options. This one also deserves to expire.</p><p>The legislation, S1890, would prevent regulators from requiring companies to account more accurately for the cost of stock options on their balance sheets. Currently, most companies hide the cost in footnotes rather than list them as expenses.</p><p>Listing the cost of options as expenses would not change the actual financial condition of any company. It would, however, reduce reported earnings in many cases.</p><p>For that reason, many in Silicon Valley furiously oppose the change, saying it will introduce new uncertainties in understanding a company's books. As I've noted before, the Valley approach seems to be that investors are smart enough today to figure out what's going on but suddenly will become too stupid to understand if we move to a system that notes the very real cost to shareholders of options grants.</p><p>There will be moves to attach the House bill to legislation in the Senate. Two powerful Republican senators, Richard Shelby of Alabama and Ted Stephens of Alaska, have indicated their opposition to mucking with the work of accounting rule-makers.</p><p>And William Donaldson, chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, also has asked the Senate to butt out of this dispute. They should take his advice.</p><p>Please pick up the phone. Call 1-202-224-3121 and ask for your U.S. senators. Their direct lines can be found on the Senate's Web site (<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.senate.gov\">http://www.senate.gov</url>).</p><p>Add your voice on the issues. You can make a difference.</p><p>-- Dan Gillmor writes for the San Jose Mercury News.

As was the case with the original \"Digital Dirty Dozen\" report, the trend toward interventionist policies threatens to lead to legal and regulatory uncertainty for entrepreneurs and potential public harm. That has resulted in new legislation and regulation covering the Internet sector.</p><p>To date, a hands-off regulatory approach has helped fuel an explosion in broadband access innovation, and, barring interference from regulators, will allow a 5G Internet to make a large positive impact on the world. But, unfortunately, there are now dozens of proposed technology-related bills in Congress that threaten to expand the government's reach. Not as paradoxically as it might seem, many big tech companiesseeing their market position as secure and desiring predictabilityoften support regulation.</p><p>This paper highlights numerous categories of interventionist policies, focuses on some of the most destructive legislative offerings within each category, and settles on the ones we consider to be the worst.</p><p>These bills address broadband deployment and access, antitrust and competition policy, bias and content controls, child protection, cybersecurity, and more.</p><p>Some are retreads, like those on online marketing and privacy. There are measures to increase antitrust intervention and to regulate \"biased,\" \"harmful,\" and other forms of speech.</p><p>The 115th Congress narrowly modified Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act with respect to human trafficking. Now both parties contemplate something more like a purge of Section 230. Section 230 allows social media networks to moderate their content without being held to the liability standards of a traditional publisher or a speaker. It protects platforms from lawsuits about third-party posts by recognizing that these hosts do not supply content like a newspaper or the content's creator does. This enables the mostly permissionless, user-driven Internet experience we enjoy online today. Without this safeguard, platforms would have to vet the enormous amount of user-driven content before displaying it because of the increased liability they would assume. This would be prohibitively time-consuming and expensive. Alternatively, and ironically for conservative critics of Section 230, platforms could take a completely hands-off approach to curating content, but the results would likely be too violent, pornographic, or offensive to attract many eyeballs.</p><p>There are also attempts to set standards for privacy and online advertising and to address online \"addiction\" and hold companies accountable for it. Some seek to bring the gig economy into the regulatory maze of labor law. Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve and the Securities Exchange Commission may seek to assert their authority over the payments processing sector just as cryptocurrencies are beginning to emerge.</p><p>The pressure to regulate has intensified thanks to the emergence of two other powerful regulatory centers that are vying with America to set the gold standard for global technological regulation. While the U.S. has traditionally aimed at empowering technology users, it faces competition from two different models. The European Union aims to protect technology users in paternalistic fashion. China wants to control how people use technology. For a global industry, regulations imposed by jurisdictions that encompass a large percentage of global population and GDP will affect American companies and consumers.</p><p>We argue instead for innovation and the separation of technology and state. Policy makers, including Republicans, must pay special attention to how these various proposals would expand invasive administrative bodies like the Federal Trade Commission, the Federal Communications Commission, the Securities and Exchange Commission, and other agencies.</p><p>Old-school telecommunications, transportation, and infrastructure have long been highly regulated, with government-supported monopoly in some instances. The Internet still offers an opportunity to show that spontaneous order can work to serve consumers and society better than lawmakers.</p><p>Market solutions, unlike legislation, better lend themselves to address the myriad problems that inevitably arise in a free, competitive economy. The Internet was not initially designed as the mass commercial and consumer medium it is today.</p><p>There is a role for law. Fraud, falsification, identity theft, hacking, and the like should be punished, but overly burdensome legislation will create legal and regulatory obstacles for small businessesa reason some large firms favor interventionand the development of newer technologies and services, which is one of the great hidden costs of regulation.</p><p>Bad legislation lays the groundwork for worse legislation later. Embracing regulation and central planning entail embracing collective \"solutions\" that will be difficult to correct later. The legislation we actually need would be a bill to prevent many of these misguided proposals.</p><p>Introduction</p><p>If you are looking for bipartisanship in Washington, D.C., the technology policy sector may be your best bet but not in a good way.

That has resulted in new legislation and regulation covering the Internet sector.</p><p>In the recent past, court decisions also have played a role. For example, in 2018 the Supreme Court, reversing precedent, greatly expanded the power of state governments to tax beyond their borders when it gave the go-ahead to the remote taxation of goods purchased online. Of course, there also have been more encouraging court decisions. For example, the D.C.

This would be prohibitively time-consuming and expensive. Alternatively, and ironically for conservative critics of Section 230, platforms could take a completely hands-off approach to curating content, but the results would likely be too violent, pornographic, or offensive to attract many eyeballs.</p><p>There are also attempts to set standards for privacy and online advertising and to address online \"addiction\" and hold companies accountable for it. Some seek to bring the gig economy into the regulatory maze of labor law. Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve and the Securities Exchange Commission may seek to assert their authority over the payments processing sector just as cryptocurrencies are beginning to emerge.</p><p>Fortunately, it is still hard to pass laws. But overseas courts and legislators are hard at work at dismantling the open social media ecosystem.13 The pressure to regulate has intensified thanks to the emergence of two other powerful regulatory centers that are vying with America to set the gold standard for global technological regulation. While the</p><p>U.S. has traditionally aimed at empowering technology users, it faces competition from two different models. The European Union aims to protect technology users in paternalistic fashion. China wants to control how people use technology. A survey of the various regulatory initiatives undertaken by these administrative rivals is beyond the scope of this paper, but for a global industry, regulations imposed by jurisdictions that encompass a large percentage of global population and GDP will affect American companies and consumers.14</p><p>We argue instead for innovation and the separation of technology and state. The longest journey does not merely begin with a single step; it requires not stepping backward. In the present instance, that means not enacting misguided laws and regulations.</p><p>Policy makers, including Republicans, must pay special attention to how these various proposals would expand invasive administrative bodies like the Federal</p><p>Trade Commission (FTC), the Federal Communications Commission, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and other agencies.</p><p>BOX 1. Major Pieces of Internet Legislation Passed Since the Heyday of AOL and Netscape.</p><p>Deregulatory</p><p>The Telecommunications Act, the first significant update to telecommunications law since the 1934 Communications Act,16 created the \"information services\" classification, separate from telephone and cable services and not subject to regulations governing either.17</p><p>Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act largely protects websites from liability over content created by third-party users, creating a safe</p><p>harbor for websites that choose to moderate content. Prior to Section 230, any attempts to moderate content meant platforms could be held liable for all user-generated content.</p><p>Title II of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act provides a safe harbor for Internet service providers, including websites, against liability for digital copyright infringements by third-party users.

Among other provisions, CAN-SPAM prohibits deceptive</p><p>email subject lines, requires identifying information for the sender, and mandates an opt-out feature for recipients. It preempts state laws relating to commercial email, aside from those covering fraudulent or deceptive content.20</p><p>The Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act scales back Section 230 immunity in several areas related to online content regarding prostitution and sex trafficking.21</p><p>Old-school telecommunications, transportation, and infrastructure have long been highly regulated, with government-supported monopoly in some instances. The Internet still offers an opportunity to show that spontaneous order can work to serve consumers and society better than lawmakers. Which will prevail, innovation or the central directives of the regulatory state?15</p><p>The Bleak Litany of Restrictive Proposals</p><p>In this report, we identify specific legislative or regulatory proposals that raise alarm bells. We also identify broad categories of control of which these proposals are examples. The report also stresses how a large administrative state grows at the expense of First Amendment rights, property rights, and free enterprise.</p><p>An \"Internet Bill of Rights\": Proposals that Conflate Public and Private Spheres and Ignore the Dichotomy between Positive and Negative Rights</p><p>The concept of \"Internet Exceptional- ism\" is a common theme across these proposals. It postulates that the Internet is a unique kind of technology that requires new conceptions of law and economics.22 For example, Professor Tim Wu of Columbia University, famous for popularizing the concept of \"net neutrality,\" recently said that tech companies \"had reinvented economics, reinvented business as we knew it.\"23 This prism of novelty allows for a circumventing of norms surrounding the concept of rights in the United States. Instead of rights guaranteed to all private actors by restrictions on government through a negative rights framework, tech utopians advocate for positive rights guaranteed by government, provided at the expense of private companies and their consumers.</p><p>Under this vision, Internet users have entitlements, while those who help make the easy-to-use commercial Internet possible in the first place have obligations that supersede their own rights. As part of the lay of the land of the tech policy debate, we see longstanding calls for a \"Magna Carta\" or \"new contract\" for the Web from pioneer Sir Tim Berners-Lee.24 Worried about \"fake news\" and data protection,25 he has called for breaking up the tech giants.26 Such sentiments are shared by U.S. legislators like Rep. Ro Khanna (D-CA), who have devised versions of a highly regulatory Internet Bill of Rights, using terminology conflating public and private spheres.27 Conservatives have proposed their own versions of this folly, largely in the area of content regulation.</p><p>Yet, if lawmakers were to undermine the negative-rights framework in regards to the Internet, we will lose the kind of rapid progress that has made the Internet seem \"exceptional.\" Imposing positive rights obligations upon Internet service providers and platforms would result in a significant drop-off in investment and innovation in the sector. It is not hard to understand why.</p><p>Positive rights require that resources are allocated in specific ways. If resources must be allocated in certain ways, then companies and their investors no longer enjoy complete property rights, which are integral to investment. Positive rights also create a drain on available resources. Like burning a candle at both ends, positive rights obligations on firms limit the resources available for risk-taking, the key to innovation.</p><p>The impetus behind an Internet bill of rights is at least nominally pro-consumer. Yet, as economist Milton Friedman said, \"One of the great mistakes is to judge policies and programs by their intentions rather than their results.\"28 While some users may find value in the various prescriptive guarantees, if the majority of consumers truly valued the protections or guarantees of an Internet bill of rights, the market would already be providing these features.</p><p>Yet, as the data show, users actually place little value in such features.</p><p>Rep. Khanna's Internet Bill of Rights primarily seeks to protect data privacy, with six out of 10 provisions related to data collection. When asked, Americans certainly want companies to do a better job in protecting data privacy.</p><p>However, economics teaches us that human wants are limitless and what truly matters is how people value something relative to the alternatives. According a recent survey of over 3,000 American Internet users, only 26 percent said they would be willing to pay a monthly subscription fee for greater privacy protection.29 Many services already provide this privacy for a small fee, and in some cases for free.30 Apple recently made the privacy features of its iPhone line a major facet of its advertising campaigns.</p><p>Privacy-centric search engine DuckDuckGo has grown from approx- imately 16 million queries in 2010 to more than 15 billion in 2019.31</p><p>Consumers should be free to select the products and services that best meet their privacy needs and provide the best results. Imposing positive rights obligations on the Internet sector would reduce investment and innovation.</p><p>Consumers would ultimately have fewer choices in exchange for \"rights\" that the vast majority of consumers may not value all that much. The $50 smartphone makes the technology available to all, at the cost of privacy. When regulation produces fewer options in the market and a lack of investment in new competition, consumers are worse off at the margin, as they lack realistic alternatives to punish companies by taking their business elsewhere.</p><p>This is why the U.S. Bill of Rights places restrictions on government and not on private actors. The market is highly responsive to what consumers value, with consumers voting countless times every second with their attention, feet, and wallets; firms grow when they provide what people value. Government, on the other hand, faces no competition, is only rarely held to account, and tends to grow unimpeded.</p><p>Censorship of Social Media Content and Bias</p><p>The safe harbor provided by Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act is a major reason why America leads the world in online technology investment and innovation.32 Section 230 protects tech platforms from liability over content posted by third- party users. For example, if a person posts a libelous Facebook status about you, only the person who posted it, not Facebook, is legally responsible for the content.</p><p>While critics of Section 230 exist on both sides of the aisle for various reasons, the law is largely responsible for the Internet as we know it today. Without it, platformsfrom online marketplaces, to social media to review siteswould either be unmoderated cesspools or simply would not exist as largely free and open to users. Prior to Section 230, any attempts to moderate content meant platforms could be held liable for all user-generated content. Section 230 addresses the impracticality and excessive risk of assuming liability for all the countless pieces of content uploaded by users by granting tech companies the ability to moderate content as they see fit.</p><p>Where The World's Largest Tech Companies Are</p><p>im1.jpg</p><p>Image via Jonathan Ponciano, \"The Largest Technology Companies In 2019: Apple Reigns as Smartphones Slip and Cloud Services Thrive, Forbes, May 15, 2019,</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonathanponciano/2019/05/15/worlds-largest-tech-companies-2019/#21e4b2bc734f\">https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonathanponciano/2019/05/15/worlds-largest-tech-companies-2019/#21e4b2bc734f</url>.</p><p>The 10 Largest Tech Companies in the World</p><p>im2.jpg</p><p>Image via Jonathan Ponciano, \"The Largest Technology Companies In 2019: Apple Reigns as Smartphones Slip and Cloud Services Thrive, Forbes, May 15, 2019, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonathanponciano/2019/05/15/worlds-largest-tech-companies-2019/#21e4b2bc734f\">https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonathanponciano/2019/05/15/worlds-largest-tech-companies-2019/#21e4b2bc734f</url>.</p><p>Meanwhile, conservatives accuse tech giants of using content moderation under Section 230 to promote online bias and censor right-leaning voices, and in response they seek compulsory redress. Yet, the Internet is actually one of the few realms, like talk radio, not dominated by left-leaning views, and the drive to change that is at the root of some liberals' calls to regulate it.33 Still, right and left agree on one thing: The federal government should lord over speech, with the First Amendment's free speech guarantees thrown by the wayside. Instead of a free online marketplace of ideas, we would get one regulated by agencies like the Federal Trade Commission.</p><p>One side would partner with government to ban \"harmful speech,\" while the other would compel and then certify political neutrality. Some companies cater to this mindset, glossing over the distinction between government and private parties.34 Collectively, all ignore the fact that, as noted, First Amendment speech and association rights are negative rights that constrain the government, not private parties, from restricting or compelling your speech.</p><p>The Ending Support for Internet Censorship Act, sponsored by Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) would require \"tech companies to moderate content without political bias as a condition of civil immunity.\"35 This policy would deny property rights, compel speech and add considerably to an already large administrative state bureaucracy. In order to retain immunity from liability for user-generated content under Section 230, a \"covered company\" would have to obtain an \"immunity certification\" every two years from the FTC by assuring a majority of the (unelected) commissioners that it does not moderate content provided by others in a politically biased way.36</p><p>It also mandates arbitrary thresholds regarding which parties it would regulate. A \"covered company\" needing objectivity certification would be one with more than 30 million active U.S. monthly users, 300 million worldwide users, or $500 million or more in annual global revenue. Along with the false premise of private censorship in the bill's title, one cannot prove the negative of non-bias, so the bill is inoperable and susceptible to partisan disputes over the meaning of objectivity. That is a battle that conservative proponents will ultimately lose, since what will be regarded as politically objective by a future FTC will not necessarily match Hawley's and many other conservatives' vision.37</p><p>The Limiting Section 230 Immunity to Good Samaritans Act was also introduced by Sen. Hawley.38 To understand this legislation, it is necessary to get an understanding of Section 230 of the 1996 Communi- cations Decency Act. Part of what makes Section 230 special is not what it does but rather what it does not do. The relatively short law provides \"Protection for 'Good Samaritan' Blocking and Screening of Offensive Material.\"39 The law's title states as its purpose: \"To amend the Communications Act of 1934 to provide accountability for bad actors who abuse the Good Samaritan protections provided under that Act, and for other purposes.\" The text does not define the term \"Good Samaritan,\" which suggests that the law's authors acknowledge a simple truth: The definition of a Good Samaritan is subjective, as are the definitions of what would constitute \"bad actors\" or \"abuse\" in regard to Section 230.</p><p>In other words, the Limiting Section 230 immunity to Good Samaritans Act seeks to accomplish the impossible and define what constitutes being a Good Samaritan, or at least a Web service acting in \"good faith.\" For Web services that are seen to be acting in bad faith by selectively enforcing their terms of service on content moderation, the bill allows for civil liability of up to $5,000. Like the Ending Support for Internet Censorship Act, the bill also sets arbitrary thresholds over which entities it covers. Specifically, it outlines that it only applies to services with over 30 million U.S. users, 300 million global users, or $1.5 billion in global revenue. 40</p><p>There are several problems with this approach. First, just as the definition of a Good Samaritan is subjective, many decisions on content moderation come down to subjective judgements. The spirit of the bill thus essentially disincentivizes moderation at the margins for fear of exposure to liability. This would mean more offensive and objectionable content online where there was none before.</p><p>Second, the bill has a huge loophole that renders it essentially futile. It would allow for Web services to include a right to selectively enforce said terms in their terms of service. As Gizmodo's Dell Cameron notes, \"the changes to Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act proposed by Hawley do not appear to place any new restrictions on how companies define their own moderation policiesonly that they stick to, and evenly apply, whatever rules they ultimately decide upon.\"41</p><p>Third, by stipulating that the bill only applies to the largest Web services, it provides an incentive for these services to become even larger and more dominant over online discourse.</p><p>Upstart competitors approaching any of the bill's three metrics would be incentivized to sell to larger competitors that already exceed those thresholdsand have the compliance personnel to deal with that.</p><p>The Stop the Censorship Act, introduced by Rep. Paul Gosar (R-AZ), would limit moderation of \"objectionable\" content by only granting immunity when companies act in \"good faith\" to remove \"unlawful content.\"42 Under such a regime, companies would be forced to host endless amounts of content against their willregardless of whether or not they would be deemed in compliance with the impossible non-bias standard in Hawley's bill. This would amount to a violation of the speech and association rights of the covered firms.</p><p>Rep. Gosar has frequently made the claim, common among critics of Section 230, that tech companies are unlawfully acting as both a \"publisher\" and a \"platform.\" In a tweet from September 18, 2019, he wrote: \"Facebook makes a judicial admission it is a publisher not a platform. As a publisher it can assert editorial control. But it can also be sued for defamation and tortious interference. Sec. 230 of the CDA protects platforms. Not publishers.\"43 No part of the actual law makes this distinction.</p><p>Professor Jeff Kosseff, a cybersecurity law professor at the U.S. Naval Academy and perhaps the nation's leading expert on Section 230, said on the platform-publisher distinction:</p><p>I'm not quite sure what their parameters are for publisher or platform. Are they saying you don't do any moderation at all? A free for all? I seriously would not want to be on the internet at all if that was the case. ... I don't know where these people are drawing the line between platforms and publishers. All I can say is that Congress, at least at the time, did not intend that distinction.44</p><p>Yet an Internet Kosseff seriously would not want to be on would be the default setting for tech platforms and other websites under the Stop the Censorship Act, as consumers would be forced to choose to opt in to see or receive moderated content. Should a social media page filled with hateful, violent, and sexually explicit content really be the default setting?</p><p>The Biased Algorithm Deterrence Act would effectively abolish Section 230 immunities by commanding that:</p><p>[A]n owner or operator of a social media service that displays user-generated content in an order other than chronological order, delays the display of such content relative to other content, or otherwise hinders the display of such content relative to other content ... shall be treated as a publisher or speaker of such content.45</p><p>This bill literally puts others' words in the platforms' mouths, by declaring the platform to be the speaker. It also mandates a chronological presentation of content. Algorithms that learn what you are interested in are actually useful to readers. Anyone who has tried installing a social media plug-in that forces the display of content in chronological order will know what happens when a friend has uploaded an album of holiday photosendless scrolling to get to the next interesting item.</p><p>These proposals' violations of private companies' speech and association rights alone, not to mention the impossibility of policing objectivity when government agents have plenty of their own biases, render these proposals problematic, to put it lightly. Forcing companies to host content against their will goes beyond simple control over their platforms. There are significant implications for the tangible property of these firms under each of these supposed anti-censorship proposals. While cyberspace may seem unlimited, it is not. Tremendous resources are dedicated to hosting all the data uploaded to the Internet. In 2019, an estimated $210 billion was spent worldwide on data centers.46 Forcing companies to host any and all lawful content would dramatically increase the physical infrastructure needs of tech platforms, a de facto tax of potentially hundreds of billions of dollars.</p><p>Ironically, the tremendous resource costs related to hosting content, under these anti-censorship proposals, could lead to forced limiting of online speech due entirely to resource constraints. In this way, all sorts of spam, violent, sexual, and other objectionable content that is otherwise discarded could impose a sort of heckler's veto over the political content Hawley, Gosar, and their allies are trying to protect.</p><p>Congress should not stand in judgment of others' acceptable or unacceptable bias or speech. Regardless of all the various legal and practical problems with implementing such policies, progressives have already teed up an abundance of subjective, ill-defined, and open-ended categories of speech to be regulated, including misinformation, disinformation, harmful content, and hate speech.</p><p>One likely effect of content restraint would be a clampdown on anonymous speech and criticism of unorthodox views. In fact, in a self-regulatory move, Facebook has decided to allow more political content on the platform in exchange for stricter rules to ensure the true identity of the speaker can be identified.47 Moreover, if content rules are good for social media, why they are not also good for government websites, mainstream media, and publicly funded university curricula?</p><p>These proposals violate the spirit of the First Amendment by restricting private citizens' speech and leaving the government not only unshackled, but more powerful.</p><p>Trial Ballooning a Sweeping Federal Takeover of the Internet</p><p>In July 2018, the Columbia Journalism Review (CJR) reported on a leaked draft white paper from Sen. Mark Warner (D-VA) that contained a wide-ranging slate of proposals to treat tech companies as essential facilities and to regulate content and speech.48</p><p>The white paper, titled \"Potential Policy Proposals for Regulation of Social Media and Technology Firms,\" cited anonymity using trolls, misinformation, and election interference as justification. Warner expressed alarm that \"bots, trolls, click-farms, fake pages and groups, ads, and algorithm-gaming can be used to propagate political disinformation.\"49 Proposed solutions, which Warner refers to as \"guard rails,\" include:</p><p>Labeling of automated \"bot\" accounts;</p><p>Requiring location verification;</p><p>Limiting certain elements of anonymity;</p><p>Limiting Section 230 immunity for re-uploaded content;</p><p>Imposing liability for defamation, false light, and deep fakes;</p><p>Audits of tech company algorithms, and</p><p>Defining certain services to be essential facilities.50</p><p>Reason correspondent Elizabeth Nolan Brown called it \"plans for a government takeover of the Internet.\"51</p><p>The loss of the civil right of anonymous online speech is an unexplored vulnerability in the various social media regulatory campaigns, with Warner leading the charge.52 The CJR's Matthew Ingram notes:</p><p>When it comes to misinformation, the Warner paper says one possible proposal is that platforms be required to label automated bot accounts, and also do more to identify who is behind anonymous or pseudonymous accounts. If there's a failure to do these things, it says, the Federal Trade Commission could step in with sanctions.53</p><p>If companies like Facebook grew thanks to the protections of Section 230, newly formed social media companies have the right to do the same, and politicians the duty not to interfere. Future networks that do not yet exist deserve the same clear path.</p><p>The Internet has given individuals power over their speech, providing a platform for both popular and unpopular ideas. It is a good thing that the Internet allows the questioning of orthodoxies and the bypassing of gatekeepers. Yet, attempts are now under way to reestablish gatekeepers. For all the talk of regulating algorithms, such efforts seek to certify government \"algorithms\" while demonizing those of the private sphere.</p><p>Helicopter Government: Saving Children from Parents' Failure in the Duty to Supervise Online Activities</p><p>Sen. Josh Hawley teamed with two Democrats, Sens. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut and Ed Markey of Massachusetts, to sponsor the Protecting Children from Abusive Games Act (S. 1629).54 Targeting what he calls the \"addiction economy,\" Hawley alleges, \"When a game is designed for kids, game developers shouldn't be allowed to monetize addiction.55 And when kids play games designed for adults, they should be walled off from compulsive microtransactions. Game developers who knowingly exploit children should face legal consequences.\"56 Games would be banned from having loot boxes, defined as \"microtransactions offering randomized or partially randomized rewards to players.\" (If you ever bought a Cracker Jack box hoping for a good prize, you might be familiar with the concept.) The bill also targets \"pay-to-win\" mechanics that \"manipulate a game's progression system ... to induce players to spend money.\"57</p><p>The Entertainment Software Association argues that loot boxes do not constitute gambling, and describes tools the sector provides \"that keeps the control of in-game spending in parents' hands. Parents already have the ability to limit or prohibit in-game purchases with easy to use parental controls.\" In Hawley's perspective, parents are not competent to supervise the purchase of digital weapons for junior's Fortnite game and need the help of the nanny state.</p><p>The Protecting Children from Online Predators Act (S. 1916), also sponsored by Hawley, would prevent companies like YouTube from recommending videos featuring minors.59 As Reason's Elizabeth Nolan Brown describes it:</p><p>Teen video makers couldn't rely on algorithms to recommend any of their content. Sites like Facebook would be prohibited from recommending family videos featuring children to grandma and grandpa.60</p><p>Relatedly, a Federal Trade Commis- sion rulemaking on the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) is underway.61 The bill was passed 20 years ago to prevent online data collection from children under 13 years of age. The FTC oversees enforcement and issues fines to websites that are not in compliance with the regulations. As CEI noted in comments submitted to the FTC, COPPA \"exceeds its mandate and ultimately harms children by creating disincentives towards the production and distribution of content directed towards children while not providing any additional privacy protections.\"62 As noted, outcomes are far more valuable than intent in measuring public policy. Meanwhile, Google has reached a settlement with the FTC and promises to improve the protection of children's data on YouTube.63 Yet, there is still no substitute for parents' supervision, not just in tech concerns, but everywhere.</p><p>Helicopter Government, Continued: Saving Dumb Adults from Online Addiction, Manipulation, and Nuisance</p><p>The Social Media Addiction Reduction Technology (SMART) Act (S. 2314), also sponsored by Hawley, is filled with extremely specific paternalistic rules aimed at stemming online addiction, including banning autoplay videos and infinite scrolling, and limiting social media use to 30 minutes a day.64 The latter clock would be reset every month even if one chooses to change it. But why stop there when there are TVs and newspaper subscriptions to ban?65 The SMART Act would also require a make-work report:66</p><p>Not less frequently than once every 3 years, the [Federal Trade] Commission shall submit to Congress a report on the issue of internet addiction and the processes through which social media companies and other internet companies, by exploiting human psychology and brain physiology, interfere with free choices of individuals on the internet (including with respect to the amount of time individuals spend online).</p><p>Every generation has faced new threats to the moral order. It was comic books' effect on youth in the 1960s, Guns 'n Roses in the 1980s, and now it is online addiction. It seems technology is no barrier for puritans seeking to ruin someone else's fun. The SMART Act managed to attract no cosponsors.</p><p>The Deceptive Experiences to Online Users Reduction (DETOUR) Act (S. 1084), sponsored by Sen. Mark Warner (D-VA) and Sen. Deb Fischer (R-NE), seeks \"to prohibit the usage of exploitative and deceptive practices by large online operators and to promote consumer welfare in the use of behavioral research by such providers.\" Specifically, it would grant new powers to the Federal Trade Commission to police \"unfair\" and \"deceptive\" acts by sites with more than 100 million active monthly users:</p><p>... to design, modify, or manipulate a user interface with the purpose or substantial effect of obscuring, subverting, or impairing user autonomy, decision-making, or choice to obtain consent or user data; [or] to subdivide or segment consumers of online services into groups for the purposes of behavioral or psychological experiments or studies, except with the informed consent of each user.</p><p>This refers to prompting users to take actions they presumably otherwise would not. Examples include yes or no buttons of different sizes, suggestions that others are about to buy an item in hopes of closing a sale, making alternative settings difficult to access, and luring kids to ask their parents for in-app purchases.67 The problem, allegedly, is the possibility of websites goading people into giving up more information than intended, through \"prompts to access phone and email contacts in order to keep using the platform.\"68 Warner points to fake smudges tricking users to click on an ad.69 Sen. Hawley is on board, too, since dark patterns \"feed tech addiction.\"70 Apparently, the Internet is a giant haunted house manipulating everyone to give up personal data and information via \"dark patterns.\"</p><p>The DETOUR Act retains government's protected-class status. Not only does it expand the power of the FTC, it hypocritically fails to restrain politicians' purchase of online political ads and grassroots rallying for election.71</p><p>Lawmakers Threaten the Right to Anonymous Speech</p><p>The tech regulatory proposals described above threaten the right of anonymous speech, which is elemental to our right to speak and petition for redress of grievances, since sometimes speaking can make one a target for retaliation. Indeed, anonymous political speech was integral to America's founding, with the publishing of the Federalist Papers initially under the pseudonym \"Publius.\" This stands in contrast to current policy makers' professed concerns over our data privacy in commercial contexts.</p><p>The Honest Ads Act proposal (S. 1356) from Sens. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) and Mark Warner (D-VA) aims \"to enhance the integrity of American democracy and national security by improving disclosure requirements for online political advertisements.\"72 The bill would expand the power of the Federal Election Commission and require tech companies to disclose how they target online political ads and the cost of those ads. Both Facebook and Twitter have endorsed it.73</p><p>Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg proclaimed that election \"interference is a problem that's bigger than any one platform, and that's why we support the Honest Ads Act. This will help raise the bar for all political advertising online.\"74 Echoing that, Facebook Ads Vice President Rob Goldman wrote:</p><p>[W]hen it comes to advertising on Facebook, people should be able to tell who the advertiser is and see the ads they're running, especially for political ads. ... That level of transparency is good for democracy and it's good for the electoral process.75</p><p>Russia did not buy that many ads, in the grand scheme of things. Yet, the bill includes an exemption for \"a communication appearing in a news story, commentary, or editorial distributed through the facilities of any broadcasting station or any online or digital newspaper, magazine, blog, publication, or periodical,\" unless a political body controls itall this because Russia bought $100,000 worth of ads.76 If people are that malleable, they may not be suited for voting in the first place.</p><p>The bill is not limited to candidates, but encompasses issue advocacy as well. Section 8 (4) (III) requires individuals purchasing political advertisements on social media to disclose their name, address, and phone number (and those of associates) and requires online platforms to keep a record of anyone spending $500 on political ads. In that sense, the bill contradicts its original intent. It was intended to keep tabs on potential Russian-style interference in elections, but Section 8(1)(A) could expose private information to public inspection in a machine-readable format, which in turn could make individuals vulnerable to online harassment.77</p><p>Related in spirit is Sen. Diane Feinstein's (D-CA) Bot Disclosure and Accountability Act (S.2125).78 It prohibits candidates, campaigns, and political organizations from using \"social media bots in political advertising, which is intended to deceive voters and suppress human speech.\" The legislation would empower the Federal Trade Commission to enforce social media transparency requirements regulating \"the use of automated software programs intended to impersonate or replicate human activity on social media.\"79</p><p>\"Fake news\" does not undermine democracy until governments assume the authority to label information as such and to squelch speech. Anonymous speech is a cornerstone of our republic: After all, Thomas Paine signed Common Sense \"An Englishman\" and the Federalist Papers authors used pseudonyms as did John Trenchard and Thomas Gordon when they penned Cato's Letters.80</p><p>Compulsory Disclosure of Internal Business Processes and Monetization of Data</p><p>The Designing Accounting Safeguards to Help Broaden Oversight and Regulations on Data (DASHBOARD) Act (S.1951) would require social media platforms to disclose how much their user data is worth, presumably to determine for how much big tech is selling, or would sell, their data. Specifically, it would require any \"commercial data operator\" with more than 100 million unique monthly users to, at least every 90 days, \"provide each user of the commercial data operator with an assessment of the economic value that the commercial data operator places on the data of that user\" and describe the types of data collected and any tangential uses of it. The bill would also impose limits on data retention and the ability to delete it.81 The Federal Trade Commission would enforce all these requirements. The Securities and Exchange Commission would oversee annual or quarterly filings (parallel to financial filings) related to the value of aggregate data, and develop accounting schemes to attempt an impossible calculation of the \"value\" of the data that tech firms gather or collect from users.</p><p>Internet Privacy</p><p>Top-down privacy proposals would generally force online operations to reveal their collection policies, secure that information, and allow users to control its use. Advocates want the federal government to supersede states in order to avoid a patchwork of rules. Aside from the federalism counterarguments, former Federal Trade Commission Chairman Tim Muris long ago noted that privacy abuses are lessened by the fact that national companies like Visa require sites with which it does business to adopt privacy policies.82</p><p>Large players have often supported legislation, while small businesses are hurt more by onerous regulation than large operations with plenty of legal assistance. Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg invited a data privacy law and further regulation in 2018 Senate testimony:</p><p>I actually am not sure we shouldn't be regulated. I think in general technology is an increasingly important trend in the world and I actually think the question is more, what is the right regulation rather than \"Yes or no, should it be regulated?\"83</p><p>Zuckerberg, whose company argues that sharing on social media forfeits any expectation of privacy,84 later stated:</p><p>I also believe a common global frameworkrather than regulation that varies significantly by country and statewill ensure that the internet does not get fractured, entrepreneurs can build products that serve everyone, and everyone gets the same protections.85</p><p>The Do Not Track Act (S. 1578), also introduced by Hawley, calls for the government to establish a national \"Do Not Track\" system \"to provide consumers a legally enforceable right to browse the internet privately, without data tracking.\"86 This system will allow users to attach a \"signal\" to their devices that all websites and online applications must be able to recognize and therefore not target ads at them. Without providing any detail on how this system will work on a technical level, the bill demands that it be up and running in just six months. In addition, the legislation would require websites and applications to inform users about the Do Not Track system if they are not already enrolled, requiring a notification from each website and application the first time a signal is not detected and each subsequent 30th time.</p><p>The Do Not Track Act illustrates the fundamental problem with privacy legislation. Acceptable privacy means something different to everyone.</p><p>Government's role is not to dictate the terms of privacy contracts, but to enforce companies' promises.</p><p>Governments need not mandate privacy, but allow it.87 A world where people have control of their information cannot be reconciled with government being in control of what information can be created and communicated.</p><p>The American Data Dissemination (ADD) Act, sponsored by Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL), would apply the Privacy Act of 1974, which covers government agencies, to private Internet service providers.88 Like most privacy legislation, it would impose onerous requirements on virtually all businesses, yet do nothing to actually protect privacy. As Will Rinehart, then with the American Action Forum (now with the Center for Growth and Opportunity at Utah State University), described it:</p><p>In total, every business in the United States would be subject to an onerous privacy regime. And because the ADD Act is based on the Privacy Act of 1974, it too will commit the same errors by focusing on data collection and disclosure. But collecting and disclosing data isn't especially problematic. What is worrying is how a company might use information in a way that could be harmful to consumers.89</p><p>The Social Media Privacy Protection and Consumer Rights Act of 2019 (S. 189), sponsored by Sen. Amy Klobuchar, would mandate that behavioral data collected on social media after registration be flagged to users as being used and shared.90 The marvelous thing about the Internet is that one can contact and learn about anyone and anything. The downside is that the reverse is often true. Of course, websites have long collected and marketed information about visitors. Behavioral marketing firms \"watch\" user clickstreams to develop profiles or inform categories to better target future advertisements. While inarguably beneficial, the process stokes understandable privacy concerns. Privacy policies need to be filtered through the lens of the entire society's needs. We must consider the impact on 1) consumers; 2) e-commerce and commerce generally; 3) broader security, cybersecurity, homeland security and critical infrastructure issues; and finally 3) citizens' Fourth Amendment protections.91</p><p>The Own Your Own Data Act, sponsored by Sen. John Kennedy (R-LA), would force social media companies to disclose to individuals how they were using their data and create a property right in data \"that an individual generates.\"92 The inherent properties of data make creating an individual property right legislatively in the area difficult, costly, and detrimental to innovation.93 Privacy is a relationship, not a thing.94 There is an infinite range between anonymity and full authentication. It is incoherent to say there is an automatic property right in privacy, that no one can say anything or use any information about somebody else, any more than we can be forbidden to gossip. But it is conceivable that in various contexts such as the medical, insurance, and financial fieldscontracts are created regarding certain information and its disclosure that can be considered a property right of sorts (as intellectual property may be), but not a blanket property right in \"personal info.\"</p><p>The Information Transparency and Personal Data Control Act, from Rep. Suzan DelBene (D-WA) and with 24 cosponsors, directs \"the Federal Trade Commission to promulgate regulations on sensitive information.\"95 What counts as sensitive? The government will decide, with said standards not applied to itself, of course. The legislation would give users the option to opt in to the collection, stor- age, and sharing of their data. It also would require companies to inform consumers if and with whom their sensitive information will be shared. However, the bill stops short of em- powering consumers to sue companies or letting states experiment with their own approaches to data privacy.\"96</p><p>The Balancing the Rights of Web Surfers Equally and Responsibly (BROWSER) Act, sponsored by Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), a vocal advocate for federal privacy legislation, would require both Internet service providers (ISP) and edge providers to obtain opt-in consent from consumers in order to use their data.97 The bill also preempts state privacy laws and would at least avoid the interstate commerce clause violation of a patchwork of 50 state privacy regimeswhich would be a costly and complicated compliance nightmare for ISPs and edge providers.</p><p>Privacy Mandates on the Frontier: Home Devices and Public Surveillance via Facial Recognition and Biometrics</p><p>Privacy concerns have moved from marketing and online tracking into larger realms like real-time surveillance in cities.98 Since these realms involve public property and infrastructure, the dangers are real and bring the issue of government information collection to the forefront.99 This offers a chance to make the proper value assertions, but seemingly Washington will have no part of that. One in four Americans now owns a voice-activated smart speaker of one kind or another.100 And there is always the ultimate opt-out of not buying or using these features.</p><p>The Commercial Facial Recognition Privacy Act, sponsored by Sens. Roy Blunt (R-MO) and Brian Schatz (D-HI), purports to \"strengthen consumer protections by prohibiting commercial users of facial recognition technology (FR) from collecting and re-sharing data for identifying or tracking consumers without their consent.\"101 While government may use technology to identify a match to a wanted individual in a database for whom they had already undertaken Fourth Amendment safeguards to identify, incidental recognition data on other individuals \"passing by\" must not be retained by authorities. On the private sector side, people may be willing to give up \"privacy\" in exchange for services they want.</p><p>Competition and avoidance of data breaches, backed by companies' reputations for security and safeguarding, are more powerful than regulation by the quarter most eager to invade privacy and track everyone: the government itself.</p><p>Antitrust Regulatory Manipulation and Corporate Breakup</p><p>Antitrust regulation is likely to be one of the highest-stakes regulatory battles in the technology sector.102 President Trump and members of Congress from both parties have threatened antitrust actions against Google, Amazon, and Facebook over political grievances often unrelated to competition. In March 2019, the European Commission fined Google 1.49 billion ($1.7 billion) for violating EU antitrust laws in the firm's search business.103 State attorneys general in the United States and federal regulators have threatened to bring their own cases.</p><p>In the Google cases, progressives tend to object to Google's market share in online advertising, search, and that of its Android operating system. Conservatives often attack the company claiming its search results have an anti-conservative bias.</p><p>In a potential Amazon case, progressives are concerned with Amazon's market share in retail and its labor relations. President Trump seems to have a personal grudge against Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, who separately owns The Washington Post, which often runs coverage critical of Trump. The paper is unaffiliated with Amazon.</p><p>Regarding Facebook, progressives focus on the company's dominance in social networking, its tendency to buy out competitors, and privacy issues.</p><p>Conservatives believe Facebook's algorithms and software designers are biased against conservatives and censor conservative viewpoints.</p><p>None of these cases have merit. Most of the reasons are addressed in a 2019 CEI paper, \"The Case Against Antitrust Law.\"104 That paper focuses more on general theory than on specific cases. This section will apply those arguments to today's Google, Amazon, and Facebook antitrust debates.</p><p>The Relevant Market Fallacy. The relevant market fallacy is one of the most common misconceptions behind antitrust policy. A company's critics almost invariably assume that its relevant competitive market is smaller than it actually is. Google's share of Internet search is actually much smaller than many antitrust advocates believe. Common searches ranging from Netflix recommendations to match- finding algorithms on online dating sites rely on search engines other than Google. In fact, their proprietary search algorithms are often a competitive selling point. The only area of Internet search where Google truly has a monopoly is on Google searches.</p><p>Amazon controls roughly half of online retail, for example, but only about 5 percent of total retail. Which is the proper relevant market? Facebook dominates social networking. But as a way to use leisure time, it competes with television, movies, YouTube, books, music, friends, families, and more.</p><p>Solving problems and continuing to innovate may require \"collusion\" among service providers of the very sort that is going to enrage the \"open Internet\" and antitrust advocates. \"The Case Against Antitrust Law,\" goes into greater detail about the productive case for some forms of collusion.105 CEI has also detailed how these large firms are actually fiercely competing with each other across a number of fronts.106</p><p>Net Neutrality Mandates and the Denial of Property Rights in Complex Assets</p><p>It has been two years since the repeal of heavy-handed title II regulation of the Internet, known as net neutrality regulations, and none of the dire predictions of net neutrality supporters have come to pass. The Internet is not just intact, but is thriving.</p><p>The Open Internet Act of 2019 (H.R. 1006), sponsored by Rep. Robert Latta (R-OH) would \"amend title I of the Communications Act of 1934 to provide for internet openness.\"107</p><p>This bill is similar to The Promoting Internet Freedom and Innovation Act of 2019,108 sponsored by Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-WA) and untitled legislation introduced by Rep. Greg Walden (R-OR).109 With some nuances, this category of bills involves reinstituting bans on blocking content online; slowing data, a practice known as throttling; and preventing so-called \"fast lanes\" that prioritize certain traffic across the network, presumably for an increased fee. Those practices were legalized in the Federal Trade Commission's repeal of net neutrality regulations, along with ending the Internet's classification as a Title I information service.110</p><p>Distortion via Government Ownership, Subsidies, and Industrial Policy in Tech RandD and Production</p><p>Some legislation in the 116th Congress was aimed at promoting broadband and 5G, but this is best carried out by regulatory liberalization and easing permitting restrictions. And unfortunately, while the FCC has been eliminating cumbersome net neutrality regulations and working to bring more spectrum to market, it also has been pushing unwise federal funding of broadband deployment in certain sectors.111</p><p>The Accelerating Broadband Development by Empowering Local Communities Act of 2019, introduced by Rep. Anna Eshoo (D-CA), would nullify rules issued by the Federal Communications Commission that revoke state and local authority to regulate telecommunications equipment deployment.112 It would seem to be the dead opposite of needed federal preemption, which would eliminate the patchwork maze of costly and complicated state and local regulatory regimes.</p><p>The Office of Rural Broadband Act, sponsored by Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-ND), would create an office at the FCC to coordinate rural broadband deployment efforts.113 This is as the FCC itself fights to shrink the regulatory underbrush, not expand it.</p><p>Government Subsidies and Intervention in the Gig Economy, Tech Workforces, and Education</p><p>The Championing Apprenticeships for New Careers and Employees in Technology (CHANCE in Tech) Act would provide industry intermediaries, like state tech associations, the ability to receive federal grants to develop apprenticeships within the technology sector.114 These are baby versions of grander schemes for \"free college.\"</p><p>The Protecting the Right to Organize (PRO) Act of 2019, sponsored by Rep. Bobby Scott (R-VA), would likely cripple gig economy firms by destroying their business model. Specifically, it creates a federal version of the \"ABC\" test in AB5, the recently enacted California law that seeks to reclassify large numbers of independent contractors as employees eligible for unionization.</p><p>The many thousands who work for sharing economy platforms because they value flexibility or extra income would lose their gigs. The millions of dollars of consumer surplus added to the economy by these firms would vanish. The PRO Act passed the House in 2019 but has so far languished in the Senate. It is likely that future administrations might attempt to reclassify workers by administrative fiat, as the Obama administration attempted.</p><p>California's AB5 was an attempt to force gig economy firms like Uber, Lyft, and Taskrabbit to classify independent contractors as employees, giving them full benefits and the right to unionize. AB5 uses what is called an ABC test to determine if a worker is an independent contractor or a formal employee. It consists of three questions:</p><p>How closely is each worker supervised or directed? Do they check in with a boss every day? Or do they work mostly on their own and have wide discretion on how to do their job?</p><p>Is their work part of the company's core business? (For an Uber driver, the answer is yes. For an accountant or a maintenance worker, maybe not.)</p><p>Is the hiring company the contractor's sole or dominant customer? Is the job mostly in the contractor's area of specialty or expertise?115</p><p>The bill text is vaguely worded.116</p><p>In practice, nearly any freelancer qualifies as a formal employee under AB5, but a lot of job arrangements are somewhere in between. While those firms have so far successfully resisted the effort, many thousands of independent contractors in California have lost their jobs, been dropped from in-state work, or been forced to move out of state.117</p><p>The Gig Is Up Act, sponsored by Rep. Debra Haaland (D-NM), also targets gig economy firms. It would require businesses to pay employer and employee portions of Social Security and Medicare taxes when they contract with at least 10,000 independent contractors and gross at least $100 million in a calendar year. While not as existential a threat to gig economy firms as AB5 or the PRO Act, it would still impose significant costs on national firms, reducing the attractiveness of their business model and probably reducing the amount they are able to pay workers.</p><p>Moves Toward the Regulation of Virtual Currencies</p><p>For more than three years, the Securities and Exchange Commission has been lording over the cryptocurrency and blockchain technology sectors, including in areas over which it has no jurisdiction granted from Congress. It has been doing so via arbitrary enforcement actions and \"regulatory dark matter\"agency issuances, including guidance documents bulletins, memos, and even blog posts that do not go through the notice-and-comment rulemaking process, as required by the Administrative Procedure Act, yet carry regulatory weight.118</p><p>In short, without changes in the law, stated intent of Congress, or a formal rule, the SEC has been sending signals through enforcement actions and statements from officials that new issuers of cryptocurrency may be required to go through the same cumbersome securities registration process as do issuers of stocks and bonds.</p><p>The SEC has been regulating products under its jurisdiction, such as exchange- traded funds, or ETFs, more stringently if they involve cryptocurrency. Since 2017, the commission has rejected proposals for more than 10 Bitcoin- based exchange traded funds, sparking a strong dissent in 2018 from Commissioner Hester Peirce. Peirce wrote that the SEC's rejection \"signals an aversion to innovation that may convince entrepreneurs that they should take their ingenuity to other sectors of our economy, or to foreign markets.\"119</p><p>Most troubling is the SEC's assertion of jurisdiction over cryptocurrency products that clearly do not fit the definition of a \"security\" from either Congress or the courts. A 2019 guidance document from the SEC properly classified as \"regulatory dark matter,\" since it was never submitted to Congress for review as a rule states that even in cases where cryptocurrency can be used in a functional market for goods and services, \"there may be securities transactions if ... there are limited or no restrictions on reselling those digital assets.\"120</p><p>This overly broad definition of a security could set a precedent for the SEC to regulate not just cryptocurrency, but everyday consumer goods, as \"securities.\" In an interview for a CEI study, prominent FinTech attorney Georgia Quinn said after reading the SEC guidance, \"I think airline miles and retailer points could be considered securities,\" noting that some of these items are transferable and therefore could be deemed to have a secondary market. For instance, the website points.com enables users to manage and exchange rewards points, creating what could be deemed a secondary market.121 And then there are the numerous physical goods, from comic books to baseball cards, that are often bought in part as investments and can be sold in secondary markets.</p><p>For cryptocurrency and other new technologies to flourish, consumers, investors and entrepreneurs must be protected from the overreach of the SEC. The Trump administration and Congress need to rein in \"regulatory dark matter\" at the SEC (as well as other agencies) and curb any efforts by the SEC to stretch the definition of \"security\" beyond recognition.</p><p>Furthermore, Congress should update the nation's securities laws to more clearly and narrowly define federal agencies' jurisdiction over cryptocurrency.</p><p>INFORM Act</p><p>The Integrity, Notification and Fairness in Online Retail Marketplace for Consumers (INFORM) Act (S. 3431) would force online marketplaces like Amazon, eBay, and the like to verify the government ID, tax ID, bank account, and contact information of all their third-party sellers that make at least 200 sales amounting to $5,000 or more in one year. Platforms would also be obligated to make that information available to customers. The bill seeks to thwart sales of counterfeit and stolen items online by third-parties, but platforms are already working to solve those problems for consumers.</p><p>Just as there is a certain amount of fraud in bricks and mortar retail, there is also fraudulent activity online. But a lack of perfection should not be the rule for when to regulate. Market failure should be the only justification for government intervention.</p><p>Retail platforms that host third-party sellers have every incentive to protect their reputations by protecting their customers. eBay has won awards for its cooperation with rights holders to address the sales of fakes online.122 Amazon is the nation's largest online retailer and Americans rank the company among the most trusted brands.123 That trust is a competitive advantage that Amazon saw fit to spend $500 million protecting in 2019. The retail platform also devoted the efforts of 8,000 employees to combat these problems on its platform last year.124 The company vets new third- party sellers, monitors their offerings, and proactively notifies and even refunds consumers when fraud has been detected. Amazon offers a Brand Registry program,125 a Transparency service,126 a Counterfeit Crimes Unit, and other security services that the company has instituted on its own.127</p><p>All of this appears to be money well spent because, according to testimony from Amazon Vice President Dharmesh M. Mehta gave to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce in March, the company prevented 2.5 million suspected bad actor accounts from starting to sell in its online stores, blocked six billion suspected bad listings from appearing, and blocked and repressed 100 suspected fake reviews last year.128 All of this benefits Amazon in preserving its good name, and it benefits consumers by protecting them from fraudulent items and information.</p><p>Market solutions are already working to protect consumers. A regulatory bill is not needed.</p><p>But worse than being repetitive, the INFORM Act may be harmful. The unintended consequences of the bill include security and privacy concerns with the gathering, storing, and sharing with customers of potentially sensitive information. The best intentions do not prevent the inherent tension between verification and privacy. There is also a chance that these compliance costs could act as a barrier to entry for the next, but still small, eBay or Amazon. The big platforms can afford to comply, but the new guy might find the regulatory hoop cost prohibitive.</p><p>Better to let market forces compete for consumers by catering to their preferences. It is already happening to combat fraud online. Let's hope Congress does not get in the way.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>Market solutions, unlike legislation, better lend themselves to address the myriad problems that inevitably arise in a free, competitive economy. The Internet was not initially designed as the mass commercial and consumer medium it is today. If one were to design a commercial network today from the bottom up, it likely would incorporate better authentication. Now that we are in midstream, we wonder if technology can fix its attendant problems, or if law must do it. Either free enterprise or Congress and legislators can set terms, but not both.</p><p>There is a role for law. Fraud, falsification, identity theft, hacking, and the like should be punished, but overly burdensome legislation will create legal and regulatory hassles for small businessesa reason some large firms favor interventionand the development of newer technologies and services, which is one of the great hidden costs of regulation.</p><p>Bad legislation now lays the groundwork for worse legislation later. Embracing regulation and central planning entails embracing collective \"solutions\" that will be difficult or impossible to correct later. The legislation we actually need would be a bill to prevent many of these misguided proposals.</p><p>NOTES</p><p>Elizabeth Holmes and Amy Schatz, \"McCain Tech Plan to Continue Hands-Off Approach to Regulation,\" Wall Street Journal, August 14, 2008, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB121867827436739337\">https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB121867827436739337</url>.</p><p>Clyde Wayne Crews, Jr., \"Mapping Washington's Lawlessness: An Inventory of 'Regulatory Dark Matter' 2017 Edition,\"</p><p>Issue Analysis 2017 No. 4, Competitive Enterprise Institute,</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://cei.org/content/mapping-washington%E2%80%99s-lawlessness-2017\">https://cei.org/content/mapping-washington%E2%80%99s-lawlessness-2017</url>.

INTRODUCTION II. THE INCOMPATIBILITY III. THE CONFLICTING INTERESTS IV. THE NEW GTLD SYSTEM AND ITS LEGAL RAMIFICATIONS V. EARLY DEVELOPMENTS SINCE THE CLOSING OF GTLD APPLICATIONS VI. CONCLUSION</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I. INTRODUCTION</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Being human-friendly addresses on the Internet, domain names, such as amazon.com and cbc.ca, operate as globally unique gateways that enable consumers of products, services, and information to reach online contents. Trademarks, on the other hand, are territorial in nature and arise primarily from the need to prevent consumer confusion. The interface between the two systems in an Internet economy is such that domain names act similarly to word-marks in the trademark system, thereby functioning as quasi-trademarks.</p><p>In an Internet economy, there is an entrenched association between trademarks and domain names despite the inherent legal and technical incompatibility between the two, a result of which gives rise to exploitative business practices in the midst of an ever-present risk of violation of exclusive rights. As domain names continue to be an integral part of any firm's trademark strategy, there have been increasing efforts on an international level to make the administration of the domain name system (DNS) compatible with the way trademark rights are enforced. This article examines such trends, particularly in light of Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers' (ICANN's) introduction of generic top-level domains (gTLDs), and their ramifications from an intellectual property law standpoint.</p><p>Legal avenues for domain name dispute resolution have long favoured trademark interests in the current domain name system. The provisions and safeguards in ICANN's new gTLD programme, however, introduce new dimensions of complexity in terms of dispute resolution, which transcend the extent of territorially enforced trademarks. Some of the early developments since the closing of the gTLD registration applications show the increasing misalignment between the governance of identifying marks on the Internet and the reach of national trademark laws. The paradoxical nature of endeavours to align the governance of globally unique domain names with that of territorial trademark interests inevitably harms domain names' conformity to the traditional trademark system.</p><p>II. THE INCOMPATIBILITY</p><p>In terms of valuation of assets, trademarks are \"as significant in economic terms as patents and copyright; and their impact across industry is thought to be far wider.\" (1) In fact, the result of having trademarks is argued to be purely economic, one that \"seeks to protect consumers from deceitful and anti- competitive practices.\" (2) Moreover, while the protection of trademarks in itself may not create an incentive for continuous improvement in quality, trademarks are key to maintaining the quality associated with goods and services offered. (3) Internet domain names, on the other hand, are a largely privately administered system, born out of technical needs to facilitate a global addressing scheme for the operation of the Internet. (4) In order to draw an intuitive comparison, Phillips and Simon classify trademarks and domain names as \"distinguishing\" signs and \"disguising\" signs, respectively. (5) While closely interwound on the surface and in practice, the domain name system differs significantly from trademarks in the following legal and technical aspects:</p><p>International legal harmonisation: Unlike trademarks, there is no international convention or treaty to govern domain names upon which ratifying member states are obliged to harmonise administration.</p><p>Principle of territoriality: Country-code top-level domains (ccTLDs) such as .it, .nz, and .kr correspond to individual countries and territories. ccTLDs are managed territorially by authorities according to local policies and legal circumstances of the country or territory involved. (6) Still, the country-code portion cannot be omitted and must always follow the string to the left of the dot when written down or pronounced. For example, the armani.it domain name cannot be shortened or communicated as simply ARMANI even within the territory of Italy.</p><p>Principle of specificity: One of the key design goals of the domain name system is that it reliably provides the same answers to the same queries from any source. (7) A corollary of this is that identical domain names are not allowed even if they belong to different classes of goods and services as may be permitted in the trademark system. A domain name is functional only when it is complete with the top-level portion, i.e. the right-hand side of the right-most dot, which determines the outermost name space in the domain name system. As a result, all Internet domain names are unique not only at the national level but also globally.</p><p>Single root: The \"Internet root servers,\" which act as the first tier of the directory of all domain names on the Internet, are property of the government of the United States. ICANN, an agency of the U.S. government, is ultimately responsible for the governance of all top-level domains (TLDs), thereby creating a single system of domain name administration across the entire cyberspace. Trademarks, on the other hand, are territorial and generally have national jurisdictions where each country's trademark office is the ultimate authority over all trademarks registered in that country.</p><p>Global execution of changes: Many arbitration proceedings in disputes over the ownership of Internet domain names result in cancellation or transfer. Due to the technical nature of the domain name system, the outcome of a dispute takes effect globally, uniformly, and immediately, thereby creating a de facto international jurisdiction, which is clearly not the case with national trademark laws.</p><p>III. THE CONFLICTING INTERESTS</p><p>Economically, exclusive rights conferred in trademarks \"reduce inefficiencies that result from a mismatch of information between buyers and sellers on certain attributes of goods and services.\" (8) Since the commercialisation of the Internet, rights-holders of existing trademarks have sought to extend their exclusive rights by securing domain names that supposedly represent their trademarks.</p><p>The business objective in this context is to correspond to an intuitive association, likely to be made by the average consumer, between the marketed domain name and the registered trademark the domain name purports to represent. For instance, it would not be unreasonable for average customers of Scandinavian Airlines, widely known and trading as SAS, to expect to find the airline's services--or at least meaningful pointers to the services--on the Internet domain sas.com. (9)</p><p>Similarly, rights-holders of future trademarks, such as owners of start-up businesses or new brands, want to ensure that the Internet domain names that correspond to their new trade remain available for them to register before publicising or marketing their products or services. Many authors and bloggers on the Internet offer advice on how to choose the right domain name for a business, (10) and even domain name-generation services have sprung up to assist business owners in finding domain names that suit their business ideas. (11) A domain name's role of acting as a mark that represents one's trade has become so elemental and widely accepted that it is now arguably common practice for organisations to avoid creating a word-mark whose corresponding domain name, as would be naturally perceived by the average target consumers of the product or service, is:</p><p>a. Impossible or difficult to express in character sets allowed in the domain name system; or</p><p>b. Currently unavailable and deemed impractical to acquire from a third-party registrant, who is often a competitor.</p><p>Two relevant facts are at play here: 1) unlike a postal address, an Internet domain name is expressly chosen by its owner; and 2) on the Internet, users \"readily interpret a domain name as reflecting the identity of its owner.\" (12) The above outlines the nature of trademark interests with respect to the domain name system. A domain name that implements a trademark \"conveys all the goodwill and intangible value that are epitomised in the trademark.\" (13) It is consistent with a trademark's functions of origin, advertising, and investment as intended by its proprietor. (14) While the owner of a registered trademark is conferred exclusive rights in accordance with Article 16(1) of the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS), (15) an Internet domain name is a time-bound contract of assignment between a registrant and a registry that is in charge of a name space, often involving a registrar in the middle.</p><p>There is no explicit notion of property right associated with Internet domain names; to date, no institutionalisation or formalisation on domain names has been made within an explicit legal understanding, although courts have three possible theories: trademark, contracts for services, and property rights. (16) The consequence of this uncertainty in everyday language is as follows: a person who has registered a domain name for any purpose, commercial or otherwise, without the corresponding trademark rights registered at least in their own country, is always exposed and vulnerable to ownership disputes initiated by a third-party entity that does allegedly have trademark rights associated with the domain name in question.</p><p>Up until 2012, there existed twenty-three \"global\" top-level domains that were not tied to country codes. (17) They included .com, .net, .org, .info, .biz, and .xxx, all of which transcended the notion of territoriality as employed by the trademark system. Of these, the .com space is by far the most popular TLD among businesses in most countries, as they prefer a single territory-neutral .com to local TLDs and any other currently available global TLDs. (18) Such is consistent with the general tendency observed in trademark registrations, whereby businesses prefer simplicity, certainty, and affordability to having to \"apply country by country using systems encrusted with individual idiosyncrasies.\" (19)</p><p>Moreover, a particularly low barrier to entry in certain name spaces, such as .com, allows anyone to register available domain names with virtually no cost concerns, time-wise or in monetary terms. This has contributed to the current over-saturation in parts of the domain name system and the resultant scarcity of domain names as resources. To holders of trademark rights, the situation equates to an ever-present risk of violation of their exclusive rights on the Internet.</p><p>Today, most domain name dispute proceedings are carried out by five dispute resolution service providers, (20) including the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), under ICANN's Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy (UDRP). (21) Although the UDRP's overall procedure is described to be an extra-legal approach (22) and its legal basis is contractual, (23) countries such as Ireland, Australia, and the United Arab Emirates have also adopted the UDRP (24) for the resolution of disputes over domain names within their own ccTLDs. As stated in Paragraph 4(b) of the Policy, the UDRP at its core assesses the existence of bad faith in registering a domain name that is identical or confusingly similar to another's trademark. (25)</p><p>Typically, an entity that believes that its trademark rights have been violated by someone else's domain name registration, which may or may not have been carried out in bad faith, would attempt to claim that domain name first through private negotiation. Failing that, the UDRP is at their disposal as an affordable, timesaving option generally preferred to litigation, which is costlier. On average, the cost of court litigation in a foreign jurisdiction amounts to more than U.S. $850,000, whereas mediation under the UDRP does not usually exceed U.S. $100,000. (26) Litigation also turns a domain name dispute into a matter of trademark infringement in the eyes of national trademark law and often enters into the realm of international private law, (27) thereby raising questions of domicile, jurisdiction, adjudication upon place of validity and infringement and the resultant possibility of forum shopping--as well as an assessment of the territorial factors of \"commercial effect,\" (28) none of which is the UDRP's concern.</p><p>More than ten years of UDRP arbitration proceedings has clearly favoured trademark interests over domain name-only interests. It should be noted that domain name interests often fall under areas outside the economic objectives of trademarks, for instance, traditional knowledge, free speech, and not-for-profit activities. According to WIPO, the prominent UDRP dispute resolution service provider, 90 percent (22,510 out of 25,114) of all UDRP cases it arbitrated up until 2012 saw an outcome that was fully or partially favourable to the claimant. (29) Indeed, the UDRP, with its international jurisdiction, has become a popular dispute resolution mechanism that seemingly gives claimants equipped with trademark rights a high chance of success.</p><p>There are sharply contrasting views on the UDRP; WIPO, for example, hails the success of the UDRP as a mechanism available to trademark owners for \"the efficient resolution of disputes arising out of bad-faith registration and use by third parties of Internet domain names corresponding to those trademark rights.\" (30) Others criticise the UDRP as one-sidedly presupposing that established trademark rights should be given priority, (31) while lacking constitutional relevance in itself. (32) It has even been argued that ICANN's UDRP often produces an outcome that a claimant \"would not achieve under the law of passing off or infringement of registered trademark.\" (33) At the same time, arbitration under the UDRP also has its limitations from a procedural point of view that may in fact work against claimants:</p><p>The desire to maintain a simple and cheap procedure can result in procedural unfairness: the complainant has no automatic right to respond to the contentions made by the respondent, and it is impossible for the complainant to anticipate every manoeuvre which a respondent may make. There is little opportunity to dispute assertions, which are put forward as facts, or statements of intention put forward by registrants. Relatively speaking, it provides a cheaper and quicker solution than litigation, but it has its limitations. (34)</p><p>Nevertheless, the legal argument in the treatment of Internet domain names before trademark rights remains intensely debated with no planned revision or amendment of the UDRP in sight.</p><p>IV. THE NEW GTLD SYSTEM AND ITS LEGAL RAMIFICATIONS</p><p>After years of discussions and deliberation, ICANNhas introduced a system of gTLDs, to launch in 2013. (35) In principle, the gTLD programme is an unlimited expansion of global TLDs beyond the existing twenty-three, which could lead to the creation of short, previously unavailable Internet domain names, such as .music, .law, and .gucci. The programme is essentially a full-scale deregulation and globalisation of the domain name system, and comes after a small number of previous additions to global TLDs, such as .info and .biz, failed to attract the attention of trademark owners and other types of registrants away from the congested .com space. (36)</p><p>The purpose of the new gTLD programme according to ICANNis to \"create more choice for Internet users, empower innovation, stimulate economic activity, and generate new business opportunities around the world.\" (37) Loosely speaking, such objectives translate to a new wave of domain name registrations by entities that wish to exploit business opportunities by becoming a domain name registry themselves in charge of a top-level name space, and also by those committed to and capable of protecting their trademarks and the associated goodwill to the maximum.</p><p>Although the central idea behind gTLDs is to remove restrictions in the domain name system, there are important considerations for existing and future trademark holders to take into account. One notable limitation is the applicability of Article 6ter of the Paris Convention, where prohibitions concerning state emblems, official hallmarks, and emblems for intergovernmental organisations are stipulated. (38) This means that governments and intergovernmental organisations may invoke the provision within the gTLD programme for objection against third-party applications that implement the names and acronyms prohibited for trademark use by the Paris Convention. (39)</p><p>Furthermore, gTLDs are not at all compartmentalised by national borders or country codes. As such, different entities should establish different gTLD strategies by examining the descriptiveness and other characteristics of their own trademarks, as well as other registrations of identical marks, not only in their own country, but also within and outside their language zone, within and outside their community (such as the European Union), and ultimately globally. For example, the legal complexity and cost involved in having .apple approved may be considerably higher than those of .microsoft, where the MICROSOFT trademark arguably has a stronger case of non-descriptiveness in most jurisdictions and languages globally. In the realm of gTLDs, neither borders nor classes of goods and services exist; there can only be one registry of .apple and .microsoft, respectively.</p><p>Because gTLDs are a brand new system, an elaborate scheme of provisions and safeguards have been thought out and put in place by ICANNto minimise side effects and unintended consequences right from the beginning. (40) gTLDs from an intellectual property rights perspective can be characterised by the following:</p><p>High barrier to entry: Trademark owners have generally frowned upon the idea of opening up the domain name space as it could heighten the risk of consumer confusion and threaten their ability to conduct business on the Internet. (41) In order to address such concerns, and in line with the need to go beyond traditional trademark enforcement monitoring in virtual worlds, (42) gTLDs impose a barrier to entry that is inconceivably high for potential cybersquatters, free-riders, and competitors acting in bad faith, particularly when compared to the current mode of registration in the popular .com space. (43) The barrier to entry into gTLDs consists of multiple layers of pre- and post- delegation provisions (44) such as applicant review procedures over many months that include background screening and evaluation of financial capacity; the new Unified Rapid Suspension (URS) mechanism (45) to follow the assessment of a complaint; third-party objection upon legal rights (trademark rights) (46) among other grounds; and the sheer amount of application and renewal fees that are many thousand times higher than what a second-level domain name under the .com space typically costs. (47) To trademark owners, all of these provisions amount to a strong deterrent to disruptive conduct, which systematically and pre-emptively minimises room for future challenges against their rights. By implication, the existing UDRP can be argued to be largely redundant as far as new top-level domain names are concerned because room for acting in bad faith is systematically minimised. The UDRP, however, may still function for disputes over registrations of second-level domain names within a gTLD space depending on the regulations set forth by its registry.</p><p>Windows of registration and objection: Unlike other domain name spaces where registrants may apply for new domain names at any time, the gTLD programme closed registration applications on March 29, 2012. (48) Information on the applied-for gTLDs was kept secret until ICANNmade it public on June 13, 2012, dubbed \"the Reveal Day.\" (49) The public then had until March 13, 2013 to lodge objections to the gTLD applications ICANNhad received. (50) Many organisations saw the window of registration as a one-off opportunity to establish and execute their gTLD strategy, but had to engage in speculation since they had no visibility over their competitors' intent. The high cost of application (51) meant that some potential applicants chose to forgo gTLDs representing their trade and/or marks at the risk of other entities applying for them, as opposed to engaging in defensive registrations as would have been viable in traditional domain name spaces. To ICANN, on the other hand, such a closed, time-based scheme has resulted in a system that gives finite sets of registrations, objections, and issues to deal with.</p><p>Protection of strong trademark interests: It was envisaged that multiple eligible applicants would want the same gTLD that is made of a generic term, a trademark independently owned by more than one entity, or both. (52) In such cases, gTLD applicants will enter into an auction (53) where the highest bid, most likely from the applicant able to exhibit the strongest commitment to its trademark interests, would secure the gTLD in question. This not only contrasts with the \"first-come-first-served\" principle adopted by many name spaces in the current domain name system, but also transcends national borders thereby going against the elemental principle of territoriality stipulated in national trademark laws.</p><p>ICANNTrademark Clearinghouse: In March 2013, ICANNofficially launched a global repository of trademarks and other information pertaining to the rights of trademark holders throughout the world, dubbed Trademark Clearinghouse. (54) Through the facilitation of a \"sunrise\" period and alerts in advance, Trademark Clearinghouse provides trademark owners with centralised, pre-emptive measures to protect and claim their rights across all new gTLD spaces. (55) The legal ramifications of establishing a global Trademark Clearinghouse for the Internet constitute a profound challenge to the traditional system of trademark registrations; although Trademark Clearinghouse is a paid service where participation remains strictly optional, ICANNis nevertheless set to be in charge of a massive authoritative database with which it can use to make regulatory determinations. (56) Critics voice their concerns over the amount of discretionary power to be given to ICANN, a result of which may see its Trademark Clearinghouse ultimately substituting national trademark offices. (57)</p><p>V. EARLY DEVELOPMENTS SINCE THE CLOSING OF GTLD APPLICATIONS</p><p>In March 2013, ICANNreleased statistics from the first round of gTLD application submissions. The agency has begun to assess a total of 1,930 gTLD applications. (58) Applicants range from the biggest names on the Internet such as Google, Microsoft, and Amazon, to smaller enterprises and consortiums. Google in particular has applied for a total of 101 gTLDs, an endeavour that cost the company US $18.7 million in application fees alone. Google's gTLD applications include those associated with its own trademarks such as .google, .youtube, .gmail, and .android, as well as generic strings including .cloud, .search, .tech, .wow, .you, .book, .mba, and .lol. While many of these gTLDs are intended exclusively for Google's own use, the company plans to make a portion of its gTLDs open for the general public and, in some cases, qualified entities. (59) This means that once approved by ICANN, Google will invite other organisations and individuals to register, most likely for a fee, second-level domain names under each of its \"open\" gTLD spaces. It will consequently open up the possibility of the birth of new Internet domain names such as penguin.book and duke.mba.</p><p>Of the 1,930 gTLD applications, 731 conflict with at least one other applicant's requests, and the number of gTLDs that are sought by more than one applicant is 230. (60) For example, .app, .inc, and .online are contested by thirteen, eleven, and six different applicants, respectively. (61) It is expected that, upon initial evaluation, ICANNwill determine the owner of each contested gTLD through an auction. It is possible that parties that are able to negotiate an alignment of interests will form alliances for greater bargaining power in the selection process as seen in the case of .online, where three competing domain name businesses have announced their plan to team up for a bid to form a jointly run .online registry. (62)</p><p>Some of the applications for gTLDs have been challenged on the grounds of legal rights objection in accordance with the provisions of the gTLD application process. As of March 2013, WIPO, the sole arbitrator for legal rights objections made against gTLD applications, received sixty-nine objections affecting more than thirty unique gTLDs, including .mail, .blue, .merck, .yellowpages, .gcc, .academy, .limited, .weibo, .delmonte, .direct, and .food (63) The objecting parties range from businesses with direct trademark interests such as Del Monte Corporation, to intergovernmental organisations such as The Gulf Corporation Council, to government agencies such as the United States Postal Service, to entities otherwise seeking to protect the purported associations between the top-level domain names in question and their own products and services. (64)</p><p>The abovementioned objections on the grounds of legal rights are a subset of the 204 objections of all categories submitted to ICANN. (65) Objections that have been made on the grounds of public policy are tabled at the ICANNGovernmental Advisory Committee (GAC), which gathers input from governments around the world and makes rulings in the form of advice to the ICANNBoard. (66) One such GAC ruling was made against Amazon EU S.a r.l. over its applications for a .amazon gTLD and the equivalent internationalised domain names (IDNs) in Japanese and Chinese. (67) The GAC reached a consensus to block Amazon's .amazon and related applications after Brazil and other South American countries claimed the rights over geographic indications associated with the Amazon River. (68) As a result, Amazon, a business that currently trades under amazon.com and country-specific domain names such as amazon.co.uk, will not be able to use the ultimately short .amazon moniker. In its July 2013 meeting in Durban, the GAC also allowed the .date and .persiangulf gTLD applications to proceed, decided to defer decisions over .vin and .wine to a later meeting \"due to the complexity in the matter,\" reaffirmed that marks and abbreviations representing intergovernmental organisations (IGOs) should be protected from third-party registrations, and \"noted the concerns expressed by the Government of India\" not to proceed with the gTLD applications for .indians and .ram (69)</p><p>Amazon the global online retailer scored a victory, however, on another gTLD front involving less public policy. In July 2013, WIPO overruled the objection to Amazon's application for a .pin gTLD, lodged by Pinterest, Inc., a social networking service provider widely known for the concept of \"pinning\" items of interest to users' Web pages. In its legal rights objection panel determination, WIPO ruled that, among Internet users, retailers, and media commentators, the word PIN does not sufficiently give rise to secondary meaning to identify Pinterest, which has been in operation since 2010, as the source of its goods and services. Also taken into account was the fact that, of the sixty-three pending PIN trademark registration applications by Pinterest, only two were filed, in the European Union and Russia, before Amazon applied for the .pin gTLD. (70) In other words, sixty-one of the sixty-three PIN trademark registration applications were filed after Amazon's intention to secure .pin became public knowledge on the gTLD Reveal Day. Because Pinterest had not applied for a .pin gTLD itself and was supposedly unaware that Amazon was going to, the only action the company could take within the provisions of the gTLD programme was to invoke a legal rights objection to Amazon's application after the event. The .pin dispute highlights the speculative nature of the gTLD application process and also a heightened risk of having limited reactive measures against a third-party monopolisation on the most global, succinct manifestation of a company's trademark on the Internet.</p><p>Another notable development in the expansion of domain names is the yet- to-be-resolved dispute over .kosher, a gTLD application filed by Kosher Marketing Assets LLC and its parent company OK Kosher to \"promote awareness of the TLD through press releases and direct communications with the customers of OK Kosher Certification.\" (71) OK Kosher's sole application for .kosher is now challenged by five rival certifying organisations, including OU Kosher, Chicago Rabbinical Council, and the Kashruth Council of Canada, who claim that \"[OK Kosher] seeks to profit from a sacred tradition that should not be over-commercialised,\" in a market that is thought to amount to US $17 billion a year. (72) Meanwhile, ICANN statistics confirm that the gTLD application for .halal is also in dispute. (73) The crux of the matter in these disputes, however, is neither religious practices nor dietary preferences; it is that, when one operator secures a global monopoly, as allowed in the gTLD system, over a mark seemingly common to the trade, it is inevitably seen as a threat and stolen opportunity by others in the market. As pointed out above, gTLDs are an extra-legal system featuring a high entry barrier, one that remains strictly optional to everyone. However, as soon as one operator decides that the benefits of a gTLD generically representing its trade outweighs the cost of securing it, takes the trouble of applying for one, and manages to act within the registration window, any perceived equilibrium in the playing field is broken and an unprecedented competitive advantage is seemingly created. Moreover, in a non-compartmentalised world of gTLDs, reactive measures may prove to be just as costly, if not more, as applying for a gTLD in the first instance, regardless of the extent of one's entrenched trademark rights in individual territories.</p><p>Any gTLD developments from this point on are the results of, and reactions to, the 1,930 applications already submitted to ICANN; (74) there is currently no room for additional applications, offensive or defensive. Although ICANN hinted that there may eventually be a second round of gTLD applications, (75) the legal, political, and administrative overheads required for resolving the current conflicting interests appear to have closed the door for new entrants at least for the foreseeable future. Nevertheless, the effect of approved gTLDs, the number of which is expected to be many tens of times that of the current non-country- specific TLDs, is set to question and complicate the territorial recognition and enforcement of today's trademarks even more visibly than traditional domain names have.</p><p>VI. CONCLUSION</p><p>In principle, the system of new gTLDs offers provisions and safeguards designed to empower the rights-holders who are capable of and committed to maximising the exposure and goodwill of their marks. The extent of such measures is significantly greater than that of the UDRP provisions applicable to the current domain name system, which already favours trademark interests over domain name-only interests when the two are in conflict. Yet, legal avenues for dispute resolution over Internet domain names remain largely outside the control of national trademark laws, and such a reality is even more articulated under the system of gTLDs. As illustrated above, the actual treatment of generic strings and conflicting trademarks in a highly competitive global jurisdiction is inevitably fraught with rules, exceptions, and bodies of extra-legal authority beyond the reach of national trademark laws, international harmonisation, and even the traditional domain name system.</p><p>Fundamentally, the core of the trademark vs. domain name debate, now even more acutely accentuated by the introduction of new gTLDs, lies in the territorial nature of intellectual property rights. Internet domain names inherently and incessantly demonstrate their nonconformity to trademark rights that are recognised and enforced upon the principles of territoriality and specificity in individual jurisdictions. What is increasingly observed is an inevitable breakdown between trademark rights as protected under different national laws, and the global exploitation of those rights on the Internet. (76) The global market that is the Internet has irreversibly perturbed the traditional trademark system, and raises the unavoidable question of whether a country's trademark law is actually applicable when a trademark is used on the Internet. (77) It is rather paradoxical that, as observed today, the continuing extra-legal endeavours on a global scale to enforce territorially exclusive rights onto an arena of a globally unique addressing scheme should come back to threaten the legal basis of the very rights these endeavours intend to uphold.</p><p>(1.)

INTRODUCTION\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Being human-friendly addresses on the Internet, domain names, such as amazon.com and cbc.ca, operate as globally unique gateways that enable consumers of products, services, and information to reach online contents. Trademarks, on the other hand, are territorial in nature and arise primarily from the need to prevent consumer confusion. The interface between the two systems in an Internet economy is such that domain names act similarly to word-marks in the trademark system, thereby functioning as quasi-trademarks.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In an Internet economy, there is an entrenched association between trademarks and domain names despite the inherent legal and technical incompatibility between the two, a result of which gives rise to exploitative business practices in the midst of an ever-present risk of violation of exclusive rights. </pre></p><p><pre xml:space=\"preserve\">As domain names continue to be an integral part of any firm's trademark strategy, there have been increasing efforts on an international level to make the administration of the domain name system (DNS) compatible with the way trademark rights are enforced. This article examines such trends, particularly in light of Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers' (ICANN's) introduction of generic top-level domains (gTLDs), and their ramifications from an intellectual property law standpoint.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Legal avenues for domain name dispute resolution have long favoured trademark interests in the current domain name system. The provisions and safeguards in ICANN's new gTLD programme, however, introduce new dimensions of complexity in terms of dispute resolution, which transcend the extent of territorially enforced trademarks. Some of the early developments since the closing of the gTLD registration applications show the increasing misalignment between the governance of identifying marks on the Internet and the reach of national trademark laws. The paradoxical nature of endeavours to align the governance of globally unique domain names with that of territorial trademark interests inevitably harms domain names' conformity to the traditional trademark system.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0II. THE INCOMPATIBILITY\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In terms of valuation of assets, trademarks are \"as significant in economic terms as patents and copyright; and their impact across industry is thought to be far wider.\" (1) In fact, the result of having trademarks is argued to be purely economic, one that \"seeks to protect consumers from deceitful and anti- competitive practices.\" (2) Moreover, while the protection of trademarks in itself may not create an incentive for continuous improvement in quality, trademarks are key to maintaining the quality associated with goods and services offered. (3) Internet domain names, on the other hand, are a largely privately administered system, born out of technical needs to facilitate a global addressing scheme for the operation of the Internet. (4) In order to draw an intuitive comparison, Phillips and Simon classify trademarks and domain names as \"distinguishing\" signs and \"disguising\" signs, respectively. (5) While closely interwound on the surface and in practice, the domain name system differs significantly from trademarks in the following legal and technical aspects:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0International legal harmonisation: Unlike trademarks, there is no international convention or treaty to govern domain names upon which ratifying member states are obliged to harmonise administration.\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Principle of territoriality: Country-code top-level domains (ccTLDs) such as .it, .nz, and .kr correspond to individual countries and territories. ccTLDs are managed territorially by authorities according to local policies and legal circumstances of the country or territory involved. (6) Still, the country-code portion cannot be omitted and must always follow the string to the left of the dot when written down or pronounced. For example, the armani.it domain name cannot be shortened or communicated as simply ARMANI even within the territory of Italy.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Principle of specificity: One of the key design goals of the domain name system is that it reliably provides the same answers to the same queries from any source. (7) A corollary of this is that identical domain names are not allowed even if they belong to different classes of goods and services as may be permitted in the trademark system. A domain name is functional only when it is complete with the top-level portion, i.e. the right-hand side of the right-most dot, which determines the outermost name space in the domain name system. As a result, all Internet domain names are unique not only at the national level but also globally.\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Single root: The \"Internet root servers,\" which act as the first tier of the directory of all domain names on the Internet, are property of the government of the United States. ICANN, an agency of the U.S. government, is ultimately responsible for the governance of all top-level domains (TLDs), thereby creating a single system of domain name administration across the entire cyberspace. Trademarks, on the other hand, are territorial and generally have national jurisdictions where each country's trademark office is the ultimate authority over all trademarks registered in that country.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Global execution of changes: Many arbitration proceedings in disputes over the ownership of Internet domain names result in cancellation or transfer. Due to the technical nature of the domain name system, the outcome of a dispute takes effect globally, uniformly, and immediately, thereby creating a de facto international jurisdiction, which is clearly not the case with national trademark laws.\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0III. THE CONFLICTING INTERESTS<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Economically, exclusive rights conferred in trademarks \"reduce inefficiencies that result from a mismatch of information between buyers and sellers on certain attributes of goods and services.\" (8) Since the commercialisation of the Internet, rights-holders of existing trademarks have sought to extend their exclusive rights by securing domain names that supposedly represent their trademarks.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The business objective in this context is to correspond to an intuitive association, likely to be made by the average consumer, between the marketed domain name and the registered trademark the domain name purports to represent. For instance, it would not be unreasonable for average customers of Scandinavian Airlines, widely known and trading as SAS, to expect to find the airline's services--or at least meaningful pointers to the services--on the Internet domain sas.com. (9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Similarly, rights-holders of future trademarks, such as owners of start-up businesses or new brands, want to ensure that the Internet domain names that correspond to their new trade remain available for them to register before publicising or marketing their products or services. Many authors and bloggers on the Internet offer advice on how to choose the right domain name for a business, (10) and even domain name-generation services have sprung up to assist business owners in finding domain names that suit their business ideas. (11) A domain name's role of acting as a mark that represents one's trade has become so elemental and widely accepted that it is now arguably common practice for organisations to avoid creating a word-mark whose corresponding domain name, as would be naturally perceived by the average target consumers of the product or service, is:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0a. Impossible or difficult to express in character sets allowed in the domain name system; or\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0b. Currently unavailable and deemed impractical to acquire from a third-party registrant, who is often a competitor.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Two relevant facts are at play here: 1) unlike a postal address, an Internet domain name is expressly chosen by its owner; and 2) on the Internet, users \"readily interpret a domain name as reflecting the identity of its owner.\" (12) The above outlines the nature of trademark interests with respect to the domain name system. A domain name that implements a trademark \"conveys all the goodwill and intangible value that are epitomised in the trademark.\" (13) It is consistent with a trademark's functions of origin, advertising, and investment as intended by its proprietor. (14) While the owner of a registered trademark is conferred exclusive rights in accordance with Article 16(1) of the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS), (15) an Internet domain name is a time-bound contract of assignment between a registrant and a registry that is in charge of a name space, often involving a registrar in the middle.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There is no explicit notion of property right associated with Internet domain names; to date, no institutionalisation or formalisation on domain names has been made within an explicit legal understanding, although courts have three possible theories: trademark, contracts for services, and property rights. (16) The consequence of this uncertainty in everyday language is as follows: a person who has registered a domain name for any purpose, commercial or otherwise, without the corresponding trademark rights registered at least in their own country, is always exposed and vulnerable to ownership disputes initiated by a third-party entity that does allegedly have trademark rights associated with the domain name in question.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Up until 2012, there existed twenty-three \"global\" top-level domains that were not tied to country codes. (17) They included .com, .net, .org, .info, .biz, and .xxx, all of which transcended the notion of territoriality as employed by the trademark system. Of these, the .com space is by far the most popular TLD among businesses in most countries, as they prefer a single territory-neutral .com to local TLDs and any other currently available global TLDs. (18) Such is consistent with the general tendency observed in trademark registrations, whereby businesses prefer simplicity, certainty, and affordability to having to \"apply country by country using systems encrusted with individual idiosyncrasies.\" (19)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Moreover, a particularly low barrier to entry in certain name spaces, such as .com, allows anyone to register available domain names with virtually no cost concerns, time-wise or in monetary terms. This has contributed to the current over-saturation in parts of the domain name system and the resultant scarcity of domain names as resources. To holders of trademark rights, the situation equates to an ever-present risk of violation of their exclusive rights on the Internet.\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Today, most domain name dispute proceedings are carried out by five dispute resolution service providers, (20) including the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), under ICANN's Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy (UDRP). (21) Although the UDRP's overall procedure is described to be an extra-legal approach (22) and its legal basis is contractual, (23) countries such as Ireland, Australia, and the United Arab Emirates have also adopted the UDRP (24) for the resolution of disputes over domain names within their own ccTLDs. As stated in Paragraph 4(b) of the Policy, the UDRP at its core assesses the existence of bad faith in registering a domain name that is identical or confusingly similar to another's trademark. (25)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Typically, an entity that believes that its trademark rights have been violated by someone else's domain name registration, which may or may not have been carried out in bad faith, would attempt to claim that domain name first through private negotiation. Failing that, the UDRP is at their disposal as an affordable, timesaving option generally preferred to litigation, which is costlier. On average, the cost of court litigation in a foreign jurisdiction amounts to more than U.S. $850,000, whereas mediation under the UDRP does not usually exceed U.S. $100,000. (26) Litigation also turns a domain name dispute into a matter of trademark infringement in the eyes of national trademark law and often enters into the realm of international private law, (27) thereby raising questions of domicile, jurisdiction, adjudication upon place of validity and infringement and the resultant possibility of forum shopping--as well as an assessment of the territorial factors of \"commercial effect,\" (28) none of which is the UDRP's concern.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0More than ten years of UDRP arbitration proceedings has clearly favoured trademark interests over domain name-only interests. It should be noted that domain name interests often fall under areas outside the economic objectives of trademarks, for instance, traditional knowledge, free speech, and not-for-profit activities. According to WIPO, the prominent UDRP dispute resolution service provider, 90 percent (22,510 out of 25,114) of all UDRP cases it arbitrated up until 2012 saw an outcome that was fully or partially favourable to the claimant. (29) Indeed, the UDRP, with its international jurisdiction, has become a popular dispute resolution mechanism that seemingly gives claimants equipped with trademark rights a high chance of success.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There are sharply contrasting views on the UDRP; WIPO, for example, hails the success of the UDRP as a mechanism available to trademark owners for \"the efficient resolution of disputes arising out of bad-faith registration and use by third parties of Internet domain names corresponding to those trademark rights.\" (30) Others criticise the UDRP as one-sidedly presupposing that established trademark rights should be given priority, (31) while lacking constitutional relevance in itself. (32) It has even been argued that ICANN's UDRP often produces an outcome that a claimant \"would not achieve under the law of passing off or infringement of registered trademark.\" (33) At the same time, arbitration under the UDRP also has its limitations from a procedural point of view that may in fact work against claimants:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The desire to maintain a simple and cheap procedure can result in\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 procedural unfairness: the complainant has no automatic right to\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 respond to the contentions made by the respondent, and it is\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 impossible for the complainant to anticipate every manoeuvre which\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 a respondent may make. There is little opportunity to dispute\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 assertions, which are put forward as facts, or statements of\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 intention put forward by registrants.

(34)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Nevertheless, the legal argument in the treatment of Internet domain names before trademark rights remains intensely debated with no planned revision or amendment of the UDRP in sight.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0IV. THE NEW GTLD SYSTEM AND ITS LEGAL RAMIFICATIONS\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After years of discussions and deliberation, ICANN has introduced a system of gTLDs, to launch in 2013. (35) In principle, the gTLD programme is an unlimited expansion of global TLDs beyond the existing twenty-three, which could lead to the creation of short, previously unavailable Internet domain names, such as .music, .law, and .gucci. The programme is essentially a full-scale deregulation and globalisation of the domain name system, and comes after a small number of previous additions to global TLDs, such as .info and .biz, failed to attract the attention of trademark owners and other types of registrants away from the congested .com space. (36)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The purpose of the new gTLD programme according to ICANN is to \"create more choice for Internet users, empower innovation, stimulate economic activity, and generate new business opportunities around the world.\" (37) Loosely speaking, such objectives translate to a new wave of domain name registrations by entities that wish to exploit business opportunities by becoming a domain name registry themselves in charge of a top-level name space, and also by those committed to and capable of protecting their trademarks and the associated goodwill to the maximum.\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Although the central idea behind gTLDs is to remove restrictions in the domain name system, there are important considerations for existing and future trademark holders to take into account. One notable limitation is the applicability of Article 6ter of the Paris Convention, where prohibitions concerning state emblems, official hallmarks, and emblems for intergovernmental organisations are stipulated. (38) This means that governments and intergovernmental organisations may invoke the provision within the gTLD programme for objection against third-party applications that implement the names and acronyms prohibited for trademark use by the Paris Convention. (39)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Furthermore, gTLDs are not at all compartmentalised by national borders or country codes. As such, different entities should establish different gTLD strategies by examining the descriptiveness and other characteristics of their own trademarks, as well as other registrations of identical marks, not only in their own country, but also within and outside their language zone, within and outside their community (such as the European Union), and ultimately globally. For example, the legal complexity and cost involved in having .apple approved may be considerably higher than those of .microsoft, where the MICROSOFT trademark arguably has a stronger case of non-descriptiveness in most jurisdictions and languages globally. In the realm of gTLDs, neither borders nor classes of goods and services exist; there can only be one registry of .apple and .microsoft, respectively.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Because gTLDs are a brand new system, an elaborate scheme of provisions and safeguards have been thought out and put in place by ICANN to minimise side effects and unintended consequences right from the beginning. (40) gTLDs from an intellectual property rights perspective can be characterised by the following:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0High barrier to entry: Trademark owners have generally frowned upon the idea of opening up the domain name space as it could heighten the risk of consumer confusion and threaten their ability to conduct business on the Internet. (41) In order to address such concerns, and in line with the need to go beyond traditional trademark enforcement monitoring in virtual worlds, (42) gTLDs impose a barrier to entry that is inconceivably high for potential cybersquatters, free-riders, and competitors acting in bad faith, particularly when compared to the current mode of registration in the popular .com space. (43) The barrier to entry into gTLDs consists of multiple layers of pre- and post- delegation provisions (44) such as applicant review procedures over many months that include background screening and evaluation of financial capacity; the new Unified Rapid Suspension (URS) mechanism (45) to follow the assessment of a complaint; third-party objection upon legal rights (trademark rights) (46) among other grounds; and the sheer amount of application and renewal fees that are many thousand times higher than what a second-level domain name under the .com space typically costs. (47) To trademark owners, all of these provisions amount to a strong deterrent to disruptive conduct, which systematically and pre-emptively minimises room for future challenges against their rights. By implication, the existing UDRP can be argued to be largely redundant as far as new top-level domain names are concerned because room for acting in bad faith is systematically minimised. The UDRP, however, may still function for disputes over registrations of second-level domain names within a gTLD space depending on the regulations set forth by its registry.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Windows of registration and objection: Unlike other domain name spaces where registrants may apply for new domain names at any time, the gTLD programme closed registration applications on March 29, 2012. (48) Information on the applied-for gTLDs was kept secret until ICANN made it public on June 13, 2012, dubbed \"the Reveal Day.\" (49) The public then had until March 13, 2013 to lodge objections to the gTLD applications ICANN had received. (50) Many organisations saw the window of registration as a one-off opportunity to establish and execute their gTLD strategy, but had to engage in speculation since they had no visibility over their competitors' intent. The high cost of application (51) meant that some potential applicants chose to forgo gTLDs representing their trade and/or marks at the risk of other entities applying for them, as opposed to engaging in defensive registrations as would have been viable in traditional domain name spaces. To ICANN, on the other hand, such a closed, time-based scheme has resulted in a system that gives finite sets of registrations, objections, and issues to deal with.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Protection of strong trademark interests: It was envisaged that multiple eligible applicants would want the same gTLD that is made of a generic term, a trademark independently owned by more than one entity, or both. (52) In such cases, gTLD applicants will enter into an auction (53) where the highest bid, most likely from the applicant able to exhibit the strongest commitment to its trademark interests, would secure the gTLD in question. This not only contrasts with the \"first-come-first-served\" principle adopted by many name spaces in the current domain name system, but also transcends national borders thereby going against the elemental principle of territoriality stipulated in national trademark laws.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0ICANN Trademark Clearinghouse: In March 2013, ICANN officially launched a global repository of trademarks and other information pertaining to the rights of trademark holders throughout the world, dubbed Trademark Clearinghouse. (54) Through the facilitation of a \"sunrise\" period and alerts in advance, Trademark Clearinghouse provides trademark owners with centralised, pre-emptive measures to protect and claim their rights across all new gTLD spaces. (55) The legal ramifications of establishing a global Trademark Clearinghouse for the Internet constitute a profound challenge to the traditional system of trademark registrations; although Trademark Clearinghouse is a paid service where participation remains strictly optional, ICANN is nevertheless set to be in charge of a massive authoritative database with which it can use to make regulatory determinations. (56) Critics voice their concerns over the amount of discretionary power to be given to ICANN, a result of which may see its Trademark Clearinghouse ultimately substituting national trademark offices. (57)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0V. EARLY DEVELOPMENTS SINCE THE CLOSING OF GTLD APPLICATIONS\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In March 2013, ICANN released statistics from the first round of gTLD application submissions. The agency has begun to assess a total of 1,930 gTLD applications. (58) Applicants range from the biggest names on the Internet such as Google, Microsoft, and Amazon, to smaller enterprises and consortiums. Google in particular has applied for a total of 101 gTLDs, an endeavour that cost the company US $18.7 million in application fees alone. Google's gTLD applications include those associated with its own trademarks such as .google, .youtube, .gmail, and .android, as well as generic strings including .cloud, .search, .tech, .wow, .you, .book, .mba, and .lol. While many of these gTLDs are intended exclusively for Google's own use, the company plans to make a portion of its gTLDs open for the general public and, in some cases, qualified entities. (59) This means that once approved by ICANN, Google will invite other organisations and individuals to register, most likely for a fee, second-level domain names under each of its \"open\" gTLD spaces. It will consequently open up the possibility of the birth of new Internet domain names such as penguin.book and duke.mba.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Of the 1,930 gTLD applications, 731 conflict with at least one other applicant's requests, and the number of gTLDs that are sought by more than one applicant is 230. (60) For example, .app, .inc, and .online are contested by thirteen, eleven, and six different applicants, respectively. (61) It is expected that, upon initial evaluation, ICANN will determine the owner of each contested gTLD through an auction. It is possible that parties that are able to negotiate an alignment of interests will form alliances for greater bargaining power in the selection process as seen in the case of .online, where three competing domain name businesses have announced their plan to team up for a bid to form a jointly run .online registry. (62)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Some of the applications for gTLDs have been challenged on the grounds of legal rights objection in accordance with the provisions of the gTLD application process. As of March 2013, WIPO, the sole arbitrator for legal rights objections made against gTLD applications, received sixty-nine objections affecting more than thirty unique gTLDs, including .mail, .blue, .merck, .yellowpages, .gcc, .academy, .limited, .weibo, .delmonte, .direct, and .food (63) The objecting parties range from businesses with direct trademark interests such as Del Monte Corporation, to intergovernmental organisations such as The Gulf Corporation Council, to government agencies such as the United States Postal Service, to entities otherwise seeking to protect the purported associations between the top-level domain names in question and their own products and services. (64)\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The abovementioned objections on the grounds of legal rights are a subset of the 204 objections of all categories submitted to ICANN. (65) Objections that have been made on the grounds of public policy are tabled at the ICANN Governmental Advisory Committee (GAC), which gathers input from governments around the world and makes rulings in the form of advice to the ICANN Board. (66) One such GAC ruling was made against Amazon EU S.a r.l. over its applications for a .amazon gTLD and the equivalent internationalised domain names (IDNs) in Japanese and Chinese. (67) The GAC reached a consensus to block Amazon's .amazon and related applications after Brazil and other South American countries claimed the rights over geographic indications associated with the Amazon River. (68) As a result, Amazon, a business that currently trades under amazon.com and country-specific domain names such as amazon.co.uk, will not be able to use the ultimately short .amazon moniker. In its July 2013 meeting in Durban, the GAC also allowed the .date and .persiangulf gTLD applications to proceed, decided to defer decisions over .vin and .wine to a later meeting \"due to the complexity in the matter,\" reaffirmed that marks and abbreviations representing intergovernmental organisations (IGOs) should be protected from third-party registrations, and \"noted the concerns expressed by the Government of India\" not to proceed with the gTLD applications for .indians and .ram (69)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Amazon the global online retailer scored a victory, however, on another gTLD front involving less public policy. In July 2013, WIPO overruled the objection to Amazon's application for a .pin gTLD, lodged by Pinterest, Inc., a social networking service provider widely known for the concept of \"pinning\" items of interest to users' Web pages. In its legal rights objection panel determination, WIPO ruled that, among Internet users, retailers, and media commentators, the word PIN does not sufficiently give rise to secondary meaning to identify Pinterest, which has been in operation since 2010, as the source of its goods and services. Also taken into account was the fact that, of the sixty-three pending PIN trademark registration applications by Pinterest, only two were filed, in the European Union and Russia, before Amazon applied for the .pin gTLD. (70) In other words, sixty-one of the sixty-three PIN trademark registration applications were filed after Amazon's intention to secure .pin became public knowledge on the gTLD Reveal Day. Because Pinterest had not applied for a .pin gTLD itself and was supposedly unaware that Amazon was going to, the only action the company could take within the provisions of the gTLD programme was to invoke a legal rights objection to Amazon's application after the event. The .pin dispute highlights the speculative nature of the gTLD application process and also a heightened risk of having limited reactive measures against a third-party monopolisation on the most global, succinct manifestation of a company's trademark on the Internet.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Another notable development in the expansion of domain names is the yet- to-be-resolved dispute over .kosher, a gTLD application filed by Kosher Marketing Assets LLC and its parent company OK Kosher to \"promote awareness of the TLD through press releases and direct communications with the customers of OK Kosher Certification.\" (71) OK Kosher's sole application for .kosher is now challenged by five rival certifying organisations, including OU Kosher, Chicago Rabbinical Council, and the Kashruth Council of Canada, who claim that \"[OK Kosher] seeks to profit from a sacred tradition that should not be over-commercialised,\" in a market that is thought to amount to US $17 billion a year. (72) Meanwhile, ICANN statistics confirm that the gTLD application for .halal is also in dispute. (73) The crux of the matter in these disputes, however, is neither religious practices nor dietary preferences; it is that, when one operator secures a global monopoly, as allowed in the gTLD system, over a mark seemingly common to the trade, it is inevitably seen as a threat and stolen opportunity by others in the market. As pointed out above, gTLDs are an extra-legal system featuring a high entry barrier, one that remains strictly optional to everyone. However, as soon as one operator decides that the benefits of a gTLD generically representing its trade outweighs the cost of securing it, takes the trouble of applying for one, and manages to act within the registration window, any perceived equilibrium in the playing field is broken and an unprecedented competitive advantage is seemingly created. Moreover, in a non-compartmentalised world of gTLDs, reactive measures may prove to be just as costly, if not more, as applying for a gTLD in the first instance, regardless of the extent of one's entrenched trademark rights in individual territories.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Any gTLD developments from this point on are the results of, and reactions to, the 1,930 applications already submitted to ICANN; (74) there is currently no room for additional applications, offensive or defensive. Although ICANN hinted that there may eventually be a second round of gTLD applications, (75) the legal, political, and administrative overheads required for resolving the current conflicting interests appear to have closed the door for new entrants at least for the foreseeable future. Nevertheless, the effect of approved gTLDs, the number of which is expected to be many tens of times that of the current non-country- specific TLDs, is set to question and complicate the territorial recognition and enforcement of today's trademarks even more visibly than traditional domain names have.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0VI. CONCLUSION\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In principle, the system of new gTLDs offers provisions and safeguards designed to empower the rights-holders who are capable of and committed to maximising the exposure and goodwill of their marks. The extent of such measures is significantly greater than that of the UDRP provisions applicable to the current domain name system, which already favours trademark interests over domain name-only interests when the two are in conflict. Yet, legal avenues for dispute resolution over Internet domain names remain largely outside the control of national trademark laws, and such a reality is even more articulated under the system of gTLDs. As illustrated above, the actual treatment of generic strings and conflicting trademarks in a highly competitive global jurisdiction is inevitably fraught with rules, exceptions, and bodies of extra-legal authority beyond the reach of national trademark laws, international harmonisation, and even the traditional domain name system.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fundamentally, the core of the trademark vs. domain name debate, now even more acutely accentuated by the introduction of new gTLDs, lies in the territorial nature of intellectual property rights. Internet domain names inherently and incessantly demonstrate their nonconformity to trademark rights that are recognised and enforced upon the principles of territoriality and specificity in individual jurisdictions. What is increasingly observed is an inevitable breakdown between trademark rights as protected under different national laws, and the global exploitation of those rights on the Internet. (76) The global market that is the Internet has irreversibly perturbed the traditional trademark system, and raises the unavoidable question of whether a country's trademark law is actually applicable when a trademark is used on the Internet. (77) It is rather paradoxical that, as observed today, the continuing extra-legal endeavours on a global scale to enforce territorially exclusive rights onto an arena of a globally unique addressing scheme should come back to threaten the legal basis of the very rights these endeavours intend to uphold.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(1.)

(\"Does the use of the trade mark by the US company on its US website constitute infringement of the United Kingdom registered trade mark, and vice-versa? Claimants in this type of situation have argued that use of the trade mark on a website constitutes use of the trade mark throughout the world because the website can be accessed throughout the world. . . . At the other extreme, defendants argue that the trade mark is only being used in the country where the web server is situate. This argument may or may not be right, it depends on the circumstances. . . . Infringement in the United Kingdom requires use of the sign in the course of trade in relation to goods or services in the United Kingdom. So the use on the US or any foreign website constitute use in the course of trade in the United Kingdom before it can amount to infringement of a United Kingdom registered trade mark or, for that matter, passing off in the United Kingdom. . . . One needs to ask whether the defendant has any trade here, customers buying goods or services for consumption here. Of course, infringement does not require the defendant to have an established trade in the United Kingdom, the only requirement is for use in the course of trade.\").\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(28.)

Even if they can intercept a message, the content remains a mystery.</p><p>'There are 200-plus social media companies. Some of these companies build their business model around end-to-end encryption,' Steinbach said. And that, he said, is what terror groups count on.</p><p>Following the congressional fight over the USA Freedom Act and federal access to cellphone metadata, the debate has switched to encryption, covered by other laws and regulations.</p><p>The FBI's push to amend federal law to give federal officials the keys to social media companies' encryption systems comes as the tech industry has stepped up its lobbying against such measures. Just last month, a coalition of advocacy groups, companies and trade organizations wrote a letter to <person><nameText>President Obama </nameText></person>warning him that the FBI's request would weaken cybersecurity and privacy rights.</p><p>'The administration faces a critical choice: will it adopt policies that foster a global digital ecosystem that is more secure, or less?' stated the letter, signed by groups including the ACLU, Apple and Facebook.</p><p>So far, Obama has hedged. At a cybersecurity summit earlier this year, he called for a 'pubic conversation' on the issue.</p><p>While he acknowledged at the summit that 'the first time that attack takes place in which it turns out that we had a lead and we couldn't follow up on it, the public's going to demand answers,' in an interview later for the website Re/code, Obama said he leans 'further in the direction of strong encryption than some do inside of law enforcement.'</p><p>But while recent homegrown plots in Boston and Texas were averted, the threat of more will only intensify the debate as lawmakers feel pressure to stay a step ahead of other lone wolves before they strike at police.</p><p>'We're doing a good job swatting mosquitos,' said U.S. Rep.

Plus, big tech companies like Facebook and Tesla just releasing earnings after the bell. Also those Russia-back Facebook ads have just been released, and they look like they support Bernie Sanders. We're going to go through them for you.</p><p>Retired lieutenant General Tom McInerney, Americans for Tax Reform's Grover Norquist, Muslim Reform Movement Asra Nomani, and former FBI counterterrorism task force member Steve Roger is here all here all speaking out tonight.</p><p>And welcome, to Risk &amp; Reward. I'm Cheryl Casone.</p><p>Well, the market shaken up, our latest terror attack in the city. The Dow, the S&amp;P, and the NASDAQ, hitting intraday all-time highs today. Tech heavyweights Apple, Facebook, and Alibaba hitting record highs as well, driving the NASDAQ higher.</p><p>U.S. companies reporting they've added most workers in seven months, consumer confidence also hitting its highest level since December of 2000.</p><p>And this just in, the breaking news, the president reportedly is going to tap Federal Reserve Governor Jerome Powell to be the next chairman of the Federal Reserve.

We want people that are going to help our country, we want people that are going to keep our country safe. We don't want lotteries.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE: <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>starting the process of ending the program that the suspect allegedly use to legally enter the U.S. that use lottery toward visa instead of judging people on their merit.</p><p>Here with the latest on the terror attack, our own Connell McShane, he's joining us now from the scene. A very busy day down there today, Connell. Hello.</p><p>CONNELL MCSHANE, CORRESPONDENT, FOX BUSINESS: It is indeed, Cheryl. And we've just learned some new information in the last few minute from Justice Department officials to tell us that the suspected terrorist in yesterday's attack, Sayfullo Saipov will be making a court appearance and will be making that court appearance tonight. That's important for a couple of reasons which we'll get into a moment.</p><p>But first to the investigation happening here in New York and across the river in New Jersey, the newest video shots just moments ago, it shows the vehicle that was used in this attack that killed eight being driven away from the scene, it had been here throughout the day.</p><p>But in video you see it under the tarp. The New York City Police Department vehicle being driven away. Earlier today our cameras caught that vehicle on West Street, it was still there. The white Home Depot-rented flatbed truck with both doors at the time still open, you can see the damage that was done when it collided with a school bus that ended this attack.</p><p>Two adults and two children injured in that particular collision, eight killed overall. And a police officer came out and shot that suspected terrorist. Now only that he survived, but as he say he will be appear in in court.</p><p>We also learned some about his planning from New York City officials. Listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOHN MILLER, DEPUTY COMMISSIONER, NEW YORK POLICE DEPARTMENT: Based on the investigation overnight, it appears that Mr. Saipov had been planning this for a number of weeks, he did this in the name of ISIS. And along with the other items recovered at the scene was some notes that further indicate that.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes, notes that were written in Arabic, and certainly left clear indications that this was a terrorist attack inspired by ISIS, officials say. They have taken their investigation over to Paterson, New Jersey, as well where this man most recently lived and he's thought to have attended a mosque in that area, it's not very far from where he lived that he rented that truck yesterday.</p><p>At about an hour or later he was here in Lower Manhattan carrying out this attack.</p><p>Now, Cheryl, to get back to where we started here, we've learned in the last few minutes that he'll make a court appearance tonight. As I said that is important for a couple of different reasons. Number one, I guess it speaks to his wellbeing to some degree, we were told he underwent what is described to us as minor surgery after being shot by that police officer.</p><p>So, from this official that we spoke to at the court house, apparently he's well enough to be in court, but it also tells us more importantly that he will go through the civilian criminal justice system, rather than being sent as some speculated to Guantanamo Bay. That will not happen if he appears in court as expected to tonight.</p><p>So, with that, back to you.</p><p>CASONE: Not an enemy combatant. Connell, that's very interesting. And also we're learning that there is going to be a press conference from the southern district of New York, the United States Attorney General, so we hopefully get some more details about the charges and exactly what they're going to look like.</p><p>Connell McShane, thank you for that live report on the scene. A busy day, of course down in Lower Manhattan.</p><p>Well, for more on the New York terror suspect entering U.S., under the diversity visa program that <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>wants to end since it allows people it's based on a lottery, instead of merit.</p><p>Well, former Trump foreign policy adviser Sebastian Gorka tell Fox Newsthat political correctness it going to get us killed. Take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEBASTIAN GORKA, FORMER TRUMP FOREIGN POLICY ADVISOR: Look at Australia, look at New Zealand, they have incredibly stringent immigration requirements, it's based upon education, it's based upon skill set, there's a whole slew of yardsticks you have to meet. And if don't meet them you don't get to come in, you don't play bingo and give the guy a green card, political correctness can get people killed.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE: All right. Former Air Force assistant vice chief of staff retired lieutenant general Tom McInerney joins me now. General, it's good to have you here.</p><p>THOMAS MCINERNEY, RETIRED UNITED STATES AIR FORCE: Thanks for having me, Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE: You know, Congress has tried to end the diversity visa lottery program five times since 2007. Do you agree with the president, do you think that program is dangerous, and should be at least reevaluated?</p><p>MCINERNEY: Absolutely, Cheryl. There is no reason why we need a diversity visa program. This is an example of what's happened, and how many other potential terrorist have we brought in with this program if you look at the nations there. We don't need that kind of diversity.</p><p>And so, I think it's extremely important that the president get rid of this program. Even if it's by an executive order if in fact he could do that. But we need to get rid of it as quickly as possible.</p><p>CASONE: Well, if that is possible I guess will be the next kind of shoe to drop on this. But you know, this suspect applied for that program back in 2008, he was granted a diverse visa two years later.</p><p>I mean, this though, we should point out to be clear is the fourth assailant from Uzbekistan to launch an attack in less a year, that's according to several reports. I mean, retired CIA officer Gary Berntsen told Fox the country is well-known terrorist hotbed and we let him in. Listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GARY BERNTSEN, FORMER CIA OFFICER: Uzbekistan in particular, has a history of Jihadism. There is an organization that was founded years ago called the IMU, the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan. There is a place in Uzbekistan called the Ferghana Valley where Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan and I think Kazakhstan all meet together. Excuse me, Kazakhstan all meet together.</p><p>But that is a group of bandit terrorists they were married to Taliban, we fought them before, a lot of these people have been inside Afghanistan. And the fact that we would have a diversity program open to allow people to come in is just, it's insane.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE: And especially from Uzbekistan. That is the point here. According to the international crisis group between 2,000 and 4,000 militants from Central Asia may have signed up for ISIS. And Uzbek nationals or ethnic Uzbeks from neighboring states make up the largest single group of ISIS supporters among Central Asians. I mean, should there be more protections more monitoring of this country?</p><p>MCINERNEY: Absolutely, Cheryl. I mean, it's insane what we are doing for diversity. The fact is this, when you listen to Governor Cuomo and the mayor, they do not understand what they talk about lone wolves. There is no such thing as a lone wolf.</p><p>They are soldiers of Allah. They are soldiers of Islam, they are always connected to it in the ideology. People who talk about lone wolves are really do not understand what the ideology we are facing. And it's extremely important that we do that and incumbent upon us to put the responsibility back on the Muslims to fix this. Infidels can't fix this ideology problem.</p><p>CASONE: Yes. That lone wolf statement from Governor Cuomo last night has really been hotly debated today. And we're going to talk about that later on in the show.</p><p>General, thank you for being here tonight. I really appreciate your perspective on all of this.</p><p>MCINERNEY: Thanks, Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE: Well, House republicans postponing the roll out of their tax reform bill too tomorrow. It was supposed to be this morning remember, saying that they need to finalize a few key details.</p><p><person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>talking about the much anticipated release. Watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: The House is doing very well. They've taken an extra few hours, which will go in tomorrow, I think tomorrow and they'll be announcing and I'll probably be standing with them, we're leaving as you know, Asia. We're leaving on Friday morning, so I'll be standing with them, sometime tomorrow. We'll be announcing massive tax cuts and reform.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE: Like the president is suggesting calling the tax bill the cut, cut act, no word on whether that's going to be accepted by the Hill, maybe becoming a special name.</p><p>But the president reportedly tapping Federal Reserve Governor Jerome Powell as the next Fed chairman, that is the breaking news.</p><p>Grover Norquist, Americans for Tax Reform president is with me now. And I want to start with that one. Well, OK, let's put Jerome on the sideline because we kind of expected that. But as far as taxes tomorrow, I mean, what do you make of this whole one day delay? We're going to work on the details. Haven't they had seven years to work on the details, Grover?</p><p>GROVER NORQUIST, PRESIDENT, AMERICANS FOR TAX REFORM: Well, they've got a very nice outline which is extremely helpful, they are staying within it. What you are doing now is kind of negotiation and coming to an agreement that otherwise might be happening at the committee level or on floor of the House or on a joint Senate house conference.</p><p>The fact that they are doing it now, as they did with the budget, remember that that budget could have taken three weeks, instead they sat down, they worked it out. The Senate accepted the House amendments; the House accepted the Senate bill, boom, done in two days. Very impressive, save this two and a half, maybe three weeks on the agenda.</p><p>So, to take the day now and negotiate some of the two or three things that are being worked on rather than doing that over a couple of weeks I think it's a good use of time. And it's helpful.</p><p>CASONE: Grover, I just have to say really quick that there are so many, you know, bones of contention, if you will, on this thing from the state and local deduction to what's happening with the estate tax, leaving that 39.6 percent top tier rate on this hiring Americans.</p><p>I mean, there just seems -- it seems to me again, they were coming out and seeing more divisive pieces of tax reform. And doesn't that put getting this thing through in jeopardy, aka, healthcare.</p><p>NORQUIST: OK. No, because the things that used to be divisive are now all agreed to. The idea of a 20 percent corporate rate, originally the House was at 25, Trump came in said 15, this is a year ago, a year and a quarter ago. And the House moved down to 20. And Trump came up from 15. They agreed on 20.</p><p>You got full and immediate business expensing, but it's difficult to do it permanently, so do you it for five years.</p><p>CASONE: Right.</p><p>NORQUIST: These are now settled questions, we're debating other much smaller questions than those right there. So, I think that's progress. We do need to get all the stuff down, no reason to wait till December.</p><p>CASONE: OK. Grover, really quick. I 've got five seconds. Jerome Powell, do you like the pick.</p><p>NORQUIST: Yes, good pick.</p><p>CASONE: I figured that much. Question is over. Grover...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>NORQUIST: Can we call him Jerry, though.</p><p>CASONE: All right. Well, maybe. I don't know if we're allowed to do that. We'll see. Grover Norquist, thanks, Grover. It's good to have you on.</p><p>NORQUIST: You got it.</p><p>CASONE: All right. Well, social media company Facebook just coming out with earnings after the bell, they did beat on revenue by, yes, a billion dollars. Take a look, the stock is trading up slightly after hours. Definitely a stock to watch tomorrow.</p><p>Well, yes, the White House has notified Federal Reserve Governor Jerome J. Powell, I'm not calling him Jerry, Grover. That <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>intends to nominate him as the next chairman of the Central Bank.</p><p>Adam Shapiro is here with the latest. All right. So, Grover likes him, Adam.</p><p>ADAM SHAPIRO, CORRESPONDENT, FOX NEWS: Well, the president likes it, that's what matters. And Congress most likely will like it as well. Because look, this is a man who is a lifelong republican, who worked at the Treasury Department from roughly 1990 to 93, he was undersecretary at treasury and investigating domestic finance.</p><p>You might remember Solomon brothers, he was involved in some investigation of Solomon brothers, as well an investigation of what was this, yes, Solomon. But he also went to bankers trust, he worked for the Carlyle Group at one point, and then he comes back into you might say the government when Barack Obama the president, the democrat nominated him to join the board of governors, he took office with the Federal Reserve in 2012.</p><p>So we actually spoke with Governor Powell back at Jackson hall in August about the potential that he might become the next Fed chair. I think we have the sound bite ready in which he responded to what would you do if the president called you. And here's what he said.</p><p>We don't have the sound bite ready, but what he essentially said is that \"This is a job that requires deep knowledge of Federal Reserve operations, I think it helps to have knowledge of the economic issues that we face.\"</p><p>Now he does understand the economic issues, some people say he is kind of neutral on, for instance, Dodd-Frank regulation, but says we can do that more efficiently. He wrote a paper and deliver a speech about six months ago, calling for Congress to reform Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, he says that issue has not been resolved.</p><p>Some people refer to him somewhat as a dove. He's probably more neutral when it comes to monetary policy, expect more of the same, but perhaps with a few more papers from Governor Powell.</p><p>CASONE: It seems like a safer pick. I think that's kind of how many characterize him, which is OK. I mean, we don't need controversy at the Fed. That's for sure.</p><p>SHAPIRO: Well, he has real world experience, again, he was at Carlyle Group, he was I think at Bankers Trust at one point. But the other issue that this doesn't get a talk a lot about. But back during the financial cliff several years ago, he was actually, he wasn't in government service at that point, remember he's been in treasury.</p><p>He was going up to Capitol Hill talking to different lawmaker about why that would be a horrible thing to allow the United States to miss its debt payment.</p><p>CASONE: Interesting.</p><p>SHAPIRO: So this is not only a man who has real world experience in finance, the politics as well.</p><p>CASONE: And you know him, Adam Shapiro, live in Washington. Adam, thank you.</p><p>All right. Well, OK, those Russia-funded Facebook ads that have been released by the House intelligence committee, they seem to back Bernie Sanders. What is up with that? We're going to show those to you. We just got them a little bit later in the show.</p><p>But first this, more details coming out about the New York City terrorist as the FBI is now seeking information on a second person in relation to the New York attack, details next.</p><p>CASONE: All right. Electric carmaker Tesla reporting earnings just moments ago, shocking investors with a bigger loss than expected. Now they are slashing production of the model X and the model S, that's not really good. Shares is falling about 3 percent, it's falling another 3 percent after the bell so it's definitely a stock to watch tomorrow morning when trading opens up once again.</p><p>Also getting breaking new. Just in, the FBI we're just being told are seeking a second person Mukhammadzoir Kadirov in relation to the attack in New York City yesterday.</p><p>And here is what we know right now. They are describing this person, brown eyes, a white male, born November 5, 1984. He's about 39 years old and he's from Uzbekistan. Remember, the suspect, the current suspect also is from Uzbekistan. The second individual that they are looking for right now also from Uzbekistan.</p><p>If you see this person if you recognize this person, you are told to contact the FBI right away especially if you are in the New York area.</p><p>I wanted to get that breaking news, they are seeking a second person in connection with the terror attack in New York City yesterday.</p><p>Now all of this is happening as <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>wants to step up extreme vetting. But New York democratic Congressman Jerrold Nadler says there is no way that the U.S. can improve this process. Listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JERROLD NADLER, (D) UNITED STATES REPRESENTATIVE: No amount of extreme vetting is going to stop that, the president is usually as usual, went off halfcocked out without for the facts. If you're talking about a refugee, someone is going to come here, they get extreme vetting. It takes about two years to go through the vetting process in which the American intelligence agencies (Inaudible) are looking at people. I don't know how you could improve that.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE: All right. But retired lieutenant Colonel Tony Shaffer said our vetting is not good enough.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TONY SHAFFER, FORMER CIA INTELLIGENCE OFFICER: We didn't vet the guy beforehand, Brian, I mean, his name himself is sword of Allah, that's the clue. The sword of Allah, so that's not like Joe, and I think that was a clue to where he came from.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE: All right. Joining me now, the author of \"Standing Alone: An American Woman Struggle for the Soul of Islam\" and co-author of the Muslim Reform Movement, Asra Nomani. Asra, it's great to have you here, so much to discuss with this.</p><p>You know, a lot of liberal are arguing that extreme vetting it's just not going to help. Attackers are radicalized after they're admitted into the United States. What do you say?</p><p>ASRA NOMANI, CO-FOUNDER, MUSLIM REFORM MOVEMENT: Well, I do believe that we need to do more vetting, we have to do vetting not only of human beings but we have to do vetting of the ideas that are crossing into America's borders.</p><p>The real issue that concerns me as a liberal is that too many people on the left, and inside of our Democratic Party are refusing to acknowledge the ideological problem that is the underlying issue behind this Manhattan attack.</p><p>We had unfortunately this afternoon the former journalist and interviewer of Osama Bin Laden stepping forward to speak for the NYPD. And saying that this attack had nothing to do with Islam. We have Muslim activists who are trying to claim that you are Islamophobic if you talk about Islamic extremism.</p><p>The real issue is that we're not vetting our ideas, and we're not saying Islamic supremacy and Islamic radicalism are not OK in this world, and that's the heart of what we need to tackle as a country. And unfortunately, what I see on that part is a lot of cowardice.</p><p>CASONE: Well, and it means being politically incorrect, which is something that the country, I mean, we've gone the opposite direct, especially under the previous administration.</p><p>So, what about the vetting process, if they do enhance vetting, if they really step this up as <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>has discussed, do you think that that would help stop these ISIS-inspired attacks in United States.</p><p>NOMANI: I don't think they will stop it honestly, because these ideas are crossing borders that are porous. We have to have increased vetting because we are in fact not doing enough to stop radicalization from coming in to this country.</p><p>And the idea that we can top through human being this threat is one that we shouldn't be naive about. We have to continue to put pressure on governments like Saudi Arabia and Qatar so that they shut down the mosques and the propaganda channels that are putting out the kind of ideology that makes a man think that it's Islamic and legal and religious to then plow people on the streets of Manhattan and then declare allahu akbar. God is great.</p><p>CASONE: Yes. It's amazing, still I think kind of surreal what happened yesterday here in New York.</p><p>And I do want to switch gears. So Fox is reporting that mosque that the terrorist attended was on MYPD watch list for years. Listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROB SCHMITT, ANCHOR, FOX NEWS: The Mosque right behind me here, the Omar mosque we're actually outside of Sayfullo Saipov's mosque and also his residents because he lived right behind this mosque right back over here. The Omar mosque right behind me, has been on the NYPD's radar even though we're in New Jersey, been on the New York City Police Department's radar since 2005. They've been keeping an eye on this mosque.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE: What do you make of that? That they've been watching that mosque for years.</p><p>NOMANI: You know, it's really tragic to me. I came to this country as a 4- year-old, and I moved, I first lived in New Jersey. That's where my father was sending Rutgers University. My father fought so that Saudi influence would not come to mosque here in America. But we have been penetrated by dangerous ideologies.</p><p>CASONE: Yes.</p><p>NOMANI: And it only took me two seconds looking at the Facebook page of that mosque to know that it is intolerant.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CASONE: It is so frightening. Asra, it's so frightening. Thank you so much for being here tonight, so much more to talk with you. We will be right back.</p><p>CASONE: OK. Breaking news, we want to let you know you're looking right now at live pictures here in New York, a press conference is about to begin to announce federal terrorism charges against Sayfullo Saipov, related to yesterday's deadly attack in lower Manhattan.</p><p>We are monitoring the podium right now. We are expecting to see Joon Kim, acting United States Attorney for southern district of New York, as well as William Sweeney, the assistant director in-charge and James O'Neill. We are told is going to be there as well.</p><p>Of course he is the police commissioner of the city of New York. So we expect to see all of them out there in just the next few moments. We will take you there live when that press conference starts, and actually, here we go. They are coming out right once again, I believe this is, if we're going to start with -- let's listen in.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Everybody ready?</p><p>RYAN NASH, POLICE OFFICER, NYPD: Hello, thank you for coming. I am Officer Ryan Nash. I appreciate the public recognition of the actions of myself and my fellow officers yesterday, although I feel that we were just doing our job like thousands of officers do every day, I understand the importance of yesterday's events.</p><p>And role we played, and I am grateful for the recognition we have received. I just want to thank my family and friends for their support and all the responding officers who assisted me. However, due to the nature of the pending criminal case, I cannot make any further public statements about the incident at this time, thank you.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Thank you, guys.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE: OK, so that was interesting, that was Ryan Nash. That is the NYPD, the hero officer. He has been called today here in New York City, that actually was the first person to come upon the suspect here in New York.</p><p>Ryan Nash coming out and saying he couldn't say much more but just really being appreciative of the fact that there has been such an outpouring of him and again, he has been called a hero. He is the one that first apprehended and shot the suspect here in New York.</p><p>So again, we weren't exactly sure how that was going to go down but we are again waiting for that press conference, but we had guidance that it's going to start in next 10 minutes or so. When the full press conference starts with FBI, with the police commissioner, and with the United States district attorney of New York, we are going to take you back.</p><p>We're going to get the formal charges, but again, these aren't going to be criminal charges. Many had wanted these charges to be basically federal terrorism charges, these are going to be criminal terrorism charges, and there is a difference here and how -- he going to go through the criminal court system basically.</p><p>All right, while we're waiting for that press conference to begin, moving on to some other things that we've been following for you, in this story, the White House saying today that it considers the New York terrorist is enemy combatant, OK?</p><p>That's why we're just talking about what the charges and how they are different. <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>said, basically, that he would like to see this prisoner, basically, this attacker, go to Guantanamo Bay. That is military detention center there in Cuba while he awaits trial. Well, Senator Lindsey Graham agreed with that, saying that terrorist doesn't deserve U.S. criminal protection. Listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R), SOUTH CAROLINA: The last thing I want this guy to hear tonight, is you have the right to a lawyer, the last thing he should hear is his Miranda rights, I have been a military lawyer for 33 years.</p><p>There is enough evidence to believe that he qualifies as an enemy combatant on the law of law. He can be held by intelligence community, as long as necessary to find out, did he act alone and was he part of a bigger plot.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE: OK, I wanted to follow-up with that sound bite. Obviously there is a lot of talk about the types of charges and where this court -- this trial is going to be held, all of that we're waiting to get more details. We're waiting on that breaking news. We're going to take a quick commercial break, Risk and Reward will be right back, stay with us.</p><p>CASONE: We continue to follow the story of the terror attack here in New York City yesterday. Right now, I'm going to bring in the man who interrogated 9/11 mastermind, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed. And his interrogation author James Mitchell. James, it's great to have you here. There are so many questions about this seems to be handled by authorities.</p><p>JAMES MITCHELL, FORMER MEMBER, UNITED STATES AIR FORCE: OK, do you have one?</p><p>CASONE: Yes, I do have a question. The NYPD referred to Sayfullo Saipov as a criminal, but the White House thinks that he should be considered as enemy combatant. I'm curious what you think about that.</p><p>MITCHELL: I think he should be considered an illegal enemy combatant, not an enemy combatant. An illegal enemy combatant is a person who doesn't fight a standing army, doesn't wear a uniform and breaks the international laws of war.</p><p>And under those circumstances, are not subject to the Geneva Convention, unless we decide that he is. So I would -- I would echo what <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>said, and I think what Senator Graham said, we should be interested in interrogating that guy to find out, since we know that he is not there by himself.</p><p>And that he came here probably already radicalized and then honed it while here, he brought those bad ideas with him, we should figure out who he brought with him because he had a chain of people that he allowed -- they allowed him to bring to United States.</p><p>We should figure out which of those folks are radicalized. We should figure out what his network is, who has been providing support, who he got radicalized and we should treat him like an enemy combatant.</p><p>CASONE: Well, but this look like that, really going to happen here. This is going to go -- I mean, we're waiting on this press conference by the United States attorney general and police commissioner. It looks like he is going through the regular court system, that means a lawyer, James. I mean, that's what were looking at here. Do you think this is the right...</p><p>MITCHELL: Well, he is probable -- well, he is probably already been Mirandized, right? Because he was arrest a New York cop. So when he was arrested, they undoubtedly read him his rights as if he was an American citizen and he undoubtedly, unless he has judge confident to be able to wave his right to an attorney.</p><p>He's undoubtedly already been appointed an attorney, either from one of many groups who apologize for these guys in pro bono represent them or from a lawyer that's paid for by taxpayer, paid for about the very people he is trying to kill.</p><p>CASONE: I'll tell you what, former congressman and fox contributor Jason Chaffetz thinks that we need to go further with this guy. I want you to listen to what he said.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JASON CHAFFETZ, FOX CONTRIBUTOR: Come to United States is a privilege. But, how do you do it and I see a mug shot. Now if you are come here to this country, and you've got an arrest record, you shouldn't get not get in, if you are here and you get arrested, and you just kick him out, that is a privilege to be here. We don't need people like that here and you should get rid of his family -- his entire family should be deported.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE: The family, James, what do you -- what do you make of that?</p><p>MITCHELL: Well, it depends on whether they are U.S. citizens or not and it depends on whether or not they were, you know, aiding and abetting his crime. I think it would be a useful tool to have if the family actually deserved to be treated that way.</p><p>But if they are innocent and they don't, I think it's a little bit draconian, but it would be nice to have that because here is the -- here is the problem, and this, I don't know his wife, I don't know who she is.</p><p>She may be neurosurgeon or a rocket scientist I don't know but odds are pretty good -- the odds are pretty good that she is not. And the odds are pretty good that she is going to be on our welfare system. So again, the very people he is trying to kill are going to end up supporting him.</p><p>CASONE: Well -- and there are children involved, too. So it's -- it's going to be...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MITCHELL: Absolutely, those children are already United States Citizens.</p><p>CASONE: Yes, James, thank you very much. We really appreciate having you here tonight on this.</p><p>MITCHELL: All right, thank you so much for having me.</p><p>CASONE: All right, James Mitchell. Well, we're going to take a quick break, when we come back, again, we're waiting to hear official the charges against the suspect in the New York City terror attacks. You are watching Risk and Reward, stay with us.</p><p>CASONE: Once again, I want to show you these live pictures. We're waiting right now on a press conference. It's about to begin, they are going to announce -- we are told, federal terrorism charges against Sayfullo Saipov related to yesterday's deadly attack in lower Manhattan, killing eight, injuring 12. I want to bring in right now as we await for this to get under way, former FBI counterterrorism task force member, Steve Rogers, a good friend to the program.</p><p>Steve, you know, this -- there was so much back and forth today politically about how he should be charged. <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>said, sent him in Guantanamo Bay but this is going to be a -- he's going to be a federal criminal case basically, he is getting a lawyer. He may already be zipping his lip. What do you make on all of these?</p><p>STEVE ROGERS, FORMER MEMBER FBI COUNTERTERRORISM TASK FORCE: And that's the tragedy of what we're dealing with. You know, Cheryl, we're at war, and until the government and I am talking about whether we have Congress or whatever realized is that we're at war, we're going to continue to see this terrorist go down this road of being prosecuted as criminals and not enemy combatants.</p><p>So when you are at war, and you've got the enemy radicalizing their warriors here in this country, or if they are coming for overseas, they are enemy combatants. So he should be tried in a military court.</p><p>CASONE: But obviously that is not going to happen. I guess the point being though and -- tell you what, a few moments ago, we thought that press conference was going to start, Ryan Nash, the hero police officer from the NYPD came out to say thank you for outpouring of support.</p><p>I am so glad we had that moment, because he was the there and obviously saved lives. I mean, it was amazing what he shot him right away, and the suspect lived.</p><p>ROGERS: You know what a way to humanize our police officers, you know, we hear so many negative things but here is a young man who really, really served his country, let alone the city well, and God bless him and all of the law enforcement officers who have to protect and serve us.</p><p>CASONE: Yes, so he came on and he spoke but obviously now we move to next phase of this. This is going to be a very long drawn out process, the suspect is from Uzbekistan, not is not a citizen of the United State. He has family here. There is a lot that we don't know.</p><p>But we do know that he attend a mosque in New Jersey that had been on NYPD watch list for years. That is somewhat troubling. We do know -- we heard from the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee yesterday on Bret Baier show last night actually.</p><p>That they had a picture that came out in August as somebody taking a picture of that exact walkway in that exact spot among the bike path on West Side with an ISIS flag in the picture, this was planned, he planned this, we've been told this already, this information leaking out to Fox Newsahead of these charges.</p><p>ROGERS: Well you know, there are questions asked if he was on law enforcement radar, what happened? And I can tell you this, the FBI and law enforcement agencies, they are doing the best they could with what they have, and unfortunately, we don't have the human intelligence assets we use to have.</p><p>Those are boots on the ground, eyes on suspect, we are great at electronic intercepts, so I know the Trump administration is moving toward brining for example, community policing back in, so cops know, who, what, when, where and why in their neighborhoods, at the same time, more money will be put into counterterrorism, putting boots on ground to follow people.</p><p>That is how we brought the old mob down. We have organized crime then yet, cops in the cars, physically surveying people. You're going to see that come back. It is interesting from high-tech back to low tech.</p><p>CASONE: Yes, but at the same time, you have to think -- I mean this is New York City. This is the worst terror attack that we've seen in New York since 9/11. It is troubling that we are still vulnerable.</p><p>But to Mayor de Blasio's point, to Governor Cuomo's point, we can't be held hostage by terrorists, whether its ISIS inspired or lone wolf or whatever you want to call it, that's being debated. We can't be held hostage as New Yorkers, and those are Americans. They hate our way of life. They want us to suffer, and this is maybe just our new reality.</p><p>ROGERS: Well you know what, we're not being held hostage because we're still moving on. The World Series is on, the football game is on, everything that we live by is moving on, but what we can do, situational awareness is something that we need to talk about down the road, you talked about guy with the flag, somebody took a picture. If you see something, say something and so many times people say, I don't want to bother the police, bother the police.</p><p>CASONE: There are plenty of them around especially in this city. Steve, I want you to stay with me, we continue to monitor of course those live picture, we're waiting the official federal charges to be announced against the suspect in the terror attack here in New York City. We're taking a quick commercial break, stay with us, we'll be right back with that.</p><p>CASONE: Once again, I want to let you know, press conference about to begin to announce federal terrorism changes against Sayfullo Saipov, related to yesterday's deadly attack here in lower Manhattan. We're going to -- we expecting to see Joon Kim, the acting United States Attorney for southern district as well as William Sweeney. He is from the FBI, and James O'Neill, the New York Police commissioner.</p><p>You may have seen him yesterday, when he was there standing, of course they are giving us those first early details in that press confront held with Mayor Bill de Blasio and also with New York Governor Andrew Cuomo. They are testing the microphone, we're told this is going to start at any moment, I've got Steve Rogers with me as we wait.</p><p>And in break, Steve, we were talking about the fact that being here in city yesterday as we were, you almost wonder if we're desensitized to things like this, and if that is a dangerous thing. I have my friends worried about where am I going to take my kids trick or treating, not are we safe in this city.</p><p>ROGERS: It's very dangerous and we are so inundated with violence, T.V., radio, news script or you hear about it, even these new movies come out, all violence, and that's all we're being fed, and now a real, true, real life violent act happens, are we desensitized. We have to be very careful to not fall asleep and to know what's going on around us.</p><p>CASONE: You know, obviously, the general manner are there. They are kind of starting to assemble and we will take this, until they start talking but certainly again, the big -- actually here we go, this is Joon Kim, he is the acting U.S. attorney for southern district of New York. Let's listen in.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JOON KIM, ACTING U.S. ATTORNEY, SOUTHERN DISTRICT, NEW YORK: Good evening. My name is Joon Kim. I am the acting United States Attorney for southern district of New York. Yesterday afternoon, a man consumed by hate and a twisted ideology attacked our country and our city.</p><p>Using a rented home depot truck as his weapon of terror the man sped down West Side Highway, and then intentionally plowed his truck into a pedestrian walkway and bicycle path, hitting and running over people who were simply trying to enjoy a sunny afternoon in New York City.</p><p>He killed eight innocent human beings and injured at least a dozen other people. That man has alleged in a complaint filed today was Sayfullo Saipov. Today, thanks to the incredible work of the FBI, the NYPD, Joint Terrorism Tasks Force, and law enforce in the city and around the country, just about 24 hours after Sayfullo Saipov attack, we have him charged with federal crimes of terrorism.</p><p>The complaint filed today, charges Saipov with two counts, first, material support of a terrorist organization, that being ISIS and second, a federal charge of violence and destruction of a motor vehicle with willful disregard for the safety of human life that resulted in multiple deaths.</p><p>At the complaint alleges, after speeding through the walkway and bicycle paths, run over and killing people, Saipov crashed his truck into a school bus, carrying children. The he got out, yelled, Allah Akbar, meaning, God is great, brandishing two weapons, which turned out to be a paintball gun and a pellet gun. He was ultimately stopped by a brave police officer, Ryan Nash, who confronted him and shot him in the abdomen.</p><p>In the short time since this attack as alleged in the complain, we have developed evidence establishing that Saipov committed this attack in support of ISIS. That evidence is laid out in the complaint, but it includes the following. A note that was recovered just outside the truck, that read in part, no God, but God, and Mohammed is his prophet, and Islamic supplication, it will endure.</p><p>A phrase commonly used to refer to ISIS. Also, a search of cell phones found in a bag that he was carrying, a search conducted pursue to court authorize wiretaps, revealed thousands of ISIS related images, and 90 videos -- about 90 videos, depicting among other things, ISIS fighters, killing prisoners by running over them with a tank, beheading them, and shooting them in the face.</p><p>In Mirandized interview statements with law enforcement last night and today, Saipov allegedly admitted that he was inspired to commit the attack by the ISIS videos he watched and had been planning this attack for two months. He also admitted that he had rented a truck on October 22nd, in practice -- to practice the turns he would make on his Halloween day attack.</p><p>As I mentioned, it is incredible investigative work that had allowed us to bring the changes so soon after the attacks. I want to thank all law enforcement and citizens who responded to this attack in the way New Yorkers do. In particular, I want to thank Officer Ryan Nash, for his selfless bravery.</p><p>I want to thank the FBI represented here today by Bill Sweeney, assistant director in-charge of the New York field office. Their work in this case, as in all terrorism matters that we've worked with them on has been extraordinary. I also want to thank the NYPD, represented here today by first deputy commissioner Benjamin Tucker, and deputy Commissioner John Miller.</p><p>Their leadership and that of Commissioner O'Neill, over the greatest police force in the world has helped keep our city safe, and in the wake of yesterday's attacks, the NYPD has kept our citizens reassured and continuing to live our lives. Finally, I want to thank the terrorism prosecutors and investigators in my office who jumped on this immediately and haven't gotten any sleep since.</p><p>(Inaudible) who are all -- were not here because they are in court at the presentment. And investigators Kevin Song (ph) and George Corey (ph), as well as the supervisors of our Terrorism International Unit who are here with me, John Buckley and (Inaudible).</p><p>To folks in that unit working with the FBI, the NYPD, the JTTF, having a long and unblemished track record of successfully investigating and prosecuting domestic and international terrorists, whether it's the Chelsea bomber, just convicted a few weeks ago on all counts and who will be serving life -- mandatory life in prison.</p><p>Or the other terrorists convicted in our courthouse, just down the street in the last few years alone. That list includes the recent convictions by this office at the trial of Suleiman Abu Ghaith, Osama bin Laden's son-in- law.</p><p>Abu Hamza, the United Kingdom-based radical cleric. (Inaudible), the homegrown ISIS supporter and khalid al-Fawwaz, one of al-Qaeda's embassy bombing defendants. It's an amazing record of success. Of the eight innocent people, Saipov allegedly killed yesterday, two were Americans. And the rest were foreigners visiting New York City. It has been reported that five of eight victims were childhood friends from Argentina celebrating a high school reunion --</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">RSKRWD-2017110101cb233</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXBNT2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PVT-R3W1-JB20-G3FG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">437056</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7563\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>RISK &amp;

And ISIS-inspired suspect detonated a bomb in a  crowded subway passage right in the middle of morning rush hour.  The  explosion sent commuters fleeing.  Thankfully only a few people were hurt.   Most severely the bomber himself.  That man has been identified as Akayed  Ullah.  He's a 27-year-old Bangladeshi immigrant who came to this country  in 2011 through a chain migration visa.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> FOX senior correspondent Rick Leventhal joins us from New York City with  more.  Rick?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> RICK LEVENTHAL, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  And Tucker, the investigation  aggressively underway.  A law enforcement source tells me they don't  believe the suspect had any co-conspirators.  In other words, they believe  that he did in fact act alone.  They say that he made the device at work.   He told them, authorities, that he made the device at work.  He was  employed by an electrical company.   </p><p> And I'm told that he had extensive travel overseas since arriving here in  the U.S. in February 2011.  Akayed Ullah, 27, lived in Brooklyn, but from  Bangladesh.  The Department of Homeland Security confirming that he arrived  here on an F43 family immigrant visa.  He was a lawful permanent resident.   As you mentioned, benefiting from the extended family chain migration.   There are questions about whether he was inspired by ISIS.  </p><p> He told investigators apparently that his attack was revenge for U.S.  attacks overseas.  But if his goal was to inflict damage and death, Tucker,  he failed miserably.  Authorities say, Ullah had a low-tech pipe bomb  strapped to his body with Velcro and zip ties and when he detonated it in  an underground passageway between the Port Authority and Times Square, the  bomber was the only one seriously injured with lacerations and burns to his  hands and abdomen.  </p><p> Three other people were hurt, headaches and ringing ears, but not serious  injuries at this point.  The Port Authority police were first on scene to  contain the suspect, but there was a massive response by the NYPD, MPA,  State Police and the FBI, now investigating the suspect's home.  His  family's home, his social media accounts and any devices he might have been  connected to or had access to for any clues to his inspiration and possible  accomplishes.  </p><p> So, Tucker, clearly this city was lucky.  More people could have been hurt  and clearly, Tucker, New York City remains a top target for terrorists.  </p><p> CARLSON:  Apparently so.  Rick Leventhal, thank you for that.  </p><p> So what type of bomb was the attacker using, and what could we do to block  attacks like this in the future, if anything?  Those questions for our next  two guests.  Walid Phares is an expert on terror in the Middle East and has  been for a long time.  Johnny Joey Jones served as a bomb disposal expert  in the Marine Corps in both Iraq and Afghanistan.  They both join us  tonight.  </p><p> First to you, Walid, the question we always ask, how do we prevent attacks  like this in the future? </p><p> WALID PHARES, FOX NEWS NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST:  I am not concerned about  the investigation.  They will going to get us a lot of information about  himself, his network.  I am concerned about the fact that we were not able  to detect him and therefore vetting him before.  The real battle is going  to be the vetting system.  </p><p> CARLSON:  But with the scale of our immigration into this country, how  could you possibly vet all of those people? </p><p> PHARES:  Well, you have a problem of immigration that we need to respond  to, regardless of terrorism.  And then you have a problem of terrorism, the  Jihadist connecting to these loopholes inside that immigration system.  So,  we need to be smart, making sure that we have a government ability to  detect on the one hand, and disconnects that threat from the windows they  are using to get into another space.  </p><p> CARLSON:  Yes.  Johnny, this attack seems like it could have been far  worse.  Why wasn't it? </p><p> JOHNNY JOEY JONES, RETIRED MARINE CORPS STAFF SERGEANT:  Well, yes, it's  absolutely could have been far worse because he made it to that place with  a bomb on his body.  More than likely there are two scenarios here on why  it didn't work well.  Either he attempted to make a high explosive like  ammonium nitrate or CATP or some of the things you've heard of and failed  in the chemistry, the actual mixture of the component, in which when he  went to detonate it, the little blasting cap went off but the actual high  explosive didn't, or he did what I believed to be more common option.  </p><p> He tried to use a lower explosive like black powder, almost like gunpowder,  and when you do that the container you put it in has to stay contained.   That's why they use pressure cookers and threaded pipe.  </p><p> CARLSON:  Right.</p><p> JONES:  It has to stay contained and allow for enough time for that lower  explosive to actually turn into an explosive, or to actually explode.  When  that happens, if you don't do it right, then that container has any weak  spots, they will do what is called venting where it actually just sucks and  oxygen and starts to burn instead of explode.  I think more than likely  with a very little information, which is the video, the picture and what we  hear, more than likely it probably was a low explosive white powder.  A lot  easier, you can bind up the shelf.  There's no chemistry involved.  </p><p> CARLSON:  Well, that is the thing.  </p><p> JONES:  He acted alone.</p><p> CARLSON:  Well, he apparently told investigators from his hospital bed this  afternoon that he got the instructions for this bomb and the internet.  Is  that possible? </p><p> JONES:  Absolutely.  If you think of two things when it comes to making a  bomb.  The thing that goes boom is your main charge.  That's a chemical  that you have to make or acquire.  And then the apparatus, the whatever it  is.  Anything in Wal-Mart that turns a light bulb on or makes a noise can  be used to trigger a bomb.  Any battery can be used to set it off.  So, you  know, there are two things you make.  One is the electronic circuit that  sets it off, the other is the actual explosion that explodes.  </p><p> CARLSON:  Right.</p><p> JONES:  Usually both are homemade in Afghanistan or Iraq and usually both  have opportunities to go wrong.  I can tell you I'm sitting here today  alive because dozens of them just weren't made right.  </p><p> CARLSON:  Well, it is good news for you, and for commuters this morning.   Walid, the thing really that may be most troublesome about this is that  this guy was basically succeeding in the United States.  He came over, he  had a hack license to drive professionally in New York City, he was working  for an electrical contractor apparently.  He's been here for a while, and  yet he tried to detonate a suicide bomb this morning.  How do you get from  one to the other? </p><p> PHARES:  That is a great point, Tucker.  Basically number one, what has  happened now and what will be happening is that unsuccessful operation will  do what?  It will teach the next wave of Jihad.  What we discuss right now,  we are telling the other side that to have the successful bomb, you need to  do it in another way.  That is the system of democracy.  Why he actually  came here basically -- what we don't know, was he already indoctrinated  overseas?  Where did the indoctrination happen?  That's my real concern.  </p><p> CARLSON:  But what was terrifying is that he wasn't an outcast.  I mean, he  was doing what immigrants are supposed to do.  He had a house.  He was here  living with his family.  He had a series of jobs.  I mean, he doesn't --</p><p> PHARES:  Well, that is your response, guess to whom?  To the previous eight  years, of the Obama administration where we were told, oh, they don't have  a job, they are frustrated.  </p><p> CARLSON:  Exactly.</p><p> PHARES:  Well, that's a successful guy.  That's exactly the point you're  making right now.  </p><p> CARLSON:  Which is terrifying.  </p><p> PHARES:  Which is terrifying because they could use success if they are  indoctrinated.  </p><p> CARLSON:  Scary.  Well, Johnny, thank you both very much.  </p><p> PHARES:  Thank you.  </p><p> CARLSON:  Islamic terror isn't just menacing New York City of course, a  greater problem in Europe or decades of slow immigration have accelerated  to become a wave of migrants that has completely changed the demographic  mix of that continent, not to mention the daily lives of the people who  live there.  The mental image of Sweden, pacifism, socialism, blond people,  mandatory politeness.  Lilting accents, saunas, you know the cliche.  If  that's what you are picturing, you haven't been there recently.  Here's the  scene in Malmo, that is the country's third largest city, just the other  day.  </p><p> BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> (CROWD CHANTING)</p><p> (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CARLSON:  It may look like Karachi or Cairo, but again that is Sweden.  It  has changed quite a bit.  A generation ago you would've been hard pressed  to find Swedes marching in support of religiously motivated mass murder.   Now it's all but normal thanks to mass immigration that has brought tens of  thousands of immigrants into the country from North Africa and the Middle  East.  </p><p> Malmo has been called Europe's most anti-Semitic city with dozens of verbal  and physical attacks targeting the few hundred Jews who still lived there.   Just 75 years ago, Sweden was a haven for Jews fleeing the holocaust.   Today those same Jews fear their own neighbors.  Again, thanks to the  Swedish government's decision to bring in a population that hates them.  </p><p> Just two days ago a synagogue in Sweden was firebombed.  It wasn't the  first such attack and unfortunately will likely not be the last.   Meanwhile, in Paris most immigrants have taken over the city streets on  some parts of the capital.  Residents of one neighborhood are threatening a  hunger strike if camping migrants aren't moved by the end of the year.   They say trash is everywhere and worse, women are being harassed regularly  on the street.  </p><p> Mark Steyn is an author and columnist who has followed what's happening in  Europe for some time, and he joins us tonight.  </p><p> So, Mark, you see videos like that from Sweden and you realized that this  is not the continent that you pictured, that it really is completely  different because of immigration trends.  Are the authorities in Europe --  I know you spent a lot of time over there -- aware of this?  Do they care?   Is there a public conversation about this? </p><p> MARK STEYN, BESTSELLING AUTHOR:  Well, Tony Blair was asked by the late  Christopher Hitchens about my book and whether the demographic trends in  Europe were part of what he called the public conversation, the European  conversation with his fellow prime ministers.  And Tony Blair gave a very  revealing answer, I thought.  He said it's part of the subterranean  conversation.  </p><p> CARLSON:  Right.  Exactly.  </p><p> STEYN:  In other words, Europe's leaders haven't figured out a way to talk  about this in public.  I know Malmo very well.  I've been there once or  twice a year for the last 15 years.  And the reason I go to Malmo is  because it was the first Christian City in what was then Denmark, and it's  now going to be the first Muslim City in Sweden.  And I do something that I  first did at the suggestion of a couple of those Swedish blondes you were  mentioning, the Abigails (ph), Brett Ecklund, those kinds of girls that you  were talking about earlier.</p><p> That they made one evening to me -- and the twilight I walked from downtown  Malmo to Rosen Guard, which is the big Muslim sobered and the Swedish  blondes fan out and the covered women and the bearded men come towards you  until eventually you are in a part of Sweden in which there are no  uncovered women, and in which Muslim women who have come from Muslim  countries where they didn't have to go covered, such as Bosnia, suddenly  find they have to go covered when they immigrate to Sweden.  </p><p> That walk as the blondes thin out and the big bearded men come towards you  and have a greater numbers.  That is Europe's future walking towards you.   And I would -- it's the biggest story of our time.  </p><p> CARLSON:  Yes.</p><p> STEYN:  But Christendom is being transformed at an extraordinary level to  the point where Swedes will be an ethnic minority in their own country by  mid-century.  </p><p> CARLSON:  What I don't understand, why is no one allowed to talk about it?   I mean, if Swedes or Danes or Fins were flooding into Jordan and displacing  the native population and forcing people to follow their Christian  practices and obey their cultural imperatives, their mores, I think  liberals here would say, well, no, you can't do that, it's their country.   Why is it different when it happens in Europe or the United States? </p><p> STEYN:  Right.  Well, you actually see it in the United States when they  talk about New Orleans no longer being a chocolate city because too many  white people have moved in.  If you remember, that was one of the headlines  a few years ago.  </p><p> CARLSON:  I do remember.  Yes.</p><p> STEYN:  And I think the problem of course is the, you, the minute you raise  it, you get accused of being racist.  The minute you talk about it with any  degree of honesty, that deputy leader of Britain first that you mentioned a  couple of days ago, the police in Belfast flew all the way to London to  arrest her, put her on a plane, take her back to Belfast for something she  said in a speech at Belfast City Hall.  Swedes are particularly dishonest  about it.  </p><p> The wealthy Swedes, the minute their area gets like those scenes you were  showing in Paris where there's too many migrants in the neighborhood starts  to change, they move out to all-white suburbs and all-white villages, and  the moment they are there they vote evermore enthusiastically in polls  about how wonderful multiculturalism is.  The more they move away from it,  the more they are in favor of it.  </p><p> CARLSON:  Of course, because it doesn't affect them.  But if you  intentionally set out to create an environment in which violent nationalism  would flower, wouldn't this be it? </p><p> STEYN:  Absolutely.  I mean, the first duty of the political class is  prudence.  </p><p> CARLSON:  Exactly.</p><p> STEYN:  And you don't extinguish prudence for Utopian delusions.  And the  reality is that as people know in almost any part of the world, that the  minute you have Islam as 15-20 percent of your population, the mediation of  relations between Islam and the rest of society becomes your principal  domestic consideration, as is happening in front of our eyes in Sweden, in  the Netherlands, in France, and Germany, and the United Kingdom.  </p><p> CARLSON:  And it will happen here.  The first duty of the political class  is prudence.  I'm getting that tattooed.</p><p> STEYN:  Absolutely.</p><p> CARLSON:  And I'm giving you credit when I get it.  Mark Steyn, it's great  to see you.  </p><p> STEYN:  That is the great tramp stamp to get.  I recommend that, Tucker.  </p><p> CARLSON:  It's true.  Thank you.</p><p>CNN, ABC, \"The Washington Post\" all went above and beyond in an effort to  win the President's fake news contest.  Who won?  We will tell you, next.                           </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> CARLSON:  A couple of weeks ago, President Trump made the following, pretty  amusing proposal on Twitter.  Quote, \"We should have a contest as to which  of the networks, plus CNN, not including FOX, is the most dishonest,  corrupt and or distorted in its political coverage of your favorite  president (me).  They are all bad.  Winner to receive fake news trophy!</p><p> It seems like a joke then.  But apparently the other networks took it very  seriously and started working to win.  CNN hike the Wikileaks bombshell  that went absolutely nowhere.  ABC had to suspend Brian Ross after he  falsely claimed evidence of pre-election collusion between Trump and  Russia, even though Dave Weigel of \"The Washington Post,\" who now has a  mustache got involved.  </p><p> Used a misleading photo to suggest Trump's rally in Pensacola was MD rather  than packed.  It was quite a week for the press but instead of pausing for  self-reflection, David Frum of \"The Atlantic\" said these bungle stories  prove the importance of trusting the media.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DAVID FRUM, \"THE ATLANTIC\":  The mistakes are precisely the reason that  people should trust the media.  Astronomers make mistakes all the time  because Science is a process of discovery of truth.  Astrologers never make  mistakes, or at least they never own up to them because what they are  offering is a closed system of ideology and propaganda.  </p><p> CARLSON:  So the mistakes are the reason you ought to trust the accuracy.   Is it brilliantly counterintuitive or just stupid?  That's the question.  </p><p> Joe Concha writes about media for \"The Hill.\"  Mollie Hemingway is a senior  editor at \"The Federalist\" and they both join us tonight.  </p><p> Mollie, first to you.  I don't begrudge anybody the right to make a mistake  once in a while, I've made a ton of them for sure.  I just can't help but  notice that all the mistakes that the different channels are making are in  the same direction.  All mistakes seem to be kind of solidifying liberal  views on things.  </p><p> MOLLIE HEMINGWAY, SENIOR EDITOR, \"THE FEDERALIST\":  Right.  And just in  this last week alone, you mentioned a few of the stories, but you didn't  even get all of the stories that there were mistakes.  </p><p> CARLSON:  No.</p><p> HEMINGWAY:  A false report about Deutsche Bank subpoenaing Trump financial  accounts.  </p><p> CARLSON:  Right.</p><p> HEMINGWAY:  I mean, there's many, and \"The New York Times\" said that K.T.  McFarland had admitted collusion.  She did not admit collusion.  All these  stories go in the same ways.  So, they want us to believe that these areas  are just routine and they are just something that happens occasionally.   Why are they all going in the same direction?  If they truly were just  accidents or things that happened as part of the job, you would expect to  see errors go in different directions.  </p><p> Errors that make Trump look good as well as bad.  Or you would have  expected to have seen the same level of erroneous reporting on Barack  Obama.  We did not say that.  </p><p> CARLSON:  Yes.  I don't remember seeing that at all.  </p><p> So, Joe, again, people make mistakes, but if you are consistently wrong and  if you're way out over your skis making predictions that don't match  reality, in any other business you would be demoted or at least asked to  take some time off.  You would be fired from the military.  No one ever  gets fired in the media except for groping others at Christmas parties.   Have you noticed that?</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> JOE CONCHA, THE HILL:  Well, Brian Ross to get a four-week suspension.  So,  let's be clear about that.  </p><p> CARLSON:  He did.  That's true.</p><p> CONCHA:  And the CNN case there, there were no suspensions or reprimands in  that particular instance.  I keep hearing, and I saw the story in the press  briefing today, that reporters are saying, look, we just made mistakes,  we're just trying to get to the truth.  The problem is, there is a rush to  get to that every time and to see an example is perfect with the Wikileaks  story because remember, the network went ahead with information that was  read to them.  And then \"The Washington Post\" did the right thing.  </p><p> They actually got the document that showed that the information was false  in an essence that Donald Trump, Jr. and Trump associates receive that  information ten days later.  In other words, they took a little more  effort, and took a little more time and actually got the document.  Now,  and one more point, by the way, in terms of we hear about unnamed sources.   Right?  These aren't innocent whistle-blowers.  These are political  operatives.  </p><p> They may even be lawmakers themselves.  And they realize now, they can  weaponize false information because you have reporters that are like that,  Jim Comey analogy, used earlier in the year, seagulls of at the beach that  will eat anything and gobble it up regardless of the quality or even know  what they are eating.  And let me give you one more stat, Jim Sciutto who  is foreign affairs correspondent for CNN, he pushed out the story like  everybody does when their network got a big exclusive.  And that got 2,300  re-tweets and 3,300 likes on Twitter.  </p><p> He then sends out the correction saying, no, no, no, we got it wrong and  this is what the story actually says.  Remember the re-tweets that got?   Fifty two.  And only 148 likes.  I'm not very good at math, but I believe  that's about two percent.  So, that is the thing.  The allegation always  trumps the exoneration.  </p><p> CARLSON:  So, Mollie, the substance of the stories, maybe not the  ridiculous Russia story or how many people went to some Trump rally like in  the end, who cares.  But what if, you know, if we were in a war where there  were like an actual crisis in this country and nobody trusted media  outlets, what with that due to our society? </p><p> HEMMINGWAY:  It is a very dangerous thing to not be able to trust a media  outlet or have a general confidence that the media will get a story right.   But I actually think the substance is key here.  What we've seen for the  last year is an obsession with a story about treasonous collusion with  Russia to steal an election.  The substance of that is so important.  It  has undermined legitimately elected president and it has been something  that the media have been hammering on day after day.  I mean, multiple  stories a day.  </p><p> CARLSON:  Yes.</p><p> HEMMINGWAY:  What if the real scandal is that that itself was an  information operation and that it was weaponized and it was distributed  through the media and our media people either willingly fell for it, or  unwittingly fell for it.  Either of those scenarios is extremely dangerous  and it doesn't feel like we have a media complex capable of really digging  into the significance of that story.  </p><p> CARLSON:  Right.  Because you're incapable of self-reflection.  And I  actually start to think that's exactly what it was.  I wish we had more  time.  Mollie, Joe, thank you both.  </p><p> CONCHA:  Thank you.  </p><p> CARLSON:  It's been a turbulent contest to put it mildly, but Alabama  Senate race finally ends tomorrow.  Democrats are making the contest all  about race, weirdly.  One African-American Jones Motor disagrees with that.   He's from Birmingham, Alabama, and he's here to explain what's going on,  next.    </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> CARLSON:  This is a FOX News alert.  I'm Trace Gallagher.  A pipe bomb  attack shaking the heart of New York City.  The suspect inspired by ISIS  set off the crew device in a crowded subway passageway at the height of the  morning rush hour.  Authorities say the bomb was packed with explosive  powder but failed to turn the pipe into shrapnel.  The suspect, 27-year-old  Akayed Ullah who is in the U.S. on a family visa from Bangladesh was the  only one who suffered serious injuries.  </p><p> While the massive wildfire burning in the foothill towns near Santa Barbara  exploding in size.  This is now the fifth-largest fire in California  history.  The flames forcing tens of thousands of people from their homes.   So far more than 750 buildings have been destroyed but the strong Santa Ana  winds have died down a bit allowing firefighters to get the upper hand on  other fires burning in Southern California.  </p><p> I'm Trace Gallagher, now back to TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT.  </p><p> CARLSON:  We are just a day away from what seems like the longest political  contest in human history.  The Alabama special Senate election race.   Democratic Senate candidate Doug Jones facing blowback tonight over mailers  his campaign sent out last week.  Those flyers showed an image of an  incredulous black man and asked, quote, \"If a black man went after high  school girls, anyone would try to make him a senator.\"  </p><p>Eric Guster is a lawyer from Alabama.  He is a Doug Jones supporter, voted  for him, an absentee ballot, he joins us tonight.  </p><p> So, Eric, it seems to me there are a lot of reasons that Democrats might  want to vote against Roy Moore.  But why these flyers telling black voters  he's a racist?  Why not go after him on the issues? </p><p>ERIC GUSTER, CIVIL RIGHTS ATTORNEY:  Actually Doug Jones has gone against  Roy Moore on the issues such as Roy Moore's, his civil rights history and  some of the things such as he wanted to keep segregation a language in the  constitution.  Those are issues that Doug Jones has brought out on the  flyer, I did not like that flyer, but he has promoted his campaign and he  has marketed to African-American communities as well as other Democratic  bases to get them out the vote.  </p><p> CARLSON:  But what I find I guess insulting about this, and I'm not  African-American nor a Democrat, so I'm just sort of watching from the  outside.  But it seems insulting kind of that, I mean, if someone tried to  get my vote by making it all about, you know, someone who's against white  people, whatever, I would say, okay, but where is he on tax rates?  Do you  know what I mean?  It seems like this is a very tired way to campaign, you  see it a lot.  Why do it in this race? </p><p>GUSTER:  Everybody is doing it.  Luther Strange, when Luther Strange got  beat down by Roy Moore, Luther Strange was one of the most race baiting  campaigns I've ever seen.  Roy Moore has done it in a way in which he  talked about immigration and building a wall.  I mean, he has all these  brown people on camera to say, we don't like them.  That is what his  campaign is based upon.  </p><p> CARLSON:  Luther Strange is not running for anything now.  </p><p>GUSTER:  No.  But I'm telling you.  </p><p> CARLSON:  When Luther Strange ran a racist campaign against Roy Moore in  the primary, that doesn't even make sense given the demographics of  Alabama.  I don't even know what you're talking about.  </p><p>GUSTER:  And that's what he did!  It did make sense.  That's the beauty of  it.  </p><p> CARLSON:  Right.</p><p>GUSTER:  Because he was trying to create racially charged -- he was trying  to create the campaign to make it racially charged and that's what he did  and he got whipped.  However, now we have Roy Moore who is doing something  similar.  </p><p> CARLSON:  Here's the point -- </p><p>GUSTER:  I'm trying to educate you about it.  </p><p> CARLSON:  There are a lot of reasons that you might be against Roy Moore.   I think you could take his accuser seriously, you might not like his  position on X, Y, or Z, but he's not trying to bring segregation back to  Alabama and you would have to be dumb to think that he is.  I mean, let's  just be honest.  </p><p>GUSTER:  Hold on, Tucker.  I did not say that.  </p><p> CARLSON:  I don't think you said that.  </p><p>GUSTER:  No.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> CARLSON:  You didn't say that but the Jones campaign is saying that.  </p><p>GUSTER:  I didn't say that.</p><p> CARLSON:  I don't think you did that.  The Jones campaign.  </p><p>GUSTER:  Okay.  I'm making sure.  </p><p> CARLSON:  Right.  Absolutely.  </p><p>GUSTER:  Right.  No, no.  Jones is nothing he wanted to bring back  segregation, that is not what he said.  Doug Jones is bringing out the fact  that Roy Moore wanted to keep segregation a language in our Alabama  constitution.  That is a major issues for so many people including blacks  and whites because we want to get rid of that language and Roy Moore  supported it.  </p><p> CARLSON:  Okay.  But no one is trying to bring back -- I mean, that's a  debate about language.  But its real-life implications are pretty much  zero.  Nobody is trying to bring segregation back to the state of Alabama.   No one in this race.  </p><p>GUSTER:  Nobody.</p><p> CARLSON:  No non-crazy person is trying to do that.  And so, it's not  really about that.  This is about trying to scare people and it doesn't  seem like it's necessary, and it leads to lasting wounds that don't go  away.  So, why do that?  And why do it in every single race? </p><p>GUSTER:  I don't know why Roy Moore is trying to scare people into voting  for him.  I don't know why Roy Moore is trying to scare people into voting  for him.  Because that's what his ads are portraying.  They are trying to  scare people about immigrants, trying to make the immigration -- the people  who need immigration, the immigration bogeyman.  But both sides have gone  low bar with their mailers and with their ads.  I do say that.  But I do  support Jones.  </p><p> CARLSON:  Here's the difference.  You should be afraid of our immigration  policy, because of what happened this morning in New York, what happened  last week in Sweden.  I mean, it's not a racial question.  You can be  terrified of our immigration policy and not being a racist.  </p><p>GUSTER:  Hold on.  Why are you saying we should be terrified about it? </p><p> CARLSON:  Because we're not vetting people letting in here.  And it's  making the country poorer and more dangerous.  It's not a race attack, it's  a statement of fact and you are not a bigot for saying that.  </p><p>GUSTER:  That's not true.  No it's not.  I appreciate you saying that, but  it's not true.  </p><p> CARLSON:  You appreciate it.  Eric Guster, thanks for coming on.  I  appreciate it.  </p><p> Richard Goodstein advised both of Hillary Clinton's presidential campaigns  and he joins us now.  So, this, I guess what bugs me -- and I'm not taking  up the cudgel on behalf of Roy Moore, I'm just pointing out that like you  don't need to do this.  You could run a series of ads against Roy Moore  about him being impeached as a judge or about the accusations currently  against him.  You don't have to pretend that he some kind of Klansman or  George Wallace replica, because he's not.  Why are they doing this? </p><p> RICHARD GOODSTEIN, FORMER HILLARY CAMPAIGN ADVISER:  Well, I mean, ask  Richard Shelby why he said not only could he not vote for Roy Moore, but he  didn't think other people should and he didn't think Roy Moore represented  what Alabama should.  I mean, and he's not talking about race.  I mean,  look, Doug Jones -- </p><p> CARLSON:  You're making my point for me.  </p><p> GOODSTEIN:  Okay, I'm saying --  </p><p> CARLSON:  Why didn't Doug Jones do that? </p><p> GOODSTEIN:  Doug Jones has said that the mailer speaks for itself.  But in  an odd way, Roy Moore is the one who introduced raised by talking about  how, when America was great again, it's when there was slavery because  families were together.  Roy Moore is the one who said, we should abolish  all the amendment after the tenth, which would mean no 13th, no abolition  of slavery.  No 15th, no right to vote.  You know, dependent on race.  No  19th Amendment because giving women the right to vote.  Et cetera, et  cetera.  So, if anybody is kind of putting race in, it's Roy Moore.  And  nobody is suggesting we go back to these things.  </p><p> CARLSON:  No.  Okay.  And that's kind of the point.  </p><p> GOODSTEIN:  Right.</p><p> CARLSON:  You can agree or disagree with Moore on a whole bunch of things  but to compare them to George Wallace or to suggest, as this flyer does  that he wants to bring segregation back.  He hasn't suggested that, there's  no evidence he wants that.  And whenever you say something like that it  makes people more afraid, it divides the country in ways that are  permanent.  I don't why Democrats persisting campaigning that way.  Every  single campaign.  </p><p> GOODSTEIN:  Yes.  So, all I'm saying is, I don't think a statement in 2011  about doing away with every -- and passed the tenth.  Okay.  This was not  ancient history.  This is a relatively recent comment.  </p><p> CARLSON:  Wouldn't it be easier to ask Roy Moore?  Look, are you for  limiting people's --</p><p> GOODSTEIN:  Roy Moore is lying about these women.  What you say asking?   Roy Moore can't, you know, kind of level with people about what he did with  these women.  </p><p> CARLSON:  But on a policy question, it's really simple.  I've never just  thought people persist in like assuming what other people think when you  can just ask.  Roy Moore, whatever you think of them, is pretty upfront  about what he thinks.  You believe on the women, I get it.</p><p> GOODSTEIN:  Right.</p><p> CARLSON:  But on his beliefs, he's willing to say the most unfashionable  things.  Why don't -- hey, Roy Moore, should everyone over the age of 18  would be allowed to vote, without a felony record, I think he would  probably say, yes.  </p><p> GOODSTEIN:  Yes.  What I am saying is, Richard Shelby, the other senator  has as much at stake and who that other position is going to be anybody  including Donald Trump.  And even he couldn't bring himself to vote for Roy  Moore.  </p><p> CARLSON:  My point is, not that every decent person asked to vote for Roy  Moore, I don't think that actually.  I'm just saying that in campaign after  campaign after campaign, Democrats have only one pitch to African-American  voters, and that is the other side hates you because of your race.  </p><p> GOODSTEIN:  Yes.</p><p> CARLSON:  And I just think over time that divides the country, I think in a  lot of cases is totally untrue.  It is the sleaziest way to campaign.  Why  keep doing it? </p><p> GOODSTEIN:  Could you blame a black voter for looking at Roy Moore's  record?  Looking at the fact that Roy Moore wouldn't dare step foot in a  black community to campaign.  He is not even in the state to campaign.  The  fact that Roy Moore can't bring himself to speak to black voters and that  he takes these positions that are so antithetical, to the essence of black  voters saying, slavery was the time we want to make America great back to.  </p><p> CARLSON:  He didn't say slavery was, look, you are not going to get me in a  position where I'm defending everything Roy Moore said.  I'm just saying,  he didn't actually endorse slavery.  </p><p> GOODSTEIN:  Of course, I'm not saying he did.  </p><p> CARLSON:  Why not attack his views on, I don't know, tax rates, or  something real? </p><p> GOODSTEIN:  Yes.  But the question was, when was America great again?  And  what does he go to?  He go to the time of slavery.  So, again, it's not  Doug Jones.  </p><p> CARLSON:  You think Roy Moore is for slavery? </p><p> I think Roy Moore has this fantasized view that yes, that's when America  was at its best.  We had slavery, but in his adult view, families were  close, which is hideous.  </p><p> CARLSON:  Do you think Roy Moore -- you don't think he's for slavery?  You  don't have the evidence he is a racist.  </p><p> GOODSTEIN:  I'm looking at what Roy Moore said.  </p><p> CARLSON:  No.  But let's just be real for a second.  Do you have evidence  he's a racist?  You don't.  He's never said anything that's racist.  He  said a lot of things that people may disagree with, but why call him a  racist, that's all I'm asking.  </p><p> GOODSTEIN:  I think people of color find it deeply offensive when he says,  when we had America great again was at a time of slavery.  So, is that  racist?  </p><p> CARLSON:  Yes.</p><p> GOODSTEIN:  Fundamentally.  </p><p> CARLSON:  Do you think black voters at all feel patronized by white  liberals -- the only pitch they ever make is that the other side is racist.   Don't you think some black voters think, why don't you just treat me like a  normal person and like tell me about how you're going to make the schools  better or make the roads better or lower my taxes, or some normal issue.   Do you ever think that they feel patronized by that? </p><p> GOODSTEIN:  Yes.  Actually, I don't think that's the message.  It's about  health care, it's about jobs.  It's about pay, it's about income equality.  </p><p> CARLSON:  I wish it works.  Those are real issues.  Those are real  messages.  I never hear them, but maybe they are out there.  </p><p> GOODSTEIN:  Well, I think they are, but time will tell.  </p><p> CARLSON:  Richard, thank you.  </p><p> GOODSTEIN:  Thank you.</p><p> CARLSON:  After years of calling a whole story a sham, Planned Parenthood  is now facing a federal investigation for possibly selling baby parts,  which they appear to have been doing.  The man who first exposed this  horrifying scandal joins us next.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> CARLSON:  America's largest abortion provider, Planned Parenthood, is now  under federal investigation by the Department of Justice for selling fetal  body parts.  Allegations against the group first surfaced when the center  for medical progress, that is anti-abortion organization, published footage  of Planned Parenthood employees discussing the trade in fetal body parts.   And it was nauseating.  </p><p> This is the first time we ever heard of the story, it could be because the  rest of the press is not interested in covering it, so they don't.  We  spoke to David Gladden, who leads the center for medical progress on the  subject.  </p><p> David, thanks for joining us.  </p><p> DAVID GLADDEN, CENTER FOR MEDICAL PROGRESS:  Hey, Tucker.  Great to be on.</p><p> CARLSON:  What exactly is the DOJ looking into, what are the allegations? </p><p> GLADDEN:  Sure.  So, the DOJ is just doing their job and doing exactly what  they should be doing, which is following up on two very good comprehensive  investigations that were done by the Senate Judiciary Committee and by the  House Select Investigative panel into Planned Parenthood's participation in  the harvesting and sale of aborted baby body parts with multiple for-profit  companies that they were engaged with for about five years, and sometimes  even longer.  </p><p> CARLSON:  So Planned Parenthood was involved in the sale of human parts,  that's illegal.  We've known this for a long time, and yet as far as I know  the only people to face legal consequences so far have been members of your  group, which brought this to light, is that correct? </p><p> GLADDEN:  So far Planned Parenthood's political allies in California have  brought a series of totally bogus charges against myself and one of my  investigative colleagues.  Those are being litigated in California right  now.  But now Planned Parenthood is going to have to face the wheels of  justice themselves because the Justice Department is doing their job.  They  are following up on some very damning evidence, both documents and other  kinds of evidence that uncovered by the Congressional investigations.  </p><p> And Planned Parenthood is going to have to answer very serious questions  about why their medical directors are in those documents endorsing  advertisements from companies like stem express promising a financial  profit to abortion clinics when they provide body parts.  Why they are  signing contracts that value Planned Parenthood's abortion body parts  inventory up to the millions of dollars.  </p><p> There is a lot of very damning, and incriminating evidence in those  documents that now the Department of Justice is going to have access to.   And Planned Parenthood is going to have to face the consequences for that  under the law.  </p><p> CARLSON:  I mean, presumably you could be for Roe v. Wade and still  horrified by the idea of selling baby parts, as any prominent Democrat  denounced this that you've seen? </p><p> GLADDEN:  I think the pro-life Democrats that are out there needs to speak  out pretty loudly now and those who are pro-choice and who supports  abortion rights need to speak out and differentiate themselves from Planned  Parenthood.  </p><p> CARLSON:  Yes.</p><p> GLADDEN:  From the radical abortion extremists there who think that pro- choice means any abortion, anytime, anywhere, up to nine months, selling  the body parts afterwards using partial-birth abortions to get intact body  parts.  </p><p> CARLSON:  Right.</p><p> GLADDEN:  That is the fate of Planned Parenthood today that is funded by  taxpayers by up to half of billion and dollars every year and that needs to  stop.  </p><p> CARLSON:  Committing abortions for sex election, which they explicitly  allow at their clinics.  So, I guess the question is, has any prominent  Democrat denounced this?  Any? </p><p> GLADDEN:  You would have to ask them.  You know, I just saw my own Senator  Dianne Feinstein from the state of California, just issued a statement  today in support of Planned Parenthood.  Even in the face of them facing an  investigation, a federal investigation from the Department of Justice now  for their years long scheme with companies like stem express and advanced  bioscience resources, and other laboratories to harvest and sell tiny baby  hearts, lungs, livers and brains from their late-term abortions.  </p><p> So, unfortunately the most prominent people who were in Planned  Parenthood's corner still seem to be with them.  And it's really a problem  because the evidence is not going to be able to be kept under wraps and to  be kept covered up forever.  Planned Parenthood's allies in high places  like Judge Orrick who is the federal judge in San Francisco --   </p><p> CARLSON:  Yes.</p><p> GLADDEN: -- overseeing their lawsuits over to me.  He has a long history of  affiliation with Planned Parenthood.  He helped open and run and fund a  Planned Parenthood clinic in San Francisco that is now part of the  affiliate that is suing me in his courtroom.  </p><p> CARLSON:  Yes.</p><p> GLADDEN:  He needs to recuse himself, he still hasn't on that.  And he's  the one that is trying to keep the remaining videotapes under wrap, which  are now going to be all the more relevant in light of the federal DOJ  investigation.  </p><p> CARLSON:  Fifty years from now, his ancestors will be ashamed and so will  Dianne Feinstein's of what they're doing right now.  And I appreciate  everything you're doing.  Thank you.  </p><p> GLADDEN:  Thanks, Tucker.  </p><p> CARLSON:  David, thank you.  U.S. tech companies are more powerful than any  corporations in human history.  What's the right way to rein them in and if  indeed they should be reined in at all?  The chairman of the FCC joins us,  next.    </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> CARLSON:  You think of the FCC as kind of an obscure federal body, not  anymore.  It's under attack now for its plans to repeal an Obama era  regulation known as net neutrality.  A lot of people, a lot of famous  people have very strong opinions about net neutrality.  They warn if it is  repealed a handful of tech companies will have total control over the  internet.  Wait, doesn't that already describe the status quo?  </p><p> Ajit Pai, FCC chairman of the FCC, he's been at the center of a lot of  criticism recently and he joins us tonight.  Great to see you.  </p><p> AJIT PAI, FCC CHAIRMAN:  Great to see you, too.  </p><p> CARLSON:  So, here's and I actually don't think this, but here's the line,  that if net neutrality is rolled back, that a handful of companies will be  able to control content and if they don't like what they are seeing or  you're broadcasting, they can shut it down.  Should we be worried about  that? </p><p> PAI:  No, I think what net neutrality repealed would actually mean is that  we once again have a free and open internet.  The government will not be  regulating how internet service providers, how anyone else in the internet  economy manages the network.  And so, I think we had that free market  approach for 20 years, starting in President Clinton's time --  </p><p> CARLSON:  Right.  </p><p> PAI:  1996, all the way through 2015.  The internet wasn't broken when the  Obama FCC decided, tried to fix it.  And we've seen the effects of these  regulations over the last two years.  It's made for worse infrastructure  investments, less innovation and I think that's part of the reason why  these regulations need to be repealed.  </p><p> CARLSON:  Right.  But I guess those changes were in the middle of the  biggest witch-hunt in American history.  And corporations are complicit in  that.  So, what would happen if this is repealed and the Southern Poverty  Law Center says, you know, I saw FOX News the other night.  That is hate  speech, internet service provider shut them down.  What would prevent the  service provider from doing that? </p><p> PAI:  Well, one thing is that the FCC requires transparency.  If any ISP  engaged in that kind of conduct they would have to disclose it.   Additionally the Federal Trade Commission would have jurisdiction over it.   But I think you've actually put your finger on something that is very  important that I talked to you about.  Where is the real threat to the free  and open internet?  And one of the things that the people have suggested  is, it's not internet service providers, and some of the content companies  that decide what you see on the internet and more importantly what you  don't see.  Where is the transparency there?  Shouldn't we have a  conversation that involves them as well? </p><p> CARLSON:  Why don't we?  So, you have two companies, Google and Facebook to  control 90 percent of all digital ad dollars.  That means they basically  control all news on the internet.  Nobody ever says anything about it,  nobody appears worried by it.  Why is that? </p><p> PAI:  I'm not sure why.  But you do see rumblings on Capitol Hill, members  of both parties in both houses are a little bit worried about what's going  on in the internet in terms of transparency and how some of these decisions  are being made.  And I two have some of these concerns, that when Twitter  for example restricted Congresswoman Marsha Blackburn's video announcing  her run for the Senate in part because of her pro-life views and same thing  with YouTube demonetizing Diamond and Silk, some Trump supporters and  Dennis Prager's videos.  I mean, a lot of these decisions impinge on the  free expression online that we've all come to cherish, but there's no real  transparency into how these decisions are made.  </p><p> CARLSON:  And there's never any outcry, whereas there is with net  neutrality.  And again, I'm not even sure what I think of it, but it does  seem like someone is spending a lot of money to lobby public opinion on the  subject, the opinions of famous people.  Is it the big tech companies  lobbying against? </p><p> PAI:  I'm not sure who exactly is funding all of these things, but what I  can say is that hysteria has reached a pitch which is completely  disproportionate to the facts.  I mean, as I said, we weren't living in the  broken internet in 2015.  All of these harms that these celebrities are  talking about are all hypothetical.  There's no market failure here.   Internet service providers are not, and have not, blocked content willy- nilly.  And we are confident going forward that given the robust rules that  we have and the Federal Trade Commission has, they won't going forward.  </p><p> CARLSON:  And so, we know, Facebook, Google and Twitter have blocked  content willy-nilly and continue to and nobody does anything about it.  Mr.  Pai, thank you for coming on.  Great to see you.  </p><p> PAI:  Thanks, good to see you too.  </p><p> CARLSON:  We will be back in just a minute.    </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> CARLSON:  An hour passed already.  We enjoyed it.  Tune in each night at  eight to the show that is the sworn enemy of lying, pomposity, smugness and  group think.  DVR it if you can figure that out and above all join us  tomorrow.  </p><p> HANNITY starts right now.    </p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2017 Fox News Network, LLC.

And ISIS-inspired suspect detonated a bomb in a crowded subway passage right in the middle of morning rush hour. The explosion sent commuters fleeing. Thankfully only a few people were hurt. Most severely the bomber himself. That man has been identified as Akayed Ullah. He's a 27-year-old Bangladeshi immigrant who came to this country in 2011 through a chain migration visa.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">FOX senior correspondent Rick Leventhal joins us from New York City with more. Rick?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">RICK LEVENTHAL, <person><nameText>FOX NEWS </nameText></person>CORRESPONDENT: And Tucker, the investigation aggressively underway. A law enforcement source tells me they don't believe the suspect had any co-conspirators. In other words, they believe that he did in fact act alone. They say that he made the device at work. He told them, authorities, that he made the device at work. He was employed by an electrical company.</p><p>And I'm told that he had extensive travel overseas since arriving here in the U.S. in February 2011. Akayed Ullah, 27, lived in Brooklyn, but from Bangladesh. The Department of Homeland Security confirming that he arrived here on an F43 family immigrant visa. He was a lawful permanent resident. As you mentioned, benefiting from the extended family chain migration. There are questions about whether he was inspired by ISIS.</p><p>He told investigators apparently that his attack was revenge for U.S. attacks overseas. But if his goal was to inflict damage and death, Tucker, he failed miserably. Authorities say, Ullah had a low-tech pipe bomb strapped to his body with Velcro and zip ties and when he detonated it in an underground passageway between the Port Authority and Times Square, the bomber was the only one seriously injured with lacerations and burns to his hands and abdomen.</p><p>Three other people were hurt, headaches and ringing ears, but not serious injuries at this point. The Port Authority police were first on scene to contain the suspect, but there was a massive response by the NYPD, MPA, State Police and the FBI, now investigating the suspect's home. His family's home, his social media accounts and any devices he might have been connected to or had access to for any clues to his inspiration and possible accomplishes.</p><p>So, Tucker, clearly this city was lucky. More people could have been hurt and clearly, Tucker, New York City remains a top target for terrorists.</p><p>CARLSON: Apparently so. Rick Leventhal, thank you for that.</p><p>So what type of bomb was the attacker using, and what could we do to block attacks like this in the future, if anything? Those questions for our next two guests. Walid Phares is an expert on terror in the Middle East and has been for a long time. Johnny Joey Jones served as a bomb disposal expert in the Marine Corps in both Iraq and Afghanistan. They both join us tonight.</p><p>First to you, Walid, the question we always ask, how do we prevent attacks like this in the future?</p><p>WALID PHARES, <person><nameText>FOX NEWS </nameText></person>NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST: I am not concerned about the investigation. They will going to get us a lot of information about himself, his network. I am concerned about the fact that we were not able to detect him and therefore vetting him before. The real battle is going to be the vetting system.</p><p>CARLSON: But with the scale of our immigration into this country, how could you possibly vet all of those people?</p><p>PHARES: Well, you have a problem of immigration that we need to respond to, regardless of terrorism. And then you have a problem of terrorism, the Jihadist connecting to these loopholes inside that immigration system. So, we need to be smart, making sure that we have a government ability to detect on the one hand, and disconnects that threat from the windows they are using to get into another space.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes. Johnny, this attack seems like it could have been far worse. Why wasn't it?</p><p>JOHNNY JOEY JONES, RETIRED MARINE CORPS STAFF SERGEANT: Well, yes, it's absolutely could have been far worse because he made it to that place with a bomb on his body. More than likely there are two scenarios here on why it didn't work well. Either he attempted to make a high explosive like ammonium nitrate or CATP or some of the things you've heard of and failed in the chemistry, the actual mixture of the component, in which when he went to detonate it, the little blasting cap went off but the actual high explosive didn't, or he did what I believed to be more common option.</p><p>He tried to use a lower explosive like black powder, almost like gunpowder, and when you do that the container you put it in has to stay contained. That's why they use pressure cookers and threaded pipe.</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>JONES: It has to stay contained and allow for enough time for that lower explosive to actually turn into an explosive, or to actually explode. When that happens, if you don't do it right, then that container has any weak spots, they will do what is called venting where it actually just sucks and oxygen and starts to burn instead of explode. I think more than likely with a very little information, which is the video, the picture and what we hear, more than likely it probably was a low explosive white powder. A lot easier, you can bind up the shelf. There's no chemistry involved.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, that is the thing.</p><p>JONES: He acted alone.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, he apparently told investigators from his hospital bed this afternoon that he got the instructions for this bomb and the internet. Is that possible?</p><p>JONES: Absolutely. If you think of two things when it comes to making a bomb. The thing that goes boom is your main charge. That's a chemical that you have to make or acquire. And then the apparatus, the whatever it is. Anything in Wal-Mart that turns a light bulb on or makes a noise can be used to trigger a bomb. Any battery can be used to set it off. So, you know, there are two things you make. One is the electronic circuit that sets it off, the other is the actual explosion that explodes.</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>JONES: Usually both are homemade in Afghanistan or Iraq and usually both have opportunities to go wrong. I can tell you I'm sitting here today alive because dozens of them just weren't made right.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, it is good news for you, and for commuters this morning. Walid, the thing really that may be most troublesome about this is that this guy was basically succeeding in the United States. He came over, he had a hack license to drive professionally in New York City, he was working for an electrical contractor apparently. He's been here for a while, and yet he tried to detonate a suicide bomb this morning. How do you get from one to the other?</p><p>PHARES: That is a great point, Tucker. Basically number one, what has happened now and what will be happening is that unsuccessful operation will do what? It will teach the next wave of Jihad. What we discuss right now, we are telling the other side that to have the successful bomb, you need to do it in another way. That is the system of democracy. Why he actually came here basically -- what we don't know, was he already indoctrinated overseas? Where did the indoctrination happen? That's my real concern.</p><p>CARLSON: But what was terrifying is that he wasn't an outcast. I mean, he was doing what immigrants are supposed to do. He had a house. He was here living with his family. He had a series of jobs. I mean, he doesn't --</p><p>PHARES: Well, that is your response, guess to whom? To the previous eight years, of the Obama administration where we were told, oh, they don't have a job, they are frustrated.</p><p>CARLSON: Exactly.</p><p>PHARES: Well, that's a successful guy. That's exactly the point you're making right now.</p><p>CARLSON: Which is terrifying.</p><p>PHARES: Which is terrifying because they could use success if they are indoctrinated.</p><p>CARLSON: Scary. Well, Johnny, thank you both very much.</p><p>PHARES: Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: Islamic terror isn't just menacing New York City of course, a greater problem in Europe or decades of slow immigration have accelerated to become a wave of migrants that has completely changed the demographic mix of that continent, not to mention the daily lives of the people who live there. The mental image of Sweden, pacifism, socialism, blond people, mandatory politeness. Lilting accents, saunas, you know the cliche. If that's what you are picturing, you haven't been there recently. Here's the scene in Malmo, that is the country's third largest city, just the other day.</p><p>BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(CROWD CHANTING)</p><p>(SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: It may look like Karachi or Cairo, but again that is Sweden. It has changed quite a bit. A generation ago you would've been hard pressed to find Swedes marching in support of religiously motivated mass murder. Now it's all but normal thanks to mass immigration that has brought tens of thousands of immigrants into the country from North Africa and the Middle East.</p><p>Malmo has been called Europe's most anti-Semitic city with dozens of verbal and physical attacks targeting the few hundred Jews who still lived there. Just 75 years ago, Sweden was a haven for Jews fleeing the holocaust. Today those same Jews fear their own neighbors. Again, thanks to the Swedish government's decision to bring in a population that hates them.</p><p>Just two days ago a synagogue in Sweden was firebombed. It wasn't the first such attack and unfortunately will likely not be the last. Meanwhile, in Paris most immigrants have taken over the city streets on some parts of the capital. Residents of one neighborhood are threatening a hunger strike if camping migrants aren't moved by the end of the year. They say trash is everywhere and worse, women are being harassed regularly on the street.</p><p>Mark Steyn is an author and columnist who has followed what's happening in Europe for some time, and he joins us tonight.</p><p>So, Mark, you see videos like that from Sweden and you realized that this is not the continent that you pictured, that it really is completely different because of immigration trends. Are the authorities in Europe -- I know you spent a lot of time over there -- aware of this? Do they care? Is there a public conversation about this?</p><p>MARK STEYN, BESTSELLING AUTHOR: Well, Tony Blair was asked by the late Christopher Hitchens about my book and whether the demographic trends in Europe were part of what he called the public conversation, the European conversation with his fellow prime ministers. And Tony Blair gave a very revealing answer, I thought. He said it's part of the subterranean conversation.</p><p>CARLSON: Right. Exactly.</p><p>STEYN: In other words, Europe's leaders haven't figured out a way to talk about this in public. I know Malmo very well. I've been there once or twice a year for the last 15 years. And the reason I go to Malmo is because it was the first Christian City in what was then Denmark, and it's now going to be the first Muslim City in Sweden. And I do something that I first did at the suggestion of a couple of those Swedish blondes you were mentioning, the Abigails (ph), Brett Ecklund, those kinds of girls that you were talking about earlier.</p><p>That they made one evening to me -- and the twilight I walked from downtown Malmo to Rosen Guard, which is the big Muslim sobered and the Swedish blondes fan out and the covered women and the bearded men come towards you until eventually you are in a part of Sweden in which there are no uncovered women, and in which Muslim women who have come from Muslim countries where they didn't have to go covered, such as Bosnia, suddenly find they have to go covered when they immigrate to Sweden.</p><p>That walk as the blondes thin out and the big bearded men come towards you and have a greater numbers. That is Europe's future walking towards you. And I would -- it's the biggest story of our time.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>STEYN: But Christendom is being transformed at an extraordinary level to the point where Swedes will be an ethnic minority in their own country by mid-century.</p><p>CARLSON: What I don't understand, why is no one allowed to talk about it? I mean, if Swedes or Danes or Fins were flooding into Jordan and displacing the native population and forcing people to follow their Christian practices and obey their cultural imperatives, their mores, I think liberals here would say, well, no, you can't do that, it's their country. Why is it different when it happens in Europe or the United States?</p><p>STEYN: Right. Well, you actually see it in the United States when they talk about New Orleans no longer being a chocolate city because too many white people have moved in. If you remember, that was one of the headlines a few years ago.</p><p>CARLSON: I do remember. Yes.</p><p>STEYN: And I think the problem of course is the, you, the minute you raise it, you get accused of being racist. The minute you talk about it with any degree of honesty, that deputy leader of Britain first that you mentioned a couple of days ago, the police in Belfast flew all the way to London to arrest her, put her on a plane, take her back to Belfast for something she said in a speech at Belfast City Hall. Swedes are particularly dishonest about it.</p><p>The wealthy Swedes, the minute their area gets like those scenes you were showing in Paris where there's too many migrants in the neighborhood starts to change, they move out to all-white suburbs and all-white villages, and the moment they are there they vote evermore enthusiastically in polls about how wonderful multiculturalism is. The more they move away from it, the more they are in favor of it.</p><p>CARLSON: Of course, because it doesn't affect them. But if you intentionally set out to create an environment in which violent nationalism would flower, wouldn't this be it?</p><p>STEYN: Absolutely. I mean, the first duty of the political class is prudence.</p><p>CARLSON: Exactly.</p><p>STEYN: And you don't extinguish prudence for Utopian delusions. And the reality is that as people know in almost any part of the world, that the minute you have Islam as 15-20 percent of your population, the mediation of relations between Islam and the rest of society becomes your principal domestic consideration, as is happening in front of our eyes in Sweden, in the Netherlands, in France, and Germany, and the United Kingdom.</p><p>CARLSON: And it will happen here. The first duty of the political class is prudence. I'm getting that tattooed.</p><p>STEYN: Absolutely.</p><p>CARLSON: And I'm giving you credit when I get it. Mark Steyn, it's great to see you.</p><p>STEYN: That is the great tramp stamp to get. I recommend that, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: It's true. Thank you.</p><p>CNN, ABC, \"The Washington Post\" all went above and beyond in an effort to win the President's fake news contest. Who won? We will tell you, next.</p><p>CARLSON: A couple of weeks ago, President Trump made the following, pretty amusing proposal on Twitter. Quote, \"We should have a contest as to which of the networks, plus CNN, not including FOX, is the most dishonest, corrupt and or distorted in its political coverage of your favorite president (me). They are all bad. Winner to receive fake news trophy!</p><p>It seems like a joke then. But apparently the other networks took it very seriously and started working to win. CNN hike the Wikileaks bombshell that went absolutely nowhere. ABC had to suspend Brian Ross after he falsely claimed evidence of pre-election collusion between Trump and Russia, even though Dave Weigel of \"The Washington Post,\" who now has a mustache got involved.</p><p>Used a misleading photo to suggest Trump's rally in Pensacola was MD rather than packed. It was quite a week for the press but instead of pausing for self-reflection, David Frum of \"The Atlantic\" said these bungle stories prove the importance of trusting the media.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DAVID FRUM, \"THE ATLANTIC\": The mistakes are precisely the reason that people should trust the media. Astronomers make mistakes all the time because Science is a process of discovery of truth. Astrologers never make mistakes, or at least they never own up to them because what they are offering is a closed system of ideology and propaganda.</p><p>CARLSON: So the mistakes are the reason you ought to trust the accuracy. Is it brilliantly counterintuitive or just stupid? That's the question.</p><p>Joe Concha writes about media for \"The Hill.\" Mollie Hemingway is a senior editor at \"The Federalist\" and they both join us tonight.</p><p>Mollie, first to you. I don't begrudge anybody the right to make a mistake once in a while, I've made a ton of them for sure. I just can't help but notice that all the mistakes that the different channels are making are in the same direction. All mistakes seem to be kind of solidifying liberal views on things.</p><p>MOLLIE HEMINGWAY, SENIOR EDITOR, \"THE FEDERALIST\": Right. And just in this last week alone, you mentioned a few of the stories, but you didn't even get all of the stories that there were mistakes.</p><p>CARLSON: No.</p><p>HEMINGWAY: A false report about Deutsche Bank subpoenaing Trump financial accounts.</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>HEMINGWAY: I mean, there's many, and \"The New York Times\" said that K.T. McFarland had admitted collusion. She did not admit collusion. All these stories go in the same ways. So, they want us to believe that these areas are just routine and they are just something that happens occasionally. Why are they all going in the same direction? If they truly were just accidents or things that happened as part of the job, you would expect to see errors go in different directions.</p><p>Errors that make Trump look good as well as bad. Or you would have expected to have seen the same level of erroneous reporting on Barack Obama. We did not say that.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes. I don't remember seeing that at all.</p><p>So, Joe, again, people make mistakes, but if you are consistently wrong and if you're way out over your skis making predictions that don't match reality, in any other business you would be demoted or at least asked to take some time off. You would be fired from the military. No one ever gets fired in the media except for groping others at Christmas parties. Have you noticed that?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>JOE CONCHA, THE HILL: Well, Brian Ross to get a four-week suspension. So, let's be clear about that.</p><p>CARLSON: He did. That's true.</p><p>CONCHA: And the CNN case there, there were no suspensions or reprimands in that particular instance. I keep hearing, and I saw the story in the press briefing today, that reporters are saying, look, we just made mistakes, we're just trying to get to the truth. The problem is, there is a rush to get to that every time and to see an example is perfect with the Wikileaks story because remember, the network went ahead with information that was read to them. And then \"The Washington Post\" did the right thing.</p><p>They actually got the document that showed that the information was false in an essence that Donald Trump, Jr. and Trump associates receive that information ten days later. In other words, they took a little more effort, and took a little more time and actually got the document. Now, and one more point, by the way, in terms of we hear about unnamed sources. Right? These aren't innocent whistle-blowers. These are political operatives.</p><p>They may even be lawmakers themselves. And they realize now, they can weaponize false information because you have reporters that are like that, Jim Comey analogy, used earlier in the year, seagulls of at the beach that will eat anything and gobble it up regardless of the quality or even know what they are eating. And let me give you one more stat, Jim Sciutto who is foreign affairs correspondent for CNN, he pushed out the story like everybody does when their network got a big exclusive. And that got 2,300 re-tweets and 3,300 likes on Twitter.</p><p>He then sends out the correction saying, no, no, no, we got it wrong and this is what the story actually says. Remember the re-tweets that got? Fifty two. And only 148 likes. I'm not very good at math, but I believe that's about two percent. So, that is the thing. The allegation always trumps the exoneration.</p><p>CARLSON: So, Mollie, the substance of the stories, maybe not the ridiculous Russia story or how many people went to some Trump rally like in the end, who cares. But what if, you know, if we were in a war where there were like an actual crisis in this country and nobody trusted media outlets, what with that due to our society?</p><p>HEMMINGWAY: It is a very dangerous thing to not be able to trust a media outlet or have a general confidence that the media will get a story right. But I actually think the substance is key here. What we've seen for the last year is an obsession with a story about treasonous collusion with Russia to steal an election. The substance of that is so important. It has undermined legitimately elected president and it has been something that the media have been hammering on day after day. I mean, multiple stories a day.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>HEMMINGWAY: What if the real scandal is that that itself was an information operation and that it was weaponized and it was distributed through the media and our media people either willingly fell for it, or unwittingly fell for it. Either of those scenarios is extremely dangerous and it doesn't feel like we have a media complex capable of really digging into the significance of that story.</p><p>CARLSON: Right. Because you're incapable of self-reflection. And I actually start to think that's exactly what it was. I wish we had more time. Mollie, Joe, thank you both.</p><p>CONCHA: Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: It's been a turbulent contest to put it mildly, but Alabama Senate race finally ends tomorrow. Democrats are making the contest all about race, weirdly. One African-American Jones Motor disagrees with that. He's from Birmingham, Alabama, and he's here to explain what's going on, next.</p><p>CARLSON: This is a <person><nameText>FOX News </nameText></person>alert. I'm Trace Gallagher. A pipe bomb attack shaking the heart of New York City. The suspect inspired by ISIS set off the crew device in a crowded subway passageway at the height of the morning rush hour. Authorities say the bomb was packed with explosive powder but failed to turn the pipe into shrapnel. The suspect, 27-year-old Akayed Ullah who is in the U.S. on a family visa from Bangladesh was the only one who suffered serious injuries.</p><p>While the massive wildfire burning in the foothill towns near Santa Barbara exploding in size. This is now the fifth-largest fire in California history. The flames forcing tens of thousands of people from their homes. So far more than 750 buildings have been destroyed but the strong Santa Ana winds have died down a bit allowing firefighters to get the upper hand on other fires burning in Southern California.</p><p>I'm Trace Gallagher, now back to TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT.</p><p>CARLSON: We are just a day away from what seems like the longest political contest in human history. The Alabama special Senate election race. Democratic Senate candidate <person><nameText>Doug Jones </nameText></person>facing blowback tonight over mailers his campaign sent out last week. Those flyers showed an image of an incredulous black man and asked, quote, \"If a black man went after high school girls, anyone would try to make him a senator.\"</p><p>Eric Guster is a lawyer from Alabama. He is a <person><nameText>Doug Jones </nameText></person>supporter, voted for him, an absentee ballot, he joins us tonight.</p><p>So, Eric, it seems to me there are a lot of reasons that Democrats might want to vote against Roy Moore. But why these flyers telling black voters he's a racist? Why not go after him on the issues?</p><p>ERIC GUSTER, CIVIL RIGHTS ATTORNEY: Actually <person><nameText>Doug Jones </nameText></person>has gone against Roy Moore on the issues such as Roy Moore's, his civil rights history and some of the things such as he wanted to keep segregation a language in the constitution. Those are issues that <person><nameText>Doug Jones </nameText></person>has brought out on the flyer, I did not like that flyer, but he has promoted his campaign and he has marketed to African-American communities as well as other Democratic bases to get them out the vote.</p><p>CARLSON: But what I find I guess insulting about this, and I'm not African-American nor a Democrat, so I'm just sort of watching from the outside. But it seems insulting kind of that, I mean, if someone tried to get my vote by making it all about, you know, someone who's against white people, whatever, I would say, okay, but where is he on tax rates? Do you know what I mean? It seems like this is a very tired way to campaign, you see it a lot. Why do it in this race?</p><p>GUSTER: Everybody is doing it. Luther Strange, when Luther Strange got beat down by Roy Moore, Luther Strange was one of the most race baiting campaigns I've ever seen. Roy Moore has done it in a way in which he talked about immigration and building a wall. I mean, he has all these brown people on camera to say, we don't like them. That is what his campaign is based upon.</p><p>CARLSON: Luther Strange is not running for anything now.</p><p>GUSTER: No. But I'm telling you.</p><p>CARLSON: When Luther Strange ran a racist campaign against Roy Moore in the primary, that doesn't even make sense given the demographics of Alabama. I don't even know what you're talking about.</p><p>GUSTER: And that's what he did! It did make sense. That's the beauty of it.</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>GUSTER: Because he was trying to create racially charged -- he was trying to create the campaign to make it racially charged and that's what he did and he got whipped. However, now we have Roy Moore who is doing something similar.</p><p>CARLSON: Here's the point --</p><p>GUSTER: I'm trying to educate you about it.</p><p>CARLSON: There are a lot of reasons that you might be against Roy Moore. I think you could take his accuser seriously, you might not like his position on X, Y, or Z, but he's not trying to bring segregation back to Alabama and you would have to be dumb to think that he is. I mean, let's just be honest.</p><p>GUSTER: Hold on, Tucker. I did not say that.</p><p>CARLSON: I don't think you said that.</p><p>GUSTER: No.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CARLSON: You didn't say that but the Jones campaign is saying that.</p><p>GUSTER: I didn't say that.</p><p>CARLSON: I don't think you did that. The Jones campaign.</p><p>GUSTER: Okay. I'm making sure.</p><p>CARLSON: Right. Absolutely.</p><p>GUSTER: Right. No, no. Jones is nothing he wanted to bring back segregation, that is not what he said. <person><nameText>Doug Jones </nameText></person>is bringing out the fact that Roy Moore wanted to keep segregation a language in our Alabama constitution. That is a major issues for so many people including blacks and whites because we want to get rid of that language and Roy Moore supported it.</p><p>CARLSON: Okay. But no one is trying to bring back -- I mean, that's a debate about language. But its real-life implications are pretty much zero. Nobody is trying to bring segregation back to the state of Alabama. No one in this race.</p><p>GUSTER: Nobody.</p><p>CARLSON: No non-crazy person is trying to do that. And so, it's not really about that. This is about trying to scare people and it doesn't seem like it's necessary, and it leads to lasting wounds that don't go away. So, why do that? And why do it in every single race?</p><p>GUSTER: I don't know why Roy Moore is trying to scare people into voting for him. I don't know why Roy Moore is trying to scare people into voting for him. Because that's what his ads are portraying. They are trying to scare people about immigrants, trying to make the immigration -- the people who need immigration, the immigration bogeyman. But both sides have gone low bar with their mailers and with their ads. I do say that. But I do support Jones.</p><p>CARLSON: Here's the difference. You should be afraid of our immigration policy, because of what happened this morning in New York, what happened last week in Sweden. I mean, it's not a racial question. You can be terrified of our immigration policy and not being a racist.</p><p>GUSTER: Hold on. Why are you saying we should be terrified about it?</p><p>CARLSON: Because we're not vetting people letting in here. And it's making the country poorer and more dangerous. It's not a race attack, it's a statement of fact and you are not a bigot for saying that.</p><p>GUSTER: That's not true. No it's not. I appreciate you saying that, but it's not true.</p><p>CARLSON: You appreciate it. Eric Guster, thanks for coming on. I appreciate it.</p><p>Richard Goodstein advised both of Hillary Clinton's presidential campaigns and he joins us now. So, this, I guess what bugs me -- and I'm not taking up the cudgel on behalf of Roy Moore, I'm just pointing out that like you don't need to do this. You could run a series of ads against Roy Moore about him being impeached as a judge or about the accusations currently against him. You don't have to pretend that he some kind of Klansman or George Wallace replica, because he's not. Why are they doing this?</p><p>RICHARD GOODSTEIN, FORMER HILLARY CAMPAIGN ADVISER: Well, I mean, ask Richard Shelby why he said not only could he not vote for Roy Moore, but he didn't think other people should and he didn't think Roy Moore represented what Alabama should. I mean, and he's not talking about race. I mean, look, <person><nameText>Doug Jones </nameText></person>--</p><p>CARLSON: You're making my point for me.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Okay, I'm saying --</p><p>CARLSON: Why didn't <person><nameText>Doug Jones </nameText></person>do that?</p><p>GOODSTEIN: <person><nameText>Doug Jones </nameText></person>has said that the mailer speaks for itself. But in an odd way, Roy Moore is the one who introduced raised by talking about how, when America was great again, it's when there was slavery because families were together. Roy Moore is the one who said, we should abolish all the amendment after the tenth, which would mean no 13th, no abolition of slavery. No 15th, no right to vote. You know, dependent on race. No 19th Amendment because giving women the right to vote. Et cetera, et cetera. So, if anybody is kind of putting race in, it's Roy Moore. And nobody is suggesting we go back to these things.</p><p>CARLSON: No. Okay. And that's kind of the point.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Right.</p><p>CARLSON: You can agree or disagree with Moore on a whole bunch of things but to compare them to George Wallace or to suggest, as this flyer does that he wants to bring segregation back. He hasn't suggested that, there's no evidence he wants that. And whenever you say something like that it makes people more afraid, it divides the country in ways that are permanent. I don't why Democrats persisting campaigning that way. Every single campaign.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Yes. So, all I'm saying is, I don't think a statement in 2011 about doing away with every -- and passed the tenth. Okay. This was not ancient history. This is a relatively recent comment.</p><p>CARLSON: Wouldn't it be easier to ask Roy Moore? Look, are you for limiting people's --</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Roy Moore is lying about these women. What you say asking? Roy Moore can't, you know, kind of level with people about what he did with these women.</p><p>CARLSON: But on a policy question, it's really simple. I've never just thought people persist in like assuming what other people think when you can just ask. Roy Moore, whatever you think of them, is pretty upfront about what he thinks. You believe on the women, I get it.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Right.</p><p>CARLSON: But on his beliefs, he's willing to say the most unfashionable things. Why don't -- hey, Roy Moore, should everyone over the age of 18 would be allowed to vote, without a felony record, I think he would probably say, yes.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Yes. What I am saying is, Richard Shelby, the other senator has as much at stake and who that other position is going to be anybody including Donald Trump. And even he couldn't bring himself to vote for Roy Moore.</p><p>CARLSON: My point is, not that every decent person asked to vote for Roy Moore, I don't think that actually. I'm just saying that in campaign after campaign after campaign, Democrats have only one pitch to African-American voters, and that is the other side hates you because of your race.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: And I just think over time that divides the country, I think in a lot of cases is totally untrue. It is the sleaziest way to campaign. Why keep doing it?</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Could you blame a black voter for looking at Roy Moore's record? Looking at the fact that Roy Moore wouldn't dare step foot in a black community to campaign. He is not even in the state to campaign. The fact that Roy Moore can't bring himself to speak to black voters and that he takes these positions that are so antithetical, to the essence of black voters saying, slavery was the time we want to make America great back to.</p><p>CARLSON: He didn't say slavery was, look, you are not going to get me in a position where I'm defending everything Roy Moore said. I'm just saying, he didn't actually endorse slavery.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Of course, I'm not saying he did.</p><p>CARLSON: Why not attack his views on, I don't know, tax rates, or something real?</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Yes. But the question was, when was America great again? And what does he go to? He go to the time of slavery. So, again, it's not <person><nameText>Doug Jones.</nameText></person></p><p>CARLSON: You think Roy Moore is for slavery?</p><p>I think Roy Moore has this fantasized view that yes, that's when America was at its best. We had slavery, but in his adult view, families were close, which is hideous.</p><p>CARLSON: Do you think Roy Moore -- you don't think he's for slavery? You don't have the evidence he is a racist.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: I'm looking at what Roy Moore said.</p><p>CARLSON: No. But let's just be real for a second. Do you have evidence he's a racist? You don't. He's never said anything that's racist. He said a lot of things that people may disagree with, but why call him a racist, that's all I'm asking.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: I think people of color find it deeply offensive when he says, when we had America great again was at a time of slavery. So, is that racist?</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Fundamentally.</p><p>CARLSON: Do you think black voters at all feel patronized by white liberals -- the only pitch they ever make is that the other side is racist. Don't you think some black voters think, why don't you just treat me like a normal person and like tell me about how you're going to make the schools better or make the roads better or lower my taxes, or some normal issue. Do you ever think that they feel patronized by that?</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Yes. Actually, I don't think that's the message. It's about health care, it's about jobs. It's about pay, it's about income equality.</p><p>CARLSON: I wish it works. Those are real issues. Those are real messages. I never hear them, but maybe they are out there.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Well, I think they are, but time will tell.</p><p>CARLSON: Richard, thank you.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: After years of calling a whole story a sham, Planned Parenthood is now facing a federal investigation for possibly selling baby parts, which they appear to have been doing. The man who first exposed this horrifying scandal joins us next.</p><p>CARLSON: America's largest abortion provider, Planned Parenthood, is now under federal investigation by the Department of Justice for selling fetal body parts. Allegations against the group first surfaced when the center for medical progress, that is anti-abortion organization, published footage of Planned Parenthood employees discussing the trade in fetal body parts. And it was nauseating.</p><p>This is the first time we ever heard of the story, it could be because the rest of the press is not interested in covering it, so they don't. We spoke to David Gladden, who leads the center for medical progress on the subject.</p><p>David, thanks for joining us.</p><p>DAVID GLADDEN, CENTER FOR MEDICAL PROGRESS: Hey, Tucker. Great to be on.</p><p>CARLSON: What exactly is the DOJ looking into, what are the allegations?</p><p>GLADDEN: Sure. So, the DOJ is just doing their job and doing exactly what they should be doing, which is following up on two very good comprehensive investigations that were done by the Senate Judiciary Committee and by the House Select Investigative panel into Planned Parenthood's participation in the harvesting and sale of aborted baby body parts with multiple for-profit companies that they were engaged with for about five years, and sometimes even longer.</p><p>CARLSON: So Planned Parenthood was involved in the sale of human parts, that's illegal. We've known this for a long time, and yet as far as I know the only people to face legal consequences so far have been members of your group, which brought this to light, is that correct?</p><p>GLADDEN: So far Planned Parenthood's political allies in California have brought a series of totally bogus charges against myself and one of my investigative colleagues. Those are being litigated in California right now. But now Planned Parenthood is going to have to face the wheels of justice themselves because the Justice Department is doing their job. They are following up on some very damning evidence, both documents and other kinds of evidence that uncovered by the Congressional investigations.</p><p>And Planned Parenthood is going to have to answer very serious questions about why their medical directors are in those documents endorsing advertisements from companies like stem express promising a financial profit to abortion clinics when they provide body parts. Why they are signing contracts that value Planned Parenthood's abortion body parts inventory up to the millions of dollars.</p><p>There is a lot of very damning, and incriminating evidence in those documents that now the Department of Justice is going to have access to. And Planned Parenthood is going to have to face the consequences for that under the law.</p><p>CARLSON: I mean, presumably you could be for Roe v. Wade and still horrified by the idea of selling baby parts, as any prominent Democrat denounced this that you've seen?</p><p>GLADDEN: I think the pro-life Democrats that are out there needs to speak out pretty loudly now and those who are pro-choice and who supports abortion rights need to speak out and differentiate themselves from Planned Parenthood.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>GLADDEN: From the radical abortion extremists there who think that pro- choice means any abortion, anytime, anywhere, up to nine months, selling the body parts afterwards using partial-birth abortions to get intact body parts.</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>GLADDEN: That is the fate of Planned Parenthood today that is funded by taxpayers by up to half of billion and dollars every year and that needs to stop.</p><p>CARLSON: Committing abortions for sex election, which they explicitly allow at their clinics. So, I guess the question is, has any prominent Democrat denounced this? Any?</p><p>GLADDEN: You would have to ask them. You know, I just saw my own Senator Dianne Feinstein from the state of California, just issued a statement today in support of Planned Parenthood. Even in the face of them facing an investigation, a federal investigation from the Department of Justice now for their years long scheme with companies like stem express and advanced bioscience resources, and other laboratories to harvest and sell tiny baby hearts, lungs, livers and brains from their late-term abortions.</p><p>So, unfortunately the most prominent people who were in Planned Parenthood's corner still seem to be with them. And it's really a problem because the evidence is not going to be able to be kept under wraps and to be kept covered up forever. Planned Parenthood's allies in high places like Judge Orrick who is the federal judge in San Francisco --</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>GLADDEN: -- overseeing their lawsuits over to me. He has a long history of affiliation with Planned Parenthood. He helped open and run and fund a Planned Parenthood clinic in San Francisco that is now part of the affiliate that is suing me in his courtroom.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>GLADDEN: He needs to recuse himself, he still hasn't on that. And he's the one that is trying to keep the remaining videotapes under wrap, which are now going to be all the more relevant in light of the federal DOJ investigation.</p><p>CARLSON: Fifty years from now, his ancestors will be ashamed and so will Dianne Feinstein's of what they're doing right now. And I appreciate everything you're doing. Thank you.</p><p>GLADDEN: Thanks, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: David, thank you. U.S. tech companies are more powerful than any corporations in human history. What's the right way to rein them in and if indeed they should be reined in at all? The chairman of the FCC joins us, next.</p><p>CARLSON: You think of the FCC as kind of an obscure federal body, not anymore. It's under attack now for its plans to repeal an Obama era regulation known as net neutrality. A lot of people, a lot of famous people have very strong opinions about net neutrality. They warn if it is repealed a handful of tech companies will have total control over the internet. Wait, doesn't that already describe the status quo?</p><p>Ajit Pai, FCC chairman of the FCC, he's been at the center of a lot of criticism recently and he joins us tonight. Great to see you.</p><p>AJIT PAI, FCC CHAIRMAN: Great to see you, too.</p><p>CARLSON: So, here's and I actually don't think this, but here's the line, that if net neutrality is rolled back, that a handful of companies will be able to control content and if they don't like what they are seeing or you're broadcasting, they can shut it down. Should we be worried about that?</p><p>PAI: No, I think what net neutrality repealed would actually mean is that we once again have a free and open internet. The government will not be regulating how internet service providers, how anyone else in the internet economy manages the network. And so, I think we had that free market approach for 20 years, starting in President Clinton's time --</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>PAI: 1996, all the way through 2015. The internet wasn't broken when the Obama FCC decided, tried to fix it. And we've seen the effects of these regulations over the last two years. It's made for worse infrastructure investments, less innovation and I think that's part of the reason why these regulations need to be repealed.</p><p>CARLSON: Right. But I guess those changes were in the middle of the biggest witch-hunt in American history. And corporations are complicit in that. So, what would happen if this is repealed and the Southern Poverty Law Center says, you know, I saw <person><nameText>FOX News </nameText></person>the other night. That is hate speech, internet service provider shut them down. What would prevent the service provider from doing that?</p><p>PAI: Well, one thing is that the FCC requires transparency. If any ISP engaged in that kind of conduct they would have to disclose it. Additionally the Federal Trade Commission would have jurisdiction over it. But I think you've actually put your finger on something that is very important that I talked to you about. Where is the real threat to the free and open internet? And one of the things that the people have suggested is, it's not internet service providers, and some of the content companies that decide what you see on the internet and more importantly what you don't see. Where is the transparency there? Shouldn't we have a conversation that involves them as well?</p><p>CARLSON: Why don't we? So, you have two companies, Google and Facebook to control 90 percent of all digital ad dollars. That means they basically control all news on the internet. Nobody ever says anything about it, nobody appears worried by it. Why is that?</p><p>PAI: I'm not sure why. But you do see rumblings on Capitol Hill, members of both parties in both houses are a little bit worried about what's going on in the internet in terms of transparency and how some of these decisions are being made. And I two have some of these concerns, that when Twitter for example restricted Congresswoman Marsha Blackburn's video announcing her run for the Senate in part because of her pro-life views and same thing with YouTube demonetizing Diamond and Silk, some Trump supporters and Dennis Prager's videos. I mean, a lot of these decisions impinge on the free expression online that we've all come to cherish, but there's no real transparency into how these decisions are made.</p><p>CARLSON: And there's never any outcry, whereas there is with net neutrality. And again, I'm not even sure what I think of it, but it does seem like someone is spending a lot of money to lobby public opinion on the subject, the opinions of famous people. Is it the big tech companies lobbying against?</p><p>PAI: I'm not sure who exactly is funding all of these things, but what I can say is that hysteria has reached a pitch which is completely disproportionate to the facts. I mean, as I said, we weren't living in the broken internet in 2015. All of these harms that these celebrities are talking about are all hypothetical. There's no market failure here. Internet service providers are not, and have not, blocked content willy- nilly. And we are confident going forward that given the robust rules that we have and the Federal Trade Commission has, they won't going forward.</p><p>CARLSON: And so, we know, Facebook, Google and Twitter have blocked content willy-nilly and continue to and nobody does anything about it. Mr. Pai, thank you for coming on. Great to see you.</p><p>PAI: Thanks, good to see you too.</p><p>CARLSON: We will be back in just a minute.</p><p>CARLSON: An hour passed already. We enjoyed it. Tune in each night at eight to the show that is the sworn enemy of lying, pomposity, smugness and group think. DVR it if you can figure that out and above all join us tomorrow.</p><p>HANNITY starts right now.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FOXNWS-2017121101cb260</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXNWS2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5R59-RPV1-JB20-G3XV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">174179</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-01-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7478\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Fox News Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>Fox News Network</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"12\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>December 11, 2017 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Show</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>PLANNED PARENTHOOD FEDERATION OF AMERICA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>US DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Terrorism</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Government</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Politics</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Health and Medicine</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>New York</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Bombing</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Police</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Wildfire</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>California</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Alabama</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Elections</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Doug Jones</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Computer &amp;

These companies make organizations register to Tech Soup before giving out these perks. It seems to Terry, that this has become a way for big-tech companies to suppress opposing viewpoints.

He was once known as America's \"Abortion King\" and is the father of America's abortion industry. <br/><br/>Terry promised Dr. Nathanson that she would reveal the truth of how he deceived America's media, courts, legislators, doctors, clergy and public with the insidious lie that abortion is synonymous to \"women's healthcare.\"<br/><br/>Right before his death, Dr. Nathanson asked her to tell America the cofounder of NARAL says Abortion is not love - the world needs more love, stop the killing and love one another.<br/><br/>To help fulfill this promise, Terry established Hosea Initiative, an educational 501(c)3 organization. She named the organization after the Bible verse Hosea 4:6 \"My people are destroyed for lack to knowledge.\" <br/><br/>Company <url normalizedValue=\"mailto:info@hosea4you.org\">info@hosea4you.org</url>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.Hosea4You.org\">www.Hosea4You.org</url><br/><br/>SOURCE Hosea Initiative<br/><br/>CONTACT: Peter, 703-862-1970,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"mailto:info@hosea4you.org\">info@hosea4you.org</url><br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><contact><bodyText><p><br/><br/>CONTACT: P.O.

Bloomberg LP cannot guarantee its accuracy.)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">TOM KEENE, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR: Terry Haines with us with Evercore ISI. Terry, let's do this two-part question. One is, what does Washington do is it migrate 63 days to a midterm election. And then, the second part of the question, is what does Washington do if they have a president who could careless?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Let's start with what the belt way does, inside the belt way, given 63 days, five hours, 11 minutes and 4 seconds till the election.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">TERRY HAINES, SENIOR POLITICAL STRATEGIST, EVERCORE ISI: Oh, the 4 second, all important. The -- well, they did -- they do a couple of things. They -- what they do, first of all, a lot of this is keeping the train running a force physically, and otherwise they going to pass a new spending bill for fiscal 2019 that will be essentially a kick the can until after the election, not all the appreciation bills are done.</p><p>They, of course, judge -- a lot of us going to do this month is, get Judge Kavanaugh's confirmation in train. And the majority of them, Majority there, McConnell says he wants to finalize Kavanaugh's vote by -- as he put it, by the end of the fiscal year. I look for that -- I look at that as --</p><p>KEENE: Right.</p><p>HAINES: -- setting up potentially interesting confluence. I still see the spending as likely in the past. But, you know, it's going to be Democrats are demonstrating on that, that sort of thing within the next month.</p><p>KEENE: But then, let's get to the second part which is an original president who doesn't really care that it's 63 days till the election, does he?</p><p>HAINES: Well, I think he does. You know, but how I read this -- how I read the famous Session tweets over the weekend --</p><p>KEENE: Please.</p><p>HAINES: -- their potential exit ramp should the midterm in not, you know, particularly well. And as past presidents will tell you -- their first midterm, never go particularly well. So, you know, they are with loses and (inaudible) and the like. So, you know, I think he said (inaudible) to take credits, you know, it's a classical political sense, take credit for whatever good happens. And then, look for the (inaudible) and start building those too, if things don't go well.</p><p>JONATHAN FERRO, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR: Terry, how difficult would it be to replace Jeff Sessions?</p><p>KEENE: That's a good question.</p><p>HAINES: I don't think -- it is a good question. I don't think it would be the difficult tough. But, you know, the dilemma for the White House is that, anybody confirmable is going to have to essentially say that the Mueller probe was going to continue, because if the Mueller probe isn't going to continue, that nominee isn't going to get confirmed even by a Republican Majority Senate. So --</p><p>FERRO: What was going to be McConnell (inaudible), anyone confirmable, anybody that the President would want to nominate?</p><p>HAINES: You know, in the end I think so. The President seems to blame sanctions for the existence of the Mueller probe to begin with. But once you -- once you get pass that, I think that it is entirely possible to get somebody, who is -- confirmable. And, you know, this is always advising in Senate and did part of the advise is going to be, even by people who the President considered his friends, instead of Graham and the like. That, look, you need to get somebody in here who is confirmable, and they are going to have to state somethings about Mueller you're not going to like.</p><p>KEENE: Within any number of articles, Terry -- and if you're just joining us, of course, Terry Haines, Evercore ISI with us. As you look at Washington, one of the themes over the weekend reading, was the sustainability of President Trump's movement, and you can define that anywhere you want, whether you do or do not support. The president, is your Washington, Terry Haines, operating under Donald Trump as the one off or is there a real sustainability to the kind of issues that he believes him with his core constituency?</p><p>HAINES: That also is a very good question because I think what -- I think the Washington that I operate and sees Trump and those issues as not the same thing. I've always said that Trump and Congressional Republicans are operating, going to coalesce from government. And that they happen to coalesce around a few different issues that both sides believe in.</p><p>And, you know, and that comes down to the economy. I mean, it's actually was all about -- was all about that coalition for example. But, you know, on a lot of other things, they don't. The president's real problem is that, he sees it as a secondary important to broaden this coalition out beyond the true believers. And that is not something that is sustainable in the long run.</p><p>And, you know, it will lead to some midterm reverses in my view. My general idea of the midterms right now is that, Democrats gain and tiny. And I mean, tiny, 10 feet or less majority in the House. And, you know, which is not really majority at all. And secondly, that Republicans probably would take up a couple of seats in the Senate.</p><p>FERRO: Yes.</p><p>HAINES: You know, but one thing that casual observers like they call them, so yes. And you can look at the 2016 election that says the most recent group from this is that, the elections in this country are generally not nationalized. The national, you know, what goes on like Trump and national environment has something to do with it, but it's not determinant of the way it is and other western democracies that are more legislative standards, UK and other countries.</p><p>FERRO: Sorry -- I just wanted to fill in a final question on a final topic. This will be some high profile talks this week, hearings. One of the Senate about Russian interference and the other in the house about bias against conservative voices on social media platforms, to understand the Sandberg and Dorsey heading over to D.C. tomorrow. This gets up in more juicy now to Steve Bannon was disinvited to the New Yorker Festival. How are these social media platform is going to stand up against this?</p><p>HAINES: I have always thought, Jon, always, back to the Facebook revelation six months ago. That this is not a Facebook problem, it was the social media big tech problem. And you're starting to see that from the fruition.</p><p>I think that it is not about and a lot of people in Washington will say it. It's not about the (inaudible) thing have conservative voices only. That's it is part of a larger media concern that voices on both sides are being silenced. And I think you're going to see a lot of that.</p><p>I don't think but honestly, with the regulation and the like, that's the rhetoric for midterm, none of that comes to fruition.</p><p>KEENE: Terry, thank you so much, great briefing.

But, you know, it's going to be Democrats are demonstrating on that, that sort of thing within the next month.</p><p>KEENE: But then, let's get to the second part which is an original president who doesn't really care that it's 63 days till the election, does he?</p><p>HAINES: Well, I think he does. You know, but how I read this -- how I read the famous Session tweets over the weekend --</p><p>KEENE: Please.</p><p>HAINES: -- their potential exit ramp should the midterm in not, you know, particularly well. And as past presidents will tell you -- their first midterm, never go particularly well. So, you know, they are with loses and (inaudible) and the like. So, you know, I think he said (inaudible) to take credits, you know, it's a classical political sense, take credit for whatever good happens. And then, look for the (inaudible) and start building those too, if things don't go well.</p><p>JONATHAN FERRO, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR: Terry, how difficult would it be to replace Jeff Sessions?</p><p>KEENE: That's a good question.</p><p>HAINES: I don't think -- it is a good question. I don't think it would be the difficult tough. But, you know, the dilemma for the White House is that, anybody confirmable is going to have to essentially say that the Mueller probe was going to continue, because if the Mueller probe isn't going to continue, that nominee isn't going to get confirmed even by a Republican Majority Senate. So --</p><p>FERRO: What was going to be McConnell (inaudible), anyone confirmable, anybody that the President would want to nominate?</p><p>HAINES: You know, in the end I think so. The President seems to blame sanctions for the existence of the Mueller probe to begin with. But once you -- once you get pass that, I think that it is entirely possible to get somebody, who is -- confirmable. And, you know, this is always advising in Senate and did part of the advise is going to be, even by people who the President considered his friends, instead of Graham and the like. That, look, you need to get somebody in here who is confirmable, and they are going to have to state somethings about Mueller you're not going to like.</p><p>KEENE: Within any number of articles, Terry -- and if you're just joining us, of course, Terry Haines, Evercore ISI with us. As you look at Washington, one of the themes over the weekend reading, was the sustainability of President Trump's movement, and you can define that anywhere you want, whether you do or do not support. The president, is your Washington, Terry Haines, operating under Donald Trump as the one off or is there a real sustainability to the kind of issues that he believes him with his core constituency?</p><p>HAINES: That also is a very good question because I think what -- I think the Washington that I operate and sees Trump and those issues as not the same thing. I've always said that Trump and Congressional Republicans are operating, going to coalesce from government. And that they happen to coalesce around a few different issues that both sides believe in.</p><p>And, you know, and that comes down to the economy. I mean, it's actually was all about -- was all about that coalition for example. But, you know, on a lot of other things, they don't. The president's real problem is that, he sees it as a secondary important to broaden this coalition out beyond the true believers. And that is not something that is sustainable in the long run.</p><p>And, you know, it will lead to some midterm reverses in my view. My general idea of the midterms right now is that, Democrats gain and tiny. And I mean, tiny, 10 feet or less majority in the House. And, you know, which is not really majority at all. And secondly, that Republicans probably would take up a couple of seats in the Senate.</p><p>FERRO: Yes.</p><p>HAINES: You know, but one thing that casual observers like they call them, so yes. And you can look at the 2016 election that says the most recent group from this is that, the elections in this country are generally not nationalized. The national, you know, what goes on like Trump and national environment has something to do with it, but it's not determinant of the way it is and other western democracies that are more legislative standards, UK and other countries.</p><p>FERRO: Sorry -- I just wanted to fill in a final question on a final topic. This will be some high profile talks this week, hearings.

This gets up in more juicy now to Steve Bannon was disinvited to the New Yorker Festival.

One is, what does Washington do is  it migrate 63 days to a midterm election.  And then, the second part of the  question, is what does Washington do if they have a president who could  careless?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Let's start with what the belt way does, inside the belt way, given 63  days, five hours, 11 minutes and 4 seconds till the election.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">TERRY HAINES, SENIOR POLITICAL STRATEGIST, EVERCORE ISI:  Oh, the 4 second,  all important.  The -- well, they did -- they do a couple of things.  They  -- what they do, first of all, a lot of this is keeping the train running a  force physically, and otherwise they going to pass a new spending bill for  fiscal 2019 that will be essentially a kick the can until after the  election, not all the appreciation bills are done.</p><p>They, of course, judge -- a lot of us going to do this month is, get Judge  Kavanaugh's confirmation in train.  And the majority of them, Majority  there, McConnell says he wants to finalize Kavanaugh's vote by -- as he put  it, by the end of the fiscal year.  I look for that -- I look at that as --</p><p>KEENE:  Right.</p><p>HAINES:  -- setting up potentially interesting confluence.  I still see the  spending as likely in the past.

Bloomberg LP cannot guarantee its  accuracy.)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">TOM KEENE, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR:  Terry Haines with us with Evercore ISI.   Terry, let's do this two-part question.  One is, what does Washington do is  it migrate 63 days to a midterm election.  And then, the second part of the  question, is what does Washington do if they have a president who could  careless?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Let's start with what the belt way does, inside the belt way, given 63  days, five hours, 11 minutes and 4 seconds till the election.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">TERRY HAINES, SENIOR POLITICAL STRATEGIST, EVERCORE ISI:  Oh, the 4 second,  all important.  The -- well, they did -- they do a couple of things.  They  -- what they do, first of all, a lot of this is keeping the train running a  force physically, and otherwise they going to pass a new spending bill for  fiscal 2019 that will be essentially a kick the can until after the  election, not all the appreciation bills are done.</p><p>They, of course, judge -- a lot of us going to do this month is, get Judge  Kavanaugh's confirmation in train.  And the majority of them, Majority  there, McConnell says he wants to finalize Kavanaugh's vote by -- as he put  it, by the end of the fiscal year.  I look for that -- I look at that as --</p><p>KEENE:  Right.</p><p>HAINES:  -- setting up potentially interesting confluence.  I still see the  spending as likely in the past.  But, you know, it's going to be Democrats  are demonstrating on that, that sort of thing within the next month.</p><p>KEENE:  But then, let's get to the second part which is an original  president who doesn't really care that it's 63 days till the election, does  he?</p><p>HAINES:  Well, I think he does.  You know, but how I read this -- how I  read the famous Session tweets over the weekend --</p><p>KEENE:  Please.</p><p>HAINES:  -- their potential exit ramp should the midterm in not, you know,  particularly well.  And as past presidents will tell you -- their first  midterm, never go particularly well.  So, you know, they are with loses and  (inaudible) and the like.  So, you know, I think he said (inaudible) to  take credits, you know, it's a classical political sense, take credit for  whatever good happens.  And then, look for the (inaudible) and start  building those too, if things don't go well.</p><p>JONATHAN FERRO, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR:  Terry, how difficult would it be to  replace Jeff Sessions?</p><p>KEENE:  That's a good question.</p><p>HAINES:  I don't think -- it is a good question.  I don't think it would be  the difficult tough.  But, you know, the dilemma for the White House is  that, anybody confirmable is going to have to essentially say that the  Mueller probe was going to continue, because if the Mueller probe isn't  going to continue, that nominee isn't going to get confirmed even by a  Republican Majority Senate.  So --</p><p>FERRO:  What was going to be McConnell (inaudible), anyone confirmable,  anybody that the President would want to nominate?</p><p>HAINES:  You know, in the end I think so.  The President seems to blame  sanctions for the existence of the Mueller probe to begin with.  But once  you -- once you get pass that, I think that it is entirely possible to get  somebody, who is -- confirmable.  And, you know, this is always advising in  Senate and did part of the advise is going to be, even by people who the  President considered his friends, instead of Graham and the like.  That,  look, you need to get somebody in here who is confirmable, and they are  going to have to state somethings about Mueller you're not going to like.</p><p>KEENE:  Within any number of articles, Terry -- and if you're just joining  us, of course, Terry Haines, Evercore ISI with us.  As you look at  Washington, one of the themes over the weekend reading, was the  sustainability of President Trump's movement, and you can define that  anywhere you want, whether you do or do not support.  The president, is  your Washington, Terry Haines, operating under Donald Trump as the one off  or is there a real sustainability to the kind of issues that he believes  him with his core constituency?</p><p>HAINES:  That also is a very good question because I think what -- I think  the Washington that I operate and sees Trump and those issues as not the  same thing.  I've always said that Trump and Congressional Republicans are  operating, going to coalesce from government.  And that they happen to  coalesce around a few different issues that both sides believe in.</p><p>And, you know, and that comes down to the economy.  I mean, it's actually  was all about -- was all about that coalition for example.  But, you know,  on a lot of other things, they don't.  The president's real problem is  that, he sees it as a secondary important to broaden this coalition out  beyond the true believers.  And that is not something that is sustainable  in the long run.</p><p>And, you know, it will lead to some midterm reverses in my view.  My  general idea of the midterms right now is that, Democrats gain and tiny.   And I mean, tiny, 10 feet or less majority in the House.  And, you know,  which is not really majority at all.  And secondly, that Republicans  probably would take up a couple of seats in the Senate.</p><p>FERRO:  Yes.</p><p>HAINES:  You know, but one thing that casual observers like they call them,  so yes.  And you can look at the 2016 election that says the most recent  group from this is that, the elections in this country are generally not  nationalized.  The national, you know, what goes on like Trump and national  environment has something to do with it, but it's not determinant of the  way it is and other western democracies that are more legislative  standards, UK and other countries.</p><p>FERRO:  Sorry -- I just wanted to fill in a final question on a final  topic.  This will be some high profile talks this week, hearings.  One of  the Senate about Russian interference and the other in the house about bias  against conservative voices on social media platforms, to understand the  Sandberg and Dorsey heading over to D.C. tomorrow.  This gets up in more  juicy now to Steve Bannon was disinvited to the New Yorker Festival.  How  are these social media platform is going to stand up against this?</p><p>HAINES:  I have always thought, Jon, always, back to the Facebook  revelation six months ago.  That this is not a Facebook problem, it was the  social media big tech problem.  And you're starting to see that from the  fruition.</p><p>I think that it is not about and a lot of people in Washington will say it.   It's not about the (inaudible) thing have conservative voices only.  That's  it is part of a larger media concern that voices on both sides are being  silenced.

The U.S. government and many environmentalists also view electric vehicles as key to combating climate change.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But the electric-vehicles revolution Musk and others envision depends on an immense escalation in the world's capacity to manufacture lithium-ion batteries, and the race for the raw materials to build those batteries is creating strains for people and the environment far from Silicon Valley, a Washington Post investigation has found.</p><p>The series of Post stories found that the manufacture of lithium-ion batteries - the power source for smartphones, laptops and electric cars - is linked to child labor in cobalt mines in Congo, severe air and water pollution around graphite plants in China and complaints of mistreatment of indigenous communities near lithium deposits in South \u00adAmerica.</p><p>The mining companies tied to these problems supply some of the largest manufacturers of \u00adlithium-ion batteries, The Post found. And some of those battery makers directly supply Tesla and other big tech giants.</p><p>In response to these concerns, Tesla denied that the sources of its battery materials are tainted by abuses. At the same time, the company declined to identify what those sources are.</p><p>\"Tesla is committed to ensuring all supply chain practices are safe and humane, that workers are treated with respect and dignity, and that manufacturing processes are environmentally responsible,\" according to a statement from the company.</p><p>Samsung, LG Chem and other consumer companies likewise reliant on lithium-ion batteries have issued similar assurances.</p><p>Yet The Post investigation showed that large consumer companies may not know where the raw materials come from. The paths that cobalt, graphite, lithium and other materials take from mines to batteries involve \u00admultiple stops, and tracking batteries to their origins can be a logistical maze.</p><p>Some nonprofit organizations trying to correct abuses in the global supply chain say they believe that few companies take the care required to trace their raw materials back to their source, let alone correct any abuses they would find there.</p><p>\"Most consumers have an expectation that their products are sourced responsibly,\" said Patricia Jurewicz, director of the Responsible Sourcing Network, a group that seeks to correct human rights abuses in the way raw materials are harvested and mined. But \"it's like we are walking around with our hands over our eyes.\"</p><p>\"All the brands we know are so far removed from the abuse,\" Jurewicz said. \"They don't buy raw materials. They don't even buy processed materials in the form of metals. There may be anywhere from three to seven tiers of suppliers and \u00adsub-suppliers.\"</p><p>While the abuses in the production of raw materials span many industries - from food to textiles to high tech - the anticipated growth in the electric-vehicle industry means the demand for the materials for lithium-ion batteries may be especially acute. The demand for raw materials for \u00adlithium-ion batteries is expected to more than triple over the next 10 years, according to some industry analysts. </p><p>While many consumers may assume their products emerge from companies that treat workers and the environment well, there are few legal requirements for companies to track their supply chains.</p><p>The best known effort to regulate mining is the U.S. law regarding four \"conflict minerals\" from the Congo region: tin, tungsten, tantalum and gold. The 2010 legislation, known as the Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, aimed to stem the flow of money from those materials to Congo's militias and requires U.S. companies to attempt to trace the sources of these materials.</p><p>But other minerals are not part of those requirements, leaving consumers to rely on company assurances that their supply chains are managed in a way that protects workers and the \u00adenvironment.</p><p>It is difficult, and in most cases impossible, to know whether major brands in the United States are fulfilling their promises.</p><p>As an example, The Post traced ways that disputed raw materials are reaching or could be reaching Panasonic, the company that supplies batteries for Tesla.</p><p>Graphite from polluting Chinese factories is sold to BTR, a Chinese company, that supplies Panasonic. Panasonic said it found and corrected a problem in its graphite supply chain.</p><p>Lithium from Sales de Jujuy, a mining company in Argentina that some indigenous communities say has acted unfairly, was anticipated to be sold to Panasonic, according to a news release from the operators.</p><p>Cobalt from Zhejiang Huayou, a Chinese company accused of buying cobalt mined under harsh conditions in Congo, is shipped to Taiwan, according to the news accounts. In Taiwan, a company called Coremax was a supplier of Sumitomo in the past decade, according to company documents, and Japan-based Sumitomo supplies Panasonic.</p><p>In each case, Tesla denied that the products from those companies reached their batteries.</p><p>So if not from those companies, where does Tesla gets its graphite, cobalt and lithium? Tesla declined to identify sources. </p><p>As evidence of its concern that suppliers operate cleanly, Tesla officials note that the core of its mission involves improving the environment and that it has taken steps to make sure that the inputs to its forthcoming battery \"Gigafactory\" in Nevada will be clean. It will be powered in part by solar energy, they say, and the project will allow it to select and purchase its own raw materials rather than relying on battery suppliers to make those decisions.</p><p>\"Tesla performs on-site visits and audits to the best of our ability during the sourcing and vetting process for suppliers,\" the company said. \"All of our contracts require suppliers to adhere to our human rights policy and environmental and safety requirements.\" </p><p>The company sometimes finds it difficult to make on-site visits, however. In March, the company said it would be sending personnel to Congo, where cobalt is mined. As of September, it had not done so.</p><p>A few companies, meanwhile, have begun to respond to pressure for more disclosure, and some industry groups have initiated efforts to promote industry standards for the sourcing of cobalt. Apple annually publishes a list of its top suppliers, a rare move in an industry that prefers to keep supply details secret. And Umicore, a major supplier of battery parts, has hired the accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers, to judge whether it has adhered to its standards for making sure its cobalt is sourced responsibly.</p><p>But these efforts are the exception within the many industries reliant on lithium-ion batteries.</p><p>\"It's important for companies to demonstrate what they're doing and go beyond a mere verbal commitment,\" Jurewicz said. \"Companies that do anything beyond what is required by the [Dodd-Frank] law are few and far between.\"</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:peter.whoriskey@washpost.com\">peter.whoriskey@washpost.com</email></p><p>Ana Swanson contributed to this report.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPBLOG-635caa8ccecf11e6a87fb917067331bb</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPBLOG2016</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5MHD-GC01-JB4M-V0PX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-08-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1226\"/><timeReceived>8:37 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2016 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washington Post Blogs <br/></publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5072\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"12\" year=\"2016\"><dateText>December 30, 2016 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC000CA0B</classCode><className>TESLA MOTORS INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC00086Y6</classCode><className>LG CHEM LTD</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>TSLA (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><className>LGCD (LSE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><className>051910 (KSE)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Banking Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QjQyMUFCOUJBNURBNEFDREE3MTNCNDk5QkQ4NUM3RjI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Regulatory Conversion</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OUExQjU3NThFNDA2NDJENzlEMjc4MDc3MzU1Mjk3NDk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MEYzNTBDMDYwNTkyNDUyODlGQTJEMEQyMTZDOEE0MkY</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

While not out feeding pigeons on night-time strolls, the Serbian-American engineer reimagined the uses of electricity, radio and robotics and patented 278 inventions. But he died in poverty in 1943.\u00a0</p><p>By a cruel twist of fate, the electric car company <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/why-elon-musk-named-his-electric-car-tesla/\"> named in Tesla\u2019s honour</url> has become one of the most extraordinary, wealth-creating stock market machines in history. In spite of the sharp sell-off in tech stocks this week, Tesla\u2019s share price has more than quadrupled this year. Run by Elon Musk, Tesla is currently valued at about $379bn, one and a quarter times more than Toyota and Volkswagen combined.</p><p>If Barack Obama won the US presidency in 2008 on the audacity of hope, then the maverick Mr Musk has built his career on the audacity of hype. The fast-tweeting, pot-smoking, rocket-launching Mr Musk is not just selling cars but a ticket to the future, supporters claim. He promises yet another \u201cmind-blowing\u201d announcement about Tesla\u2019s battery technology later this month.</p><p>The market euphoria surrounding Tesla has rubbed off on other electric vehicle companies as investors have scrambled to find the next wonder stock. Last week, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f8dce61e-f673-4033-8b69-9426f9b49ad8\"> Xpeng Motors,</url> a Chinese EV manufacturer, jumped 40 per cent on its stock market debut in New York, benefiting from a \u201cTesla halo\u201d. Its heavily oversubscribed listing valued the start-up at $10bn.\u00a0</p><p>Such nosebleed valuations surely scream: \u201cBUBBLE!\u201d And the market certainly paused for thought this week. No traditional investment metrics, such as price earnings ratios or dividend yields, can possibly justify Tesla\u2019s stratospheric share price. Tesla makes minimal earnings and pays no dividend.\u00a0</p><p>For comparison, Toyota and Volkswagen jointly produced 21.8m cars and generated $15.6bn of free cash flow in 2019, according to JPMorgan. That same year, Tesla made 366,000 cars and $1.1bn of cash. Looked at another way, the stock market \u201cvalues\u201d every car Tesla sold last year at over $1m apiece. You can buy a Tesla Model 3 for $35,000.</p><p>A punchy bear case has been made by Jamie Powell on <url normalizedValue=\"https://ftalphaville.ft.com/2020/09/01/1598948660000/Tesla-is-nuts--will-it-ever-crash-/\"> FT Alphaville</url> who argues Tesla\u2019s share price is unhinged from economic reality. We have returned to the world of \u201cdot.comedy\u201d of 2000 just before markets crashed.\u00a0</p><p>Such scepticism does not worry Mr Musk\u2019s fans, who cheer his every move and aggressively troll his doubters. Nor does it seem to concern some mainstream investors, who argue Tesla is a bet on three big technological trends: electric cars, battery technology and autonomous driving. Morgan Stanley forecasts that Tesla will sell 6m cars by 2030 and can generate rapidly increasing high-margin revenue from services and batteries. The company is as much about software as it is about hardware, a bet that an iPhone on wheels is a lot more valuable than a tin can.\u00a0</p><p>This week, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e3cb3bc5-a185-4e2a-8ed8-45e48840ef9d\"> Baillie Gifford, one of Tesla\u2019s biggest shareholders, cut its investment</url> for portfolio weighting reasons, booking profits of $17bn in eight months. But the Edinburgh-based fund management group said it remained optimistic about Tesla\u2019s future and retained a 4.25 per cent stake.</p><p>James Anderson, co-manager of Baillie Gifford\u2019s flagship fund, says it is sometimes worth paying \u201cunreasonable prices\u201d for high-growth tech stocks. The bears have been blinded by misguided concepts of value investing and index tracking.\u00a0To understand the new economy, Mr Anderson suggests, it <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d60a3442-3d82-42dc-bd48-9b24a305371a\"> is far more instructive</url> to read the annual shareholder letters of Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon, than those of Warren Buffett, the high priest of the value investment movement.</p><p>Two contentions underpin Baillie Gifford\u2019s investment approach. First, returns in stock markets are infinitely more extreme and concentrated than most people assume. Citing the research of <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bailliegifford.com/en/uk/individual-investors/insights/ic-article/2018-q3-trust-37-archived-extreme-returns-ind-we-1124?p=12557\"> Hendrik Bessembinder</url>, a professor at Arizona State University, Mr Anderson says: \u201cAll the excess returns in world markets since 1990 have come from just 1.3 per cent of companies.\u201d</p><p>Second, some of these intellectual property-rich companies, such as Google and Alibaba, generate <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">increasing</emphasis>, rather than <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">diminishing</emphasis>, returns because of scale effects in a networked world, as described by Brian Arthur, professor at the Santa Fe Institute.</p><p>To be sure, Tesla\u2019s current valuation looks irrational. But rationality has been stretched thin in all kinds of ways in 2020. In a world awash with central bank cash, many other market valuations look just as screwy. There are now about $14tn of global bonds trading on negative yields.</p><p>The other big difference with 2000 is that many highly valued tech companies, if not Tesla, are massively profitable. From that perspective, Big Tech\u2019s valuations may reflect an excessive concentration of corporate power. That should be of more immediate interest to antitrust regulators than short sellers.</p><p>At Baillie Gifford, Mr Anderson concedes it is pointless to try to time the market\u2019s next move. But he remains convinced of the worth of active fund management and the long-term transformations wrought by technology. \u201cOver the past 15 years we have made an awful lot of mistakes,\u201d he says. \u201cBut our biggest mistake may be that we have not been optimistic enough.\u201d </p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FTCOMH-c97e428e24574b6abb8e01477c418beb</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FTCOMH2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60S1-DNC1-DXP9-90W6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">408337</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"885\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Financial Times Limited All Rights Reserved Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web.</copyright><publicationName>FT.com Headlines</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 4, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>CC000CME0</classCode><className>ELECTRIC CAR CO INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC00027NH</classCode><className>JPMORGAN CHASE &amp;

Did you have a great Fourth of July celebration? (Otherwise known as national 'scare the crap out of your dog' day.) If the fireworks finally died down in your neighborhood (lucky!)</p><p> and you're jonesing for more, Wall Street has you covered. More specifically, Tesla Inc. (Nasdaq: TSLA[1]) has you covered in short red shorts. Over the weekend, the ever-effervescent CEO Elon Musk took aim at TSLA short sellers once again. Musk tweeted out 'Who wears short shorts?' followed by a link to buy limited edition Tesla short shorts[2]. The shorts have Tesla's logo on the front and 'S3XY' on the back, a reference to Tesla vehicle models. The shorts were clearly aimed at Tesla bears, one of which \u2014 Stanphyl Capital[3] \u2014 laid out extensive reasoning last week why you should sell TSLA right now. But Musk once again had the last laugh. TSLA shares are up more than 200% this year, riding solid vehicle deliveries and a streak of three consecutive profitable quarters. Profitability has long been Tesla's biggest drag, especially among short sellers. But, if second-quarter deliveries \u2014 which came in at 90,000 vehicles, above Wall Street's most bullish estimates \u2014 are any indication, Tesla is set to extend that winning streak to four quarters, something the company has never done before. Will that silence TSLA short sellers? Probably not. Short sellers gotta short, and bears will jump through any number of hoops to do so. For instance, J.P. Morgan Analyst Ryan Brinkman grudgingly lifted his price target on TSLA from $275 to $295[4] this morning, citing Tesla's deliveries report. Yes, you read that right: a price target of $295 on a $1,313-plus stock. Now, Brinkman and Stanphyl Capital might be right. I'm not saying they are, but it's possible. However, you can be right and still lose a lot of money. Betting against Telsa right now is a surefire way to do just that. Luckily for TSLA short sellers, they can now 'run like the wind or entertain like Liberace[5]' in their new Tesla short shorts for just $69.420. Maybe a little exercise in Tesla shorts will help relieve the chafing from their TSLA shorts. Editor's Note: Chafing. Are you tired of chafing? I'm tired of chafing. With TSLA constantly hitting all-time highs, it's tough to nail down an entry point. That really smarts, and a pair of little red Tesla shorts won't change that. I say it's time to put an end to chafing over TSLA shares \u2014 and find a better way to play the electric vehicle (EV) market! The real potential for your investment dollar lies in energy technology \u2014 specifically, a crucial piece of tech developed by one tiny, pioneering American company. It's an energy revolution that could create more millionaires than pot stocks, cryptos and Big Tech combined! So quit chafing over Tesla. Click here to learn more![6] Good: Me and My Shadow Tesla's Chinese shadow, Nio Inc. (NYSE: NIO[7]) also stole headlines today. DigiTimes reported that Nio sold 3,740 EVs[8] in June, spiking 179% year over year. What's more, Nio sold 10,331 EVs in the first half of 2020. That's up 191% from last year and above the company's original estimate for sales of 9,500 to 10,000. The company also announced plans to ramp up production from 4,000 units per month to 4,500 to 5,000 per month. So far, Tesla's success in China has proven to be Nio's success as well. The smaller Chinese rival continues to ride Tesla's coattails, albeit with a healthy dose of government support. That said, this serious home-field advantage may be what ultimately gives Nio an edge in China. Because of this home-field advantage, I'm putting Nio on the Great Stuff watch list. In other words, we'll look for a reasonable entry price once the current rally hype dies down. Stay tuned for more!Better: Uber Eats Postmates It's no secret that Uber Technologies Inc. (NYSE: UBER[9]) was hungry. Last month, it tried to fill its belly with Grubhub. Alas, European food delivery company Takeaway.com drank Uber's milkshake[10]. But, let's be honest, the Uber-Grubhub deal never would've passed regulators' noses to begin with \u2014 48% control of the U.S. food delivery market? Nope. Not happening. But today, Uber finally found a tasty treat in Postmates[11]. The privately held food delivery company was shaping up to be one of the hottest initial public offerings (IPO) of the year[12]. But those IPO dreams came to a halt today after Uber's board approved a $2.65 billion, all-stock offer for Postmates. Uber stock rose roughly 7% on the news. Investors clearly cheer Uber's support of its rising food delivery service \u2014 especially with the pandemic crippling the ride-sharing front. Last quarter, Uber lost $3 billion despite Uber Eats growing revenue at a 52% clip. More on earnings Armageddon in a second, because firstBest: Spot the Triple-Digit Winner Congratulations are in order, dear reader! Today, Great Stuff Picks is closing out our fourth triple-digit winner of the year! We recommended music streaming giant Spotify Technology S.A. (NYSE: SPOT[13]) back in June 2019, when the stock traded around $127. Today, SPOT hovers around $265. That's a 108% gain in about a year's time! Spotify has come on big in 2020, fueled by podcast deals like those with popular podcasters Bill Simmons and Joe Rogan. Analysts at RiskHedge[14] believe that the company is 'rapidly becoming something of a monopoly in the audio industry,' while others believe that Spotify's 'blue-sky growth' is over. There are still bullish parameters in play for Spotify. There really isn't a competitor that stands up to Spotify in terms of price, content and user base growth. It's quickly becoming a household name for streaming music. However, I believe that the hype behind Spotify will settle down over the next month or so as investors take profits. Keeping with our mantra of 'don't be greedy,' Great Stuff is taking our 100% gain and going home. If SPOT revisits the $200 area in a pullback, we'll reevaluate buying back in. But for now: Sell SPOT.Would you look at the time! It's almost earnings season again. This time around, analysts and masochists alike expect a rude awakening, like firecrackers in your cornflakes. Today's Chart of the Week comes from a Yahoo Finance article that wasn't quite the Monday morning pep talk I was looking for: 'Get Ready for the Ugliest Earnings Season Since the Financial Crisis[15].' Aren't you ready?! I'm chomping at the bit, myself. Here's what analysts predict about the nigh-approaching earnings season:Here we can see bottom-up earnings projected to run off a cliff like Wile E. Coyote, followed by a prim-and-proper rebound to whisk away the unpleasantries. But Mr. Great Stuff, you've seen the numbers, what earnings didn't go bottom-up this season? You jest but here's a little market lingo to stick in your quiver. Bottom-up simply refers to earnings. A lot of different factors affect earnings, including the coronavirus prep and cleaning costs. Earnings results more directly affect shareholders, or at least they're supposed to \u2014 I'm looking at you, 2020. Top-down, meanwhile, refers to a company's revenue, which typically excludes pesky things like taxes and costs that aren't from straight-up sales. Top-down investing looks at these figures as a better reflection of actual economic activity \u2014 a company's big-picture growth, if you will. Now our Chart of the Week has some context or does it? You see, it's not the highlighted second-quarter dip that worries me \u2014 that's already priced into the market. No, it's the rosy rebound in the third and fourth quarters that doesn't jive with rising COVID-19 cases. Those projections were laid out while expecting the Great Reopening to go off without a hitch. That the U.S. economy would come roaring back once nationwide lockdowns were lifted. They were made without the prospect of a second wave of COVID-19 infections or economic blackouts rolling across the country as counties and states reclose their economies to deal with the pandemic (again). Just like we said months ago nobody's timing this. I'd love for earnings to roar back to life like a round trip to the Pet Sematary, but the only timeline that matters here is the virus's timeline. On that note, from Bank of America's Savita Subramanian: 'At this point, exactly 400 companies within the S&amp;#38;P 500 have failed to guide over the last three months suggesting that corporate sentiment is neither positive nor negative, but simply a big question mark.' Here's my point: We can basically throw out those early earnings and economic projections. What does that leave us with? A big ol' question mark. And we all know how Wall Street loves uncertainty. One thing's for certain: We're headed for an explosive tell-all earnings season. As always, Great Stuff will keep you in the loop!Great Stuff: Keep It LoopyWhat a Monday!

While other big tech companies like Yahoo and Google have, at times, made upwards of 20 purchases a year, Tesla really doesn't make many acquisitions at all. Prior to this year, in fact, it had only made one acquisition. </p><p>This year is a total outlier, it has now made two in just the last three months. The company announced on Tuesday that it has\u00a0acquired[1]\u00a0Grohmann Engineering, a\u00a0German engineering firm that specializes in automated manufacturing processes.\u00a0No financial terms of the deal were disclosed. The purchase will give Elon Musk's company a new factory that will allow Tesla to increase its productivity, aiding its goal of bringing number of cars manufactured to half a million a year by 2018. \"Accelerating a sustainable energy future is only possible with high-volume factories. They allow us to manufacture high-quality products with economies of scale, making them more affordable and accessible to the world,\" the company wrote. \"As the machine that builds the machine, our factories are so important that we believe they will ultimately deserve an order of magnitude more attention in engineering than what they produce. At very high production volumes, the factory becomes more of a product than the product itself.\" Going forward, Grohmann Engineering\u00a0will be renamed as TeslaGrohmann Automation, and it\u00a0will serve as the initial base for Tesla Advanced Automation Germany headquarters, with other locations to follow. The company\u00a0will continue to be led by\u00a0founder and CEO Klaus Grohmann.\u00a0 Tesla said that it expects to add over 1,000 advanced engineering and skilled technician jobs in Germany over the next two years. The deal isn't quite done yet, as it still needs to be cleared by regulators, including in Germany, but the company is seeking to have the acquisition completed in only a few months, by early 2017. Tesla is riding high right now. In its most recent earnings, the company\u00a0posted its second profitable quarter ever, earning $2.3 billion, beating expectations of $1.98 billion.\u00a0The company also\u00a0revealed[2]\u00a0that it delivered approximately 24,500 vehicles in the quarter, up 70 percent quarter-to-quarter, while production rose 37 percent to 25,185 vehicles, both record numbers. Over a quarter, 25.1 percent of the company, was acquired from private equity firm Deutsche Beteiligungs AG.\u00a0 'With its technology leadership, Grohmann exemplifies the hidden champions in Germany's Mittelstand, without which key innovations would not occur,' Torsten Grede, Spokesman of the Board of Management of Deutsche Beteiligungs AG,\u00a0said in a statement[3]. 'Grohmann is an outstanding example of the excellent progress technology-geared Mittelstand companies can make backed by growth capital and the support of professional investors.' According to\u00a0Deutsche Beteiligungs,\u00a0Grohmann\u00a0revenues have been growing by an average of more than six percent annually over the last 20 years, reaching 123 million euros in 2015. The number of employees tripled over the same period to approximately 700.\u00a0 This is Tesla's second proposed acquisition of the year,\u00a0announcing[4]\u00a0this summer that it would combine with SolarCity,\u00a0a solar energy company, which Musk also helped start, and which he serves as chairman. Prior to this year, Tesla had made one other purchase,\u00a0buying\u00a0Riviera Tool[5], a producer of tools and dies that stamp out metal parts, in early 2015. That allowed the company to expand operations to Michigan, the location of one of its three egineering facilities; the others are in Fremont, California, and now Germany.\u00a0 Shares of Tesla stock are up 1.87 percent, trading at $196.83 a share.

Thank you for being with us. Good night from Sussex.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Happy Wednesday everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo. Good morning to you. It is Wednesday, August 12th, your top stories right now at 6:00 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Democratic ticket is set, Joe Biden tapping Senator Kamala Harris as his running mate; President Trump's reaction straight ahead. Stimulus stalemate, still no deal with Congress as the White House pushes forward on executive orders to help Americans.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Coming up at 8:30 a.m. Eastern this morning, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is here, live on where the talks stand and how soon Americans could see extra unemployment benefits.</p><p>Tesla trying to electrify investors, announcing a 5-1 stock split. The stock is shifting into high gear on the news; we are looking at a 5% rally right now.</p><p>Broad markets also higher, take a look at Futures indicating a gain at the start of trading. The Dow Futures currently up 250 points, that's about 1%. The NASDAQ Futures up 92 and the S&amp;P Futures up 25.</p><p>The stimulus standoff leading to a late day sell-off yesterday, meanwhile the S&amp;P 500 snapped a seven day winning streak at 4 o'clock on Wall Street but the S&amp;P down 26, the Dow down 105 and the NASDAQ lower by 185. Gold also losing some of its shine, gold prices back below $2,000 announced now after tumbling 4.5% yesterday.</p><p>More TikTok security concerns this morning. The popular Chinese app reportedly tracking user data from millions of people, in violation of Google policies. Plus college football taking a time out, the Big Ten and Pac-12 postponing the fall season due to the coronavirus.</p><p>Mornings with Maria is live right now</p><p>And global markets this morning are mixed. The FTSE 100 in London is up 48 points, the UK economy falling into a recession after shrinking by more than 20% in the second quarter, the largest contraction reported by any major economy so far. The CAC quarante in Paris was up 12 and the DAX Index in Germany lower by 18 points this morning.</p><p>Check Asian markets overnight mostly higher on the session, take a look. KOSPI Index was higher as was the Hang Seng. Hong Kong up 1.5% overnight. Shanghai Composite in China, lower.</p><p>Now, some of the top stores that we are watching this morning. Historic decision, Joe Biden tapping Kamala Harris as his pick for Vice President. The California Senator is the daughter of Indian and Jamaican parents. She makes history as the first woman of color on a major Presidential ticket. President Trump already slamming the decision, calling Harris one of the most liberal members of the Senate.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT, UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: As far as Kamala is concerned, she's a big tax raiser, slasher of funds for our military, and she's got a lot of difficult things that she's going to have to explain.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Harris and Biden will make their first appearance as running mates later today in Delaware. No more games, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell demanding Democrats to restart coronavirus relief negotiations. McConnell says if Democrats are playing hardball, they are only harming vulnerable Americans, not Republicans. President Trump signed executive orders last weekend extending certain relief benefits to keep the stimulus on the move.</p><p>Tesla is on the move this morning. Shares are up in the free market. The electric vehicle maker announced last night a 5-1 stock split. Tesla shares gaining 229% this year, hitting a string of closing records. As you see, the stock is up 5.5% right now. This split goes into effect after the close of trading August 31; couple of weeks now.</p><p>College football on the bench. The Big Ten and Pac-12 taking a time out, sidelining players to the upcoming fall season due to the coronavirus concerns. Officials say the health of student athletes is most important. The conferences are now on pushing the season to the spring.</p><p>And the 2020 presidential race officially on the Democratic ticket set, Joe Biden taps Senator Kamala Harris as his nitpick for Vice President. Biden tweeted this out, \"I have the great honor to announce that I have picked Kamala Harris, a fearless fighter for the little guy and one of the country's finest public servants as my running mate.\"</p><p>Harris tweeted this in response, \"Joe Biden can unify the American people because he spent his life fighting for us, and as President, he will build an America that lives up to our ideals. I'm honored to join him as our Party's nominee for Vice President and do what it takes to make him our Commander-in-Chief,\" writes Kamala Harris.</p><p>President Trump weighed in as well. He spoke with Sean Hannity in a Fox News exclusive last night</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: She wants to raise taxes. She wants to get rid of your Second Amendment. No guns for protection, no nothing. She's very strong in the Second Amendment, getting rid of it and very bad to the military.</p><p>She wants to cut the military, she wants to cut spending for the military, and the vets. And I don't quite get the choice, but we'll have it out. We have a great Vice President named Mike Pence and he will take care of business just like he did the last time against a different candidate.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Biden and Harris will make their first campaign event together today in Delaware. Joining me right now is Former Senior Advisor to the Clintons. He is the CEO of MDC Partners and Stagwell Group President and Managing Partner Mark Penn. Also joining the conversation this morning is Fox Business' Dagen McDowell, Republican Strategist and Fried &amp; Williams Attorney Jonathan Madison, along with Payne Capital Management President Ryan Payne.</p><p>Great to see everybody this morning, thanks so much for being here. Mark Penn, kick it off with you. Your reaction to Biden's pick, Kamala gets the job.</p><p>MARK PENN, PRESIDENT AND MANAGING DIRECTOR, STAGWELL GROUP: Well, I think as I said last time, I thought it was the obvious pick, probably the smartest pick of the choices that he had assembled. It certainly unifies the Democratic Party. There's not going to be a split or a fight.</p><p>It gives a momentum; frankly I don't know why didn't they do this weeks earlier. Obviously, Biden had some reservations, he cleared up those reservations, and then went forward with a safer choice I think than any of the others before them.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Would you call Kamala Harris moderate?</p><p>PENN: Moderate in the Democratic Party as it is today, but yes, sure. I think she is going to be backing higher taxes, regulations on guns. She backed up the New Green Deal. But in terms of the Democratic Party itself and her true history, over a longer term, she was more moderate before she got into the Democratic primary and I don't know what she's going to be on the stump, but she has a real record as someone who served the public well and I think she will wear well as a Vice Presidential pick.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, Dagen McDowell, jump in here because the reason that I ask is just for that reason, she's backing the Green Deal, she's backing these higher taxes. I'm wondering if she has been pulled all the way to the Left by those hijacking this party, Dagen, that's why I asked the question.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Well, Joe Biden has been, and Mark talked about this the last time he was on the show that Joe Biden has been pulled to the left.</p><p>Normally, you move to the center after the primary season, not so much with Joe Biden that he's being pulled further and further left. So she kind of fits in with that in a way. But Mark, what does Kamala Harris bring, the Senator, to swing States and suburban swing state voters? Does she have any impact there because that's where the rubber meets the road in the Presidential Election?</p><p>PENN: Well, I think she brings three things. One, she brings unity within the Democratic Party. I don't think that there'll be a significant challenge to her. I think she does bring record as a prosecutor. The time she was criticized for being too tough, I think you'll see her swing into that mode, right, and she is a historic nomination.</p><p>So I think those three things, and she's not going to be at variance with Joe Biden. I think whatever positions he takes, I think she's going to be a supporter and I think she'll be a reasonably effective debater. I think I'll want to see the Pence-Kamala Harris debate. I think it could be a really strong debate on the issues before the country.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So what about the issue of crime and this vandalism taking place and this crime numbers rising throughout so many of our big cities, Mark? How do you see her dealing with that as a former prosecutor?</p><p>PENN: Well, I think that's a big question. I think Biden has come out against the violence, but really hasn't made it a theme of the campaign. And so I think that President Trump has actually put a pretty strong contrast against Biden and the Democrats on this issue.</p><p>And particularly as violence continued, I think it's more of a weakness than strength. So I'd like to see the Democrats come out much more strongly condemning violence and clearly so, while at the same time, condemning racial inequality. I think it's a false choice that's been set up here.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, so what else does she bring in terms of being the former AG in California? How does she use that resume to actually bring value and make a difference as Vice President?</p><p>PENN: Well, I think as Vice President, she'll say, look, I went after criminals, I was a cop (ph), I pulled no punches, I'm ready to go toe-to- toe with Mike Pence and I'm ready to take the Democratic platform and with Joe Biden once he is President, articulated, get out there.</p><p>She's certainly shown that she's willing to be a tough campaigner. She obviously attacked Joe Biden. It didn't work as effectively as she was hoping, but I think she will get out there and be what a Vice Presidential pick is generally thought of these days, as someone who's able to carry on the fight. And I think she's an articulate and skilled debater.</p><p>So again, the number of choices, she is historic choice, she moves this ticket forward, probably should have done it two weeks earlier, but I think it'll get some momentum going into the campaign, into the convention.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Jonathan Madison, jump in.</p><p>JONATHAN MADISON, ATTORNEY, FRIED &amp; WILLIAMS: I think it's awesome that she and I share the same alma mater, Howard University. Her resume obviously speaks for itself. That being said, I think she has two really big challenges.</p><p>The first of which is, it's ironic that she's the only candidate Joe Biden could have picked that went to a Howard University in HBCU, a historically black college. However, she had a tremendously tough time connecting with the black vote in, garnering the black vote in the Democratic primaries if you recall.</p><p>She didn't even make it past 2019 in the Democratic primaries in large part because she could not garner black votes. So if Joe Biden is attempting to use her to garner some black support and the black vote, particularly after he's made disparaging comments about the African American race over the past couple of months, he's got some tough times ahead.</p><p>The second issue is, she's going to have to connect with voters on the Rust Belt and that's not going to be a very easy thing for her to do, having been a District Attorney in a place like San Francisco for seven years. Whether you're connecting with Democrats in the Rust Belt, whether you're connecting with Republicans, everyone in between, she's got some tough day there.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, these are great points. Mark, what do you say?</p><p>PENN: Well, I don't think it's going to be her job to connect with the Rust Belt.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Would there connecting with the African-American - yes.</p><p>PENN: Well, A, I don't think it's going to her job to connect with the Rust Belt. I think that's going to be Joe Biden's job. And he's right, she didn't pull the African American vote as strongly as she expected and everyone expected during the primaries. I don't think anybody ever really explained why that happened and Biden held on to his share of the vote.</p><p>Look, together as a ticket, I think they're going to do very, very well with the African American vote. A lot of people will see her as a potential second African-American President now that she has this nomination. I wouldn't worry about her not performing well out there on the stump with these poor Democratic constituencies. I think that she is a safe pick, a good pick, and this race is not going to be about the Vice Presidential choice. It's going to be about other issues.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, alright Mark. Great to see you this morning, thanks so much.</p><p>PENN: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Mark Penn joining us. Now in the morning mover, Moderna. Take a look at the stock surging this morning after the White House announced a deal for the biotech company's coronavirus vaccine.</p><p>The U.S. government will pay $1.5 billion for 100 million doses of Moderna's vaccine. It is currently in the final phase of testing, which is on track to wrap up in September. Stock is up 9.25% this morning, our morning mover.</p><p>We are just getting started this morning. Coming up, quick break and then the RNC Chair Ronna McDaniel is here to talk about Kamala Harris as Joe Biden's Vice Presidential pick. Then Atlas Organization's Founder Jonathan Ward is here talking about Jimmy Lai's latest arrest in Hong Kong.</p><p>Next hour, former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani will react to Joe Biden's VP pick, and Georgia Congressman Doug Collins is here talking about the latest on the Michael Flynn hearing. All that coming up. In the 8:00 a.m. hour this morning, Wisconsin Senator Ron Johnson discussing his subpoena on FBI Director Christopher Wray.</p><p>Then Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin will join me to talk stimulus and the capital gains tax, all that and a lot more. But first, new risks for vaping when it comes to coronavirus, plus how you can save your hotel and your airline points. You are watching Mornings with Maria live on Fox Business.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. A big claim from Moscow. Russia approving what it is calling the world's first coronavirus vaccine, though many have their doubts. Global health officials saying that the vaccine has yet to go through critical late-stage trials. But Russian President Vladimir Putin says his own daughter has taken it.</p><p>Joining us right now is Pulmonary and Critical Care Physician at the Cleveland Clinic, Dr. Daniel Culver. And Dr. Culver, it's great to have you this morning. Thanks very much for joining us. What do we know about this vaccine? Is it safe? Compare what's happening in Russia to what the United States is doing in terms of efforts around a coronavirus vaccine?</p><p>DANIEL CULVER, PULMONOLOGIST, CLEVELAND CLINIC: Good morning. Thank you for having me. We really know very little about the vaccine. Broadly, we know that it's similar to a strategy used by the Oxford University, AstraZeneca Group and CanSino and Johnson &amp; Johnson, but we don't know any of the data about how effective it was in early stage trials. We know very little about the plans for larger trials. And so, all we really know is a strategy right now. I think we'd like more information before we make judgments on it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So a little propaganda in there. Let's turn to the United States and what Moderna is doing. The stock is up this morning. What vaccines can you talk about that are in development, that are actually showing promise? And I know Moderna is among them.</p><p>CULVER: Right, Moderna is among them. Several vaccine manufacturers have published results on early stage trials showing immune responses, both formation of antibodies and responses from the cell part of the immune system, and all four of those that have published the results so far, which includes Moderna, have shown that there may be potential benefits. But of course, those are in healthy patients, younger patients and we need to see how the vaccines act in larger populations, the people who are really at risk for this disease, and to look for rare side effects that can happen where you really need large populations to see those.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, the President yesterday talked about the government's deal to purchase 100 million doses of Moderna's experimental coronavirus vaccine. When do you expect that? They're talking about later this year, perhaps October, November. It's pretty extraordinary that we're at this point in such a short period of time, right, for this agreement is for 100 million doses.</p><p>CULVER: Yes. I think that this is really a wonderful example of collaboration across academia, pharma and government. De-risking the process by allowing manufacturing of the vaccines now, I think really speeds things up. The question of when this will happen depends on the speed of enrolment of the trials. These are roughly looking at around 30,000 patients for the trials, the Pfizer drug, the Moderna vaccine. And so, we need to see how fast those trials enrol.</p><p>And then, it depends on how many people in the trials actually get exposed to the virus, because until there are enough events, it's very hard to judge whether or not the vaccine is effective. I think that October is perhaps ambitious. We'll have to see how it goes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, assess where we are here today, as far as this vaccine, do you feel that we're going to see another spike in the fall?</p><p>CULVER: Well, I think whether or not we see a spike really depends on behaviour, how closely people follow social distancing. What happens is people go back to schools, whether there's fatigue about things like mask wearing, and so it's really up to the American public about how big this virus gets in the fall. I do think that eventually there's likely to be a vaccine, but first we have to do those important blocking and tackling measures.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Dr. Daniel Culver, great to see you this morning, thanks very much for your insights. We'll keep watching and talk with you soon. Thank you, sir.</p><p>CULVER: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Coming up, historic choice, Joe Biden taps Senator Kamala Harris as his Vice-Presidential pick. We are on it all morning this morning, taking a look at the impact on your life. Back in a moment.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Senator Kamala Harris in the spotlight. As we have been reporting this morning, Joe Biden has tapped the California Senator and former Presidential candidate as his running mate; the move ending months of speculation. Dagen McDowell, your reaction earlier about where she is in terms of being moderate, what kind of an impact is this going to have do you think?</p><p>MCDOWELL: I think her biggest impact will be, number one, she could go out of the House with ease, which clearly has been an issue for former Vice President Joe Biden. My friend Jenny Johnson tweeted this 'Finally! Someone who can drive at night!' So if anything, it does highlight that people look at Vice President Biden and his lack of mental sharpness and his age at potential inauguration.</p><p>He would be the oldest President ever inaugurated, aged 78; The Wall Street Journal editorial page writing about this today. So people really have to look at her. If Biden is a one-term President, are you looking at her in a different way than any other running mate before as potentially a Presidential candidate or the next President, if you will, after the next four years?</p><p>Just one more quick thing. I've said this and I'll say it over and over again. This will be potentially the election of public security. With all the unrest and runaway violence in major cities across the country, will she step up and run on her record as an Attorney General in the State of California? Will she get tough? Because frankly, this is something that President Trump is increasingly using against the Biden Campaign, and is she up for that job?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, that's a good point. And I agree with you in terms of looking at her differently than we've looked at other Vice Presidential candidates, given Joe Biden's condition. You could see her become President sooner rather than later should he decide to step back. Is there an impact to know on Wall Street, Ryan Payne?</p><p>RYAN PAYNE, PRESIDENT, PAYNE CAPITAL MANAGEMENT: I think the big thing is, sentiment can change on a dime and I think the thing that's being discounted here is by November, if you look at most economists, we're really going to be in a much better place than we are today in terms of where the economy is. And I think that's what's been discounted all summer so far, as most economists have been slightly dour on where we're going to be, but I think the surprises are going to continue to be in the positive. And that's something I've been saying for a long time that most people on Wall Street haven't.</p><p>So I think when you start thinking about November, you start thinking about a stronger economy. You start looking at the cases coming down for coronavirus on a daily basis because I think people are actually being more conscious about how they're living their life right now, especially in some of those states like Florida, Texas where they're having problems. I think the economy is going to be in a really, really good place and I think that's going to be really tough for Biden and Harris just because, let's face it, people vote with their wallet.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, we'll see. We're going to talk with Nancy Lazar coming up in The Word on Wall Street at the top of seven and she's actually considering changing estimates for the third quarter. So, we'll get into that and how the third quarter is shaping up relative to what we've seen in the economy.</p><p>We'll slip in a break. When we come back, RNC Chair Ronna McDaniel is here to talk about the 2020 race and how it's taking shape. Then Hollywood's most valuable players, Ryan Reynolds gets a spot on Forbes' list of top- paid actors. Who's number one? We've got it coming up. Stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back, good Wednesday morning everybody, thanks so much for joining us, I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Wednesday, August 12th. Let's take a look at markets here, 6:31 a.m. on the East Coast. We've got a rally underway, the Dow futures at the high of the morning here, up 280 points, the Nasdaq is up 106 and the S&amp;P right now up 27. The stimulus standoff leads to a late-day selloff yesterday, meanwhile, take a look.</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 snapped a 7-day winning streak, well, the Dow is down 104, the Nasdaq was down 185 points at 4 O'clock on Wall Street. Global markets this morning are mixed, a positive tone to many of them, even though the U.K. economy fell into a recession after shrinking by more than 20 percent in the second quarter, the largest contraction reported by any major economy.</p><p>The FTSE 100 is up 60 points, the CAC Quarante is up 21, the Dax Index this morning is lower by 16 points. In Asia overnight, markets were mostly higher, take a look, best performer was Hong Kong, Hang Seng index up 1.5 percent. Facebook is cracking down on news pages ahead of 2020 election. Cheryl Casone with the details now, Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS: That is right, Maria, good morning. Facebook is closing a loophole that allowed some political groups to post ads without proper disclaimers, that includes news publications with ties to political parties or to politicians. Those groups will now be banned from claiming a news exemption. Facebook says it's working on a way to identify politically connected publishers. Let's take a look at the stock, though, this morning, it's actually a little bit higher by more than 1 percent in pre-market trading.</p><p>Well, speaking of trading, going public, Airbnb close to starting the process as soon as this month. That's according to the \"Wall Street Journal\". The home-sharing giant still has to file IPO paperwork with the Securities and Exchange Commission though. Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs are said to be involved in the offering. Airbnb could be listed before the end of the year. And here is a look at what is trending this morning on foxbusiness.com. Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson once again, the highest paid actor in Hollywood.</p><p>He pulled in an estimated $87.5 million in 2020. Whole Foods just launched a series of cooking and other home economics courses for free on its website. And then Hamilton was the biggest thing on any streaming service in July, bigger than anything that Netflix put out that same month. And folks really paid for it as we know, Maria. And those are your headlines from the newsroom, back over to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, Cheryl, thank you so much. The 2020 race is officially set, Joe Biden taps California Senator, former rival Kamala Harris as his running mate. Harris took to Twitter after the announcement and wrote this, \"Joe Biden can unify the American people because he spent his life fighting for us, and as president, he'll build an America that lives up to our ideals. I am honored to join him as our party's nominee for vice president and do what it takes to make him our commander-in-chief.\" President Trump weighed in at the White House yesterday.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I was a little surprised that he picked her. I've been watching her for a long time, and I was a little surprised. She was very disrespectful to Joe Biden, and it's hard to pick somebody that's that disrespectful. She's very big into raising taxes, she wants to slash funds for our military at a level that nobody can even believe. She is against fracking, fracking is -- she's against petroleum products.</p><p>She wants to take your healthcare plans away from 180 million Americans.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Joining me right now is the Chairman of the RNC, Ronna McDaniel. Ronna, it's good to see you this morning, how does this change things?</p><p>RONNA MCDANIEL, CHAIRPERSON, REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE: I think it was kind of a boring pick. I think everybody was expecting Biden to pick Kamala, I think it's interesting that she called him a racist and she believed his accusers, and now is shifting her stance because she wants to be on the ticket, that's pretty typical of Kamala Harris. But it doesn't change the fact that she's a California progressive radical.</p><p>She embraces the green new deal. She and Biden want to raise taxes on 82 percent of Americans, they will eliminate all of our energy independence. It is truly a frightening ticket that would bankrupt the American people.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So let's talk about the African-American vote today. How does the president resonate with the black community and what will Kamala Harris bring to Joe Biden's ticket in that regard, because this is an important polling block obviously, and before the coronavirus shutdown, I think that the African-American community was seeing the lowest unemployment rates ever, there was support for President Trump. Is there still support today?</p><p>MCDANIEL: There is, we just saw Rasmussen poll that showed 35 percent of African-Americans support President Trump because of things like the First Steps Act where he took actions with criminal justice reform that Biden and Obama could have taken and they didn't. In fact, Joe Biden, according to Kamala Harris was part of mass incarcerations for the black community.</p><p>President Trump gave funding to HBCUs, he created economic opportunities zones. So this isn't just rhetoric from President Trump, this is policy that he has put into action that has lifted the African-American community. So we know what Kamala Harris said about Joe Biden. She said that obviously he was part of mass incarcerations, we've seen his rhetoric recently where he said all black people think the same.</p><p>He called an African-American journalist a junky. She's going to have to right some of the wrongs that the Biden campaign has committed and the gaffes that Joe Biden continually makes to the African-American community.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, it's pretty extraordinary when you think about some of those gaffes. Jonathan Madison, jump in here and as you -- I'd like to know if you agree with all of that, Jonathan, and as you jump in, let me just show you these latest numbers from Monmouth University, because they do show Joe Biden with a 10-point lead over President Trump nationwide, this is a slight improvement for the president, a previous Monmouth poll showed a 13-point gap between the two, Jonathan.</p><p>JONATHAN MADISON, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST: Absolutely, I mean, there are going to be some tough challenges ahead for both Biden and Kamala. For the most part, if Biden is counting on Kamala to kind of garner that black vote. You can kind of see from history how she did in 2019 in the Democratic primaries, she didn't farewell with the African-American votes. But also African-Americans, I think generally across the country, but particularly in California, those who know her actually remember statements she made, remarks about when she was asked about if she smoked marijuana and she kind of laughed, but then we know she turned around and locked about 1,500 people for doing the same.</p><p>So, you know, it's things like that, it's her prosecution record, and I think African-Americans kind of see her while she does have a great resume, she's done some great things, but as wanting to just garner the vote more than anything, it's about winning more than actually attending to African- Americans. And if there's anything we can take a lesson from, is that African-Americans are tired of being taken for granted and votes regardless of what party and what side you're on.</p><p>And Biden has his challenges too with regard to the disparaging remarks he's made towards African-Americans in the last two months. So both of them together have their challenges.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, and, you know, Kevin McCarthy tweeted, Ronna that Kamala Harris would like to make the entire country like San Francisco. What about her background and what she's done for her constituents? I mean, when you look at San Francisco today, it is a mess. Homelessness has risen so much. You've got crime on the rise, so what can you talk -- what can people expect from Kamala Harris, knowing what her constituents have seen and her background in California?</p><p>MCDANIEL: Yes, I don't think the middle of the country wants to see a California liberal telling us how to live. She has said she's going to stop deportations, she's going to give free health insurance to people who come here illegally, all the radical ideas from the green new deal she has embraced. You look at California, it's a mess. I mean, she is a total radical. And I don't say tax and spend anymore, tax and bankrupt our country, Democrat.</p><p>The policies that she and Joe Biden are embracing are truly frightening. So I don't think that's going to play in the middle of the country. The main question I have is, is she going to move into Joe Biden's basement? Is she actually going to get out and campaign? Are they going to take tough questions because so far, this is a candidacy that doesn't want to talk about the issues they're running on. They want to hide from the issues that they're running on.</p><p>And I'm just wondering when she's moving in if they've expanded their basement, so Kamala can be a roommate.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, all right, Ronna, we'll be watching, what a race. We will keep watching it along with you and see you soon. Ronna McDaniel joining us this morning with reaction. Coming up, fashion you cannot wear, the price tag on this digital shirt makes a buzz this morning. Wait until you see this. You're watching MORNINGS WITH MARIA live on Fox Business, stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. TikTok stealing user data. TikTok capitalizing on a loophole and Android phone securing -- security to obtain users unique Mac addresses, sending those back to China base ByteDance. According to the \"Wall Street Journal\", TikTok reportedly ending the practice in November. Joining me right now is Atlas Organization founder and the author of \"China's Vision of Victory\", Jonathan Ward. Jonathan, it's always a pleasure to see you, thanks very much for joining us. You know, we're talking about this on Sunday with Senator Tom Cotton who said that TikTok is like a Trojan horse on your phone, it vacuums up all your info.</p><p>Talk to us about the threat.</p><p>JONATHAN WARD, FOUNDER, ATLAS ORGANIZATION: Absolutely, good morning, Maria, it's great to be back. Well, I think what's important here is this executive orders that basically put, you know, pressure on two major Chinese technology companies, and on the one hand, TikTok and ByteDance, and on the other hand, WeChat and Tencent.</p><p>I mean, many people thought that the big tech companies in China were sort of good investments, you know, things to be pursuing for economic reasons, and of course, they're very closely linked to a Chinese state. I mean, you can't become a tech company on that scale without deep ties to the Chinese Communist Party. The other thing that matter is, you know, this week, the Fortune Global 500 was released, and there are now more Chinese companies on the Fortune Global 500 than U.S. companies.</p><p>So it's these corporations that are really China's economic battle fleet -- I mean, this is where we have to be focused as a country in order to win the competition with China. Every single one of them is tied to the party, many of them are state-owned. I mean, in this case ByteDance and you know, Tencent are not, but they're state affiliated. So, ultimately, America has a very robust toolkit for economic sanctions, economic containment and even economic warfare.</p><p>So, we're going to have to concentrate on these companies that are tied to the state, particularly those that are involved in surveillance in the civil-military fusion programs. You know, we can't let them into the U.S., so this all makes sense for us to do it, but we're also going to have a worldwide coalition that starts pushing back on China's companies.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, we'll see about that. I mean, right now, you've got Microsoft trying to convince government officials and the president that it's fine acquiring TikTok, and they can do what they need to do to eliminate any national security issue. But my question is how many people from TikTok are going to go work for Microsoft, Jonathan? Because we've seen over and over again, the Chinese Communist Party is able to steal from within, steal from the inside, whether it's those engineers from Motorola who were arrested years ago or the Cleveland Clinic or you know, the Harvard Charles Lieber, who was running the chemistry department.</p><p>They identify people or send people to America to get these incredible jobs, the CIA of CalPERS to steal information from the inside. Do you believe if a deal happens between these two companies, TikTok employees go work for Microsoft, Chinese nationals?</p><p>WARD: Well, this is going to be an important part of a deal. I mean, the technologies is going to have to be secured and it's going to have to be secured from insider threat. I mean, I think it does make sense for a U.S. company to take over TikTok if you can achieve all of that. But at the same time, what you can't do is allow, you know, Communist Party essentially, capabilities to continue within this technology, so that's what Microsoft has to be sure to fix.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, the behavior on the part of the CCP is just incredible, we've talked this week not just about the CCP military invading India, but now they're targeting islands in Japan, the Senkaku Islands, they, of course, overreached in Hong Kong. Jimmy Lai who has been a regular guest on this program was arrested again, we can report he's been released on bail. The Hong Kong media mogul and pro-democracy activist arrested this week under Hong Kong's new national security law, Jonathan. The legislation aims to prevent foreign influence in Hong Kong affairs, says the CCP.</p><p>Jonathan, what does this mean? They could go arrest Jimmy Lai, take him over to the border and torture him because that's the new security law?</p><p>WARD: Well, sure, it gives them the right to do pretty much whatever they'd like with anyone in Hong Kong, so it's going to be a way of cracking down with all the methods that are available to them on the mainland. And there have also been many who have interpreted the national security law as having worldwide reach so they can go after anyone around the world who they consider to be a threat to the national security.</p><p>So, of course, in that regard, it's a very -- you know, ugly law.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right, and he was -- he was released on bail. Were you surprised by that apparently this morning?</p><p>WARD: I think the -- it's really -- they've made their message clear. I mean, they can detain anyone, they will detain the most prominent voices, and I'm sure they're -- you know, likely to do more if they -- if they think that he hasn't been silenced, so I think the story is not over.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, Jonathan, great to talk with you this morning. Thank you so much, obviously, we're watching --</p><p>WARD: Thank you, Maria --</p><p>BARTIROMO: This one, we've been on this from day one, Jonathan Ward joining us. Thank you, sir. Coming up, new risks for vaping. When it comes to coronavirus, who is most at risk, we've got the story. Then a fresh take on the \"Fresh Prince of Bel Air\" making a buzz this morning, all coming up right after this.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Time for the Morning Buzz. First up, you can look, but you'll never touch. Tribute brand selling contactless fashion, 700 bucks gets you this, a digital certificate as proof you own one of these shirts.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>Dagen, are you going to pay for a digital closet, what do you think?</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS: No, because I'm not stupid and I think that this might be a spoof, but I'm not sure.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BARTIROMO: I mean, just to put it on and pictures digitally, that's what it's about, so -- and you're paying 700 bucks for this. Unbelievable. Next up, \"The Fresh Prince\" is back. Will Smith works with Morgan Cooper to reboot the iconic series, Cooper's YouTube trailer \"Bel Air\" going viral in 2019, prompting a fresh prince update with a twist. Ryan, are you excited?</p><p>RYAN PAYNE, PRESIDENT, PAYNE CAPITAL MANAGEMENT: I'm excited. I'm from Philly, Will Smith is from Philly, and I still think I can sing every word of that theme song and I'll do it on the air if you ever need the ratings to go up even higher. So, I'll put that offer out there.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You want to -- you want to take a shot right here, you want to take a shot right here?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>PAYNE: Maybe I shouldn't have offered that.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You didn't think I was going to call you on it.</p><p>PAYNE: You call me on my bluff --</p><p>BARTIROMO: You didn't think I was going to call you on it. All right --</p><p>MCDOWELL: Wait, so you didn't know?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wings of endearment, a professional --</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>What?</p><p>MCDOWELL: I said so he really doesn't --</p><p>BARTIROMO: A professional stuntman mixes --</p><p>MCDOWELL: Go ahead --</p><p>BARTIROMO: A professional stuntman mixing the love of his job to propose. Check this out, sparks were flying when his girlfriend said yes. OK, so he puts himself on fire before he proposes, Jonathan, isn't this cool?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MADISON: Well, you know, I thought I was a hopeless romantic --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Oh, my God --</p><p>MADISON: I mean, I thought my proposal was great, but he set the bar way higher. You know, anybody out there that thinks they had it together, this guy has set the bar to another level. You literally have to set yourself on fire to be where this guy is. Literally, you've got to be on fire. So hilarious.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BARTIROMO: There you go, oh, God. What a buzz. Still ahead, fleeing New York, the new round of people heading out of the Big Apple over high taxes and crime. Then super savers, how you can save your hotel and airline points, all that next hour right here on MORNINGS WITH MARIA is live on Fox Business.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.

He described Tesla Inc (TSLA) stock as moving upward in a 'parallel channel' starting in December. He explained that today's 3% increase helped Tesla Inc (TSLA) stock bust through what he said was a '$315 resistance.' He feels that the shares may rally on the company's earnings to reach the top line of that channel, if Wednesday's earnings report is in line with expectations. If the company meets expectations, he predicts that Tesla Inc (TSLA) stock could move toward $330. To capture the possibility of a strong week, Gordon bought a call spread consisting of buying the 320-strike call and selling the 325-strike call expiring on Friday. He'll see the biggest profit off this call spread if Tesla Inc (TSLA) stock ends this week at or above $325.Tesla stock also riding on <person><nameText>Elon Musk's </nameText></person>TED talkMuch of today's rally could be attributed to Musk's TED talk on Friday, in which he spoke on various topics, including Tesla Inc (TSLA)'s Autopilot system. The company has gotten a lot of flak[4] over Autopilot, but Musk claims that in 'about two years,' drivers will be able to sleep soundly at the wheel of their Tesla Inc (TSLA) when the vehicle sets off on a trip and wake up later when they reach their destination. That's a pretty tall order, and it's one that probably won't stand up to regulations because it seems very unlikely that in only two years, regulators will be ready to allow drivers to sleep while their car drives itself autonomously. <person><nameText>Elon Musk </nameText></person>also said that in November or December, they will show that a Tesla Inc (TSLA) vehicle will be able to make a trip from New York to Los Angeles entirely on Autopilot without any assistance from a driver. This is something he's been talking about for quite some time, and this could be more realistic. He also claims that the vehicle will be able to do this while also adjusting its own route in real time rather than having a route programmed in. Further, he claims that Autopilot will be able to adjust to a sudden destination change. <person><nameText>Elon Musk's </nameText></person>full TED talk is embedded at the end of this article.And Tesla's biggest competitor isIndeed, autonomous driving is arguably the hottest automotive niche right now, and it's so big that Morgan Stanley analyst and Tesla Inc (TSLA) stock perma-bull[5] Adam Jonas feels that the company's biggest competitor probably isn't other automakers. In a note dated April 28, Jonas \u2014 who still has his price target at $305 and rating at Overweight despite the run in the shares \u2014 highlighted the growing list of companies with permits to test autonomous vehicles in California. That list includes not only Tesla Inc (TSLA) and other automakers such as Volkswagen and Nissan, but also big tech names such as NVIDIA, Uber and Apple. He said the last eight permits issued by the California DMV were not auto firms, which demonstrates that it isn't just automakers with a stake in the autonomous driving[6] game. Tesla Inc (TSLA) stock soared to a record high of $327.25 during regular trading hours on Monday.

On the call last Wednesday, Tesla CEO Elon Musk talked about how far away we are from Level 5 autonomous driving, or even Level 4.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Here is what Musk said:</p><p>\"So I guess like, I don't know, 98% good right now, but we need it to be like 99.999%, really extremely reliable. So - and the capability will be there for - when will we think it's safe for full self-driving? It's probably towards the end of this year, and then it's up to regulators to decide when they want to approve that.\"</p><p>If you are at 98% accuracy for autonomous driving right now, you are practically nowhere. In 100 seconds of driving, you will crash and possibly die, twice. A severely drunk person, or a five-year-old, would do a better job at driving safely. Dying within the first minute of the car driving you around, is not a selling point to the consumer.</p><p>Musk is right that you need to get to at least 99.999% for an autonomous car to be in the zone of reliability. Maybe it's more like 99.9999% or 99.99999%, but let's go with Musk's 99.999% for now, just to give him the benefit of the doubt.</p><p>The difference between 98% and 99.999 is huge. It's four orders of magnitude. It's something that will likely take at least 20 to 30 years to accomplish. We are simply not anywhere close today -- not Tesla, not anyone else.</p><p>Autonomous technologies will continue to improve, and help assist a driver in avoiding an accident if the driver makes a mistake, falls asleep, or has a heart attack. This will be very useful and helpful. All automakers are implementing such improvement, step by step, on ever-less expensive cars. Technologies available on sub-$25,000 cars today, were in many cases unavailable on $50,000 to $100,000 cars just three years ago.</p><p>However, \"full self driving\" in the sense of being Level 5 driverless, remains decades away. Try having a car follow directions from a cop waving his hands, to get around a stalled truck on a one-lane road, in a snowstorm. Or park in a field for a game during an off-road exercise.</p><p>Self-driving cars will have to be severely geo-fenced and weather-fenced, among other things. They may work at lower speeds in a low-complexity campus environment. But not in the real world, where they have to mix with all kinds of real traffic, unusual obstacles, and weather.</p><p>Elon Musk was right about needing to be at the 99.999% level of better. But by saying that Tesla is now at 98%, he admits that he is decades away from delivering what he is promising for already this year, 2019. He makes impossible promises.</p><p>________</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">At the time of submitting this article for publication, the author was short TSLA and long FCAU.

Les boursiers n'ont, d\u00e9cid\u00e9ment, pas d'humour et la blague d'Elon Musk lui a co\u00fbt\u00e9 plusieurs milliards de dollars. Toujours aussi d\u00e9jant\u00e9, le patron du constructeur de voitures \u00e9lectriques haut de gamme (et de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 a\u00e9rospatiale SpaceX) a voulu faire son \u00abpoisson\u00bb, dimanche 1eravril.<url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/980566101124722688\"> Il a post\u00e9 ce Tweet</url>: \u00abMalgr\u00e9 d'intenses efforts pour trouver de l'argent, y compris une tentative d\u00e9sesp\u00e9r\u00e9e de vente massive d'oeufs de P\u00e2ques, Tesla a fait totalement et compl\u00e8tement faillite. Une faillite telle que vous ne pouvez m\u00eame pas l'imaginer\u00bb. Il a aussi publi\u00e9 une photo de lui, un \u00e9criteau sur la poitrine, barr\u00e9 du mot \u00abbankwupt\u00bb (\u00abruin\u00e9\u00bb), assorti de ce commentaire: \u00abElon a \u00e9t\u00e9 trouv\u00e9 \u00e9vanoui contre une Tesla Model 3, entour\u00e9 de bouteilles \u00abTeslaquilla\u00bb, des traces de larmes s\u00e9ch\u00e9es encore visibles sur ses joues.\u00bb</p><p>Ce n'\u00e9tait vraiment pas le moment, m\u00eame si M. Musk est agac\u00e9 par la chute de 20% de l'action Tesla \u00e0 Wall Street depuis un mois. Le titre a encore plong\u00e9 de 5,1%, lundi, \u00e0 la Bourse de New York. Le constructeur traverse une passe industrielle et financi\u00e8re difficile: retards dans la production du dernier-n\u00e9 de sa gamme, le Model 3, et baisse annonc\u00e9e de ses objectifs de ventes; rappel de 123000 Tesla S avant le week-end; enqu\u00eate du r\u00e9gulateur am\u00e9ricain des transports apr\u00e8s un r\u00e9cent accident mortel impliquant un de ses v\u00e9hicules autonomes, m\u00eame si Tesla assure que le conducteur avait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00fbment averti qu'il lui fallait reprendre le volant.</p><p> Fragile titan </p><p>Presque toutes les Big Tech sont sous surveillance des march\u00e9s, certains investisseurs estimant avoir trop de valeurs technologiques dans leur portefeuille. Et dans le collimateur des hommes politiques, aux Etats-Unis et en Europe: Amazon, clou\u00e9 au pilori de Twitter par un Donald Trump accusant le g\u00e9ant du e-commerce de mettre la Poste am\u00e9ricaine sous tension et de d\u00e9truire le commerce traditionnel, y compris des enseignes historiques comme Toys'R'Us; Facebook, \u00e9branl\u00e9 par le scandale Cambridge Analytica, un pillage de 50millions de profils d'internautes au profit d'hommes politiques; Uber, lui aussi mis en cause apr\u00e8s l'accident mortel caus\u00e9 par un de ses v\u00e9hicules autonomes en Arizona. Nombre de ces soci\u00e9t\u00e9s ont ainsi vu fondre leur capitalisation ces derni\u00e8res semaines.</p><p>Mais peu de titans de la Silicon Valley sont aussi fragiles que Tesla. Depuis sa cr\u00e9ation en2003, il n'a pas d\u00e9gag\u00e9 de b\u00e9n\u00e9fices annuels. Sa dette est lourde et co\u00fbteuse, et il va encore devoir faire appel au march\u00e9 pour se refinancer. L'avenir de la \u00abmaison Musk\u00bb repose donc sur la confiance d'investisseurs pr\u00eats \u00e0 mettre ou remettre au pot pour continuer ce qui ressemble bien \u00e0 une aventure. Et sans esp\u00e9rer que l'entreprise fasse des profits dans l'imm\u00e9diat. Apr\u00e8s tout, les actionnaires fid\u00e8les n'ont pas eu \u00e0 se plaindre: l'action a gagn\u00e9 515% en cinq ans. Ils attendent n\u00e9anmoins avec impatience - et inqui\u00e9tude - la publication du nouveau rythme de production du Model 3 dans quelques jours. Et l\u00e0, le fantasque patron de Tesla n'aura pas droit au poisson d'avril.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

Good Thursday morning. Thanks for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Thursday, August 9th. Your top stories right now 8:00 a.m. on the East Coast. Show me the money, that's the call to Tesla from Wall Street and Washington. The Securities and Exchange Commission reportedly launching a probe into Elon Musk's tweet about going private.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">My interview with former SEC Chairman Harvey Pitt is coming up this morning to talk about that. Escalating trade tensions weighing on global investors. Futures edging higher this morning, Dow Industrials up 20 points. S&amp;P 500 and the NASDAQ up just fractionally three points higher. This after a mixed performance yesterday on Wall Street, the NASDAQ was the gain top performer with the gain of four points on the session.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Dow Industrials down 45 at the close yesterday. In Europe this morning, markets are mixed. Take a look at the European indices and we are looking at some pressure on stocks this morning, in Europe, as well. FT- 100 down 50 points, three quarters of one percent. The CAC quarante down a quarter of a percent, 15 points lower. And the DAX Index in Germany down 18 points.</p><p>In Asia overnight, stocks finished mostly higher, the standout was China, Shanghai Composite up about two percent. A pair of merger deals dead. First up, Sinclair's takeover of Tribune has been called off this morning following recent comments from SEC Chairman Ajit Pai. Plus, the Rite-Aid and Albertson's deal also terminated. The company say investor pushback is to blame, that deal also off for now.</p><p>The media sector in focus. We are watching earnings from Viacom and 21st Century Fox. We are breaking down the numbers there. And as you can see both stocks are higher this morning. A front row seat to a natural disaster. Check out this unbelievable video taken on chairlift of a volcano erupting. And as you can see it, it's pretty extraordinary. Plus, this outfit is going viral this morning.</p><p>But Instagram user cannot figure out if it's a dress or is it a bikini. We report you decide. Let us know what you think. You send us tweet on that. All stories coming up this Thursday morning and joining me to break it all down, Fox Business Network Kristina Partsinevelos is with us, the Wall Street Journal's assistant editorial page editor, James Freeman is here and former Arkansas governor, Republican presidential candidate, Mike Huckabee.</p><p>Great to see you everybody this morning.</p><p>MIKE HUCKABEE, FORMER ARKANSAS GOVERNOR: Good to be with you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Good morning.</p><p>HUCKABEE: Thanks.</p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Looking forward to your Harvey Pitt interview, makes sense of this Elon Musk tweets.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What do you think? What are the most important questions here?</p><p>FREEMAN: Well, it's funny. You think about these public statements being so careful and then he fires off what looked like very casual comments but I -- but I think it is a question. What does he need to show secure funding?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>FREEMAN: And does this mean he's now obligated to bid for $120 now that he's teased it on Twitter.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. And where is he going to get that money? I mean, who has that money to acquire and take the company private?</p><p>FREEMAN: Yes. Should be --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: It's $75 billion.</p><p>FREEMAN: Yes.</p><p>KRISTINA PARTSINEVELOS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: What about --</p><p>FREEMAN: And Harvey is the guy to answer these questions.</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS: Institutional investors. So (INAUDIBLE) fact that their share stake is five percent, one of the largest after Elon Musk when you talk about insiding -- insiders and then you have five massive institutional accounts like T. Rowe, these guys have big part. So it's either going to be existing shareholders, institutional investors or some really rich guys from Silicon Valley.</p><p>HUCKABEE: Won't be me, let me just --</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS: Or sovereign wealth fund.</p><p>HUCKABEE: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. We'll see. We know that the shorts certainly took a hit on that which is what he was intending. Our top story, Musk is under the microscope this morning. The Wall Street Journal is reporting that Securities and Exchange Commission is in fact probing Elon Musk's tweet to find out if it was truthful. This after the Tesla CEO tweeted two o days ago this and considering taking Tesla private at $420 a share.</p><p>Funding secured and with that, the stock rallied. Joining me right now is former SEC Chairman Harvey Pitt. Great to see you, Harvey. Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>HARVEY PITT, CHAIRMAN, SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION: Good to be with you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What do you think as a former chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission. What is the SEC looking at? Tell us where you see potential wrongdoing here.</p><p>PITT: Well, the entire announcement was highly problematic, and unprecedented and it's important to realize it's not the medium but it's the message. Going private transactions are usually announced in advance of the market opening or after the market closing. They're not announced in the middle day. Mr. Musk tweeted in the middle of the day. In addition it's not the CEO who announces this, but it is the board.</p><p>It's the company that makes this announcement. But here it was the CEO. What's more important is he stressed that he already had funding to pay $420 a share. But no efforts have yet been done to find out whether it's in the shareholders best interest to take the company private, and, if so, at what price, so all of this raises two fundamental questions. First, was he trying to artificially influence the price of the stock?</p><p>If he was that would be manipulation. Second, does he really have the money in hand? And is it binding commitment that would give him almost $70 billion in what would be at the largest going private transaction in U.S. history? That would be fraud if those things were not true.</p><p>BARTIROMO: OK. the SEC then needs to better understand what he was referring to when he said $420 and funding secured. Where would that money come from?</p><p>PITT: Well, it could come from either a consortium of banks, it could come from foreign sovereign investor. I mean -- the company did receive the big cash infusion from Saudi Arabia the day that earnings were announced this past week. So it's possible that that kind of money might exist. It's a large amount and it would take a great deal of effort to put it together. But it's not impossible.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Having said that, it's un-- it's unwise to be tweeting about this in middle of the day creating activity in the stock. Do you think the SEC is also looking at that given the fact that on the Saudi Arabia investment news, the stock gets rallied right before this announcement. It was up seven percent going into tweet and then up 11 percent after the tweet.</p><p>PITT: It's definitely the wrong way to do this kind of thing. It may not be per se illegal, but it is definitely highly problematic and it could be illegal depending on what his intentions were when he made the announcement.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So is there a deadline here, Harvey, in terms of when he would have to reveal his source of funding? I mean, if he says funding secured does the SEC want an answer now in terms of whether or not it's secured and how long does he have to come up with whatever deal he was referring to?</p><p>PITT: No. I think he is required to demonstrate that at the time of his tweet he already had a legally binding commitment for $420 a share. That would be the requirement, so the SEC can request or subpoena documents asking for proof as to what his financing was and what the legal basis was for his suggestion that it was secured which is a very strong term.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Very strong term. What's the penalty, Harvey, if Musk was just -- I don't want to say lying but coming up with an idea that perhaps wasn't necessarily intact funding secured, what's the penalty?</p><p>PITT: Well, we don't of course know if the facts are yet but the penalties are quite serious. If he committed fraud or manipulated the market, he would be liable both civilly for an extreme amount of damages but also he could have potential criminal liability as well.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Why criminal?</p><p>PITT: Because almost every violation of the Federal securities laws is both a civil problem that the SEC pursues and also a potential criminal issue that the Department of Justice pursues.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I see. And so when do you expect we'll hear more about this? I mean, for example, when are we going to better -- have a clearer idea whether or not there was in fact funding in place?</p><p>PITT: I would believe that the next set of announcements will come at some point from Tesla itself. The company will probably organize a special committee of independent directors who will then indicate exactly where matters stand and whether they are going to pursue Musk's suggest that the company go private. I don't think we will hear from the SEC until it has completed its investigation.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What about shareholder lawsuits, Harvey, are you expecting that to also be an issue here? Because I know that the short sellers loss at lot of money on that as the stock went up and that's basically what I assumed Elon Musk wanted to do because he's been sticking it to shorts and he's, you know, uncomfortable with some of the criticism that the company has received.</p><p>You saw a very upsetting conference call recently where he pushed back on some of the criticism and the short sellers questioning about his burn rate, how much cash is he burning? So, are you expecting shareholder lawsuits?</p><p>PITT: I think they are inevitable. It's just a matter of time before lawsuits are filed because of the enormous fluctuation in the price of the stock. I would think the shorts will bring a lawsuit against Mr. Musk and Tesla.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Is there any precedence here, Harvey? Have you ever seen something like this before?</p><p>PITT: I've never seen anything like this kind of announcement. I have seen short sellers, sue certainly companies and I have certainly seen companies sue short sellers. It's a fact of life that if you're public, you're going to get criticism and the shorts are people you just have to live with.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right. And, obviously, that's what they are doing. They're critical of the company. They're shorting the stock. I mean, that's why they exist. So you're expecting the SEC to be asking questions about the funding. Any other questions coming from the SEC in your view?</p><p>PITT: Well, I think they will look into why the board didn't make an announcement sooner, why they waited for Mr. Musk to go for -- forward, and I think they will also try to determine what kinds of behind-the-scenes activities were taken by the company.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So in other words, background because the board is saying yes, Harvey Pitt, the board is saying yes, that Elon Musk has discussed the potential of going private with us before. But there is no mention of any $420 price.</p><p>PITT: No. And where that price comes from is very hard to understand. It may be a very good price, but in terms of an economic analysis it may turn out that it's not as good a price as should be paid for this company.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, exactly. I mean, when you're talking about $420 a share, that's like $70 billion, right? $75 billion?</p><p>PITT: Yes. And unprecedented amount of money, it truly is.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. We will leave it there. Harvey, it's great to see you again. Hope you'll come back soon. Thanks so much for your insights this morning.</p><p>PITT: Sure. Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Harvey Pitt joining us there. And we'll take a short break. When we come back. The Tribune Media-Sinclair deal is dead. Tribune says that the $3.9 deal can no longer move forward after comments from SEC Chairman Ajit Pai. The latest coming up there. Then half dress, half bikini? The new dress causing confusion online. That's coming up.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Tribute Media called off its buyout by Sinclair Broadcast Group. Cheryl Casone with the details. Two deals that are dead today, Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: We got two deals, that is right, Maria. First to Tribune, they've terminated their $3.9-billion deal and they're suing Sinclair for breach of contract for not doing enough to win approval from regulators. You may remember last month, SEC Chairman Ajit Pai said he had serious concerns about the merger. Take a look at the stocks, shares of Sinclair right now, they are lower in the premarket trading.</p><p>Down more than three percent. Tribune Media, not really trading it but shares down more than 20 percent so far this year. So two stocks to watch now. We're also watching shares of Rite-Aid right now. The stock plunging more than 10 percent in the premarket. The sell-off coming after Rite-Aid and Albertsons called off their $24 billion merger. Some big Rite-Aid shareholders plan to vote against the deal today.</p><p>Rite-Aid and Albertsons wanted to team up in order to compete better against CBS, Walgreens and potentially as you know Amazon has been trying to get into the pharmaceutical business as well.</p><p>All right. Check this out. A volcanic eruption in Chile gets a rider on a ski list, the front row seat to the action all on tape. The eruption shot up a 5,000 foot column of dust and ash as he was filming all of this with his cell phone. This comes from a volcano complex that's in the Andes Mountain but pretty incredible pictures and pretty close.</p><p>And finally there is this. We've seen some pretty weird fashion trends in the last year, upside down shorts, plastic jeans. Well, here is a new one. This is a bikini and it's a dress, all in one. This comes from the fashion brand, PrettyLittleThing. And after having one of their models wear it on Instagram picture, people started to freak out.</p><p>There it is. We'll let you decide. Looks like she couldn't decide on what to wear so she cut both in half and sewed them together. Maybe. Here's another comment. She's going to dinner, clubbing and swimming all at once. Yes. The whole thing goes for $35.00 maybe. Maria, you could wear it with some crack heels? You know.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>CASONE: That would be an interesting pairing.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Sure would. So is it a -- is it a dress or is it a bikini?</p><p>CASONE: It's both.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It's both.</p><p>CASONE: Yes. Because --</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS: Why not have both?</p><p>BARTIROMO: You're getting your money for it.</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS: Remember the black or blue dress or is it blue or white dress?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS: Same thing. But I know about you. I think, Governor, it would look better own you with man-bun, crack heels.</p><p>HUCKABEE: Pretty sure it wouldn't.</p><p>FREEMAN: Going to be strong with the man-bun. Yes.</p><p>HUCKABEE: Yes.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: You got to really loving this man-bun.</p><p>HUCKABEE: -- I would feel naked. Oh.</p><p>FREEMAN: If I wear that without the man-bun I would just feel just naked.</p><p>HUCKABEE: You thought of either of us wearing that is something that there are television sets across America that are going to be off mode.</p><p>BARTIROMO: No.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: We don't want that. We don't want that. Coming up. Viacom is reporting quarterly earnings this morning. We're breaking down those numbers coming up next. Big week for media. Then overhauling the Oscars. Details on new changes coming to the academy awards quarterly including the addition of a popular film category, next.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Both parent company of the Fox Business Network, 21st Century Fox quarterly profit nearly doubled due to cable and film strength. Nicole Petallides on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange watching the stock and the overall market this morning. Nic, good morning to you.</p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Good morning, Maria. So we talked about 21st Century Fox, our parent and it beat on top and bottom line. The analyst have to optimism there as you noted in those particular areas and that's exactly what came. In fact it did better than expected. Deadpool 2, the strength of Fox News just among the reasons why we did see it beat the 18 percent year over year.</p><p>Revenue increase, strong double-digit growth across all the segments and the new and obviously what happened, the transaction, Disney and the new Fox transactions, that -- they say unlocked enormous shareholder value. In fact when you take a look at the stock over the fiscal year it's about 75 percent gain, that clearly outpaces the S&amp;P 500. And the media group which actually has declined over that period.</p><p>Of course, there's still locked in the -- in the bidding war with CMSCA and that would be Comcast, but --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. You check that?</p><p>PETALLIDES: We'll watch that. So that is the big difference. Also, last but not least, we're taking a look at Viacom this morning and that came in profit top revenue fell and there was the slump in ad sales which fell short. And that number which I did talk about the increased shareholder value I did get from the 21st Century Fox headlines themselves. Back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, Nic. Thank you so much. Nicole, we'll be watching all of that. Switching gears to the censorship of conservatives on social media. It has the attention of lawmakers now including House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy who talked to us about this as well as House Intelligence Chairman Devin Nunes who want - both want answers on action. Listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA), HOUSE MAJORITY LEADER: I want to see bias stop, especially going after conservatives. I mean, just look at three points that showed up in Google right before the primary election in California. The party of Lincoln, the party of Reagan, that's not what it said, it said Nazism.</p><p>REP. DEVIN NUNES (R-CA), CHAIRMAN, SENATE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE: I don't know what Twitter is up to. It sure looks to me like they're censoring people and they ought -- they ought to stop it and we're looking at any legal remedies that we can go through.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. So that was Devin Nunes and Kevin McCarthy. Kevin McCarthy was talking about remember right before the primary elections in California. You Googled GOP California and in the search results got Naziism. Your thoughts, Governor. I know this is an important topic to you.</p><p>HUCKABEE: Well, it really is an important topic. We talk about Russian interference. I'm worried about social media interference. How are they manipulating elections, how are they manipulating the information and the question comes as somebody who doesn't really like government regulation and intervention, we're headed there.</p><p>We're going to get it because social media platforms are no longer just social media where people chit-chat about their yoga classes and their daughter's wedding, they're now the place where people get news, they are public utilities just like electricity, water, cable television and telephone. And so government is going to step in at some point. I think sooner than later and they're going to regulate them.</p><p>The social media companies will rue the day when they started favoring one point of view over another. But here's why that matters. Would Americans tolerate it if you paid differently for your electricity, your water or your telephone based on your political view of where you went to church? You would be outraged. Liberal conservative or independent, you'd be outraged. That's what we're seeing today.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And there's also so-called, shadowed banning, James, I mean --</p><p>FREEMAN: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You know, I mean, I had put out a tweet about James Clapper basically admitting on CNN that President Obama directed the Intelligence Agencies to launch investigation for the special counsel on the Trump- Russia and I -- and I -- and basically Jim Clapper -- James Clapper admitted it on CNN. So I tweeted that out, it got no life, no -- and I thought, you know, this is something that I know my followers care about.</p><p>And I felt to myself, hmm, is that shadow banning? I don't know. I wonder if my followers saw that tweet or if it just went on deaf ears.</p><p>FREEMAN: Well, we've had a bunch of these teases where certainly conservative viewpoints seem to be suppressed. The answers from Silicon Valley generally are often not denials but sort of saying, well, it wasn't intentional, it's the algorithm.</p><p>BARTIROMO: But somebody programs the algorithm change.</p><p>FREEMAN: Yes. So, I agree. I think there's enough ear to say there is a problem of bias. It's -- I think it -- I'm hoping first there's a consumer remedy, we've seen user growth surprisingly kind of flattened --</p><p>BARTIROMO: You're right.</p><p>FREEMAN: In these recent earnings reports but I'm hoping it can be disciplined either through customer behavior or maybe it has to be private litigation as opposed to creating a new Federal internet regulator and I think that's the big danger here is that the big tech giants are trying to cut a deal with both parties in Washington that gives them liability protection but it also sets up the Federal Trade Commission to have huge powers over the internet.</p><p>And this could -- this is actually a deal that could happen, very quickly, I think, and that is the anger I see for innovation because the utility model you don't get a lot of innovation out of the phone company, the water company, et cetera. So I'm hoping there is a market remedy for this and maybe consumers, you know, are starting to say I want --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HUCKABEE: I mean, I wish there was a market remedy, I would much rather see it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>HUCKABEE: But these companies are --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Some competition.</p><p>HUCKABEE: -- hearing the bells. I mean, they're bringing it upon themselves because they are actively suppressing the points of view of certain people and when they do that, the market is going to rise up and I think --</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS: What about Alex Jones and certain hate groups, they're censoring certain things that are clearly fake, if you want to say it, fake news and he is discounting Sandy Hook and the children and families there. So when he's -- when somebody is putting out inaccurate facts that have been proven to be wrong then why not get rid of him?</p><p>FREEMAN: Well, that's a fun --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS: Well, this is why we're talking about it.</p><p>FREEMAN: -- user organization. But of course, these social media companies have enjoyed a lot of legal protection on the basis that they are not news organizations, that it's an open platform anyone in public.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's a good point.</p><p>FREEMAN: Now that they're making those kind of judgments, they better be ready for different treatment --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HUCKABEE: And the first amendment protects stupidity, it protects outrages speech. I don't like it but it does protect it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. Let's take a quick break. We got the PPI on the other side of this break. Stay with us. Producer Price Index, we'll take a look at inflation.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Good Thursday morning. Welcome back, everybody, thanks so much for joining us this morning. I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Thursday, August 9th. Your top stories right now 8:30 a.m. on the east coast. We are just getting the Producer Price Index out. It is unchanged. A gain of three-tenths of a percent was expected, and that's what it looks like this morning, unchanged on the Producer Price Index. Not a major reaction from markets this morning. We've been looking at a fractional move all morning. Dow Industrials right now up 20 points, S&amp;P 500 up three, and the NASDAQ up 4-1/2. Initial jobless claims also out right now, down 6,000.</p><p>Global markets action in Europe this morning, take a look at European indices, obviously down across the board. FT-100 down 50 points, that's two-thirds of one percent. The CAC Quarante is down a quarter of a percent, 16 points lower, and the DAX Index in Germany is flat, down six points. In Asia Overnight, the standout was China. Chinese markets bouncing back on hopes to the stimulus against U.S. tariffs. Shanghai Composite up almost two percent. And PPI is out, unchanged on the session versus a two-tenths of a percent estimate, James Freeman. Your thoughts on where we are on inflation.</p><p>FREEMAN: Yes. Pretty benign environment right now, the economy is humming, fast growth but inflation not yet raging even though the Feds still has this huge balance sheet they acquired in the wake of the financial crisis. So, I think the hope here is that as we transition back to the real economy, we can do it without an inflation surge. And so far so good.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And year-over-year, Kristina, on inflation on the PPI is 3.3 percent, very much in step with what we've been -- what we've been expecting.</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS: Right. And if anything, maybe this can add to the argument that wage growth hasn't been climbing higher. So, now that inflation is staying relatively flat, that's OK because of wage growth not climbing high enough or lasted a while.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Wages have just been creeping up, the 2.8 percent higher year-over-year on wages, we'll keep following that and any impact on markets this morning. We have breaking news right now out of North Korea. North Korea says that if the Trump administration, \"adheres to all scenarios,\" then there's no chance of progress on denuclearization. Blake Burman is live at the White House this morning with more on that. Blake, good morning to you.</p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT: Hi there, Maria, good morning to you as well. This obviously raises more questions about just how intent North Korea is on resolving the issue of denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula. The headline that is coming out this morning is that the North Koreans say that if the Trump administration adheres to old scenarios, it cannot expect any progress on denuclearization, something that the White House certainly will watch throughout the day. And of course, the upcoming weeks and months as the President right now is in Bedminster, New Jersey for a week off on what the White House is characterizing as a working vacation.</p><p>Meantime, here in Washington later today, the Vice President Mike Pence will lay out what the administration hopes to deploy in the upcoming years that being a sixth branch of the military, the Space Force. The President said earlier this summer that he wanted the military to build out this new branch of government.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Now, our destiny beyond the Earth is not only a matter of national identity, but a matter of national security. When it comes to defending America, it is not enough to merely have an American presence in space, we must have American dominance in space.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURMAN: The Air Force already though has a robust presence patrolling outer space especially as it relates to the use and deployment of satellites. That responsibility would go to the Space Force which would be responsible for conducting war plans for space, but there are many questions here, including how the military would be reshaped. The defense secretary James Mattis admitting earlier this week that they are still trying to work out on how the actual organization would take place within the military. By the way, Maria, there is also the congressional issue on this one as well because a sixth branch of the military would need Congressional approval and, of course, Congressional funding. We will hear from the Vice President later today, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, Blake, thank you so much. Blake Burman with the latest there. Joining us right now is Fox News Legal Analyst and author of the new book, \"The Russia Hoax: The Illicit Scheme to Clear Hillary Clinton and Frame Donald Trump.\" Gregg Jarrett is with us. Gregg, great to see you, thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>GREGG JARRETT, FOX NEWS LEGAL ANALYST: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Congrats on the book. And as I read the title and as I report on what has teken place in the 2016 election. It seems exactly accurate in terms of what happened.</p><p>JARRETT: Thank you. Well, you would know because you have done so much to further the story yourself. I wrote this book because actually I became incensed in outraged, the top officials at the FBI and the Department of Justice were abusing their positions of power to subvert the rule of law, and undermine the democratic process, and I think I lay out a fairly persuasive case here of the facts, the evidence, and the law, that this was a cesspool of corruption. And by the way, it still is, because they continue to cover it up.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And the latest has a real focus on Bruce Ohr, the number three guy at the DOJ, whose wife worked for Fusion GPS.</p><p>JARRETT: I mean, talk about an incestuous collection of corrupt acts. You know, the FBI knew that Christopher Steele, who phonied up the anti-Trump dossier, was already on the payroll of Hillary Clinton, he was on the payroll of the FBI. And when the FBI finally fired Christopher Steele, their regulations say you can't have any more contact with him, so they were very devious. They used Bruce Ohr at the Department of Justice as the conduit, the intermediary. The FBI continued to receive Christopher Steele information, spying on Trump after he was inaugurated for several months thereafter.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. You know, what gets me, Governor, is, you know, it feels like the left in their hatred of President Trump, so much they've thrown out all ideals, they've thrown out values of, you know, the law of the land, and it was OK to spy on Carter Page, oh, because it's Trump. You know, it's OK to abuse your power at the top of the FBI, oh, it's Trump. It's incredible.</p><p>HUCKABEE: Well, it is incredible. And Gregg, congratulations on the book.</p><p>JARRETT: Thank you.</p><p>HUCKABEE: It reads like a novel. The frightening thing is that it's not fiction, it's fact, and you lay out an incredibly compelling case in a chronological order, which I think is a great value to the reader. So, it's a -- it's a powerful book. We've seen the weaponization of the agencies of our federal government going after a presidential candidate in a fashion we've never seen before, the highest levels. But when they are using their own power in this way, to create a false dossier, on which the warrant is obtained, legally, does that not put them with the fruit of the poisonous tree, and so that whatever they end up would be able to be pushed back because they got it illegally?</p><p>JARRETT: Yes, absolutely, under the exclusionary rule, it would be excluded as evidence. The law enforcers became the lawbreakers. And what's outrageous is --</p><p>HUCKABEE: That's powerful statement.</p><p>JARRETT: Yes, they're not being investigated and prosecuted. I lay out myriad of potential crimes here, by people like Andrew McCabe, James Comey, and you know, Peter Strzok, Lisa Page, and the list goes on and on, things like abusive power which is a felony. Obstruction of justice, they obstructed their own investigation to clear Hillary Clinton. And on the same day they cleared her, Comey is standing in front of cameras, his FBI is meeting secretly in London with Christopher Steele to begin the frame job on President Trump, then-candidate Trump.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wow. And you say that this all started when then-FBI director Jim Comey cleared Hillary Clinton in the e-mail server probe back in 2016. Watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JAMES COMEY, FORMER DIRECTOR, FBI: Although, we did not find clear evidence that Secretary Clinton or her colleagues intended to violate laws governing the handling of classified information, there is evidence that they were extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly- classified information.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, while they were putting together a narrative about Donald Trump, they were very easy on Hillary Clinton. And they basically did not investigate.</p><p>JARRETT: Absolutely. And it was one deception, and I believe, lie after another from James Comey as you saw there on that very day. He had originally written it, Hillary Clinton committed crimes. He wrote it down twice, gross negligence, but his staff said, well, you can't clear her if you put that in your statement, so they sit down at Peter Strzok's computer and they expunge from Comey's statements, those incriminating words and other allegations of criminality by Hillary Clinton. The swamp didn't want to be drained. And a potential President Trump jeopardized their ambitions and positions of power, so they sought to damage his candidacy, and when they didn't do that and he was elected, they sought to undo the election.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's incredible. James?</p><p>FREEMAN: And the -- when you talk about the swamp going after now- President Trump, but then-candidate Trump, do we have a sense yet of exactly when this began? There seems to have been I think a real challenge for Congressional investigators figuring out when was the real beginning of whether it was intelligence or law enforcement assets descending on the Trump campaign?</p><p>BARTIROMO: And this is what Devin Nunes is investigating right now, what happened before actual launch of the investigation, which, of course, was July 2016?</p><p>JARRETT: Some of the documents that Devin Nunes is trying to get his hands on that Rod Rosenstein and Christopher Wray will not hand over the origins of the Trump-Russia collusion investigation, it looks to me like, the FBI began spying on the Trump campaign seven months before they formally signed the papers launching the investigation. And by the way, when they signed those papers, they violated their own FBI guidelines, there was no probable cause, no evidence of crimes, no plausible intelligence for counterintelligence probe, they broke the law and the rules.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Do you think there'll be any accountability here?</p><p>JARRETT: Not with Jeff Sessions and Rod Rosenstein at the helm of the Department of Justice. And that's a sad commentary on our system of justice right now. But Sessions is utterly feckless and Rosenstein, I think, is trying to continue to cover up his own wrongdoing. This is a guy who should have recused himself the moment he appointed Mueller. You can't be a prosecutor and a key witness all rolled into one.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Because he OK'd the fourth FISA warrant.</p><p>JARRETT: That's right. And you can only do that when you have new evidence. The best we can tell so far, they have no new evidence.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And there wasn't any evidence from the get-go, it was just the dossier.</p><p>JARRETT: That's right. And the FBI knew that the dossier was totally fabricated. You can read it online, I've read it a hundred times. I never failed to laugh. You know, it is the work of an amateur dime novelist in junior high school. And even Christopher Steele who wrote it, said, in court papers under oath in Great Britain, which I dug up, and it's in the book, that it's unverifiable because it was a guy who told a guy, who told the guy, who told me. Triple, quadruple hearsay based on anonymous sources. You can't use that sort of thing in a court of law. Get the FBI and DOJ, use it to gain a warrant to wiretap -- that's abuse of power to fraud on the court.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, this is one political party spying on the -- on their opponent, there on the left.</p><p>JARRETT: Right. And where's the outrage over Hillary Clinton paying for all of this? Now, that is a violation of the law. The Trump Tower meeting, perfect legal. All the media has to do is read the federal campaign election act. Foreign nationals may participate in American political campaigns and providing any information is not a thing of value. But stonewalling to Congress is something I do not understand why it continues. They have a constitutional obligation to give Congress what it wants. And Congress should use the power of the purse and cut off the money.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Into the oversight agency.</p><p>JARRETT: That's the only way to have. Yes. Absolutely. But I blame Congress because for decades, whenever the Department of Justice and FBI didn't want to hand over documents, they just said we're not going to do it, and Congress never took action.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>JARRETT: So, it's been habitual.</p><p>FREEMAN: Well, the President could order all of this declassified.</p><p>JARRETT: And he should. I think he is considering it, but you know, there are -- there are those advising him not to. He should absolutely order declassification of a FISA application documents, the Gang of Eight documents and the origin documents.</p><p>BARTIROMO: The American people have a right to know and they want to know. \"The Russia Hoax,\" is the book, \"The Illicit Scheme to Clear Hillary Clinton and Frame Donald Trump.\" Gregg Jarrett, thank you so much.</p><p>JARRETT: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Congrats on the book. Great to see you.</p><p>JARRETT: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We have breaking news right now we want to get to, Russian Foreign Ministry is saying this, Moscow will work on retaliatory measures in response to the new U.S. sanctions against Russia, it's according to Reuters this morning. The U.S. imposed new sanctions tied to the nerve agent poisoning of a former Russian spy and his daughter, that of course, breaking this week. We'll be right back.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Uber and Lyft hitting a roadblock in New York City. The city council voted to limit the number of vehicles on the streets. Joining us now, the host of \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY,\" Stuart Varney to weigh in. Stu, good morning to you.</p><p>STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Good morning, Maria. You know, I think there's a backlash coming to this thing. As you say, the Mayor of New york is imposing a cap on the number of Uber and Lyft cars allowed in the city. In my opinion, that leaves a lot of wait times and to higher prices. But there's something else going on here, yellow cabs have often been accused (INAUDIBLE) regular taxicabs in New York City often accused of not picking up people of color because of their color. Uber has a way out.</p><p>Uber doesn't care what color you are, Uber doesn't care what your ethnicity is, they pick you up, it's all electronic. Well, that is going to be capped at the -- basically at the doings of the willing of the taxi industry. I think there's a backlash coming here from the minorities. Worse yet, I think there's going to be -- I think New York City will be used as a template as a test case for other cities in America and around the world, which want to fence in Uber, because they are devastating the local taxi industry. I think this is the wrong decision on so many levels, and I hope it's withdrawn, I don't think it will be but it should be.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Meaning there's a lot of backlash because, you know, look what happened to the taxis. The prices of the medallion plummeted.</p><p>VARNEY: Yes, the medallion was 2 -- was 1.3 million in 2013, and now it's between 160 and 250,000.</p><p>BARTIROMO: There you go.</p><p>VARNEY: That's a huge loss of capital for the taxi owners and this is their way of pushing back. But I think the pushback is very detrimental to many, many people.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. We'll watch that. Stu, I know you'll have more on that in about 10 minutes. We'll see you then top of the hour \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" begins at 9:00 a.m. Eastern, right after MORNINGS WITH MARIA. Join Stuart in the next few minutes. But first, overhauling the Oscars, details on the new changes coming to the Academy Awards including the addition of a popular film category, that's next.</p><p>GERRI WILLIS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: -- arts and sciences cutting the link to the show and introducing a category for outstanding achievement in popular film. Critics have complained that the broadcast is too long, too boring, too political, too condescending -- oh, maybe that's just my view.</p><p>Audiences would appear to agree, giving me telecast, its lowest ratings on record last February when a mere 26.5 million people tuned in. Remember, the Super Bowl got 107 million. Academy CEO Dawn Hudson said the board is, quote, committed to producing an entertaining show in three hours. Wow. Three -- it takes you three hours? The move was met with a frenzy of criticism, particularly from in the street journalists. Atlantic reporter David Sims called the (INAUDIBLE) award, the Black Panther memorial award for movie that were afraid won't get a big picture -- best picture nominations. Other called it lazy, ham-handed. In recent years, hit films like \"Wonder Woman\" have been snubbed by Oscar, although blockbusters from the past like \"Gone With the Wind\" were heavily recognized.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, good changes?</p><p>WILLIS: Not the right changes necessary (INAUDIBLE) always a good idea. Can we do this in like 30 minutes or something?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Three hours.</p><p>HUCKABEE: You can get a kidney replacement in less time and it's not as painful as watching the Oscars.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Your thoughts on the changes.</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS: People like -- I remember when I was a kid, I used to love watching it because you'd never know who would win and you'd sit around together, and then the outfits, so I don't think that they're really going to shorten it that much, but they have lost viewership, for sure, because there's --</p><p>WILLIS: It's brutal. I always (INAUDIBLE) 4 million people every single night, OK? I mean, think about it.</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS: But also the performance. The performances and the actors and the comedians in between sets, those are -- that's pretty decent stuff, and sometimes there's controversy that comes out of it, so that's what I would watch for. I don't watch it, but --</p><p>WILLIS: I thought you'd see the fashion and would be happy. That's all I really need.</p><p>FREEMAN: I think beyond the suffocating politics, they just -- you have too many movies that almost no one in the television audience has seen so I understand what they're trying to do here. Maybe they ought to just recognize some of these films that a lot of Americans think were the best pictures: \"American Sniper\" -- I mean, most people would say that's a great movie, right?</p><p>WILLIS: Right. Well, this popcorn award, that's what they're trying to do.</p><p>BARTIROMO: The popular film.</p><p>WILLIS: Yes, popular film. But you know, that's sort of like a ghetto for popular -- you know, like, though, it should really win the major categories. You know what I mean? It should be elevated to the level of \"Gone With the Wind,\" lots of very popular movies in previous years won those awards, not anymore.</p><p>FREEMAN: People don't watch the Oscars, though, because they want a political lecture that insults half of America. They want to -- they want to escape from all of that and have entertainment. When the celebrities go up there and lecture us and preach to us and point their fingers --</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS: They don't do that all the time during Oscars. I'm going to fight back against that. If you watch the full show --</p><p>BARTIROMO: It's become much more political.</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS: -- not all politics.</p><p>BARTIROMO: But it has become much more political.</p><p>HUCKABEE: It doesn't have to be all politics, but when all the politics they have is negative toward half the population, what happens? People say I'll watch paint dry before I'll sit here and watch this.</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS: There's always going to be something that's going to offend somebody out there, and usually, politics makes for good comedy.</p><p>HUCKABEE: But their ratings are tanking. It's not working. Maybe they should listen to us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Gerri, good stuff.</p><p>WILLIS: I'm staying 30 minutes. I think I'm going to --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Coming up, final thoughts from this all-star panel. Stay with us. We'll be right back.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Final thoughts from our all-star panel right now. Governor Huckabee?</p><p>HUCKABEE: I want to say thanks to James Freeman for writing a book called \"Borrowed Time,\" and giving really powerful insight into the financial crisis, I think it's a very, very important book, people need to read it, and I hope they will. James, I want it to be a bestseller.</p><p>FREEMAN: Thanks, Governor.</p><p>BARTIROMO: \" Borrowed Time: Two Centuries of Booms, Busts, and Bailouts at Citi.\" Check out the book. Congratulations.</p><p>FREEMAN: I just want to say that the Governor is very handsome and very charming man.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>FREEMAN: And a model American citizen.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Kristina?</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS: Well, I'm not going to -- I'm going to take a serious route just because we haven't been able to --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Hey, this is serious.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: This is serious stuff right here.</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS: You bring a wonderful book and you're a gorgeous man.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS: Now, the timing just seems so awkward.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Tell us. This is an important story, too.</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS: This is an important story, but you guys are great. Saudi Arabia and Canada, the relations going on between both those countries, Canada foreign affairs minister tweeting about the human rights -- two human rights activists in Saudi. Saudi is saying, you can't tell us anything and what to do. So, I think that's just a big story, a big story.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. We'll follow that. Kristina Partsinevelos, James Freeman, Mike Huckabee, great to see, everybody. Thank you so much. Great show, everybody. We'll see you again tomorrow. \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" is now.

Good Thursday  morning.  Thanks for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Thursday,  August 9th.  Your top stories right now 8:00 a.m. on the East Coast.  Show  me the money, that's the call to Tesla from Wall Street and Washington.   The Securities and Exchange Commission reportedly launching a probe into  Elon Musk's tweet about going private.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">My interview with former SEC Chairman Harvey Pitt is coming up this morning  to talk about that.  Escalating trade tensions weighing on global  investors.  Futures edging higher this morning, Dow Industrials up 20  points.  S&amp;P 500 and the NASDAQ up just fractionally three points higher.   This after a mixed performance yesterday on Wall Street, the NASDAQ was the  gain top performer with the gain of four points on the session.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Dow Industrials down 45 at the close yesterday.  In Europe this  morning, markets are mixed.  Take a look at the European indices and we are  looking at some pressure on stocks this morning, in Europe, as well.  FT- 100 down 50 points, three quarters of one percent.  The CAC quarante down a  quarter of a percent, 15 points lower.  And the DAX Index in Germany down  18 points.</p><p>In Asia overnight, stocks finished mostly higher, the standout was China,  Shanghai Composite up about two percent.  A pair of merger deals dead.   First up, Sinclair's takeover of Tribune has been called off this morning  following recent comments from SEC Chairman Ajit Pai.  Plus, the Rite-Aid  and Albertson's deal also terminated.  The company say investor pushback is  to blame, that deal also off for now.</p><p>The media sector in focus.  We are watching earnings from Viacom and 21st  Century Fox.  We are breaking down the numbers there.  And as you can see  both stocks are higher this morning. A front row seat to a natural  disaster.  Check out this unbelievable video taken on chairlift of a  volcano erupting.  And as you can see it, it's pretty extraordinary.  Plus,  this outfit is going viral this morning.</p><p>But Instagram user cannot figure out if it's a dress or is it a bikini.  We  report you decide.  Let us know what you think.  You send us tweet on that.   All stories coming up this Thursday morning and joining me to break it all  down, Fox Business Network Kristina Partsinevelos is with us, the Wall  Street Journal's assistant editorial page editor, James Freeman is here and  former Arkansas governor, Republican presidential candidate, Mike Huckabee. </p><p>Great to see you everybody this morning.</p><p>MIKE HUCKABEE, FORMER ARKANSAS GOVERNOR:  Good to be with you, Maria.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good morning.  </p><p>HUCKABEE:  Thanks.</p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Looking forward to your Harvey Pitt  interview, makes sense of this Elon Musk tweets.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What do you think?  What are the most important questions here?  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Well, it's funny.  You think about these public statements being  so careful and then he fires off what looked like very casual comments but  I -- but I think it is a question.  What does he need to show secure  funding?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>FREEMAN:  And does this mean he's now obligated to bid for $120 now that  he's teased it on Twitter.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And where is he going to get that money?  I mean, who has  that money to acquire and take the company private? </p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  Should be -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's $75 billion.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  </p><p>KRISTINA PARTSINEVELOS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  What about -- </p><p>FREEMAN:  And Harvey is the guy to answer these questions. </p><p>PARTSINEVELOS:  Institutional investors.  So (INAUDIBLE) fact that their  share stake is five percent, one of the largest after Elon Musk when you  talk about insiding -- insiders and then you have five massive  institutional accounts like T. Rowe, these guys have big part.  So it's  either going to be existing shareholders, institutional investors or some  really rich guys from Silicon Valley.  </p><p>HUCKABEE:  Won't be me, let me just -- </p><p>PARTSINEVELOS:  Or sovereign wealth fund. </p><p>HUCKABEE:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  We'll see.  We know that the shorts certainly took a hit  on that which is what he was intending.  Our top story, Musk is under the  microscope this morning.  The Wall Street Journal is reporting that  Securities and Exchange Commission is in fact probing Elon Musk's tweet to  find out if it was truthful.  This after the Tesla CEO tweeted two o days  ago this and considering taking Tesla private at $420 a share.</p><p>Funding secured and with that, the stock rallied.  Joining me right now is  former SEC Chairman Harvey Pitt.  Great to see you, Harvey.  Thanks so much  for joining us.  </p><p>HARVEY PITT, CHAIRMAN, SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION:  Good to be with  you, Maria.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What do you think as a former chairman of the Securities and  Exchange Commission.  What is the SEC looking at?  Tell us where you see  potential wrongdoing here.</p><p>PITT:  Well, the entire announcement was highly problematic, and  unprecedented and it's important to realize it's not the medium but it's  the message.  Going private transactions are usually announced in advance  of the market opening or after the market closing.  They're not announced  in the middle day.  Mr. Musk tweeted in the middle of the day.  In addition  it's not the CEO who announces this, but it is the board.</p><p>It's the company that makes this announcement.  But here it was the CEO.   What's more important is he stressed that he already had funding to pay  $420 a share.  But no efforts have yet been done to find out whether it's  in the shareholders best interest to take the company private, and, if so,  at what price, so all of this raises two fundamental questions.  First, was  he trying to artificially influence the price of the stock?</p><p>If he was that would be manipulation.  Second, does he really have the  money in hand? And is it binding commitment that would give him almost $70  billion in what would be at the largest going private transaction in U.S.  history?  That would be fraud if those things were not true.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.  the SEC then needs to better understand what he was  referring to when he said $420 and funding secured.  Where would that money  come from? </p><p>PITT:  Well, it could come from either a consortium of banks, it could come  from foreign sovereign investor.  I mean -- the company did receive the big  cash infusion from Saudi Arabia the day that earnings were announced this  past week.  So it's possible that that kind of money might exist.  It's a  large amount and it would take a great deal of effort to put it together.   But it's not impossible.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Having said that, it's un-- it's unwise to be tweeting about  this in middle of the day creating activity in the stock.  Do you think the  SEC is also looking at that given the fact that on the Saudi Arabia  investment news, the stock gets rallied right before this announcement.  It   was up seven percent going into tweet and then up 11 percent after the  tweet.  </p><p>PITT:  It's definitely the wrong way to do this kind of thing.  It may not  be per se illegal, but it is definitely highly problematic and it could be  illegal depending on what his intentions were when he made the  announcement.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So is there a deadline here, Harvey, in terms of when he would  have to reveal his source of funding?  I mean, if he says funding secured  does the SEC want an answer now in terms of whether or not it's secured and  how long does he have to come up with whatever deal he was referring to? </p><p>PITT:  No.  I think he is required to demonstrate that at the time of his  tweet he already had a legally binding commitment for $420 a share.  That  would be the requirement, so the SEC can request or subpoena documents  asking for proof as to what his financing was and what the legal basis was  for his suggestion that it was secured which is a very strong term.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Very strong term.  What's the penalty, Harvey, if Musk was just  -- I don't want to say lying but coming up with an idea that perhaps wasn't  necessarily intact funding secured, what's the penalty?  </p><p>PITT:  Well, we don't of course know if the facts are yet but the penalties  are quite serious.  If he committed fraud or manipulated the market, he  would be liable both civilly for an extreme amount of damages but also he  could have potential criminal liability as well.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Why criminal? </p><p>PITT:  Because almost every violation of the Federal securities laws is  both a civil problem that the SEC pursues and also a potential criminal  issue that the Department of Justice pursues.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I see.  And so when do you expect we'll hear more about this?   I mean, for example, when are we going to better -- have a clearer idea  whether or not there was in fact funding in place?</p><p>PITT:  I would believe that the next set of announcements will come at some  point from Tesla itself.  The company will probably organize a special  committee of independent directors who will then indicate exactly where  matters stand and whether they are going to pursue Musk's suggest that the  company go private.  I don't think we will hear from the SEC until it has  completed its investigation.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What about shareholder lawsuits, Harvey, are you expecting that  to also be an issue here?  Because I know that the short sellers loss at  lot of money on that as the stock went up and that's basically what I  assumed Elon Musk wanted to do because he's been sticking it to shorts and  he's, you know, uncomfortable with some of the criticism that the company  has received.</p><p>You saw a very upsetting conference call recently where he pushed back on  some of the criticism and the short sellers questioning about his burn  rate, how much cash is he burning?  So, are you expecting shareholder  lawsuits?  </p><p>PITT:  I think they are inevitable.  It's just a matter of time before  lawsuits are filed because of the enormous fluctuation in the price of the  stock.  I would think the shorts will bring a lawsuit against Mr. Musk and  Tesla.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is there any precedence here, Harvey?  Have you ever seen  something like this before?  </p><p>PITT:  I've never seen anything like this kind of announcement.  I have  seen short sellers, sue certainly companies and I have certainly seen  companies sue short sellers.  It's a fact of life that if you're public,  you're going to get criticism and the shorts are people you just have to  live with. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  And, obviously, that's what they are doing.  They're  critical of the company.  They're shorting the stock.  I mean, that's why  they exist.  So you're expecting the SEC to be asking questions about the  funding.  Any other questions coming from the SEC in your view?</p><p>PITT:  Well, I think they will look into why the board didn't make an  announcement sooner, why they waited for Mr. Musk to go for -- forward, and  I think they will also try to determine what kinds of behind-the-scenes  activities were taken by the company.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So in other words, background because the board is saying yes,  Harvey Pitt, the board is saying yes, that Elon Musk has discussed the  potential of going private with us before.  But there is no mention of any  $420 price.  </p><p>PITT:  No.  And where that price comes from is very hard to understand.  It  may be a very good price, but in terms of an economic analysis it may turn  out that it's not as good a price as should be paid for this company.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, exactly.  I mean, when you're talking about $420 a share,  that's like $70 billion, right?  $75 billion? </p><p>PITT:  Yes.  And unprecedented amount of money, it truly is.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We will leave it there.  Harvey, it's great to see  you again.  Hope you'll come back soon.  Thanks so much for your insights  this morning.  </p><p>PITT:  Sure.  Thank you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Harvey Pitt joining us there.  And we'll take a short break.   When we come back.  The Tribune Media-Sinclair deal is dead.  Tribune says  that the $3.9 deal can no longer move forward after comments from SEC  Chairman Ajit Pai.  The latest coming up there.  Then half dress, half  bikini?  The new dress causing confusion online.  That's coming up.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Tribute Media called off its buyout by Sinclair  Broadcast Group.  Cheryl Casone with the details.  Two deals that are dead  today, Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  We got two deals, that is  right, Maria.  First to Tribune, they've terminated their $3.9-billion deal  and they're suing Sinclair for breach of contract for not doing enough to  win approval from regulators.  You may remember last month, SEC Chairman  Ajit Pai said he had serious concerns about the merger.  Take a look at the  stocks, shares of Sinclair right now, they are lower in the premarket  trading.</p><p>Down more than three percent.  Tribune Media, not really trading it but  shares down more than 20 percent so far this year.  So two stocks to watch  now.  We're also watching shares of Rite-Aid right now.  The stock plunging  more than 10 percent in the premarket.  The sell-off coming after Rite-Aid  and Albertsons called off their $24 billion merger.  Some big Rite-Aid  shareholders plan to vote against the deal today.</p><p>Rite-Aid and Albertsons wanted to team up in order to compete better  against CBS, Walgreens and potentially as you know Amazon has been trying  to get into the pharmaceutical business as well. </p><p>All right.  Check this out.  A volcanic eruption in Chile gets a rider on a  ski list, the front row seat to the action all on tape.  The eruption shot  up a 5,000 foot column of dust and ash as he was filming all of this with  his cell phone.  This comes from a volcano complex that's in the Andes  Mountain but pretty incredible pictures and pretty close.  </p><p>And finally there is this.  We've seen some pretty weird fashion trends in  the last year, upside down shorts, plastic jeans.  Well, here is a new one.   This is a bikini and it's a dress, all in one.  This comes from the fashion  brand, PrettyLittleThing.  And after having one of their models wear it on  Instagram picture, people started to freak out.</p><p>There it is.  We'll let you decide.  Looks like she couldn't decide on what  to wear so she cut both in half and sewed them together.  Maybe.  Here's  another comment.  She's going to dinner, clubbing and swimming all at once.   Yes.  The whole thing goes for $35.00 maybe.  Maria, you could wear it with  some crack heels?  You know.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>CASONE:  That would be an interesting pairing.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Sure would.  So is it a -- is it a dress or is it a bikini?</p><p>CASONE:  It's both.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's both.</p><p>CASONE:  Yes.  Because --</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS:  Why not have both?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're getting your money for it.  </p><p>PARTSINEVELOS:  Remember the black or blue dress or is it blue or white  dress? </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS:  Same thing.  But I know about you.  I think, Governor, it  would look better own you with man-bun, crack heels.  </p><p>HUCKABEE:  Pretty sure it wouldn't.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Going to be strong with the man-bun.  Yes.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Yes.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You got to really loving this man-bun.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  -- I would feel naked.  Oh.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  If I wear that without the man-bun I would just feel just naked.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  You thought of either of us wearing that is something that there  are television sets across America that are going to be off mode.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  No.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We don't want that.  We don't want that.  Coming up.  Viacom is  reporting quarterly earnings this morning.  We're breaking down those  numbers coming up next.  Big week for media.  Then overhauling the Oscars.   Details on new changes coming to the academy awards quarterly including the  addition of a popular film category, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Both parent company of the Fox Business Network, 21st Century  Fox quarterly profit nearly doubled due to cable and film strength.  Nicole  Petallides on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange watching the stock  and the overall market this morning.  Nic, good morning to you.</p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Good morning, Maria.  So  we talked about 21st Century Fox, our parent and it beat on top and bottom  line.  The analyst have to optimism there as you noted in those particular  areas and that's exactly what came.  In fact it did better than expected.   Deadpool 2, the strength of Fox News just among the reasons why we did see  it beat the 18 percent year over year.</p><p>Revenue increase, strong double-digit growth across all the segments and  the new and obviously what happened, the transaction, Disney and the new  Fox transactions, that -- they say unlocked enormous shareholder value.  In  fact when you take a look at the stock over the fiscal year it's about 75  percent gain, that clearly outpaces the S&amp;P 500.  And the media group which  actually has declined over that period.</p><p>Of course, there's still locked in the -- in the bidding war with CMSCA and  that would be Comcast, but -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  You check that?</p><p>PETALLIDES:  We'll watch that.  So that is the big difference.  Also, last  but not least, we're taking a look at Viacom this morning and that came in  profit top revenue fell and there was the slump in ad sales which fell  short.  And that number which I did talk about the increased shareholder  value I did get from the 21st Century Fox headlines themselves.  Back to  you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Nic.  Thank you so much.  Nicole, we'll be watching  all of that.  Switching gears to the censorship of conservatives on social  media.  It has the attention of lawmakers now including House Majority  Leader Kevin McCarthy who talked to us about this as well as House  Intelligence Chairman Devin Nunes who want - both want answers on action.   Listen to this.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA), HOUSE MAJORITY LEADER:  I want to see bias  stop, especially going after conservatives.  I mean, just look at three  points that showed up in Google right before the primary election in  California.  The party of Lincoln, the party of Reagan, that's not what it  said, it said Nazism.  </p><p>REP. DEVIN NUNES (R-CA), CHAIRMAN, SENATE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE:  I don't  know what Twitter is up to.  It sure looks to me like they're censoring  people and they ought -- they ought to stop it and we're looking at any  legal remedies that we can go through.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  So that was Devin Nunes and Kevin McCarthy.  Kevin  McCarthy was talking about remember right before the primary elections in  California.  You Googled GOP California and in the search results got  Naziism.  Your thoughts, Governor.  I know this is an important topic to  you. </p><p>HUCKABEE:  Well, it really is an important topic.  We talk about Russian  interference.  I'm worried about social media interference.  How are they  manipulating elections, how are they manipulating the information and the  question comes as somebody who doesn't really like government regulation  and intervention, we're headed there.</p><p>We're going to get it because social media platforms are no longer just  social media where people chit-chat about their yoga classes and their  daughter's wedding, they're now the place where people get news, they are  public utilities just like electricity, water, cable television and  telephone.  And so government is going to step in at some point.  I think  sooner than later and they're going to regulate them.</p><p>The social media companies will rue the day when they started favoring one  point of view over another.  But here's why that matters.  Would Americans  tolerate it if you paid differently for your electricity, your water or  your telephone based on your political view of where you went to church?   You would be outraged.  Liberal conservative or independent, you'd be  outraged.  That's what we're seeing today.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And there's also so-called, shadowed banning, James, I mean --</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You know, I mean, I had put out a tweet about James Clapper  basically admitting on CNN that President Obama directed the Intelligence  Agencies to launch investigation for the special counsel on the Trump- Russia and I -- and I -- and basically Jim Clapper -- James Clapper  admitted it on CNN.  So I tweeted that out, it got no life, no -- and I  thought, you know, this is something that I know my followers care about.</p><p>And I felt to myself, hmm, is that shadow banning?  I don't know.  I wonder  if my followers saw that tweet or if it just went on deaf ears.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Well, we've had a bunch of these teases where certainly  conservative viewpoints seem to be suppressed.  The answers from Silicon  Valley generally are often not denials but sort of saying, well, it wasn't  intentional, it's the algorithm.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But somebody programs the algorithm change.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  So, I agree.  I think there's enough ear to say there is a  problem of bias.  It's -- I think it -- I'm hoping first there's a consumer  remedy, we've seen user growth surprisingly kind of flattened --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're right.</p><p>FREEMAN:  In these recent earnings reports but I'm hoping it can be  disciplined either through customer behavior or maybe it has to be private  litigation as opposed to creating a new Federal internet regulator and I  think that's the big danger here is that the big tech giants are trying to  cut a deal with both parties in Washington that gives them liability  protection but it also sets up the Federal Trade Commission to have huge  powers over the internet.</p><p>And this could -- this is actually a deal that could happen, very quickly,  I think, and that is the anger I see for innovation because the utility  model you don't get a lot of innovation out of the phone company, the water  company, et cetera.  So I'm hoping there is a market remedy for this and  maybe consumers, you know, are starting to say I want -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>HUCKABEE:  I mean, I wish there was a market remedy, I would much rather  see it.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  But these companies are --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Some competition.  </p><p>HUCKABEE:  -- hearing the bells.  I mean, they're bringing it upon  themselves because they are actively suppressing the points of view of  certain people and when they do that, the market is going to rise up and I  think -- </p><p>PARTSINEVELOS:  What about Alex Jones and certain hate groups, they're  censoring certain things that are clearly fake, if you want to say it, fake  news and he is discounting Sandy Hook and the children and families there.   So when he's -- when somebody is putting out inaccurate facts that have  been proven to be wrong then why not get rid of him?  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Well, that's a fun --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS:  Well, this is why we're talking about it.</p><p>FREEMAN:  -- user organization.  But of course, these social media  companies have enjoyed a lot of legal protection on the basis that they are  not news organizations, that it's an open platform anyone in public.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's a good point.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Now that they're making those kind of judgments, they better be  ready for different treatment --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HUCKABEE:  And the first amendment protects stupidity, it protects outrages  speech.  I don't like it but it does protect it.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Let's take a quick break.  We got the PPI on the  other side of this break.  Stay with us.  Producer Price Index, we'll take  a look at inflation.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good Thursday morning.  Welcome back, everybody, thanks so much  for joining us this morning.  I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Thursday,  August 9th.  Your top stories right now 8:30 a.m. on the east coast.  We  are just getting the Producer Price Index out.  It is unchanged.  A gain of  three-tenths of a percent was expected, and that's what it looks like this  morning, unchanged on the Producer Price Index.  Not a major reaction from  markets this morning.  We've been looking at a fractional move all morning.   Dow Industrials right now up 20 points, S&amp;P 500 up three, and the NASDAQ up  4-1/2.  Initial jobless claims also out right now, down 6,000.  </p><p>Global markets action in Europe this morning, take a look at European  indices, obviously down across the board.  FT-100 down 50 points, that's  two-thirds of one percent.  The CAC Quarante is down a quarter of a  percent, 16 points lower, and the DAX Index in Germany is flat, down six  points.  In Asia Overnight, the standout was China.  Chinese markets  bouncing back on hopes to the stimulus against U.S. tariffs.  Shanghai  Composite up almost two percent.  And PPI is out, unchanged on the session  versus a two-tenths of a percent estimate, James Freeman.  Your thoughts on  where we are on inflation.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  Pretty benign environment right now, the economy is  humming, fast growth but inflation not yet raging even though the Feds  still has this huge balance sheet they acquired in the wake of the  financial crisis.  So, I think the hope here is that as we transition back  to the real economy, we can do it without an inflation surge.  And so far  so good.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And year-over-year, Kristina, on inflation on the PPI is 3.3  percent, very much in step with what we've been -- what we've been  expecting.</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS:  Right.  And if anything, maybe this can add to the argument  that wage growth hasn't been climbing higher.  So, now that inflation is  staying relatively flat, that's OK because of wage growth not climbing high  enough or lasted a while.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Wages have just been creeping up, the 2.8 percent higher  year-over-year on wages, we'll keep following that and any impact on  markets this morning.  We have breaking news right now out of North Korea.   North Korea says that if the Trump administration, \"adheres to all  scenarios,\" then there's no chance of progress on denuclearization.  Blake  Burman is live at the White House this morning with more on that.  Blake,  good morning to you.</p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT:  Hi there,  Maria, good morning to you as well.  This obviously raises more questions  about just how intent North Korea is on resolving the issue of  denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula.  The headline that is coming out this  morning is that the North Koreans say that if the Trump administration  adheres to old scenarios, it cannot expect any progress on  denuclearization, something that the White House certainly will watch  throughout the day.  And of course, the upcoming weeks and months as the  President right now is in Bedminster, New Jersey for a week off on what the  White House is characterizing as a working vacation.</p><p>Meantime, here in Washington later today, the Vice President Mike Pence  will lay out what the administration hopes to deploy in the upcoming years  that being a sixth branch of the military, the Space Force.  The President  said earlier this summer that he wanted the military to build out this new  branch of government.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Now, our destiny beyond the  Earth is not only a matter of national identity, but a matter of national  security.  When it comes to defending America, it is not enough to merely  have an American presence in space, we must have American dominance in  space.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BURMAN:  The Air Force already though has a robust presence patrolling  outer space especially as it relates to the use and deployment of  satellites.  That responsibility would go to the Space Force which would be  responsible for conducting war plans for space, but there are many  questions here, including how the military would be reshaped.  The defense  secretary James Mattis admitting earlier this week that they are still  trying to work out on how the actual organization would take place within  the military.  By the way, Maria, there is also the congressional issue on  this one as well because a sixth branch of the military would need  Congressional approval and, of course, Congressional funding.  We will hear  from the Vice President later today, Maria. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Blake, thank you so much.  Blake Burman with the  latest there.  Joining us right now is Fox News Legal Analyst and author of  the new book, \"The Russia Hoax: The Illicit Scheme to Clear Hillary Clinton  and Frame Donald Trump.\"  Gregg Jarrett is with us.  Gregg, great to see  you, thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>GREGG JARRETT, FOX NEWS LEGAL ANALYST:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Congrats on the book.  And as I read the title and as I report  on what has teken place in the 2016 election.  It seems exactly accurate in  terms of what happened.</p><p>JARRETT:  Thank you.  Well, you would know because you have done so much to  further the story yourself.  I wrote this book because actually I became  incensed in outraged, the top officials at the FBI and the Department of  Justice were abusing their positions of power to subvert the rule of law,  and undermine the democratic process, and I think I lay out a fairly  persuasive case here of the facts, the evidence, and the law, that this was  a cesspool of corruption.  And by the way, it still is, because they  continue to cover it up.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And the latest has a real focus on Bruce Ohr, the number three  guy at the DOJ, whose wife worked for Fusion GPS.</p><p>JARRETT:  I mean, talk about an incestuous collection of corrupt acts.  You  know, the FBI knew that Christopher Steele, who phonied up the anti-Trump  dossier, was already on the payroll of Hillary Clinton, he was on the  payroll of the FBI.  And when the FBI finally fired Christopher Steele,  their regulations say you can't have any more contact with him, so they  were very devious.  They used Bruce Ohr at the Department of Justice as the  conduit, the intermediary.  The FBI continued to receive Christopher Steele  information, spying on Trump after he was inaugurated for several months  thereafter.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  You know, what gets me, Governor, is, you know, it feels  like the left in their hatred of President Trump, so much they've thrown  out all ideals, they've thrown out values of, you know, the law of the  land, and it was OK to spy on Carter Page, oh, because it's Trump.  You  know, it's OK to abuse your power at the top of the FBI, oh, it's Trump.   It's incredible.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Well, it is incredible.  And Gregg, congratulations on the book.</p><p>JARRETT:  Thank you.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  It reads like a novel.  The frightening thing is that it's not  fiction, it's fact, and you lay out an incredibly compelling case in a  chronological order, which I think is a great value to the reader.  So,  it's a -- it's a powerful book.  We've seen the weaponization of the  agencies of our federal government going after a presidential candidate in  a fashion we've never seen before, the highest levels.  But when they are  using their own power in this way, to create a false dossier, on which the  warrant is obtained, legally, does that not put them with the fruit of the  poisonous tree, and so that whatever they end up would be able to be pushed  back because they got it illegally?</p><p>JARRETT:  Yes, absolutely, under the exclusionary rule, it would be  excluded as evidence.  The law enforcers became the lawbreakers.  And  what's outrageous is --</p><p>HUCKABEE:  That's powerful statement.</p><p>JARRETT:  Yes, they're not being investigated and prosecuted.  I lay out  myriad of potential crimes here, by people like Andrew McCabe, James Comey,  and you know, Peter Strzok, Lisa Page, and the list goes on and on, things  like abusive power which is a felony.  Obstruction of justice, they  obstructed their own investigation to clear Hillary Clinton.  And on the  same day they cleared her, Comey is standing in front of cameras, his FBI  is meeting secretly in London with Christopher Steele to begin the frame  job on President Trump, then-candidate Trump.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  And you say that this all started when then-FBI director  Jim Comey cleared Hillary Clinton in the e-mail server probe back in 2016.   Watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>JAMES COMEY, FORMER DIRECTOR, FBI:  Although, we did not find clear  evidence that Secretary Clinton or her colleagues intended to violate laws  governing the handling of classified information, there is evidence that  they were extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly- classified information.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, while they were putting together a narrative about Donald  Trump, they were very easy on Hillary Clinton.  And they basically did not  investigate.</p><p>JARRETT:  Absolutely.  And it was one deception, and I believe, lie after  another from James Comey as you saw there on that very day.  He had  originally written it, Hillary Clinton committed crimes.  He wrote it down  twice, gross negligence, but his staff said, well, you can't clear her if  you put that in your statement, so they sit down at Peter Strzok's computer  and they expunge from Comey's statements, those incriminating words and  other allegations of criminality by Hillary Clinton.  The swamp didn't want  to be drained.  And a potential President Trump jeopardized their ambitions  and positions of power, so they sought to damage his candidacy, and when  they didn't do that and he was elected, they sought to undo the election.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's incredible.  James?</p><p>FREEMAN:  And the -- when you talk about the swamp going after now- President Trump, but then-candidate Trump, do we have a sense yet of  exactly when this began?  There seems to have been I think a real challenge  for Congressional investigators figuring out when was the real beginning of  whether it was intelligence or law enforcement assets descending on the  Trump campaign?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And this is what Devin Nunes is investigating right now, what  happened before actual launch of the investigation, which, of course, was  July 2016?</p><p>JARRETT:  Some of the documents that Devin Nunes is trying to get his hands  on that Rod Rosenstein and Christopher Wray will not hand over the origins  of the Trump-Russia collusion investigation, it looks to me like, the FBI  began spying on the Trump campaign seven months before they formally signed  the papers launching the investigation.  And by the way, when they signed  those papers, they violated their own FBI guidelines, there was no probable  cause, no evidence of crimes, no plausible intelligence for  counterintelligence probe, they broke the law and the rules.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you think there'll be any accountability here?  </p><p>JARRETT:  Not with Jeff Sessions and Rod Rosenstein at the helm of the  Department of Justice.  And that's a sad commentary on our system of  justice right now.  But Sessions is utterly feckless and Rosenstein, I  think, is trying to continue to cover up his own wrongdoing.  This is a guy  who should have recused himself the moment he appointed Mueller.  You can't  be a prosecutor and a key witness all rolled into one.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Because he OK'd the fourth FISA warrant.</p><p>JARRETT:  That's right.  And you can only do that when you have new  evidence.  The best we can tell so far, they have no new evidence.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And there wasn't any evidence from the get-go, it was just the  dossier.</p><p>JARRETT:  That's right.  And the FBI knew that the dossier was totally  fabricated.  You can read it online, I've read it a hundred times.  I never  failed to laugh.  You know, it is the work of an amateur dime novelist in  junior high school.  And even Christopher Steele who wrote it, said, in  court papers under oath in Great Britain, which I dug up, and it's in the  book, that it's unverifiable because it was a guy who told a guy, who told  the guy, who told me.  Triple, quadruple hearsay based on anonymous  sources.  You can't use that sort of thing in a court of law.  Get the FBI  and DOJ, use it to gain a warrant to wiretap -- that's abuse of power to  fraud on the court.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, this is one political party spying on the -- on their  opponent, there on the left.</p><p>JARRETT:  Right.  And where's the outrage over Hillary Clinton paying for  all of this?  Now, that is a violation of the law.  The Trump Tower  meeting, perfect legal.  All the media has to do is read the federal  campaign election act.  Foreign nationals may participate in American  political campaigns and providing any information is not a thing of value.   But stonewalling to Congress is something I do not understand why it  continues.  They have a constitutional obligation to give Congress what it  wants.  And Congress should use the power of the purse and cut off the  money.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Into the oversight agency.</p><p>JARRETT:  That's the only way to have.  Yes.  Absolutely.  But I blame  Congress because for decades, whenever the Department of Justice and FBI  didn't want to hand over documents, they just said we're not going to do  it, and Congress never took action.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>JARRETT:  So, it's been habitual.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Well, the President could order all of this declassified.</p><p>JARRETT:  And he should.  I think he is considering it, but you know, there  are -- there are those advising him not to.  He should absolutely order  declassification of a FISA application documents, the Gang of Eight  documents and the origin documents.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The American people have a right to know and they want to know.   \"The Russia Hoax,\" is the book, \"The Illicit Scheme to Clear Hillary  Clinton and Frame Donald Trump.\"  Gregg Jarrett, thank you so much.</p><p>JARRETT:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Congrats on the book.  Great to see you.</p><p>JARRETT:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We have breaking news right now we want to get to, Russian  Foreign Ministry is saying this, Moscow will work on retaliatory measures  in response to the new U.S. sanctions against Russia, it's according to  Reuters this morning.  The U.S. imposed new sanctions tied to the nerve  agent poisoning of a former Russian spy and his daughter, that of course,  breaking this week.  We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Uber and Lyft hitting a roadblock in New York  City.  The city council voted to limit the number of vehicles on the  streets.  Joining us now, the host of \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY,\" Stuart Varney to  weigh in.  Stu, good morning to you.</p><p>STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Good morning, Maria.  You  know, I think there's a backlash coming to this thing.  As you say, the  Mayor of New york is imposing a cap on the number of Uber and Lyft cars  allowed in the city.  In my opinion, that leaves a lot of wait times and to  higher prices.  But there's something else going on here, yellow cabs have  often been accused (INAUDIBLE) regular taxicabs in New York City often  accused of not picking up people of color because of their color.  Uber has  a way out.  </p><p>Uber doesn't care what color you are, Uber doesn't care what your ethnicity  is, they pick you up, it's all electronic.  Well, that is going to be  capped at the -- basically at the doings of the willing of the taxi  industry.  I think there's a backlash coming here from the minorities.   Worse yet, I think there's going to be -- I think New York City will be  used as a template as a test case for other cities in America and around  the world, which want to fence in Uber, because they are devastating the  local taxi industry.  I think this is the wrong decision on so many levels,  and I hope it's withdrawn, I don't think it will be but it should be.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Meaning there's a lot of backlash because, you know, look what  happened to the taxis.  The prices of the medallion plummeted.</p><p>VARNEY:  Yes, the medallion was 2 -- was 1.3 million in 2013, and now it's  between 160 and 250,000.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  There you go.</p><p>VARNEY:  That's a huge loss of capital for the taxi owners and this is  their way of pushing back.  But I think the pushback is very detrimental to  many, many people.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll watch that.  Stu, I know you'll have more on  that in about 10 minutes.  We'll see you then top of the hour \"VARNEY &amp;  COMPANY\" begins at 9:00 a.m. Eastern, right after MORNINGS WITH MARIA.   Join Stuart in the next few minutes.  But first, overhauling the Oscars,  details on the new changes coming to the Academy Awards including the  addition of a popular film category, that's next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>GERRI WILLIS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  -- arts and sciences cutting  the link to the show and introducing a category for outstanding achievement  in popular film.  Critics have complained that the broadcast is too long,  too boring, too political, too condescending -- oh, maybe that's just my  view.</p><p>Audiences would appear to agree, giving me telecast, its lowest ratings on  record last February when a mere 26.5 million people tuned in.  Remember,  the Super Bowl got 107 million.  Academy CEO Dawn Hudson said the board is,  quote, committed to producing an entertaining show in three hours.  Wow.   Three -- it takes you three hours?  The move was met with a frenzy of  criticism, particularly from in the street journalists.  Atlantic reporter  David Sims called the (INAUDIBLE) award, the Black Panther memorial award  for movie that were afraid won't get a big picture -- best picture  nominations.  Other called it lazy, ham-handed.  In recent years, hit films  like \"Wonder Woman\" have been snubbed by Oscar, although blockbusters from  the past like \"Gone With the Wind\" were heavily recognized.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, good changes?</p><p>WILLIS:  Not the right changes necessary (INAUDIBLE) always a good idea.   Can we do this in like 30 minutes or something?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Three hours.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  You can get a kidney replacement in less time and it's not as  painful as watching the Oscars.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Your thoughts on the changes.</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS:  People like -- I remember when I was a kid, I used to love  watching it because you'd never know who would win and you'd sit around  together, and then the outfits, so I don't think that they're really going  to shorten it that much, but they have lost viewership, for sure, because  there's --</p><p>WILLIS:  It's brutal.  I always (INAUDIBLE) 4 million people every single  night, OK?  I mean, think about it.</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS:  But also the performance.  The performances and the actors  and the comedians in between sets, those are -- that's pretty decent stuff,  and sometimes there's controversy that comes out of it, so that's what I  would watch for.  I don't watch it, but --</p><p>WILLIS:  I thought you'd see the fashion and would be happy.  That's all I  really need.</p><p>FREEMAN:  I think beyond the suffocating politics, they just -- you have  too many movies that almost no one in the television audience has seen so I  understand what they're trying to do here.  Maybe they ought to just  recognize some of these films that a lot of Americans think were the best  pictures: \"American Sniper\" -- I mean, most people would say that's a great  movie, right?</p><p>WILLIS:  Right.  Well, this popcorn award, that's what they're trying to  do.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The popular film.</p><p>WILLIS:  Yes, popular film.  But you know, that's sort of like a ghetto for  popular -- you know, like, though, it should really win the major  categories.  You know what I mean?  It should be elevated to the level of  \"Gone With the Wind,\" lots of very popular movies in previous years won  those awards, not anymore.</p><p>FREEMAN:  People don't watch the Oscars, though, because they want a  political lecture that insults half of America.  They want to -- they want  to escape from all of that and have entertainment.  When the celebrities go  up there and lecture us and preach to us and point their fingers --</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS:  They don't do that all the time during Oscars.  I'm going  to fight back against that.  If you watch the full show --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's become much more political.</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS:  -- not all politics.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But it has become much more political.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  It doesn't have to be all politics, but when all the politics  they have is negative toward half the population, what happens?  People say  I'll watch paint dry before I'll sit here and watch this.</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS:  There's always going to be something that's going to offend  somebody out there, and usually, politics makes for good comedy.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  But their ratings are tanking.  It's not working.  Maybe they  should listen to us.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Gerri, good stuff.</p><p>WILLIS:  I'm staying 30 minutes.  I think I'm going to --</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Coming up, final thoughts from this all-star panel.  Stay with  us.  We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Final thoughts from our all-star panel right  now.  Governor Huckabee?</p><p>HUCKABEE:  I want to say thanks to James Freeman for writing a book called  \"Borrowed Time,\" and giving really powerful insight into the financial  crisis, I think it's a very, very important book, people need to read it,  and I hope they will.  James, I want it to be a bestseller.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Thanks, Governor.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  \" Borrowed Time: Two Centuries of Booms, Busts, and Bailouts at  Citi.\"  Check out the book.  Congratulations.</p><p>FREEMAN:  I just want to say that the Governor is very handsome and very  charming man.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>FREEMAN:  And a model American citizen.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Kristina?</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS:  Well, I'm not going to -- I'm going to take a serious route  just because we haven't been able to --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Hey, this is serious.</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  This is serious stuff right here.</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS:  You bring a wonderful book and you're a gorgeous man.</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>PARTSINEVELOS:  Now, the timing just seems so awkward.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Tell us.  This is an important story, too.</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS:  This is an important story, but you guys are great.  Saudi  Arabia and Canada, the relations going on between both those countries,  Canada foreign affairs minister tweeting about the human rights -- two  human rights activists in Saudi.  Saudi is saying, you can't tell us  anything and what to do.  So, I think that's just a big story, a big story.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll follow that.  Kristina Partsinevelos, James  Freeman, Mike Huckabee, great to see, everybody.  Thank you so much.  Great  show, everybody.  We'll see you again tomorrow.  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" is now.   Stuart, take it away.</p><p>VARNEY:  Hey, good morning, Maria.  And good morning, everyone.  August  9th, yes, mid-summer, dog days of summer, summer doldrums, not if --</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

Good Thursday  morning.  Thanks for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Thursday,  August 9th.  Your top stories right now 8:00 a.m. on the East Coast.  Show  me the money, that's the call to Tesla from Wall Street and Washington.   The Securities and Exchange Commission reportedly launching a probe into  Elon Musk's tweet about going private.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">My interview with former SEC Chairman Harvey Pitt is coming up this morning  to talk about that.  Escalating trade tensions weighing on global  investors.  Futures edging higher this morning, Dow Industrials up 20  points.  S&amp;P 500 and the NASDAQ up just fractionally three points higher.   This after a mixed performance yesterday on Wall Street, the NASDAQ was the  gain top performer with the gain of four points on the session.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Dow Industrials down 45 at the close yesterday.  In Europe this  morning, markets are mixed.  Take a look at the European indices and we are  looking at some pressure on stocks this morning, in Europe, as well.  FT- 100 down 50 points, three quarters of one percent.  The CAC quarante down a  quarter of a percent, 15 points lower.  And the DAX Index in Germany down  18 points.</p><p>In Asia overnight, stocks finished mostly higher, the standout was China,  Shanghai Composite up about two percent.  A pair of merger deals dead.   First up, Sinclair's takeover of Tribune has been called off this morning  following recent comments from SEC Chairman Ajit Pai.  Plus, the Rite-Aid  and Albertson's deal also terminated.  The company say investor pushback is  to blame, that deal also off for now.</p><p>The media sector in focus.  We are watching earnings from Viacom and 21st  Century Fox.  We are breaking down the numbers there.  And as you can see  both stocks are higher this morning. A front row seat to a natural  disaster.  Check out this unbelievable video taken on chairlift of a  volcano erupting.  And as you can see it, it's pretty extraordinary.  Plus,  this outfit is going viral this morning.</p><p>But Instagram user cannot figure out if it's a dress or is it a bikini.  We  report you decide.  Let us know what you think.  You send us tweet on that.   All stories coming up this Thursday morning and joining me to break it all  down, Fox Business Network Kristina Partsinevelos is with us, the Wall  Street Journal's assistant editorial page editor, James Freeman is here and  former Arkansas governor, Republican presidential candidate, Mike Huckabee. </p><p>Great to see you everybody this morning.</p><p>MIKE HUCKABEE, FORMER ARKANSAS GOVERNOR:  Good to be with you, Maria.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good morning.  </p><p>HUCKABEE:  Thanks.</p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Looking forward to your Harvey Pitt  interview, makes sense of this Elon Musk tweets.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What do you think?  What are the most important questions here?  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Well, it's funny.  You think about these public statements being  so careful and then he fires off what looked like very casual comments but  I -- but I think it is a question.  What does he need to show secure  funding?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>FREEMAN:  And does this mean he's now obligated to bid for $120 now that  he's teased it on Twitter.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And where is he going to get that money?  I mean, who has  that money to acquire and take the company private? </p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  Should be -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's $75 billion.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  </p><p>KRISTINA PARTSINEVELOS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  What about -- </p><p>FREEMAN:  And Harvey is the guy to answer these questions. </p><p>PARTSINEVELOS:  Institutional investors.  So (INAUDIBLE) fact that their  share stake is five percent, one of the largest after Elon Musk when you  talk about insiding -- insiders and then you have five massive  institutional accounts like T. Rowe, these guys have big part.  So it's  either going to be existing shareholders, institutional investors or some  really rich guys from Silicon Valley.  </p><p>HUCKABEE:  Won't be me, let me just -- </p><p>PARTSINEVELOS:  Or sovereign wealth fund. </p><p>HUCKABEE:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  We'll see.  We know that the shorts certainly took a hit  on that which is what he was intending.  Our top story, Musk is under the  microscope this morning.  The Wall Street Journal is reporting that  Securities and Exchange Commission is in fact probing Elon Musk's tweet to  find out if it was truthful.  This after the Tesla CEO tweeted two o days  ago this and considering taking Tesla private at $420 a share.</p><p>Funding secured and with that, the stock rallied.  Joining me right now is  former SEC Chairman Harvey Pitt.  Great to see you, Harvey.  Thanks so much  for joining us.  </p><p>HARVEY PITT, CHAIRMAN, SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION:  Good to be with  you, Maria.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What do you think as a former chairman of the Securities and  Exchange Commission.  What is the SEC looking at?  Tell us where you see  potential wrongdoing here.</p><p>PITT:  Well, the entire announcement was highly problematic, and  unprecedented and it's important to realize it's not the medium but it's  the message.  Going private transactions are usually announced in advance  of the market opening or after the market closing.  They're not announced  in the middle day.  Mr. Musk tweeted in the middle of the day.  In addition  it's not the CEO who announces this, but it is the board.</p><p>It's the company that makes this announcement.  But here it was the CEO.   What's more important is he stressed that he already had funding to pay  $420 a share.  But no efforts have yet been done to find out whether it's  in the shareholders best interest to take the company private, and, if so,  at what price, so all of this raises two fundamental questions.  First, was  he trying to artificially influence the price of the stock?</p><p>If he was that would be manipulation.  Second, does he really have the  money in hand? And is it binding commitment that would give him almost $70  billion in what would be at the largest going private transaction in U.S.  history?  That would be fraud if those things were not true.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.  the SEC then needs to better understand what he was  referring to when he said $420 and funding secured.  Where would that money  come from? </p><p>PITT:  Well, it could come from either a consortium of banks, it could come  from foreign sovereign investor.  I mean -- the company did receive the big  cash infusion from Saudi Arabia the day that earnings were announced this  past week.  So it's possible that that kind of money might exist.  It's a  large amount and it would take a great deal of effort to put it together.   But it's not impossible.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Having said that, it's un-- it's unwise to be tweeting about  this in middle of the day creating activity in the stock.  Do you think the  SEC is also looking at that given the fact that on the Saudi Arabia  investment news, the stock gets rallied right before this announcement.  It   was up seven percent going into tweet and then up 11 percent after the  tweet.  </p><p>PITT:  It's definitely the wrong way to do this kind of thing.  It may not  be per se illegal, but it is definitely highly problematic and it could be  illegal depending on what his intentions were when he made the  announcement.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So is there a deadline here, Harvey, in terms of when he would  have to reveal his source of funding?  I mean, if he says funding secured  does the SEC want an answer now in terms of whether or not it's secured and  how long does he have to come up with whatever deal he was referring to? </p><p>PITT:  No.  I think he is required to demonstrate that at the time of his  tweet he already had a legally binding commitment for $420 a share.  That  would be the requirement, so the SEC can request or subpoena documents  asking for proof as to what his financing was and what the legal basis was  for his suggestion that it was secured which is a very strong term.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Very strong term.  What's the penalty, Harvey, if Musk was just  -- I don't want to say lying but coming up with an idea that perhaps wasn't  necessarily intact funding secured, what's the penalty?  </p><p>PITT:  Well, we don't of course know if the facts are yet but the penalties  are quite serious.  If he committed fraud or manipulated the market, he  would be liable both civilly for an extreme amount of damages but also he  could have potential criminal liability as well.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Why criminal? </p><p>PITT:  Because almost every violation of the Federal securities laws is  both a civil problem that the SEC pursues and also a potential criminal  issue that the Department of Justice pursues.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I see.  And so when do you expect we'll hear more about this?   I mean, for example, when are we going to better -- have a clearer idea  whether or not there was in fact funding in place?</p><p>PITT:  I would believe that the next set of announcements will come at some  point from Tesla itself.  The company will probably organize a special  committee of independent directors who will then indicate exactly where  matters stand and whether they are going to pursue Musk's suggest that the  company go private.  I don't think we will hear from the SEC until it has  completed its investigation.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What about shareholder lawsuits, Harvey, are you expecting that  to also be an issue here?  Because I know that the short sellers loss at  lot of money on that as the stock went up and that's basically what I  assumed Elon Musk wanted to do because he's been sticking it to shorts and  he's, you know, uncomfortable with some of the criticism that the company  has received.</p><p>You saw a very upsetting conference call recently where he pushed back on  some of the criticism and the short sellers questioning about his burn  rate, how much cash is he burning?  So, are you expecting shareholder  lawsuits?  </p><p>PITT:  I think they are inevitable.  It's just a matter of time before  lawsuits are filed because of the enormous fluctuation in the price of the  stock.  I would think the shorts will bring a lawsuit against Mr. Musk and  Tesla.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is there any precedence here, Harvey?  Have you ever seen  something like this before?  </p><p>PITT:  I've never seen anything like this kind of announcement.  I have  seen short sellers, sue certainly companies and I have certainly seen  companies sue short sellers.  It's a fact of life that if you're public,  you're going to get criticism and the shorts are people you just have to  live with. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  And, obviously, that's what they are doing.  They're  critical of the company.  They're shorting the stock.  I mean, that's why  they exist.  So you're expecting the SEC to be asking questions about the  funding.  Any other questions coming from the SEC in your view?</p><p>PITT:  Well, I think they will look into why the board didn't make an  announcement sooner, why they waited for Mr. Musk to go for -- forward, and  I think they will also try to determine what kinds of behind-the-scenes  activities were taken by the company.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So in other words, background because the board is saying yes,  Harvey Pitt, the board is saying yes, that Elon Musk has discussed the  potential of going private with us before.  But there is no mention of any  $420 price.  </p><p>PITT:  No.  And where that price comes from is very hard to understand.  It  may be a very good price, but in terms of an economic analysis it may turn  out that it's not as good a price as should be paid for this company.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, exactly.  I mean, when you're talking about $420 a share,  that's like $70 billion, right?  $75 billion? </p><p>PITT:  Yes.  And unprecedented amount of money, it truly is.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We will leave it there.  Harvey, it's great to see  you again.  Hope you'll come back soon.  Thanks so much for your insights  this morning.  </p><p>PITT:  Sure.  Thank you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Harvey Pitt joining us there.  And we'll take a short break.   When we come back.  The Tribune Media-Sinclair deal is dead.  Tribune says  that the $3.9 deal can no longer move forward after comments from SEC  Chairman Ajit Pai.  The latest coming up there.  Then half dress, half  bikini?  The new dress causing confusion online.  That's coming up.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Tribute Media called off its buyout by Sinclair  Broadcast Group.  Cheryl Casone with the details.  Two deals that are dead  today, Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  We got two deals, that is  right, Maria.  First to Tribune, they've terminated their $3.9-billion deal  and they're suing Sinclair for breach of contract for not doing enough to  win approval from regulators.  You may remember last month, SEC Chairman  Ajit Pai said he had serious concerns about the merger.  Take a look at the  stocks, shares of Sinclair right now, they are lower in the premarket  trading.</p><p>Down more than three percent.  Tribune Media, not really trading it but  shares down more than 20 percent so far this year.  So two stocks to watch  now.  We're also watching shares of Rite-Aid right now.  The stock plunging  more than 10 percent in the premarket.  The sell-off coming after Rite-Aid  and Albertsons called off their $24 billion merger.  Some big Rite-Aid  shareholders plan to vote against the deal today.</p><p>Rite-Aid and Albertsons wanted to team up in order to compete better  against CBS, Walgreens and potentially as you know Amazon has been trying  to get into the pharmaceutical business as well. </p><p>All right.  Check this out.  A volcanic eruption in Chile gets a rider on a  ski list, the front row seat to the action all on tape.  The eruption shot  up a 5,000 foot column of dust and ash as he was filming all of this with  his cell phone.  This comes from a volcano complex that's in the Andes  Mountain but pretty incredible pictures and pretty close.  </p><p>And finally there is this.  We've seen some pretty weird fashion trends in  the last year, upside down shorts, plastic jeans.  Well, here is a new one.   This is a bikini and it's a dress, all in one.  This comes from the fashion  brand, PrettyLittleThing.  And after having one of their models wear it on  Instagram picture, people started to freak out.</p><p>There it is.  We'll let you decide.  Looks like she couldn't decide on what  to wear so she cut both in half and sewed them together.  Maybe.  Here's  another comment.  She's going to dinner, clubbing and swimming all at once.   Yes.  The whole thing goes for $35.00 maybe.  Maria, you could wear it with  some crack heels?  You know.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>CASONE:  That would be an interesting pairing.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Sure would.  So is it a -- is it a dress or is it a bikini?</p><p>CASONE:  It's both.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's both.</p><p>CASONE:  Yes.  Because --</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS:  Why not have both?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're getting your money for it.  </p><p>PARTSINEVELOS:  Remember the black or blue dress or is it blue or white  dress? </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS:  Same thing.  But I know about you.  I think, Governor, it  would look better own you with man-bun, crack heels.  </p><p>HUCKABEE:  Pretty sure it wouldn't.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Going to be strong with the man-bun.  Yes.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Yes.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You got to really loving this man-bun.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  -- I would feel naked.  Oh.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  If I wear that without the man-bun I would just feel just naked.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  You thought of either of us wearing that is something that there  are television sets across America that are going to be off mode.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  No.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We don't want that.  We don't want that.  Coming up.  Viacom is  reporting quarterly earnings this morning.  We're breaking down those  numbers coming up next.  Big week for media.  Then overhauling the Oscars.   Details on new changes coming to the academy awards quarterly including the  addition of a popular film category, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Both parent company of the Fox Business Network, 21st Century  Fox quarterly profit nearly doubled due to cable and film strength.  Nicole  Petallides on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange watching the stock  and the overall market this morning.  Nic, good morning to you.</p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Good morning, Maria.  So  we talked about 21st Century Fox, our parent and it beat on top and bottom  line.  The analyst have to optimism there as you noted in those particular  areas and that's exactly what came.  In fact it did better than expected.   Deadpool 2, the strength of Fox News just among the reasons why we did see  it beat the 18 percent year over year.</p><p>Revenue increase, strong double-digit growth across all the segments and  the new and obviously what happened, the transaction, Disney and the new  Fox transactions, that -- they say unlocked enormous shareholder value.  In  fact when you take a look at the stock over the fiscal year it's about 75  percent gain, that clearly outpaces the S&amp;P 500.  And the media group which  actually has declined over that period.</p><p>Of course, there's still locked in the -- in the bidding war with CMSCA and  that would be Comcast, but -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  You check that?</p><p>PETALLIDES:  We'll watch that.  So that is the big difference.  Also, last  but not least, we're taking a look at Viacom this morning and that came in  profit top revenue fell and there was the slump in ad sales which fell  short.  And that number which I did talk about the increased shareholder  value I did get from the 21st Century Fox headlines themselves.  Back to  you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Nic.  Thank you so much.  Nicole, we'll be watching  all of that.  Switching gears to the censorship of conservatives on social  media.  It has the attention of lawmakers now including House Majority  Leader Kevin McCarthy who talked to us about this as well as House  Intelligence Chairman Devin Nunes who want - both want answers on action.   Listen to this.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA), HOUSE MAJORITY LEADER:  I want to see bias  stop, especially going after conservatives.  I mean, just look at three  points that showed up in Google right before the primary election in  California.  The party of Lincoln, the party of Reagan, that's not what it  said, it said Nazism.  </p><p>REP. DEVIN NUNES (R-CA), CHAIRMAN, SENATE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE:  I don't  know what Twitter is up to.  It sure looks to me like they're censoring  people and they ought -- they ought to stop it and we're looking at any  legal remedies that we can go through.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  So that was Devin Nunes and Kevin McCarthy.  Kevin  McCarthy was talking about remember right before the primary elections in  California.  You Googled GOP California and in the search results got  Naziism.  Your thoughts, Governor.  I know this is an important topic to  you. </p><p>HUCKABEE:  Well, it really is an important topic.  We talk about Russian  interference.  I'm worried about social media interference.  How are they  manipulating elections, how are they manipulating the information and the  question comes as somebody who doesn't really like government regulation  and intervention, we're headed there.</p><p>We're going to get it because social media platforms are no longer just  social media where people chit-chat about their yoga classes and their  daughter's wedding, they're now the place where people get news, they are  public utilities just like electricity, water, cable television and  telephone.  And so government is going to step in at some point.  I think  sooner than later and they're going to regulate them.</p><p>The social media companies will rue the day when they started favoring one  point of view over another.  But here's why that matters.  Would Americans  tolerate it if you paid differently for your electricity, your water or  your telephone based on your political view of where you went to church?   You would be outraged.  Liberal conservative or independent, you'd be  outraged.  That's what we're seeing today.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And there's also so-called, shadowed banning, James, I mean --</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You know, I mean, I had put out a tweet about James Clapper  basically admitting on CNN that President Obama directed the Intelligence  Agencies to launch investigation for the special counsel on the Trump- Russia and I -- and I -- and basically Jim Clapper -- James Clapper  admitted it on CNN.  So I tweeted that out, it got no life, no -- and I  thought, you know, this is something that I know my followers care about.</p><p>And I felt to myself, hmm, is that shadow banning?  I don't know.  I wonder  if my followers saw that tweet or if it just went on deaf ears.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Well, we've had a bunch of these teases where certainly  conservative viewpoints seem to be suppressed.  The answers from Silicon  Valley generally are often not denials but sort of saying, well, it wasn't  intentional, it's the algorithm.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But somebody programs the algorithm change.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  So, I agree.  I think there's enough ear to say there is a  problem of bias.  It's -- I think it -- I'm hoping first there's a consumer  remedy, we've seen user growth surprisingly kind of flattened --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're right.</p><p>FREEMAN:  In these recent earnings reports but I'm hoping it can be  disciplined either through customer behavior or maybe it has to be private  litigation as opposed to creating a new Federal internet regulator and I  think that's the big danger here is that the big tech giants are trying to  cut a deal with both parties in Washington that gives them liability  protection but it also sets up the Federal Trade Commission to have huge  powers over the internet.</p><p>And this could -- this is actually a deal that could happen, very quickly,  I think, and that is the anger I see for innovation because the utility  model you don't get a lot of innovation out of the phone company, the water  company, et cetera.  So I'm hoping there is a market remedy for this and  maybe consumers, you know, are starting to say I want -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>HUCKABEE:  I mean, I wish there was a market remedy, I would much rather  see it.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  But these companies are --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Some competition.  </p><p>HUCKABEE:  -- hearing the bells.  I mean, they're bringing it upon  themselves because they are actively suppressing the points of view of  certain people and when they do that, the market is going to rise up and I  think -- </p><p>PARTSINEVELOS:  What about Alex Jones and certain hate groups, they're  censoring certain things that are clearly fake, if you want to say it, fake  news and he is discounting Sandy Hook and the children and families there.   So when he's -- when somebody is putting out inaccurate facts that have  been proven to be wrong then why not get rid of him?  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Well, that's a fun --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS:  Well, this is why we're talking about it.</p><p>FREEMAN:  -- user organization.  But of course, these social media  companies have enjoyed a lot of legal protection on the basis that they are  not news organizations, that it's an open platform anyone in public.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's a good point.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Now that they're making those kind of judgments, they better be  ready for different treatment --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HUCKABEE:  And the first amendment protects stupidity, it protects outrages  speech.  I don't like it but it does protect it.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Let's take a quick break.  We got the PPI on the  other side of this break.  Stay with us.  Producer Price Index, we'll take  a look at inflation.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good Thursday morning.  Welcome back, everybody, thanks so much  for joining us this morning.  I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Thursday,  August 9th.  Your top stories right now 8:30 a.m. on the east coast.  We  are just getting the Producer Price Index out.  It is unchanged.  A gain of  three-tenths of a percent was expected, and that's what it looks like this  morning, unchanged on the Producer Price Index.  Not a major reaction from  markets this morning.  We've been looking at a fractional move all morning.   Dow Industrials right now up 20 points, S&amp;P 500 up three, and the NASDAQ up  4-1/2.  Initial jobless claims also out right now, down 6,000.  </p><p>Global markets action in Europe this morning, take a look at European  indices, obviously down across the board.  FT-100 down 50 points, that's  two-thirds of one percent.  The CAC Quarante is down a quarter of a  percent, 16 points lower, and the DAX Index in Germany is flat, down six  points.  In Asia Overnight, the standout was China.  Chinese markets  bouncing back on hopes to the stimulus against U.S. tariffs.  Shanghai  Composite up almost two percent.  And PPI is out, unchanged on the session  versus a two-tenths of a percent estimate, James Freeman.  Your thoughts on  where we are on inflation.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  Pretty benign environment right now, the economy is  humming, fast growth but inflation not yet raging even though the Feds  still has this huge balance sheet they acquired in the wake of the  financial crisis.  So, I think the hope here is that as we transition back  to the real economy, we can do it without an inflation surge.  And so far  so good.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And year-over-year, Kristina, on inflation on the PPI is 3.3  percent, very much in step with what we've been -- what we've been  expecting.</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS:  Right.  And if anything, maybe this can add to the argument  that wage growth hasn't been climbing higher.  So, now that inflation is  staying relatively flat, that's OK because of wage growth not climbing high  enough or lasted a while.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Wages have just been creeping up, the 2.8 percent higher  year-over-year on wages, we'll keep following that and any impact on  markets this morning.  We have breaking news right now out of North Korea.   North Korea says that if the Trump administration, \"adheres to all  scenarios,\" then there's no chance of progress on denuclearization.  Blake  Burman is live at the White House this morning with more on that.  Blake,  good morning to you.</p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT:  Hi there,  Maria, good morning to you as well.  This obviously raises more questions  about just how intent North Korea is on resolving the issue of  denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula.  The headline that is coming out this  morning is that the North Koreans say that if the Trump administration  adheres to old scenarios, it cannot expect any progress on  denuclearization, something that the White House certainly will watch  throughout the day.  And of course, the upcoming weeks and months as the  President right now is in Bedminster, New Jersey for a week off on what the  White House is characterizing as a working vacation.</p><p>Meantime, here in Washington later today, the Vice President Mike Pence  will lay out what the administration hopes to deploy in the upcoming years  that being a sixth branch of the military, the Space Force.  The President  said earlier this summer that he wanted the military to build out this new  branch of government.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Now, our destiny beyond the  Earth is not only a matter of national identity, but a matter of national  security.  When it comes to defending America, it is not enough to merely  have an American presence in space, we must have American dominance in  space.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BURMAN:  The Air Force already though has a robust presence patrolling  outer space especially as it relates to the use and deployment of  satellites.  That responsibility would go to the Space Force which would be  responsible for conducting war plans for space, but there are many  questions here, including how the military would be reshaped.  The defense  secretary James Mattis admitting earlier this week that they are still  trying to work out on how the actual organization would take place within  the military.  By the way, Maria, there is also the congressional issue on  this one as well because a sixth branch of the military would need  Congressional approval and, of course, Congressional funding.  We will hear  from the Vice President later today, Maria. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Blake, thank you so much.  Blake Burman with the  latest there.  Joining us right now is Fox News Legal Analyst and author of  the new book, \"The Russia Hoax: The Illicit Scheme to Clear Hillary Clinton  and Frame Donald Trump.\"  Gregg Jarrett is with us.  Gregg, great to see  you, thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>GREGG JARRETT, FOX NEWS LEGAL ANALYST:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Congrats on the book.  And as I read the title and as I report  on what has teken place in the 2016 election.  It seems exactly accurate in  terms of what happened.</p><p>JARRETT:  Thank you.  Well, you would know because you have done so much to  further the story yourself.  I wrote this book because actually I became  incensed in outraged, the top officials at the FBI and the Department of  Justice were abusing their positions of power to subvert the rule of law,  and undermine the democratic process, and I think I lay out a fairly  persuasive case here of the facts, the evidence, and the law, that this was  a cesspool of corruption.  And by the way, it still is, because they  continue to cover it up.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And the latest has a real focus on Bruce Ohr, the number three  guy at the DOJ, whose wife worked for Fusion GPS.</p><p>JARRETT:  I mean, talk about an incestuous collection of corrupt acts.  You  know, the FBI knew that Christopher Steele, who phonied up the anti-Trump  dossier, was already on the payroll of Hillary Clinton, he was on the  payroll of the FBI.  And when the FBI finally fired Christopher Steele,  their regulations say you can't have any more contact with him, so they  were very devious.  They used Bruce Ohr at the Department of Justice as the  conduit, the intermediary.  The FBI continued to receive Christopher Steele  information, spying on Trump after he was inaugurated for several months  thereafter.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  You know, what gets me, Governor, is, you know, it feels  like the left in their hatred of President Trump, so much they've thrown  out all ideals, they've thrown out values of, you know, the law of the  land, and it was OK to spy on Carter Page, oh, because it's Trump.  You  know, it's OK to abuse your power at the top of the FBI, oh, it's Trump.   It's incredible.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Well, it is incredible.  And Gregg, congratulations on the book.</p><p>JARRETT:  Thank you.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  It reads like a novel.  The frightening thing is that it's not  fiction, it's fact, and you lay out an incredibly compelling case in a  chronological order, which I think is a great value to the reader.  So,  it's a -- it's a powerful book.  We've seen the weaponization of the  agencies of our federal government going after a presidential candidate in  a fashion we've never seen before, the highest levels.  But when they are  using their own power in this way, to create a false dossier, on which the  warrant is obtained, legally, does that not put them with the fruit of the  poisonous tree, and so that whatever they end up would be able to be pushed  back because they got it illegally?</p><p>JARRETT:  Yes, absolutely, under the exclusionary rule, it would be  excluded as evidence.  The law enforcers became the lawbreakers.  And  what's outrageous is --</p><p>HUCKABEE:  That's powerful statement.</p><p>JARRETT:  Yes, they're not being investigated and prosecuted.  I lay out  myriad of potential crimes here, by people like Andrew McCabe, James Comey,  and you know, Peter Strzok, Lisa Page, and the list goes on and on, things  like abusive power which is a felony.  Obstruction of justice, they  obstructed their own investigation to clear Hillary Clinton.  And on the  same day they cleared her, Comey is standing in front of cameras, his FBI  is meeting secretly in London with Christopher Steele to begin the frame  job on President Trump, then-candidate Trump.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  And you say that this all started when then-FBI director  Jim Comey cleared Hillary Clinton in the e-mail server probe back in 2016.   Watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>JAMES COMEY, FORMER DIRECTOR, FBI:  Although, we did not find clear  evidence that Secretary Clinton or her colleagues intended to violate laws  governing the handling of classified information, there is evidence that  they were extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly- classified information.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, while they were putting together a narrative about Donald  Trump, they were very easy on Hillary Clinton.  And they basically did not  investigate.</p><p>JARRETT:  Absolutely.  And it was one deception, and I believe, lie after  another from James Comey as you saw there on that very day.  He had  originally written it, Hillary Clinton committed crimes.  He wrote it down  twice, gross negligence, but his staff said, well, you can't clear her if  you put that in your statement, so they sit down at Peter Strzok's computer  and they expunge from Comey's statements, those incriminating words and  other allegations of criminality by Hillary Clinton.  The swamp didn't want  to be drained.  And a potential President Trump jeopardized their ambitions  and positions of power, so they sought to damage his candidacy, and when  they didn't do that and he was elected, they sought to undo the election.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's incredible.  James?</p><p>FREEMAN:  And the -- when you talk about the swamp going after now- President Trump, but then-candidate Trump, do we have a sense yet of  exactly when this began?  There seems to have been I think a real challenge  for Congressional investigators figuring out when was the real beginning of  whether it was intelligence or law enforcement assets descending on the  Trump campaign?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And this is what Devin Nunes is investigating right now, what  happened before actual launch of the investigation, which, of course, was  July 2016?</p><p>JARRETT:  Some of the documents that Devin Nunes is trying to get his hands  on that Rod Rosenstein and Christopher Wray will not hand over the origins  of the Trump-Russia collusion investigation, it looks to me like, the FBI  began spying on the Trump campaign seven months before they formally signed  the papers launching the investigation.  And by the way, when they signed  those papers, they violated their own FBI guidelines, there was no probable  cause, no evidence of crimes, no plausible intelligence for  counterintelligence probe, they broke the law and the rules.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you think there'll be any accountability here?  </p><p>JARRETT:  Not with Jeff Sessions and Rod Rosenstein at the helm of the  Department of Justice.  And that's a sad commentary on our system of  justice right now.  But Sessions is utterly feckless and Rosenstein, I  think, is trying to continue to cover up his own wrongdoing.  This is a guy  who should have recused himself the moment he appointed Mueller.  You can't  be a prosecutor and a key witness all rolled into one.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Because he OK'd the fourth FISA warrant.</p><p>JARRETT:  That's right.  And you can only do that when you have new  evidence.  The best we can tell so far, they have no new evidence.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And there wasn't any evidence from the get-go, it was just the  dossier.</p><p>JARRETT:  That's right.  And the FBI knew that the dossier was totally  fabricated.  You can read it online, I've read it a hundred times.  I never  failed to laugh.  You know, it is the work of an amateur dime novelist in  junior high school.  And even Christopher Steele who wrote it, said, in  court papers under oath in Great Britain, which I dug up, and it's in the  book, that it's unverifiable because it was a guy who told a guy, who told  the guy, who told me.  Triple, quadruple hearsay based on anonymous  sources.  You can't use that sort of thing in a court of law.  Get the FBI  and DOJ, use it to gain a warrant to wiretap -- that's abuse of power to  fraud on the court.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, this is one political party spying on the -- on their  opponent, there on the left.</p><p>JARRETT:  Right.  And where's the outrage over Hillary Clinton paying for  all of this?  Now, that is a violation of the law.  The Trump Tower  meeting, perfect legal.  All the media has to do is read the federal  campaign election act.  Foreign nationals may participate in American  political campaigns and providing any information is not a thing of value.   But stonewalling to Congress is something I do not understand why it  continues.  They have a constitutional obligation to give Congress what it  wants.  And Congress should use the power of the purse and cut off the  money.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Into the oversight agency.</p><p>JARRETT:  That's the only way to have.  Yes.  Absolutely.  But I blame  Congress because for decades, whenever the Department of Justice and FBI  didn't want to hand over documents, they just said we're not going to do  it, and Congress never took action.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>JARRETT:  So, it's been habitual.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Well, the President could order all of this declassified.</p><p>JARRETT:  And he should.  I think he is considering it, but you know, there  are -- there are those advising him not to.  He should absolutely order  declassification of a FISA application documents, the Gang of Eight  documents and the origin documents.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The American people have a right to know and they want to know.   \"The Russia Hoax,\" is the book, \"The Illicit Scheme to Clear Hillary  Clinton and Frame Donald Trump.\"  Gregg Jarrett, thank you so much.</p><p>JARRETT:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Congrats on the book.  Great to see you.</p><p>JARRETT:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We have breaking news right now we want to get to, Russian  Foreign Ministry is saying this, Moscow will work on retaliatory measures  in response to the new U.S. sanctions against Russia, it's according to  Reuters this morning.  The U.S. imposed new sanctions tied to the nerve  agent poisoning of a former Russian spy and his daughter, that of course,  breaking this week.  We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Uber and Lyft hitting a roadblock in New York  City.  The city council voted to limit the number of vehicles on the  streets.  Joining us now, the host of \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY,\" Stuart Varney to  weigh in.  Stu, good morning to you.</p><p>STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Good morning, Maria.  You  know, I think there's a backlash coming to this thing.  As you say, the  Mayor of New york is imposing a cap on the number of Uber and Lyft cars  allowed in the city.  In my opinion, that leaves a lot of wait times and to  higher prices.  But there's something else going on here, yellow cabs have  often been accused (INAUDIBLE) regular taxicabs in New York City often  accused of not picking up people of color because of their color.  Uber has  a way out.  </p><p>Uber doesn't care what color you are, Uber doesn't care what your ethnicity  is, they pick you up, it's all electronic.  Well, that is going to be  capped at the -- basically at the doings of the willing of the taxi  industry.  I think there's a backlash coming here from the minorities.   Worse yet, I think there's going to be -- I think New York City will be  used as a template as a test case for other cities in America and around  the world, which want to fence in Uber, because they are devastating the  local taxi industry.  I think this is the wrong decision on so many levels,  and I hope it's withdrawn, I don't think it will be but it should be.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Meaning there's a lot of backlash because, you know, look what  happened to the taxis.  The prices of the medallion plummeted.</p><p>VARNEY:  Yes, the medallion was 2 -- was 1.3 million in 2013, and now it's  between 160 and 250,000.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  There you go.</p><p>VARNEY:  That's a huge loss of capital for the taxi owners and this is  their way of pushing back.  But I think the pushback is very detrimental to  many, many people.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll watch that.  Stu, I know you'll have more on  that in about 10 minutes.  We'll see you then top of the hour \"VARNEY &amp;  COMPANY\" begins at 9:00 a.m. Eastern, right after MORNINGS WITH MARIA.   Join Stuart in the next few minutes.  But first, overhauling the Oscars,  details on the new changes coming to the Academy Awards including the  addition of a popular film category, that's next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>GERRI WILLIS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  -- arts and sciences cutting  the link to the show and introducing a category for outstanding achievement  in popular film.  Critics have complained that the broadcast is too long,  too boring, too political, too condescending -- oh, maybe that's just my  view.</p><p>Audiences would appear to agree, giving me telecast, its lowest ratings on  record last February when a mere 26.5 million people tuned in.  Remember,  the Super Bowl got 107 million.  Academy CEO Dawn Hudson said the board is,  quote, committed to producing an entertaining show in three hours.  Wow.   Three -- it takes you three hours?  The move was met with a frenzy of  criticism, particularly from in the street journalists.  Atlantic reporter  David Sims called the (INAUDIBLE) award, the Black Panther memorial award  for movie that were afraid won't get a big picture -- best picture  nominations.  Other called it lazy, ham-handed.  In recent years, hit films  like \"Wonder Woman\" have been snubbed by Oscar, although blockbusters from  the past like \"Gone With the Wind\" were heavily recognized.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, good changes?</p><p>WILLIS:  Not the right changes necessary (INAUDIBLE) always a good idea.   Can we do this in like 30 minutes or something?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Three hours.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  You can get a kidney replacement in less time and it's not as  painful as watching the Oscars.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Your thoughts on the changes.</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS:  People like -- I remember when I was a kid, I used to love  watching it because you'd never know who would win and you'd sit around  together, and then the outfits, so I don't think that they're really going  to shorten it that much, but they have lost viewership, for sure, because  there's --</p><p>WILLIS:  It's brutal.  I always (INAUDIBLE) 4 million people every single  night, OK?  I mean, think about it.</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS:  But also the performance.  The performances and the actors  and the comedians in between sets, those are -- that's pretty decent stuff,  and sometimes there's controversy that comes out of it, so that's what I  would watch for.  I don't watch it, but --</p><p>WILLIS:  I thought you'd see the fashion and would be happy.  That's all I  really need.</p><p>FREEMAN:  I think beyond the suffocating politics, they just -- you have  too many movies that almost no one in the television audience has seen so I  understand what they're trying to do here.  Maybe they ought to just  recognize some of these films that a lot of Americans think were the best  pictures: \"American Sniper\" -- I mean, most people would say that's a great  movie, right?</p><p>WILLIS:  Right.  Well, this popcorn award, that's what they're trying to  do.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The popular film.</p><p>WILLIS:  Yes, popular film.  But you know, that's sort of like a ghetto for  popular -- you know, like, though, it should really win the major  categories.  You know what I mean?  It should be elevated to the level of  \"Gone With the Wind,\" lots of very popular movies in previous years won  those awards, not anymore.</p><p>FREEMAN:  People don't watch the Oscars, though, because they want a  political lecture that insults half of America.  They want to -- they want  to escape from all of that and have entertainment.  When the celebrities go  up there and lecture us and preach to us and point their fingers --</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS:  They don't do that all the time during Oscars.  I'm going  to fight back against that.  If you watch the full show --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's become much more political.</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS:  -- not all politics.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But it has become much more political.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  It doesn't have to be all politics, but when all the politics  they have is negative toward half the population, what happens?  People say  I'll watch paint dry before I'll sit here and watch this.</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS:  There's always going to be something that's going to offend  somebody out there, and usually, politics makes for good comedy.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  But their ratings are tanking.  It's not working.  Maybe they  should listen to us.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Gerri, good stuff.</p><p>WILLIS:  I'm staying 30 minutes.  I think I'm going to --</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Coming up, final thoughts from this all-star panel.  Stay with  us.  We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Final thoughts from our all-star panel right  now.  Governor Huckabee?</p><p>HUCKABEE:  I want to say thanks to James Freeman for writing a book called  \"Borrowed Time,\" and giving really powerful insight into the financial  crisis, I think it's a very, very important book, people need to read it,  and I hope they will.  James, I want it to be a bestseller.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Thanks, Governor.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  \" Borrowed Time: Two Centuries of Booms, Busts, and Bailouts at  Citi.\"  Check out the book.  Congratulations.</p><p>FREEMAN:  I just want to say that the Governor is very handsome and very  charming man.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>FREEMAN:  And a model American citizen.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Kristina?</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS:  Well, I'm not going to -- I'm going to take a serious route  just because we haven't been able to --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Hey, this is serious.</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  This is serious stuff right here.</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS:  You bring a wonderful book and you're a gorgeous man.</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>PARTSINEVELOS:  Now, the timing just seems so awkward.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Tell us.  This is an important story, too.</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS:  This is an important story, but you guys are great.  Saudi  Arabia and Canada, the relations going on between both those countries,  Canada foreign affairs minister tweeting about the human rights -- two  human rights activists in Saudi.  Saudi is saying, you can't tell us  anything and what to do.  So, I think that's just a big story, a big story.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll follow that.  Kristina Partsinevelos, James  Freeman, Mike Huckabee, great to see, everybody.  Thank you so much.  Great  show, everybody.  We'll see you again tomorrow.  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" is now.   Stuart, take it away.</p><p>VARNEY:  Hey, good morning, Maria.  And good morning, everyone.

Good Thursday  morning.  Thanks for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Thursday,  August 9th.  Your top stories right now 8:00 a.m. on the East Coast.  Show  me the money, that's the call to Tesla from Wall Street and Washington.   The Securities and Exchange Commission reportedly launching a probe into  Elon Musk's tweet about going private.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> My interview with former SEC Chairman Harvey Pitt is coming up this morning  to talk about that.  Escalating trade tensions weighing on global  investors.  Futures edging higher this morning, Dow Industrials up 20  points.  S&amp;P 500 and the NASDAQ up just fractionally three points higher.   This after a mixed performance yesterday on Wall Street, the NASDAQ was the  gain top performer with the gain of four points on the session.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> The Dow Industrials down 45 at the close yesterday.  In Europe this  morning, markets are mixed.  Take a look at the European indices and we are  looking at some pressure on stocks this morning, in Europe, as well.  FT- 100 down 50 points, three quarters of one percent.  The CAC quarante down a  quarter of a percent, 15 points lower.  And the DAX Index in Germany down  18 points.</p><p> In Asia overnight, stocks finished mostly higher, the standout was China,  Shanghai Composite up about two percent.  A pair of merger deals dead.   First up, Sinclair's takeover of Tribune has been called off this morning  following recent comments from SEC Chairman Ajit Pai.  Plus, the Rite-Aid  and Albertson's deal also terminated.  The company say investor pushback is  to blame, that deal also off for now.</p><p> The media sector in focus.  We are watching earnings from Viacom and 21st  Century Fox.  We are breaking down the numbers there.  And as you can see  both stocks are higher this morning. A front row seat to a natural  disaster.  Check out this unbelievable video taken on chairlift of a  volcano erupting.  And as you can see it, it's pretty extraordinary.  Plus,  this outfit is going viral this morning.</p><p> But Instagram user cannot figure out if it's a dress or is it a bikini.  We  report you decide.  Let us know what you think.  You send us tweet on that.   All stories coming up this Thursday morning and joining me to break it all  down, Fox Business Network Kristina Partsinevelos is with us, the Wall  Street Journal's assistant editorial page editor, James Freeman is here and  former Arkansas governor, Republican presidential candidate, Mike Huckabee. </p><p> Great to see you everybody this morning.</p><p> MIKE HUCKABEE, FORMER ARKANSAS GOVERNOR:  Good to be with you, Maria.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Good morning.  </p><p> HUCKABEE:  Thanks.</p><p> JAMES FREEMAN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Looking forward to your Harvey Pitt  interview, makes sense of this Elon Musk tweets.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  What do you think?  What are the most important questions here?  </p><p> FREEMAN:  Well, it's funny.  You think about these public statements being  so careful and then he fires off what looked like very casual comments but  I -- but I think it is a question.  What does he need to show secure  funding?</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p> FREEMAN:  And does this mean he's now obligated to bid for $120 now that  he's teased it on Twitter.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And where is he going to get that money?  I mean, who has  that money to acquire and take the company private? </p><p> FREEMAN:  Yes.  Should be -- </p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  It's $75 billion.  </p><p> FREEMAN:  Yes.  </p><p> KRISTINA PARTSINEVELOS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  What about -- </p><p> FREEMAN:  And Harvey is the guy to answer these questions. </p><p> PARTSINEVELOS:  Institutional investors.  So (INAUDIBLE) fact that their  share stake is five percent, one of the largest after Elon Musk when you  talk about insiding -- insiders and then you have five massive  institutional accounts like T. Rowe, these guys have big part.  So it's  either going to be existing shareholders, institutional investors or some  really rich guys from Silicon Valley.  </p><p> HUCKABEE:  Won't be me, let me just -- </p><p> PARTSINEVELOS:  Or sovereign wealth fund. </p><p> HUCKABEE:  Yes.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  We'll see.  We know that the shorts certainly took a hit  on that which is what he was intending.  Our top story, Musk is under the  microscope this morning.  The Wall Street Journal is reporting that  Securities and Exchange Commission is in fact probing Elon Musk's tweet to  find out if it was truthful.  This after the Tesla CEO tweeted two o days  ago this and considering taking Tesla private at $420 a share.</p><p> Funding secured and with that, the stock rallied.  Joining me right now is  former SEC Chairman Harvey Pitt.  Great to see you, Harvey.  Thanks so much  for joining us.  </p><p> HARVEY PITT, CHAIRMAN, SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION:  Good to be with  you, Maria.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  What do you think as a former chairman of the Securities and  Exchange Commission.  What is the SEC looking at?  Tell us where you see  potential wrongdoing here.</p><p> PITT:  Well, the entire announcement was highly problematic, and  unprecedented and it's important to realize it's not the medium but it's  the message.  Going private transactions are usually announced in advance  of the market opening or after the market closing.  They're not announced  in the middle day.  Mr. Musk tweeted in the middle of the day.  In addition  it's not the CEO who announces this, but it is the board.</p><p> It's the company that makes this announcement.  But here it was the CEO.   What's more important is he stressed that he already had funding to pay  $420 a share.  But no efforts have yet been done to find out whether it's  in the shareholders best interest to take the company private, and, if so,  at what price, so all of this raises two fundamental questions.  First, was  he trying to artificially influence the price of the stock?</p><p> If he was that would be manipulation.  Second, does he really have the  money in hand? And is it binding commitment that would give him almost $70  billion in what would be at the largest going private transaction in U.S.  history?  That would be fraud if those things were not true.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  OK.  the SEC then needs to better understand what he was  referring to when he said $420 and funding secured.  Where would that money  come from? </p><p> PITT:  Well, it could come from either a consortium of banks, it could come  from foreign sovereign investor.  I mean -- the company did receive the big  cash infusion from Saudi Arabia the day that earnings were announced this  past week.  So it's possible that that kind of money might exist.  It's a  large amount and it would take a great deal of effort to put it together.   But it's not impossible.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Having said that, it's un-- it's unwise to be tweeting about  this in middle of the day creating activity in the stock.  Do you think the  SEC is also looking at that given the fact that on the Saudi Arabia  investment news, the stock gets rallied right before this announcement.  It   was up seven percent going into tweet and then up 11 percent after the  tweet.  </p><p> PITT:  It's definitely the wrong way to do this kind of thing.  It may not  be per se illegal, but it is definitely highly problematic and it could be  illegal depending on what his intentions were when he made the  announcement.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So is there a deadline here, Harvey, in terms of when he would  have to reveal his source of funding?  I mean, if he says funding secured  does the SEC want an answer now in terms of whether or not it's secured and  how long does he have to come up with whatever deal he was referring to? </p><p> PITT:  No.  I think he is required to demonstrate that at the time of his  tweet he already had a legally binding commitment for $420 a share.  That  would be the requirement, so the SEC can request or subpoena documents  asking for proof as to what his financing was and what the legal basis was  for his suggestion that it was secured which is a very strong term.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Very strong term.  What's the penalty, Harvey, if Musk was just  -- I don't want to say lying but coming up with an idea that perhaps wasn't  necessarily intact funding secured, what's the penalty?  </p><p> PITT:  Well, we don't of course know if the facts are yet but the penalties  are quite serious.  If he committed fraud or manipulated the market, he  would be liable both civilly for an extreme amount of damages but also he  could have potential criminal liability as well.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Why criminal? </p><p> PITT:  Because almost every violation of the Federal securities laws is  both a civil problem that the SEC pursues and also a potential criminal  issue that the Department of Justice pursues.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  I see.  And so when do you expect we'll hear more about this?   I mean, for example, when are we going to better -- have a clearer idea  whether or not there was in fact funding in place?</p><p> PITT:  I would believe that the next set of announcements will come at some  point from Tesla itself.  The company will probably organize a special  committee of independent directors who will then indicate exactly where  matters stand and whether they are going to pursue Musk's suggest that the  company go private.  I don't think we will hear from the SEC until it has  completed its investigation.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  What about shareholder lawsuits, Harvey, are you expecting that  to also be an issue here?  Because I know that the short sellers loss at  lot of money on that as the stock went up and that's basically what I  assumed Elon Musk wanted to do because he's been sticking it to shorts and  he's, you know, uncomfortable with some of the criticism that the company  has received.</p><p> You saw a very upsetting conference call recently where he pushed back on  some of the criticism and the short sellers questioning about his burn  rate, how much cash is he burning?  So, are you expecting shareholder  lawsuits?  </p><p> PITT:  I think they are inevitable.  It's just a matter of time before  lawsuits are filed because of the enormous fluctuation in the price of the  stock.  I would think the shorts will bring a lawsuit against Mr. Musk and  Tesla.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Is there any precedence here, Harvey?  Have you ever seen  something like this before?  </p><p> PITT:  I've never seen anything like this kind of announcement.  I have  seen short sellers, sue certainly companies and I have certainly seen  companies sue short sellers.  It's a fact of life that if you're public,  you're going to get criticism and the shorts are people you just have to  live with. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.  And, obviously, that's what they are doing.  They're  critical of the company.  They're shorting the stock.  I mean, that's why  they exist.  So you're expecting the SEC to be asking questions about the  funding.  Any other questions coming from the SEC in your view?</p><p> PITT:  Well, I think they will look into why the board didn't make an  announcement sooner, why they waited for Mr. Musk to go for -- forward, and  I think they will also try to determine what kinds of behind-the-scenes  activities were taken by the company.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So in other words, background because the board is saying yes,  Harvey Pitt, the board is saying yes, that Elon Musk has discussed the  potential of going private with us before.  But there is no mention of any  $420 price.  </p><p> PITT:  No.  And where that price comes from is very hard to understand.  It  may be a very good price, but in terms of an economic analysis it may turn  out that it's not as good a price as should be paid for this company.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, exactly.  I mean, when you're talking about $420 a share,  that's like $70 billion, right?  $75 billion? </p><p> PITT:  Yes.  And unprecedented amount of money, it truly is.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  We will leave it there.  Harvey, it's great to see  you again.  Hope you'll come back soon.  Thanks so much for your insights  this morning.  </p><p> PITT:  Sure.  Thank you.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Harvey Pitt joining us there.  And we'll take a short break.   When we come back.  The Tribune Media-Sinclair deal is dead.  Tribune says  that the $3.9 deal can no longer move forward after comments from SEC  Chairman Ajit Pai.  The latest coming up there.  Then half dress, half  bikini?  The new dress causing confusion online.  That's coming up.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Tribute Media called off its buyout by Sinclair  Broadcast Group.  Cheryl Casone with the details.  Two deals that are dead  today, Cheryl.</p><p> CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  We got two deals, that is  right, Maria.  First to Tribune, they've terminated their $3.9-billion deal  and they're suing Sinclair for breach of contract for not doing enough to  win approval from regulators.  You may remember last month, SEC Chairman  Ajit Pai said he had serious concerns about the merger.  Take a look at the  stocks, shares of Sinclair right now, they are lower in the premarket  trading.</p><p> Down more than three percent.  Tribune Media, not really trading it but  shares down more than 20 percent so far this year.  So two stocks to watch  now.  We're also watching shares of Rite-Aid right now.  The stock plunging  more than 10 percent in the premarket.  The sell-off coming after Rite-Aid  and Albertsons called off their $24 billion merger.  Some big Rite-Aid  shareholders plan to vote against the deal today.</p><p> Rite-Aid and Albertsons wanted to team up in order to compete better  against CBS, Walgreens and potentially as you know Amazon has been trying  to get into the pharmaceutical business as well. </p><p> All right.  Check this out.  A volcanic eruption in Chile gets a rider on a  ski list, the front row seat to the action all on tape.  The eruption shot  up a 5,000 foot column of dust and ash as he was filming all of this with  his cell phone.  This comes from a volcano complex that's in the Andes  Mountain but pretty incredible pictures and pretty close.  </p><p> And finally there is this.  We've seen some pretty weird fashion trends in  the last year, upside down shorts, plastic jeans.  Well, here is a new one.   This is a bikini and it's a dress, all in one.  This comes from the fashion  brand, PrettyLittleThing.  And after having one of their models wear it on  Instagram picture, people started to freak out.</p><p> There it is.  We'll let you decide.  Looks like she couldn't decide on what  to wear so she cut both in half and sewed them together.  Maybe.  Here's  another comment.  She's going to dinner, clubbing and swimming all at once.   Yes.  The whole thing goes for $35.00 maybe.  Maria, you could wear it with  some crack heels?  You know.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> CASONE:  That would be an interesting pairing.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Sure would.  So is it a -- is it a dress or is it a bikini?</p><p> CASONE:  It's both.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  It's both.</p><p> CASONE:  Yes.  Because --</p><p> PARTSINEVELOS:  Why not have both?</p><p> BARTIROMO:  You're getting your money for it.  </p><p> PARTSINEVELOS:  Remember the black or blue dress or is it blue or white  dress? </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> PARTSINEVELOS:  Same thing.  But I know about you.  I think, Governor, it  would look better own you with man-bun, crack heels.  </p><p> HUCKABEE:  Pretty sure it wouldn't.</p><p> FREEMAN:  Going to be strong with the man-bun.  Yes.</p><p> HUCKABEE:  Yes.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  You got to really loving this man-bun.</p><p> HUCKABEE:  -- I would feel naked.  Oh.  </p><p> FREEMAN:  If I wear that without the man-bun I would just feel just naked.</p><p> HUCKABEE:  You thought of either of us wearing that is something that there  are television sets across America that are going to be off mode.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  No.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  We don't want that.  We don't want that.  Coming up.  Viacom is  reporting quarterly earnings this morning.  We're breaking down those  numbers coming up next.  Big week for media.  Then overhauling the Oscars.   Details on new changes coming to the academy awards quarterly including the  addition of a popular film category, next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Both parent company of the Fox Business Network, 21st Century  Fox quarterly profit nearly doubled due to cable and film strength.  Nicole  Petallides on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange watching the stock  and the overall market this morning.  Nic, good morning to you.</p><p> NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Good morning, Maria.  So  we talked about 21st Century Fox, our parent and it beat on top and bottom  line.  The analyst have to optimism there as you noted in those particular  areas and that's exactly what came.  In fact it did better than expected.   Deadpool 2, the strength of Fox News just among the reasons why we did see  it beat the 18 percent year over year.</p><p> Revenue increase, strong double-digit growth across all the segments and  the new and obviously what happened, the transaction, Disney and the new  Fox transactions, that -- they say unlocked enormous shareholder value.  In  fact when you take a look at the stock over the fiscal year it's about 75  percent gain, that clearly outpaces the S&amp;P 500.  And the media group which  actually has declined over that period.</p><p> Of course, there's still locked in the -- in the bidding war with CMSCA and  that would be Comcast, but -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  You check that?</p><p> PETALLIDES:  We'll watch that.  So that is the big difference.  Also, last  but not least, we're taking a look at Viacom this morning and that came in  profit top revenue fell and there was the slump in ad sales which fell  short.  And that number which I did talk about the increased shareholder  value I did get from the 21st Century Fox headlines themselves.  Back to  you.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right, Nic.  Thank you so much.  Nicole, we'll be watching  all of that.  Switching gears to the censorship of conservatives on social  media.  It has the attention of lawmakers now including House Majority  Leader Kevin McCarthy who talked to us about this as well as House  Intelligence Chairman Devin Nunes who want - both want answers on action.   Listen to this.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA), HOUSE MAJORITY LEADER:  I want to see bias  stop, especially going after conservatives.  I mean, just look at three  points that showed up in Google right before the primary election in  California.  The party of Lincoln, the party of Reagan, that's not what it  said, it said Nazism.  </p><p> REP. DEVIN NUNES (R-CA), CHAIRMAN, SENATE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE:  I don't  know what Twitter is up to.  It sure looks to me like they're censoring  people and they ought -- they ought to stop it and we're looking at any  legal remedies that we can go through.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  So that was Devin Nunes and Kevin McCarthy.  Kevin  McCarthy was talking about remember right before the primary elections in  California.  You Googled GOP California and in the search results got  Naziism.  Your thoughts, Governor.  I know this is an important topic to  you. </p><p> HUCKABEE:  Well, it really is an important topic.  We talk about Russian  interference.  I'm worried about social media interference.  How are they  manipulating elections, how are they manipulating the information and the  question comes as somebody who doesn't really like government regulation  and intervention, we're headed there.</p><p> We're going to get it because social media platforms are no longer just  social media where people chit-chat about their yoga classes and their  daughter's wedding, they're now the place where people get news, they are  public utilities just like electricity, water, cable television and  telephone.  And so government is going to step in at some point.  I think  sooner than later and they're going to regulate them.</p><p> The social media companies will rue the day when they started favoring one  point of view over another.  But here's why that matters.  Would Americans  tolerate it if you paid differently for your electricity, your water or  your telephone based on your political view of where you went to church?   You would be outraged.  Liberal conservative or independent, you'd be  outraged.  That's what we're seeing today.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And there's also so-called, shadowed banning, James, I mean --</p><p> FREEMAN:  Yes.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  You know, I mean, I had put out a tweet about James Clapper  basically admitting on CNN that President Obama directed the Intelligence  Agencies to launch investigation for the special counsel on the Trump- Russia and I -- and I -- and basically Jim Clapper -- James Clapper  admitted it on CNN.  So I tweeted that out, it got no life, no -- and I  thought, you know, this is something that I know my followers care about.</p><p> And I felt to myself, hmm, is that shadow banning?  I don't know.  I wonder  if my followers saw that tweet or if it just went on deaf ears.  </p><p> FREEMAN:  Well, we've had a bunch of these teases where certainly  conservative viewpoints seem to be suppressed.  The answers from Silicon  Valley generally are often not denials but sort of saying, well, it wasn't  intentional, it's the algorithm.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  But somebody programs the algorithm change.  </p><p> FREEMAN:  Yes.  So, I agree.  I think there's enough ear to say there is a  problem of bias.  It's -- I think it -- I'm hoping first there's a consumer  remedy, we've seen user growth surprisingly kind of flattened --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  You're right.</p><p> FREEMAN:  In these recent earnings reports but I'm hoping it can be  disciplined either through customer behavior or maybe it has to be private  litigation as opposed to creating a new Federal internet regulator and I  think that's the big danger here is that the big tech giants are trying to  cut a deal with both parties in Washington that gives them liability  protection but it also sets up the Federal Trade Commission to have huge  powers over the internet.</p><p> And this could -- this is actually a deal that could happen, very quickly,  I think, and that is the anger I see for innovation because the utility  model you don't get a lot of innovation out of the phone company, the water  company, et cetera.  So I'm hoping there is a market remedy for this and  maybe consumers, you know, are starting to say I want -- </p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> HUCKABEE:  I mean, I wish there was a market remedy, I would much rather  see it.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> HUCKABEE:  But these companies are --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Some competition.  </p><p> HUCKABEE:  -- hearing the bells.  I mean, they're bringing it upon  themselves because they are actively suppressing the points of view of  certain people and when they do that, the market is going to rise up and I  think -- </p><p> PARTSINEVELOS:  What about Alex Jones and certain hate groups, they're  censoring certain things that are clearly fake, if you want to say it, fake  news and he is discounting Sandy Hook and the children and families there.   So when he's -- when somebody is putting out inaccurate facts that have  been proven to be wrong then why not get rid of him?  </p><p> FREEMAN:  Well, that's a fun --</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> PARTSINEVELOS:  Well, this is why we're talking about it.</p><p> FREEMAN:  -- user organization.  But of course, these social media  companies have enjoyed a lot of legal protection on the basis that they are  not news organizations, that it's an open platform anyone in public.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's a good point.  </p><p> FREEMAN:  Now that they're making those kind of judgments, they better be  ready for different treatment --</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> HUCKABEE:  And the first amendment protects stupidity, it protects outrages  speech.  I don't like it but it does protect it.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  Let's take a quick break.  We got the PPI on the  other side of this break.  Stay with us.  Producer Price Index, we'll take  a look at inflation.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Good Thursday morning.  Welcome back, everybody, thanks so much  for joining us this morning.  I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Thursday,  August 9th.  Your top stories right now 8:30 a.m. on the east coast.  We  are just getting the Producer Price Index out.  It is unchanged.  A gain of  three-tenths of a percent was expected, and that's what it looks like this  morning, unchanged on the Producer Price Index.  Not a major reaction from  markets this morning.  We've been looking at a fractional move all morning.   Dow Industrials right now up 20 points, S&amp;P 500 up three, and the NASDAQ up  4-1/2.  Initial jobless claims also out right now, down 6,000.  </p><p> Global markets action in Europe this morning, take a look at European  indices, obviously down across the board.  FT-100 down 50 points, that's  two-thirds of one percent.  The CAC Quarante is down a quarter of a  percent, 16 points lower, and the DAX Index in Germany is flat, down six  points.  In Asia Overnight, the standout was China.  Chinese markets  bouncing back on hopes to the stimulus against U.S. tariffs.  Shanghai  Composite up almost two percent.  And PPI is out, unchanged on the session  versus a two-tenths of a percent estimate, James Freeman.  Your thoughts on  where we are on inflation.</p><p> FREEMAN:  Yes.  Pretty benign environment right now, the economy is  humming, fast growth but inflation not yet raging even though the Feds  still has this huge balance sheet they acquired in the wake of the  financial crisis.  So, I think the hope here is that as we transition back  to the real economy, we can do it without an inflation surge.  And so far  so good.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And year-over-year, Kristina, on inflation on the PPI is 3.3  percent, very much in step with what we've been -- what we've been  expecting.</p><p> PARTSINEVELOS:  Right.  And if anything, maybe this can add to the argument  that wage growth hasn't been climbing higher.  So, now that inflation is  staying relatively flat, that's OK because of wage growth not climbing high  enough or lasted a while.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Wages have just been creeping up, the 2.8 percent higher  year-over-year on wages, we'll keep following that and any impact on  markets this morning.  We have breaking news right now out of North Korea.   North Korea says that if the Trump administration, \"adheres to all  scenarios,\" then there's no chance of progress on denuclearization.  Blake  Burman is live at the White House this morning with more on that.  Blake,  good morning to you.</p><p> BLAKE BURMAN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT:  Hi there,  Maria, good morning to you as well.  This obviously raises more questions  about just how intent North Korea is on resolving the issue of  denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula.  The headline that is coming out this  morning is that the North Koreans say that if the Trump administration  adheres to old scenarios, it cannot expect any progress on  denuclearization, something that the White House certainly will watch  throughout the day.  And of course, the upcoming weeks and months as the  President right now is in Bedminster, New Jersey for a week off on what the  White House is characterizing as a working vacation.</p><p> Meantime, here in Washington later today, the Vice President Mike Pence  will lay out what the administration hopes to deploy in the upcoming years  that being a sixth branch of the military, the Space Force.  The President  said earlier this summer that he wanted the military to build out this new  branch of government.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Now, our destiny beyond the  Earth is not only a matter of national identity, but a matter of national  security.  When it comes to defending America, it is not enough to merely  have an American presence in space, we must have American dominance in  space.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> BURMAN:  The Air Force already though has a robust presence patrolling  outer space especially as it relates to the use and deployment of  satellites.  That responsibility would go to the Space Force which would be  responsible for conducting war plans for space, but there are many  questions here, including how the military would be reshaped.  The defense  secretary James Mattis admitting earlier this week that they are still  trying to work out on how the actual organization would take place within  the military.  By the way, Maria, there is also the congressional issue on  this one as well because a sixth branch of the military would need  Congressional approval and, of course, Congressional funding.  We will hear  from the Vice President later today, Maria. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right, Blake, thank you so much.  Blake Burman with the  latest there.  Joining us right now is Fox News Legal Analyst and author of  the new book, \"The Russia Hoax: The Illicit Scheme to Clear Hillary Clinton  and Frame Donald Trump.\"  Gregg Jarrett is with us.  Gregg, great to see  you, thanks so much for joining us.</p><p> GREGG JARRETT, FOX NEWS LEGAL ANALYST:  Thank you.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Congrats on the book.  And as I read the title and as I report  on what has teken place in the 2016 election.  It seems exactly accurate in  terms of what happened.</p><p> JARRETT:  Thank you.  Well, you would know because you have done so much to  further the story yourself.  I wrote this book because actually I became  incensed in outraged, the top officials at the FBI and the Department of  Justice were abusing their positions of power to subvert the rule of law,  and undermine the democratic process, and I think I lay out a fairly  persuasive case here of the facts, the evidence, and the law, that this was  a cesspool of corruption.  And by the way, it still is, because they  continue to cover it up.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And the latest has a real focus on Bruce Ohr, the number three  guy at the DOJ, whose wife worked for Fusion GPS.</p><p> JARRETT:  I mean, talk about an incestuous collection of corrupt acts.  You  know, the FBI knew that Christopher Steele, who phonied up the anti-Trump  dossier, was already on the payroll of Hillary Clinton, he was on the  payroll of the FBI.  And when the FBI finally fired Christopher Steele,  their regulations say you can't have any more contact with him, so they  were very devious.  They used Bruce Ohr at the Department of Justice as the  conduit, the intermediary.  The FBI continued to receive Christopher Steele  information, spying on Trump after he was inaugurated for several months  thereafter.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  You know, what gets me, Governor, is, you know, it feels  like the left in their hatred of President Trump, so much they've thrown  out all ideals, they've thrown out values of, you know, the law of the  land, and it was OK to spy on Carter Page, oh, because it's Trump.  You  know, it's OK to abuse your power at the top of the FBI, oh, it's Trump.   It's incredible.</p><p> HUCKABEE:  Well, it is incredible.  And Gregg, congratulations on the book.</p><p> JARRETT:  Thank you.</p><p> HUCKABEE:  It reads like a novel.  The frightening thing is that it's not  fiction, it's fact, and you lay out an incredibly compelling case in a  chronological order, which I think is a great value to the reader.  So,  it's a -- it's a powerful book.  We've seen the weaponization of the  agencies of our federal government going after a presidential candidate in  a fashion we've never seen before, the highest levels.  But when they are  using their own power in this way, to create a false dossier, on which the  warrant is obtained, legally, does that not put them with the fruit of the  poisonous tree, and so that whatever they end up would be able to be pushed  back because they got it illegally?</p><p> JARRETT:  Yes, absolutely, under the exclusionary rule, it would be  excluded as evidence.  The law enforcers became the lawbreakers.  And  what's outrageous is --</p><p> HUCKABEE:  That's powerful statement.</p><p> JARRETT:  Yes, they're not being investigated and prosecuted.  I lay out  myriad of potential crimes here, by people like Andrew McCabe, James Comey,  and you know, Peter Strzok, Lisa Page, and the list goes on and on, things  like abusive power which is a felony.  Obstruction of justice, they  obstructed their own investigation to clear Hillary Clinton.  And on the  same day they cleared her, Comey is standing in front of cameras, his FBI  is meeting secretly in London with Christopher Steele to begin the frame  job on President Trump, then-candidate Trump.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Wow.  And you say that this all started when then-FBI director  Jim Comey cleared Hillary Clinton in the e-mail server probe back in 2016.   Watch this.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> JAMES COMEY, FORMER DIRECTOR, FBI:  Although, we did not find clear  evidence that Secretary Clinton or her colleagues intended to violate laws  governing the handling of classified information, there is evidence that  they were extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly- classified information.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So, while they were putting together a narrative about Donald  Trump, they were very easy on Hillary Clinton.  And they basically did not  investigate.</p><p> JARRETT:  Absolutely.  And it was one deception, and I believe, lie after  another from James Comey as you saw there on that very day.  He had  originally written it, Hillary Clinton committed crimes.  He wrote it down  twice, gross negligence, but his staff said, well, you can't clear her if  you put that in your statement, so they sit down at Peter Strzok's computer  and they expunge from Comey's statements, those incriminating words and  other allegations of criminality by Hillary Clinton.  The swamp didn't want  to be drained.  And a potential President Trump jeopardized their ambitions  and positions of power, so they sought to damage his candidacy, and when  they didn't do that and he was elected, they sought to undo the election.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's incredible.  James?</p><p> FREEMAN:  And the -- when you talk about the swamp going after now- President Trump, but then-candidate Trump, do we have a sense yet of  exactly when this began?  There seems to have been I think a real challenge  for Congressional investigators figuring out when was the real beginning of  whether it was intelligence or law enforcement assets descending on the  Trump campaign?</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And this is what Devin Nunes is investigating right now, what  happened before actual launch of the investigation, which, of course, was  July 2016?</p><p> JARRETT:  Some of the documents that Devin Nunes is trying to get his hands  on that Rod Rosenstein and Christopher Wray will not hand over the origins  of the Trump-Russia collusion investigation, it looks to me like, the FBI  began spying on the Trump campaign seven months before they formally signed  the papers launching the investigation.  And by the way, when they signed  those papers, they violated their own FBI guidelines, there was no probable  cause, no evidence of crimes, no plausible intelligence for  counterintelligence probe, they broke the law and the rules.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Do you think there'll be any accountability here?  </p><p> JARRETT:  Not with Jeff Sessions and Rod Rosenstein at the helm of the  Department of Justice.  And that's a sad commentary on our system of  justice right now.  But Sessions is utterly feckless and Rosenstein, I  think, is trying to continue to cover up his own wrongdoing.  This is a guy  who should have recused himself the moment he appointed Mueller.  You can't  be a prosecutor and a key witness all rolled into one.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Because he OK'd the fourth FISA warrant.</p><p> JARRETT:  That's right.  And you can only do that when you have new  evidence.  The best we can tell so far, they have no new evidence.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And there wasn't any evidence from the get-go, it was just the  dossier.</p><p> JARRETT:  That's right.  And the FBI knew that the dossier was totally  fabricated.  You can read it online, I've read it a hundred times.  I never  failed to laugh.  You know, it is the work of an amateur dime novelist in  junior high school.  And even Christopher Steele who wrote it, said, in  court papers under oath in Great Britain, which I dug up, and it's in the  book, that it's unverifiable because it was a guy who told a guy, who told  the guy, who told me.  Triple, quadruple hearsay based on anonymous  sources.  You can't use that sort of thing in a court of law.  Get the FBI  and DOJ, use it to gain a warrant to wiretap -- that's abuse of power to  fraud on the court.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  So, this is one political party spying on the -- on their  opponent, there on the left.</p><p> JARRETT:  Right.  And where's the outrage over Hillary Clinton paying for  all of this?  Now, that is a violation of the law.  The Trump Tower  meeting, perfect legal.  All the media has to do is read the federal  campaign election act.  Foreign nationals may participate in American  political campaigns and providing any information is not a thing of value.   But stonewalling to Congress is something I do not understand why it  continues.  They have a constitutional obligation to give Congress what it  wants.  And Congress should use the power of the purse and cut off the  money.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Into the oversight agency.</p><p> JARRETT:  That's the only way to have.  Yes.  Absolutely.  But I blame  Congress because for decades, whenever the Department of Justice and FBI  didn't want to hand over documents, they just said we're not going to do  it, and Congress never took action.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p> JARRETT:  So, it's been habitual.</p><p> FREEMAN:  Well, the President could order all of this declassified.</p><p> JARRETT:  And he should.  I think he is considering it, but you know, there  are -- there are those advising him not to.  He should absolutely order  declassification of a FISA application documents, the Gang of Eight  documents and the origin documents.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  The American people have a right to know and they want to know.   \"The Russia Hoax,\" is the book, \"The Illicit Scheme to Clear Hillary  Clinton and Frame Donald Trump.\"  Gregg Jarrett, thank you so much.</p><p> JARRETT:  Thank you.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Congrats on the book.  Great to see you.</p><p> JARRETT:  Thank you.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  We have breaking news right now we want to get to, Russian  Foreign Ministry is saying this, Moscow will work on retaliatory measures  in response to the new U.S. sanctions against Russia, it's according to  Reuters this morning.  The U.S. imposed new sanctions tied to the nerve  agent poisoning of a former Russian spy and his daughter, that of course,  breaking this week.  We'll be right back.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Uber and Lyft hitting a roadblock in New York  City.  The city council voted to limit the number of vehicles on the  streets.  Joining us now, the host of \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY,\" Stuart Varney to  weigh in.  Stu, good morning to you.</p><p> STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Good morning, Maria.  You  know, I think there's a backlash coming to this thing.  As you say, the  Mayor of New york is imposing a cap on the number of Uber and Lyft cars  allowed in the city.  In my opinion, that leaves a lot of wait times and to  higher prices.  But there's something else going on here, yellow cabs have  often been accused (INAUDIBLE) regular taxicabs in New York City often  accused of not picking up people of color because of their color.  Uber has  a way out.  </p><p> Uber doesn't care what color you are, Uber doesn't care what your ethnicity  is, they pick you up, it's all electronic.  Well, that is going to be  capped at the -- basically at the doings of the willing of the taxi  industry.  I think there's a backlash coming here from the minorities.   Worse yet, I think there's going to be -- I think New York City will be  used as a template as a test case for other cities in America and around  the world, which want to fence in Uber, because they are devastating the  local taxi industry.  I think this is the wrong decision on so many levels,  and I hope it's withdrawn, I don't think it will be but it should be.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Meaning there's a lot of backlash because, you know, look what  happened to the taxis.  The prices of the medallion plummeted.</p><p> VARNEY:  Yes, the medallion was 2 -- was 1.3 million in 2013, and now it's  between 160 and 250,000.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  There you go.</p><p> VARNEY:  That's a huge loss of capital for the taxi owners and this is  their way of pushing back.  But I think the pushback is very detrimental to  many, many people.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll watch that.  Stu, I know you'll have more on  that in about 10 minutes.  We'll see you then top of the hour \"VARNEY &amp;  COMPANY\" begins at 9:00 a.m. Eastern, right after MORNINGS WITH MARIA.   Join Stuart in the next few minutes.  But first, overhauling the Oscars,  details on the new changes coming to the Academy Awards including the  addition of a popular film category, that's next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> GERRI WILLIS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  -- arts and sciences cutting  the link to the show and introducing a category for outstanding achievement  in popular film.  Critics have complained that the broadcast is too long,  too boring, too political, too condescending -- oh, maybe that's just my  view.</p><p> Audiences would appear to agree, giving me telecast, its lowest ratings on  record last February when a mere 26.5 million people tuned in.  Remember,  the Super Bowl got 107 million.  Academy CEO Dawn Hudson said the board is,  quote, committed to producing an entertaining show in three hours.  Wow.   Three -- it takes you three hours?  The move was met with a frenzy of  criticism, particularly from in the street journalists.  Atlantic reporter  David Sims called the (INAUDIBLE) award, the Black Panther memorial award  for movie that were afraid won't get a big picture -- best picture  nominations.  Other called it lazy, ham-handed.  In recent years, hit films  like \"Wonder Woman\" have been snubbed by Oscar, although blockbusters from  the past like \"Gone With the Wind\" were heavily recognized.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  So, good changes?</p><p> WILLIS:  Not the right changes necessary (INAUDIBLE) always a good idea.   Can we do this in like 30 minutes or something?</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Three hours.</p><p> HUCKABEE:  You can get a kidney replacement in less time and it's not as  painful as watching the Oscars.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Your thoughts on the changes.</p><p> PARTSINEVELOS:  People like -- I remember when I was a kid, I used to love  watching it because you'd never know who would win and you'd sit around  together, and then the outfits, so I don't think that they're really going  to shorten it that much, but they have lost viewership, for sure, because  there's --</p><p> WILLIS:  It's brutal.  I always (INAUDIBLE) 4 million people every single  night, OK?  I mean, think about it.</p><p> PARTSINEVELOS:  But also the performance.  The performances and the actors  and the comedians in between sets, those are -- that's pretty decent stuff,  and sometimes there's controversy that comes out of it, so that's what I  would watch for.  I don't watch it, but --</p><p> WILLIS:  I thought you'd see the fashion and would be happy.  That's all I  really need.</p><p> FREEMAN:  I think beyond the suffocating politics, they just -- you have  too many movies that almost no one in the television audience has seen so I  understand what they're trying to do here.  Maybe they ought to just  recognize some of these films that a lot of Americans think were the best  pictures: \"American Sniper\" -- I mean, most people would say that's a great  movie, right?</p><p> WILLIS:  Right.  Well, this popcorn award, that's what they're trying to  do.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  The popular film.</p><p> WILLIS:  Yes, popular film.  But you know, that's sort of like a ghetto for  popular -- you know, like, though, it should really win the major  categories.  You know what I mean?  It should be elevated to the level of  \"Gone With the Wind,\" lots of very popular movies in previous years won  those awards, not anymore.</p><p> FREEMAN:  People don't watch the Oscars, though, because they want a  political lecture that insults half of America.  They want to -- they want  to escape from all of that and have entertainment.  When the celebrities go  up there and lecture us and preach to us and point their fingers --</p><p> PARTSINEVELOS:  They don't do that all the time during Oscars.  I'm going  to fight back against that.  If you watch the full show --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  It's become much more political.</p><p> PARTSINEVELOS:  -- not all politics.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  But it has become much more political.</p><p> HUCKABEE:  It doesn't have to be all politics, but when all the politics  they have is negative toward half the population, what happens?  People say  I'll watch paint dry before I'll sit here and watch this.</p><p> PARTSINEVELOS:  There's always going to be something that's going to offend  somebody out there, and usually, politics makes for good comedy.</p><p> HUCKABEE:  But their ratings are tanking.  It's not working.  Maybe they  should listen to us.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Gerri, good stuff.</p><p> WILLIS:  I'm staying 30 minutes.  I think I'm going to --</p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Coming up, final thoughts from this all-star panel.  Stay with  us.  We'll be right back.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Final thoughts from our all-star panel right  now.  Governor Huckabee?</p><p> HUCKABEE:  I want to say thanks to James Freeman for writing a book called  \"Borrowed Time,\" and giving really powerful insight into the financial  crisis, I think it's a very, very important book, people need to read it,  and I hope they will.  James, I want it to be a bestseller.</p><p> FREEMAN:  Thanks, Governor.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  \" Borrowed Time: Two Centuries of Booms, Busts, and Bailouts at  Citi.\"  Check out the book.  Congratulations.</p><p> FREEMAN:  I just want to say that the Governor is very handsome and very  charming man.</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> FREEMAN:  And a model American citizen.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Kristina?</p><p> PARTSINEVELOS:  Well, I'm not going to -- I'm going to take a serious route  just because we haven't been able to --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Hey, this is serious.</p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  This is serious stuff right here.</p><p> PARTSINEVELOS:  You bring a wonderful book and you're a gorgeous man.</p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> PARTSINEVELOS:  Now, the timing just seems so awkward.</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Tell us.  This is an important story, too.</p><p> PARTSINEVELOS:  This is an important story, but you guys are great.  Saudi  Arabia and Canada, the relations going on between both those countries,  Canada foreign affairs minister tweeting about the human rights -- two  human rights activists in Saudi.  Saudi is saying, you can't tell us  anything and what to do.  So, I think that's just a big story, a big story.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll follow that.  Kristina Partsinevelos, James  Freeman, Mike Huckabee, great to see, everybody.  Thank you so much.  Great  show, everybody.  We'll see you again tomorrow.  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" is now.   Stuart, take it away.</p><p> VARNEY:  Hey, good morning, Maria.  And good morning, everyone.  August  9th, yes, mid-summer, dog days of summer, summer doldrums, not if --</p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

Wednesday evening\u2019s earnings update was even more eagerly anticipated than usual after the recent surge in its share price. Elon Musk\u2019s company has added an astonishing $200 billion to its already ample market capitalization since the end of March.  Confirmation that Tesla will add a second U.S. factory, in Austin, Texas, is certainly something to celebrate \u2014 especially for the workers it will employ there to build its Cybertruck and other products. So too is a fourth consecutive quarter of net profit, which may prompt the company\u2019s inclusion in the S&amp;P500.  And yet the earnings call \u2014 where Musk has in the past ranted about \u201cfascist\u201d virus lockdowns and attacked analysts for asking \u201cboring, bonehead\u201d questions \u2014 was a bit of a snooze. It even featured a long discussion about insurance and Musk\u2019s appreciation for the actuarial profession.  In the current economic environment, such steadiness is an achievement. Most car companies will probably suffer huge losses because of the recent closures of factories and showrooms, even if things won\u2019t be quite as bad as feared initially. By contrast, Tesla reported $104 million of net income in the April to June period, bringing its total profit over the past four quarters to $368 million.  Still, these are modest amounts for a company that\u2019s valued at an inexplicable 800 times trailing earnings, giving it a $295 billion market capitalization.  The profits are also more than accounted for by $1 billion of regulatory credits that Tesla sold to other carmakers during the 12 months to June, including $428 million in the latest quarter. It\u2019s only able to earn this income because rivals haven\u2019t gotten their act together yet on building enough electric vehicles and have to buy credits from Musk\u2019s company to satisfy emissions regulators. Tesla acknowledges this good fortune won\u2019t last forever.  At a time when Musk is building three new factories on three continents, money from any source is welcome. Tesla says its $8.6 billion pile of cash and equivalents is sufficient to fund its expansion. But raising capital would barely dilute shareholders given how inflated the stock is. Investors might even welcome it.  The second-quarter earnings won\u2019t, however, settle the debate about whether demand for Tesla cars is starting to tail off in important markets. While Musk says this isn\u2019t a problem, the company has been cutting prices in North America and China. His explanation is that the cheaper the cars are, the more people will buy them. So long as the company remains \u201cslightly profitable\u201d and avoids going \u201cbankrupt\u201d \u2014 in his words \u2014 then he sounds happy to sacrifice a bit of profit margin to drive growth.  Tesla isn\u2019t growing all that much right now, which is hard to square with the massive jump in its share price. Revenue declined 5% year on year in the latest quarter. The pandemic will have taken a toll, but Tesla will only really start to merit its \u201cBig Tech\u201d valuation once its top line starts firing again.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42664252685</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60DT-NN41-F07F-82KN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"557\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>MyBroadband.co.za</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 23, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>South Africa</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Africa</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Southern Africa</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000340</classCode><className>COMPANY EARNINGS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0008X7D</classCode><className>MANUFACTURING FACILITIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001076</classCode><className>MARKET CAPITALIZATION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000CZTI</classCode><className>STOCK PRICES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001410</classCode><className>COMPANY PROFITS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DPM9</classCode><className>ELECTRIC VEHICLE INDUSTRY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX000944</classCode><className>INTERIM FINANCIAL RESULTS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST000DIJW</classCode><className>PRICES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>ST000DF2W</classCode><className>NEW MANUFACTURING FACILITIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>N236210MM</classCode><className>PLANT CONSTRUCTION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX000565</classCode><className>ELECTRIC VEHICLES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX001561</classCode><className>SHAREHOLDERS</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NEI2QjYxNjkwMTkzNDhFRUExNjlFRjVFRUU3NDhBQkE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MDQ3M0RFODczN0I4NDg2RjlFRDNFMUNBODRDQTU0Q0E</classCode><className>Shareholders</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>STX001374</classCode><className>PRICE CUTTING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>ST000DNUO</classCode><className>CLIMATE CHANGE REGULATION &amp;

Tesla's market value today is three times that of Ford, General Motors and FiatChrysler, combined. A single share of Tesla now goes for $1,600, a seven-fold increase from a year ago, making it one of the most expensive publicly traded shares in the world.</p><p>\"Things just turned on a dime,\" said CFRA Analyst Garrett Nelson. \"It's just been one positive announcement after another.\"</p><p>In the past year, the electric car and solar panel maker successfully opened a factory in China, introduced the Model Y electric SUV, made debt payments, and it has posted profits for three straight quarters. Musk toned down the posts on Twitter that had cost him and the company $40 million in penalties from U.S. securities regulators.</p><p>A day before the company posts quarterly results one year removed from that week in 2019, industry analysts have begun to question if Tesla is running too hot. Analysts polled by FactSet expect a $228 million net loss from April through June. Only one analyst has a 12-month stock price target above the current value.</p><p>Tesla's stock surge has enriched Musk, boosting his net worth to an estimated $73.5 billion. He passed Warren Buffett, the Sage of Omaha, on the Forbes Billionaires list. And Musk could be headed for another big payday soon under his ambitious Tesla compensation package. In total, Musk and other Tesla shareholders have made about $240 billion since March 18, the low point for the stock price this year.</p><p>With second-quarter sales of Tesla vehicles outpacing the first despite a global pandemic, shares could jump again if Tesla surprises with its fourth consecutive profitable quarter. That would likely check all the boxes and could lead to Tesla's admission into the club of corporate giants: The S&amp;P 500 stock index.</p><p>But it may be a Cinderella story.</p><p>CFRA's Nelson says shares have outpaced Tesla's fundamental performance, and he's telling clients to sell. He placed a price target at about two-thirds the current value of shares.</p><p>In an interview, Nelson said April-to-June registrations of Tesla vehicles fell by nearly half in California, the company's biggest market. That's an indication of waning demand for its vehicles, which start at $37,990 for a base Model 3 that can easily hit $60,000 with options.</p><p>Tesla also cut the price of its long-range Model Y by $3,000, which Nelson sees as a red flag. And the company is about to engage in a bout of heavy spending with new factories going up in Germany and the U.S.</p><p>There are also market factors that have flung share prices beyond what would be considered a rational trajectory, Nelson said.</p><p>Short sellers that perceived flaws at Tesla have since been buying shares to cover massive losses as the stock price leapt, Nelson said. Short-sellers now account for only 7.5% of Tesla's outstanding stock, down from over 23% a year ago, he said.</p><p>Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas has a $740 price target on Tesla, telling investors in a note that the market has given the company too much of a share of future electric vehicle and connected car revenue.</p><p>The valuation of Tesla shares has entered the orbit of Apple and Amazon, which took off after hitting $300 billion in market value like Tesla did last week, Jonas wrote. But Tesla's revenue and pretax earnings are far smaller than either tech company when they reached the $300 billion mark, he told investors.</p><p>Those who buy Tesla at around $1,500 per share have to believe that long-term U.S.-China trade relations will remain stable, older automakers will fail to make competitive electric vehicles, and big tech companies such as Google, Amazon and Apple won't be successful in developing electric vehicle systems, he wrote.</p><p>Jonas. who is uneasy about deteriorating relations between the world's two biggest economies, says traditional automakers are ready to spend over $400 billion on electric vehicles in the next five years, and he expects tech companies to enter the transportation business.</p><p>The dizzying run-up in Tesla's stock has positioned Musk for a lucrative payday just a few months after the Palo Alto, California, company awarded him a stock package worth more than $700 million.</p><p>That marked the first windfall in an incentive-laden deal that Tesla's board worked out two years ago to inspire Musk to build a company that eventually generates $175 billion in revenue, and is valued at $650 billion.</p><p>Tesla's market value during the past six months has averaged $149 billion, according to data compiled Monday by FactSet Research. That's just a $1 billion below the next hurdle that needs to be cleared for Musk to receive 1.69 million stock options valued at $350.02, or nearly 80% below Monday's closing price of $1,643.</p><p>The huge gap would make those stock options worth $2.2 billion on paper, although Musk wouldn't be able to sell the shares for five years.</p><p>Musk qualified for his first batch of 1.69 billion stock options in early May after Tesla's market value averaged $100 billion for a six-month period. The company also reached revenue and adjusted earnings goals needed for Musk to receive the first of 12 potential awards that could be worth tens of billions of dollars.</p><p>Copyright 2020 The Associated Press.

The electric car and solar panel maker has successfully opened a factory in China, introduced the Model Y electric SUV, made debt payments and posted profits for three straight quarters. Musk has also toned down his inflammatory posts on Twitter that had cost him and the company $40 million in penalties from U.S. securities regulators.</p><p>Today, Tesla's market value is three times that of Ford, General Motors and FiatChrysler, combined. A single share of Tesla now goes for nearly $1,600 - a seven-fold increase from a year ago - making it one of the most expensive publicly traded shares in the world.</p><p>\"Things just turned on a dime,\" said Garrett Nelson, an analyst at CFRA who specializes in the automotive industry. \"It's just been one positive announcement after another.\"</p><p>The dizzying performance on Tuesday qualified Musk for his second huge payday in less than three months, this one worth more than $2 billion. His net worth has soared to an estimated $72 billion, just behind Warren Buffett on the Forbes Billionaires list after passing the famed investor earlier this month. In total, Musk and other Tesla shareholders have made about $240 billion since March 18 when the stock stood at $361 - its low point for this year.</p><p>With second-quarter sales of Tesla vehicles outpacing the first despite a global pandemic, shares could jump again if Tesla surprises on Wednesday with a fourth consecutive profitable quarter. That could lead to Tesla's admission into the club of corporate giants: the S&amp;P 500 stock index.</p><p>But analysts have begun to question if the shares are running too hot. Analysts polled by FactSet expect a $228 million net loss from April through June. Only one analyst has a 12-month stock price target above the current value. A message was left Tuesday seeking comment from Tesla.</p><p>Nelson says shares have outpaced Tesla's fundamental performance, and he's telling clients to sell. He placed a price target at about two-thirds the current value of shares.</p><p>In an interview, Nelson said April-to-June registrations of Tesla vehicles fell by nearly half in California, the company's biggest U.S. market. That's an indication of waning demand for its vehicles, which start at $37,990 for a base Model 3 but the car can easily hit $60,000 with options.</p><p>Tesla also cut the price of its long-range Model Y by $3,000, which Nelson sees as a red flag. And the company is about to engage in a bout of heavy spending with new factories going up in Germany and the U.S.</p><p>There are also market factors that have flung share prices far higher, Nelson said.</p><p>Short sellers who perceived flaws at Tesla have since been buying shares to cover massive losses as the stock price leaped, Nelson said. Short-sellers now account for only 7.5% of Tesla's outstanding stock, down from over 23% a year ago, he said.</p><p>Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas has a $740 price target on Tesla, arguing that the market overestimates the company's share of future electric vehicle and connected car revenue.</p><p>Investors are treating Tesla like tech stocks Apple and Amazon, which took off years ago after hitting $300 billion in market value, Jonas wrote in an investor note. Tesla hit that mark last week, but its revenue and pretax earnings are far smaller than either tech company when they reached the $300 billion valuation, he wrote.</p><p>Those who buy Tesla at around $1,500 per share have to believe that long-term U.S.-China trade relations will remain stable, older automakers will fail to make competitive electric vehicles, and big tech companies such as Google, Amazon and Apple won't be successful in developing electric vehicle systems, he wrote.</p><p>Jonas, who is uneasy about deteriorating relations between the world's two biggest economies, says traditional automakers are ready to spend over $400 billion on electric vehicles in the next five years, and he expects tech companies to enter the transportation business.</p><p>In the meantime, Musk is sitting pretty. The run-up in Tesla's stock positioned him for a big payday after the Palo Alto, California, company awarded him a stock package worth more than $700 million in May.</p><p>That compensation is part of an incentive-laden deal that Tesla's board worked out two years ago to inspire Musk to build a company that eventually generates $175 billion in revenue, and is valued at $650 billion.</p><p>Musk cleared another hurdle Tuesday when Tesla's market value averaged $150 billion for a six-month stretch, according to data compiled by FactSet Research. Hitting that threshold means Musk is in line to receive 1.69 million stock options valued at $350.02, or nearly 80% below Tuesday's closing price of $1,568.36.</p><p>The huge gap would make those stock options worth $2.06 billion on paper, although Musk can't sell the shares for at least five years.</p><p>____</p><p>AP Business Writer Alex Veiga contributed from Los Angeles.

His net worth has soared to an estimated $72 billion, just behind Warren Buffett on the Forbes Billionaires list after passing the famed investor earlier this month. In total, Musk and other Tesla shareholders have made about $240 billion since March 18 when the stock stood at $361 \u2014 its low point for this year.</p><p>With second-quarter sales of Tesla vehicles outpacing the first despite a global pandemic, shares could jump again if Tesla surprises on Wednesday with a fourth consecutive profitable quarter. That could lead to Tesla\u2019s admission into the club of corporate giants: the S&amp;P 500 stock index.</p><p>But analysts have begun to question if the shares are running too hot. Analysts polled by FactSet expect a $228 million net loss from April through June. Only one analyst has a 12-month stock price target above the current value. A message was left Tuesday seeking comment from Tesla.</p><p>Nelson says shares have outpaced Tesla's fundamental performance, and he's telling clients to sell. He placed a price target at about two-thirds the current value of shares.</p><p>In an interview, Nelson said April-to-June registrations of Tesla vehicles fell by nearly half in California, the company's biggest U.S. market. That's an indication of waning demand for its vehicles, which start at $37,990 for a base Model 3 but the car can easily hit $60,000 with options.</p><p>Tesla also cut the price of its long-range Model Y by $3,000, which Nelson sees as a red flag. And the company is about to engage in a bout of heavy spending with new factories going up in Germany and the U.S.</p><p>There are also market factors that have flung share prices far higher, Nelson said.</p><p>Short sellers who perceived flaws at Tesla have since been buying shares to cover massive losses as the stock price leaped, Nelson said. Short-sellers now account for only 7.5% of Tesla's outstanding stock, down from over 23% a year ago, he said.</p><p>Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas has a $740 price target on Tesla, arguing that the market overestimates the company's share of future electric vehicle and connected car revenue.</p><p>Investors are treating Tesla like tech stocks Apple and Amazon, which took off years ago after hitting $300 billion in market value, Jonas wrote in an investor note. Tesla hit that mark last week, but its revenue and pretax earnings are far smaller than either tech company when they reached the $300 billion valuation, he wrote.</p><p>Those who buy Tesla at around $1,500 per share have to believe that long-term U.S.-China trade relations will remain stable, older automakers will fail to make competitive electric vehicles, and big tech companies such as Google, Amazon and Apple won't be successful in developing electric vehicle systems, he wrote.</p><p>Jonas, who is uneasy about deteriorating relations between the world's two biggest economies, says traditional automakers are ready to spend over $400 billion on electric vehicles in the next five years, and he expects tech companies to enter the transportation business.</p><p>In the meantime, Musk is sitting pretty. The run-up in Tesla\u2019s stock positioned him for a big payday after the Palo Alto, California, company awarded him a stock package worth more than $700 million in May.</p><p>That compensation is part of an incentive-laden deal that Tesla\u2019s board worked out two years ago to inspire Musk to build a company that eventually generates $175 billion in revenue, and is valued at $650 billion.</p><p>Musk cleared another hurdle Tuesday when Tesla's market value averaged $150 billion for a six-month stretch, according to data compiled by FactSet Research. Hitting that threshold means Musk is in line to receive 1.69 million stock options valued at $350.02, or nearly 80% below Tuesday's closing price of $1,568.36.</p><p>The huge gap would make those stock options worth $2.06 billion on paper, although Musk can't sell the shares for at least five years.</p><p>____</p><p>AP Business Writer Alex Veiga contributed from Los Angeles.

The electric car and solar panel maker has successfully opened a factory in China, introduced the Model Y electric SUV, made debt payments and posted profits for three straight quarters. Musk has also toned down his inflammatory posts on Twitter that had cost him and the company $40 million in penalties from U.S. securities regulators.</p><p>Today, Tesla's market value is three times that of Ford, General Motors and FiatChrysler, combined. A single share of Tesla now goes for nearly $1,600 \u2014 a seven-fold increase from a year ago \u2014 making it one of the most expensive publicly traded shares in the world.</p><p>\u201cThings just turned on a dime,\u201d said Garrett Nelson, an analyst at CFRA who specializes in the automotive industry. \u201cIt\u2019s just been one positive announcement after another.\u201d</p><p>The dizzying performance on Tuesday qualified Musk for his second huge payday in less than three months, this one worth more than $2 billion. His net worth has soared to an estimated $72 billion, just behind Warren Buffett on the Forbes Billionaires list after passing the famed investor earlier this month. In total, Musk and other Tesla shareholders have made about $240 billion since March 18 when the stock stood at $361 \u2014 its low point for this year.</p><p>With second-quarter sales of Tesla vehicles outpacing the first despite a global pandemic, shares could jump again if Tesla surprises on Wednesday with a fourth consecutive profitable quarter. That could lead to Tesla\u2019s admission into the club of corporate giants: the S&amp;P 500 stock index.</p><p>But analysts have begun to question if the shares are running too hot. Analysts polled by FactSet expect a $228 million net loss from April through June. Only one analyst has a 12-month stock price target above the current value. A message was left Tuesday seeking comment from Tesla.</p><p>Nelson says shares have outpaced Tesla's fundamental performance, and he's telling clients to sell. He placed a price target at about two-thirds the current value of shares.</p><p>In an interview, Nelson said April-to-June registrations of Tesla vehicles fell by nearly half in California, the company's biggest U.S. market. That's an indication of waning demand for its vehicles, which start at $37,990 for a base Model 3 but the car can easily hit $60,000 with options.</p><p>Tesla also cut the price of its long-range Model Y by $3,000, which Nelson sees as a red flag. And the company is about to engage in a bout of heavy spending with new factories going up in Germany and the U.S.</p><p>There are also market factors that have flung share prices far higher, Nelson said.</p><p>Short sellers who perceived flaws at Tesla have since been buying shares to cover massive losses as the stock price leaped, Nelson said. Short-sellers now account for only 7.5% of Tesla's outstanding stock, down from over 23% a year ago, he said.</p><p>Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas has a $740 price target on Tesla, arguing that the market overestimates the company's share of future electric vehicle and connected car revenue.</p><p>Investors are treating Tesla like tech stocks Apple and Amazon, which took off years ago after hitting $300 billion in market value, Jonas wrote in an investor note. Tesla hit that mark last week, but its revenue and pretax earnings are far smaller than either tech company when they reached the $300 billion valuation, he wrote.</p><p>Those who buy Tesla at around $1,500 per share have to believe that long-term U.S.-China trade relations will remain stable, older automakers will fail to make competitive electric vehicles, and big tech companies such as Google, Amazon and Apple won't be successful in developing electric vehicle systems, he wrote.</p><p>Jonas, who is uneasy about deteriorating relations between the world's two biggest economies, says traditional automakers are ready to spend over $400 billion on electric vehicles in the next five years, and he expects tech companies to enter the transportation business.</p><p>In the meantime, Musk is sitting pretty. The run-up in Tesla\u2019s stock positioned him for a big payday after the Palo Alto, California, company awarded him a stock package worth more than $700 million in May.</p><p>That compensation is part of an incentive-laden deal that Tesla\u2019s board worked out two years ago to inspire Musk to build a company that eventually generates $175 billion in revenue, and is valued at $650 billion.</p><p>Musk cleared another hurdle Tuesday when Tesla's market value averaged $150 billion for a six-month stretch, according to data compiled by FactSet Research. Hitting that threshold means Musk is in line to receive 1.69 million stock options valued at $350.02, or nearly 80% below Tuesday's closing price of $1,568.36.</p><p>The huge gap would make those stock options worth $2.06 billion on paper, although Musk can't sell the shares for at least five years.</p><p>____</p><p>AP Business Writer Alex Veiga contributed from Los Angeles.

Tesla has posted three straight profitable quarters, opened a factory in China and rolled out the Model Y small SUV. Yet ahead of second-quarter results on Wednesday, July 21, analysts are beginning to question whether the run will last. (AP Photo/Susan Walsh, File)DETROIT (AP) \u2014 Tesla's losses were mounting last summer, massive debt payments were looming, and both Wall Street and federal regulators had run out of patience with the erratic behavior of CEO Elon Musk. </p><p> One year ago this week, shares plunged 14% after Tesla posted another quarterly loss, this one for $408 million, wiping out about $6 billion of the company's worth.  Since then the stock has blasted off like at rocket at SpaceX, another Musk-led company. Tesla's market value today is three times that of Ford, General Motors and FiatChrysler, combined. A single share of Tesla now goes for $1,600, a seven-fold increase from a year ago, making it one of the most expensive publicly traded shares in the world.  'Things just turned on a dime,' said CFRA Analyst Garrett Nelson. 'It's just been one positive announcement after another.' In the past year, the electric car and solar panel maker successfully opened a factory in China, introduced the Model Y electric SUV, made debt payments and it's posted profits for three straight quarters. Musk toned down the posts on Twitter that had cost him and the company $40 million in penalties from U.S. securities regulators. A day before the company posts quarterly results one year removed from that week in 2019, industry analysts have begun to question if Tesla is running too hot. Analysts polled by FactSet expect a $228 million net loss from April through June. Only one analyst has a 12-month stock price target above the current value.  Tesla's stock surge has enriched Musk, boosting his net worth to an estimated $73.5 billion. He passed Warren Buffett, the Sage of Omaha, on the Forbes Billionaires list. And Musk could be headed for another big payday soon under his ambitious Tesla compensation package. In total, Musk and other Tesla shareholders have made about $240 billion since March 18, the low point for the stock price this year. (Ad) Trump's 5G plan is opening the flood gates to 3 million new jobs, $12.3 trillion in economic growth, and a brand new 5G device. One of the world's top angel investors - a tech genius named Jeff Brown believes the company behind this device is the Number One Tech Stock of 202, and it will go from $0 to nearly $100 billion in sales - this year. With second-quarter sales of Tesla vehicles outpacing the first despite a global pandemic, shares could jump again if Tesla surprises with its fourth consecutive profitable quarter. That would likely check all the boxes and could lead to Tesla's admission into the club of corporate giants: The S&amp;#38;P 500 stock index. But it may be a Cinderella story. CFRA's Nelson says shares have outpaced Tesla's fundamental performance, and he's telling clients to sell. He placed a price target at about two-thirds the current value of shares.  In an interview, Nelson said April-to-June registrations of Tesla vehicles fell by nearly half in California, the company's biggest market. That's an indication of waning demand for its vehicles, which start at $37,990 for a base Model 3 that can easily hit $60,000 with options. Tesla also cut the price of its long-range Model Y by $3,000, which Nelson sees as a red flag. And the company is about to engage in a bout of heavy spending with new factories going up in Germany and the U.S.  There are also market factors that have flung share prices beyond what would be considered a rational trajectory, Nelson said.  Short sellers that perceived flaws at Tesla have since been buying shares to cover massive losses as the stock price leapt, Nelson said. Short-sellers now account for only 7.5% of Tesla's outstanding stock, down from over 23% a year ago, he said. Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas has a $740 price target on Tesla, telling investors in a note that the market has given the company too much of a share of future electric vehicle and connected car revenue.  The valuation of Tesla shares has entered the orbit of Apple and Amazon, which took off after hitting $300 billion in market value like Tesla did last week, Jonas wrote. But Tesla's revenue and pretax earnings are far smaller than either tech company when they reached the $300 billion mark, he told investors. Those who buy Tesla at around $1,500 per share have to believe that long-term U.S.-China trade relations will remain stable, older automakers will fail to make competitive electric vehicles, and big tech companies such as Google, Amazon and Apple won't be successful in developing electric vehicle systems, he wrote.  Jonas. who is uneasy about deteriorating relations between the world's two biggest economies, says traditional automakers are ready to spend over $400 billion on electric vehicles in the next five years, and he expects tech companies to enter the transportation business. The dizzying run-up in Tesla's stock has positioned Musk for a lucrative payday just a few months after the Palo Alto, California, company awarded him a stock package worth more than $700 million.  That marked the first windfall in an incentive-laden deal that Tesla's board worked out two years ago to inspire Musk to build a company that eventually generates $175 billion in revenue, and is valued at $650 billion. Tesla's market value during the past six months has averaged $149 billion, according to data compiled Monday by FactSet Research. That's just a $1 billion below the next hurdle that needs to be cleared for Musk to receive 1.69 million stock options valued at $350.02, or nearly 80% below Monday's closing price of $1,643. The huge gap would make those stock options worth $2.2 billion on paper, although Musk wouldn't be able to sell the shares for five years. Musk qualified for his first batch of 1.69 billion stock options in early May after Tesla's market value averaged $100 billion for a six-month period. The company also reached revenue and adjusted earnings goals needed for Musk to receive the first of 12 potential awards that could be worth tens of billions of dollars. ____ AP Business Writer Alex Veiga contributed from Los Angeles.

Companies Mentioned in This Article The Next 5 Retailers on the Edge of Bankruptcy[1]Through no fault of theirs, the novel coronavirus has put some retailers on the edge of bankruptcy. And as you've seen, many have fallen over that edge including iconic names like Nieman Marcus, J.C. Penney and J.Crew. In fact, according to the American Bankruptcy Institute, there were 560 commercial Chapter 11 filings in April. That was a 26% increase over last year. And executive director, Amy Quakenboss, suggests that there are more to come. 'As financial challenges continue to escalate amid this crisis,' observes Quakenboss, 'bankruptcy is sure to offer a financial safe harbor from the economic storm.' With no revenue walking through the door, many retailers are seeing a semblance of revenue from e-commerce sales. But for some retailers, the shutdown is more impactful because they didn't have a strong e-commerce structure. That means that they rely more than others on brick-and-mortar sales. The real question now is will there really be the pent-up demand that some analysts still swear is just waiting to be unleashed. It may indeed exist. Time will tell. But time is not a commodity many of these retailers have. And we've identified five retailers for which the clock is not in their favor.

The electric car and solar panel maker has successfully opened a factory in China, introduced the Model Y electric SUV, made debt payments and posted profits for three straight quarters. Musk has also toned down his inflammatory posts on Twitter that had cost him and the company $40 million in penalties from U.S. securities regulators.</p><p>Today, Tesla's market value is three times that of Ford, General Motors and FiatChrysler, combined. A single share of Tesla now goes for nearly $1,600 \u2014 a seven-fold increase from a year ago \u2014 making it one of the most expensive publicly traded shares in the world.</p><p>\u201cThings just turned on a dime,\u201d said Garrett Nelson, an analyst at CFRA who specializes in the automotive industry. \u201cIt\u2019s just been one positive announcement after another.\u201d</p><p>The dizzying performance on Tuesday qualified Musk for his second huge payday in less than three months, this one worth more than $2 billion. His net worth has soared to an estimated $72 billion, just behind Warren Buffett on the Forbes Billionaires list after passing the famed investor earlier this month. In total, Musk and other Tesla shareholders have made about $240 billion since March 18 when the stock stood at $361 \u2014 its low point for this year.</p><p>With second-quarter sales of Tesla vehicles outpacing the first despite a global pandemic, shares could jump again if Tesla surprises on Wednesday with a fourth consecutive profitable quarter. That could lead to Tesla\u2019s admission into the club of corporate giants: the S&amp;P 500 stock index.</p><p>But analysts have begun to question if the shares are running too hot. Analysts polled by FactSet expect a $228 million net loss from April through June. Only one analyst has a 12-month stock price target above the current value. A message was left Tuesday seeking comment from Tesla.</p><p>Nelson says shares have outpaced Tesla's fundamental performance, and he's telling clients to sell. He placed a price target at about two-thirds the current value of shares.</p><p>In an interview, Nelson said April-to-June registrations of Tesla vehicles fell by nearly half in California, the company's biggest U.S. market. That's an indication of waning demand for its vehicles, which start at $37,990 for a base Model 3 but the car can easily hit $60,000 with options.</p><p>Tesla also cut the price of its long-range Model Y by $3,000, which Nelson sees as a red flag. And the company is about to engage in a bout of heavy spending with new factories going up in Germany and the U.S.</p><p>There are also market factors that have flung share prices far higher, Nelson said.</p><p>Short sellers who perceived flaws at Tesla have since been buying shares to cover massive losses as the stock price leaped, Nelson said. Short-sellers now account for only 7.5% of Tesla's outstanding stock, down from over 23% a year ago, he said.</p><p>Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas has a $740 price target on Tesla, arguing that the market overestimates the company's share of future electric vehicle and connected car revenue.</p><p>Investors are treating Tesla like tech stocks Apple and Amazon, which took off years ago after hitting $300 billion in market value, Jonas wrote in an investor note. Tesla hit that mark last week, but its revenue and pretax earnings are far smaller than either tech company when they reached the $300 billion valuation, he wrote.</p><p>Those who buy Tesla at around $1,500 per share have to believe that long-term U.S.-China trade relations will remain stable, older automakers will fail to make competitive electric vehicles, and big tech companies such as Google, Amazon and Apple won't be successful in developing electric vehicle systems, he wrote.</p><p>Jonas, who is uneasy about deteriorating relations between the world's two biggest economies, says traditional automakers are ready to spend over $400 billion on electric vehicles in the next five years, and he expects tech companies to enter the transportation business.</p><p>In the meantime, Musk is sitting pretty. The run-up in Tesla\u2019s stock positioned him for a big payday after the Palo Alto, California, company awarded him a stock package worth more than $700 million in May.</p><p>That compensation is part of an incentive-laden deal that Tesla\u2019s board worked out two years ago to inspire Musk to build a company that eventually generates $175 billion in revenue, and is valued at $650 billion.</p><p>Musk cleared another hurdle Tuesday when Tesla's market value averaged $150 billion for a six-month stretch, according to data compiled by FactSet Research. Hitting that threshold means Musk is in line to receive 1.69 million stock options valued at $350.02, or nearly 80% below Tuesday's closing price of $1,568.36.</p><p>The huge gap would make those stock options worth $2.06 billion on paper, although Musk can't sell the shares for at least five years.</p><p>____</p><p>AP Business Writer Alex Veiga contributed from Los Angeles.

One year ago this week, shares plunged 14% after Tesla posted another quarterly loss, this one for $408 million, wiping out about $6 billion of the company's worth.   Since then the stock has blasted off like at rocket at SpaceX, another Musk-led company. Tesla's market value today is three times that of Ford, General Motors and FiatChrysler, combined. A single share of Tesla now goes for $1,600, a seven-fold increase from a year ago, making it one of the most expensive publicly traded shares in the world.   \u201cThings just turned on a dime,\u201d said CFRA Analyst Garrett Nelson. \u201cIt's just been one positive announcement after another.\u201d   In the past year, the electric car and solar panel maker successfully opened a factory in China, introduced the Model Y electric SUV, made debt payments and it's posted profits for three straight quarters. Musk toned down the posts on Twitter that had cost him and the company $40 million in penalties from U.S. securities regulators.   A day before the company posts quarterly results one year removed from that week in 2019, industry analysts have begun to question if Tesla is running too hot. Analysts polled by FactSet expect a $228 million net loss from April through June. Only one analyst has a 12-month stock price target above the current value.   Tesla's stock surge has enriched Musk, boosting his net worth to an estimated $73.5 billion. He passed Warren Buffett, the Sage of Omaha, on the Forbes Billionaires list. And Musk could be headed for another big payday soon under his ambitious Tesla compensation package. In total, Musk and other Tesla shareholders have made about $240 billion since March 18, the low point for the stock price this year.   With second-quarter sales of Tesla vehicles outpacing the first despite a global pandemic, shares could jump again if Tesla surprises with its fourth consecutive profitable quarter. That would likely check all the boxes and could lead to Tesla's admission into the club of corporate giants: The S&amp;P 500 stock index.   But it may be a Cinderella story.   CFRA's Nelson says shares have outpaced Tesla's fundamental performance, and he's telling clients to sell. He placed a price target at about two-thirds the current value of shares.   In an interview, Nelson said April-to-June registrations of Tesla vehicles fell by nearly half in California, the company's biggest market. That's an indication of waning demand for its vehicles, which start at $37,990 for a base Model 3 that can easily hit $60,000 with options.   Tesla also cut the price of its long-range Model Y by $3,000, which Nelson sees as a red flag. And the company is about to engage in a bout of heavy spending with new factories going up in Germany and the U.S.   There are also market factors that have flung share prices beyond what would be considered a rational trajectory, Nelson said.   Short sellers that perceived flaws at Tesla have since been buying shares to cover massive losses as the stock price leapt, Nelson said. Short-sellers now account for only 7.5% of Tesla's outstanding stock, down from over 23% a year ago, he said.   Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas has a $740 price target on Tesla, telling investors in a note that the market has given the company too much of a share of future electric vehicle and connected car revenue.   The valuation of Tesla shares has entered the orbit of Apple and Amazon, which took off after hitting $300 billion in market value like Tesla did last week, Jonas wrote. But Tesla's revenue and pretax earnings are far smaller than either tech company when they reached the $300 billion mark, he told investors.   Those who buy Tesla at around $1,500 per share have to believe that long-term U.S.-China trade relations will remain stable, older automakers will fail to make competitive electric vehicles, and big tech companies such as Google, Amazon and Apple won't be successful in developing electric vehicle systems, he wrote.   Jonas. who is uneasy about deteriorating relations between the world's two biggest economies, says traditional automakers are ready to spend over $400 billion on electric vehicles in the next five years, and he expects tech companies to enter the transportation business.   The dizzying run-up in Tesla\u2019s stock has positioned Musk for a lucrative payday just a few months after the Palo Alto, California, company awarded him a stock package worth more than $700 million.   That marked the first windfall in an incentive-laden deal that Tesla\u2019s board worked out two years ago to inspire Musk to build a company that eventually generates $175 billion in revenue, and is valued at $650 billion.   Tesla\u2019s market value during the past six months has averaged $149 billion, according to data compiled Monday by FactSet Research. That\u2019s just a $1 billion below the next hurdle that needs to be cleared for Musk to receive 1.69 million stock options valued at $350.02, or nearly 80% below Monday\u2019s closing price of $1,643.   The huge gap would make those stock options worth $2.2 billion on paper, although Musk wouldn\u2019t be able to sell the shares for five years.   Musk qualified for his first batch of 1.69 billion stock options in early May after Tesla\u2019s market value averaged $100 billion for a six-month period. The company also reached revenue and adjusted earnings goals needed for Musk to receive the first of 12 potential awards that could be worth tens of billions of dollars.   ____   AP Business Writer Alex Veiga contributed from Los Angeles.

One year ago this week, shares plunged 14% after Tesla posted another quarterly loss, this one for $408 million, wiping out about $6 billion of the company's worth.      Since then the stock has blasted off like a rocket at SpaceX, another Musk-led company. The electric car and solar panel maker has successfully opened a factory in China, introduced the Model Y electric SUV, made debt payments and posted profits for three straight quarters. Musk has also toned down his inflammatory posts on Twitter that had cost him and the company $40 million in penalties from U.S. securities regulators.      Today, Tesla's market value is three times that of Ford, General Motors and FiatChrysler, combined. A single share of Tesla now goes for nearly $1,600 \u2014 a seven-fold increase from a year ago \u2014 making it one of the most expensive publicly traded shares in the world.      \u201cThings just turned on a dime,\u201d said Garrett Nelson, an analyst at CFRA who specializes in the automotive industry. \u201cIt\u2019s just been one positive announcement after another.\u201d      The dizzying performance on Tuesday qualified Musk for his second huge payday in less than three months, this one worth more than $2 billion. His net worth has soared to an estimated $72 billion, just behind Warren Buffett on the Forbes Billionaires list after passing the famed investor earlier this month. In total, Musk and other Tesla shareholders have made about $240 billion since March 18 when the stock stood at $361 \u2014 its low point for this year.     With second-quarter sales of Tesla vehicles outpacing the first despite a global pandemic, shares could jump again if Tesla surprises on Wednesday with a fourth consecutive profitable quarter. That could lead to Tesla\u2019s admission into the club of corporate giants: the S&amp;P 500 stock index.      But analysts have begun to question if the shares are running too hot. Analysts polled by FactSet expect a $228 million net loss from April through June. Only one analyst has a 12-month stock price target above the current value. A message was left Tuesday seeking comment from Tesla.      Nelson says shares have outpaced Tesla's fundamental performance, and he's telling clients to sell. He placed a price target at about two-thirds the current value of shares.      In an interview, Nelson said April-to-June registrations of Tesla vehicles fell by nearly half in California, the company's biggest U.S. market. That's an indication of waning demand for its vehicles, which start at $37,990 for a base Model 3 but the car can easily hit $60,000 with options.      Tesla also cut the price of its long-range Model Y by $3,000, which Nelson sees as a red flag. And the company is about to engage in a bout of heavy spending with new factories going up in Germany and the U.S.     There are also market factors that have flung share prices far higher, Nelson said.      Short sellers who perceived flaws at Tesla have since been buying shares to cover massive losses as the stock price leaped, Nelson said. Short-sellers now account for only 7.5% of Tesla's outstanding stock, down from over 23% a year ago, he said.      Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas has a $740 price target on Tesla, arguing that the market overestimates the company's share of future electric vehicle and connected car revenue.      Investors are treating Tesla like tech stocks Apple and Amazon, which took off years ago after hitting $300 billion in market value, Jonas wrote in an investor note. Tesla hit that mark last week, but its revenue and pretax earnings are far smaller than either tech company when they reached the $300 billion valuation, he wrote.      Those who buy Tesla at around $1,500 per share have to believe that long-term U.S.-China trade relations will remain stable, older automakers will fail to make competitive electric vehicles, and big tech companies such as Google, Amazon and Apple won't be successful in developing electric vehicle systems, he wrote.      Jonas, who is uneasy about deteriorating relations between the world's two biggest economies, says traditional automakers are ready to spend over $400 billion on electric vehicles in the next five years, and he expects tech companies to enter the transportation business.      In the meantime, Musk is sitting pretty. The run-up in Tesla\u2019s stock positioned him for a big payday after the Palo Alto, California, company awarded him a stock package worth more than $700 million in May.

A single share of Tesla now goes for nearly $1,600 - a seven-fold increase from a year ago - making it one of the most expensive publicly traded shares in the world. Tesla\u2019s losses were mounting last summer, massive debt payments were looming, and both Wall Street and federal regulators had run out of patience with the erratic behavior of CEO Elon Musk.   One year ago this week, shares plunged 14% after Tesla posted another quarterly loss, this one for $408 million, wiping out about $6 billion of the company\u2019s worth.   Since then the stock has blasted off like a rocket at SpaceX, another Musk-led company. The electric car and solar panel maker has successfully opened a factory in China, introduced the Model Y electric SUV, made debt payments and posted profits for three straight quarters. Musk has also toned down his inflammatory posts on Twitter that had cost him and the company $40 million in penalties from U.S. securities regulators.   Today, Tesla\u2019s market value is three times that of Ford, General Motors and FiatChrysler, combined. A single share of Tesla now goes for nearly $1,600 - a seven-fold increase from a year ago - making it one of the most expensive publicly traded shares in the world.   \"Things just turned on a dime,\u201d said Garrett Nelson, an analyst at CFRA who specializes in the automotive industry. \u201cIt\u2019s just been one positive announcement after another.\u201d   The dizzying performance on Tuesday qualified Musk for his second huge payday in less than three months, this one worth more than $2 billion. His net worth has soared to an estimated $72 billion, just behind Warren Buffett on the Forbes Billionaires list after passing the famed investor earlier this month. In total, Musk and other Tesla shareholders have made about $240 billion since March 18 when the stock stood at $361 - its low point for this year.   With second-quarter sales of Tesla vehicles outpacing the first despite a global pandemic, shares could jump again if Tesla surprises on Wednesday with a fourth consecutive profitable quarter. That could lead to Tesla\u2019s admission into the club of corporate giants- the S&amp;P 500 stock index.   But analysts have begun to question if the shares are running too hot. Analysts polled by FactSet expect a $228 million net loss from April through June. Only one analyst has a 12-month stock price target above the current value. A message was left Tuesday seeking comment from Tesla.   Nelson says shares have outpaced Tesla\u2019s fundamental performance, and he\u2019s telling clients to sell. He placed a price target at about two-thirds the current value of shares.   In an interview, Nelson said April-to-June registrations of Tesla vehicles fell by nearly half in California, the company\u2019s biggest U.S. market. That\u2019s an indication of waning demand for its vehicles, which start at $37,990 for a base Model 3 but the car can easily hit $60,000 with options.   Tesla also cut the price of its long-range Model Y by $3,000, which Nelson sees as a red flag. And the company is about to engage in a bout of heavy spending with new factories going up in Germany and the U.S.   There are also market factors that have flung share prices far higher, Nelson said.   Short sellers who perceived flaws at Tesla have since been buying shares to cover massive losses as the stock price leaped, Nelson said. Short-sellers now account for only 7.5% of Tesla\u2019s outstanding stock, down from over 23% a year ago, he said.   Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas has a $740 price target on Tesla, arguing that the market overestimates the company\u2019s share of future electric vehicle and connected car revenue.   Investors are treating Tesla like tech stocks Apple and Amazon, which took off years ago after hitting $300 billion in market value, Jonas wrote in an investor note. Tesla hit that mark last week, but its revenue and pretax earnings are far smaller than either tech company when they reached the $300 billion valuation, he wrote.   Those who buy Tesla at around $1,500 per share have to believe that long-term U.S.-China trade relations will remain stable, older automakers will fail to make competitive electric vehicles, and big tech companies such as Google, Amazon and Apple won\u2019t be successful in developing electric vehicle systems, he wrote.   Jonas, who is uneasy about deteriorating relations between the world\u2019s two biggest economies, says traditional automakers are ready to spend over $400 billion on electric vehicles in the next five years, and he expects tech companies to enter the transportation business.   In the meantime, Musk is sitting pretty. The run-up in Tesla\u2019s stock positioned him for a big payday after the Palo Alto, California, company awarded him a stock package worth more than $700 million in May.   That compensation is part of an incentive-laden deal that Tesla\u2019s board worked out two years ago to inspire Musk to build a company that eventually generates $175 billion in revenue, and is valued at $650 billion.   Musk cleared another hurdle Tuesday when Tesla\u2019s market value averaged $150 billion for a six-month stretch, according to data compiled by FactSet Research. Hitting that threshold means Musk is in line to receive 1.69 million stock options valued at $350.02, or nearly 80% below Tuesday\u2019s closing price of $1,568.36.   The huge gap would make those stock options worth $2.06 billion on paper, although Musk can\u2019t sell the shares for at least five years.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42654877722</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60DJ-BM61-F07F-842C-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"965\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>The Hindu</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 22, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC000CFF3</classCode><className>GENERAL MOTORS CO</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC0002J45</classCode><className>FORD MOTOR CO</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC0002R1H</classCode><className>FIAT CHRYSLER AUTOMOBILES NV</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS336112 LIGHT TRUCK &amp;

One year ago this week, shares plunged 14% after Tesla posted another quarterly loss, this one for $408 million, wiping out about $6 billion of the company's worth.    Since then the stock has blasted off like at rocket at SpaceX, another Musk-led company. Tesla's market value today is three times that of Ford, General Motors and FiatChrysler, combined. A single share of Tesla now goes for $1,600, a seven-fold increase from a year ago, making it one of the most expensive publicly traded shares in the world.    \"Things just turned on a dime,\" said CFRA Analyst Garrett Nelson. \"It's just been one positive announcement after another.\"    In the past year, the electric car and solar panel maker successfully opened a factory in China, introduced the Model Y electric SUV, made debt payments and it's posted profits for three straight quarters. Musk toned down the posts on Twitter that had cost him and the company $40 million in penalties from U.S. securities regulators.    A day before the company posts quarterly results one year removed from that week in 2019, industry analysts have begun to question if Tesla is running too hot. Analysts polled by FactSet expect a $228 million net loss from April through June. Only one analyst has a 12-month stock price target above the current value.    Tesla's stock surge has enriched Musk, boosting his net worth to an estimated $73.5 billion. He passed Warren Buffett, the Sage of Omaha, on the Forbes Billionaires list. And Musk could be headed for another big payday soon under his ambitious Tesla compensation package. In total, Musk and other Tesla shareholders have made about $240 billion since March 18, the low point for the stock price this year.    With second-quarter sales of Tesla vehicles outpacing the first despite a global pandemic, shares could jump again if Tesla surprises with its fourth consecutive profitable quarter. That would likely check all the boxes and could lead to Tesla's admission into the club of corporate giants: The S&amp;P 500 stock index.    But it may be a Cinderella story.    CFRA's Nelson says shares have outpaced Tesla's fundamental performance, and he's telling clients to sell. He placed a price target at about two-thirds the current value of shares.    In an interview, Nelson said April-to-June registrations of Tesla vehicles fell by nearly half in California, the company's biggest market. That's an indication of waning demand for its vehicles, which start at $37,990 for a base Model 3 that can easily hit $60,000 with options.    Tesla also cut the price of its long-range Model Y by $3,000, which Nelson sees as a red flag. And the company is about to engage in a bout of heavy spending with new factories going up in Germany and the U.S.    There are also market factors that have flung share prices beyond what would be considered a rational trajectory, Nelson said.    Short sellers that perceived flaws at Tesla have since been buying shares to cover massive losses as the stock price leapt, Nelson said. Short-sellers now account for only 7.5% of Tesla's outstanding stock, down from over 23% a year ago, he said.    Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas has a $740 price target on Tesla, telling investors in a note that the market has given the company too much of a share of future electric vehicle and connected car revenue.    The valuation of Tesla shares has entered the orbit of Apple and Amazon, which took off after hitting $300 billion in market value like Tesla did last week, Jonas wrote. But Tesla's revenue and pretax earnings are far smaller than either tech company when they reached the $300 billion mark, he told investors.    Those who buy Tesla at around $1,500 per share have to believe that long-term U.S.-China trade relations will remain stable, older automakers will fail to make competitive electric vehicles, and big tech companies such as Google, Amazon and Apple won't be successful in developing electric vehicle systems, he wrote.    Jonas. who is uneasy about deteriorating relations between the world's two biggest economies, says traditional automakers are ready to spend over $400 billion on electric vehicles in the next five years, and he expects tech companies to enter the transportation business.    The dizzying run-up in Tesla's stock has positioned Musk for a lucrative payday just a few months after the Palo Alto, California, company awarded him a stock package worth more than $700 million.    That marked the first windfall in an incentive-laden deal that Tesla's board worked out two years ago to inspire Musk to build a company that eventually generates $175 billion in revenue, and is valued at $650 billion.    Tesla's market value during the past six months has averaged $149 billion, according to data compiled Monday by FactSet Research. That's just a $1 billion below the next hurdle that needs to be cleared for Musk to receive 1.69 million stock options valued at $350.02, or nearly 80% below Monday's closing price of $1,643.    The huge gap would make those stock options worth $2.2 billion on paper, although Musk wouldn't be able to sell the shares for five years.    Musk qualified for his first batch of 1.69 billion stock options in early May after Tesla's market value averaged $100 billion for a six-month period. The company also reached revenue and adjusted earnings goals needed for Musk to receive the first of 12 potential awards that could be worth tens of billions of dollars.

At the same time, the company declined to identify what those sources are.</p><p>\"Tesla is committed to ensuring all supply chain practices are safe and humane, that workers are treated with respect and dignity, and that manufacturing processes are environmentally responsible,\" according to a statement from the company.</p><p>Samsung, LG Chem and other consumer companies likewise reliant on lithium-ion batteries have issued similar assurances.</p><p>Yet The Post investigation showed that large consumer companies may not know where the raw materials come from. The paths that cobalt, graphite, lithium and other materials take from mines to batteries involve multiple stops, and tracking batteries to their origins can be a logistical maze.</p><p>Some nonprofit organizations trying to correct abuses in the global supply chain say they believe that few companies take the care required to trace their raw materials back to their source, let alone correct any abuses they would find there.</p><p>\"Most consumers have an expectation that their products are sourced responsibly,\" said Patricia Jurewicz, director of the Responsible Sourcing Network, a group that seeks to correct human rights abuses in the way raw materials are harvested and mined. But \"it's like we are walking around with our hands over our eyes.\"</p><p>\"All the brands we know are so far removed from the abuse,\" Jurewicz said. \"They don't buy raw materials. They don't even buy processed materials in the form of metals. There may be anywhere from three to seven tiers of suppliers and sub-suppliers.\"</p><p>While the abuses in the production of raw materials span many industries - from food to textiles to high tech - the anticipated growth in the electric-vehicle industry means the demand for the materials for lithium-ion batteries may be especially acute.  </p><p>While many consumers may assume their products emerge from companies that treat workers and the environment well, there are few legal requirements for companies to track their supply chains.</p><p>The best known effort to regulate mining is the U.S. law regarding four \"conflict minerals\" from the Congo region: tin, tungsten, tantalum and gold. The 2010 legislation, known as the Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, aimed to stem the flow of money from those materials to Congo's militias and requires U.S. companies to attempt to trace the sources of these materials.</p><p>But other minerals are not part of those requirements, leaving consumers to rely on company assurances that their supply chains are managed in a way that protects workers and the environment.</p><p>It is difficult, and in most cases impossible, to know whether major brands in the United States are fulfilling their promises.</p><p>As an example, The Post traced ways that disputed raw materials are reaching or could be reaching Panasonic, the company that supplies batteries for Tesla.</p><p>Graphite from polluting Chinese factories is sold to BTR, a Chinese company, that supplies Panasonic. Panasonic said it found and corrected a problem in its graphite supply chain.</p><p>Lithium from Sales de Jujuy, a mining company in Argentina that some indigenous communities say has acted unfairly, was anticipated to be sold to Panasonic, according to a news release from the operators.</p><p>Cobalt from Zhejiang Huayou, a Chinese company accused of buying cobalt mined under harsh conditions in Congo, is shipped to Taiwan, according to the news accounts. In Taiwan, a company called Coremax was a supplier of Sumitomo in the past decade, according to company documents, and Japan-based Sumitomo supplies Panasonic.</p><p>In each case, Tesla denied that the products from those companies reached their batteries.</p><p>So if not from those companies, where does Tesla gets its graphite, cobalt and lithium? Tesla declined to identify sources. </p><p>As evidence of its concern that suppliers operate cleanly, Tesla officials note that the core of its mission involves improving the environment and that it has taken steps to make sure that the inputs to its forthcoming battery \"Gigafactory\" in Nevada will be clean. It will be powered in part by solar energy, they say, and the project will allow it to select and purchase its own raw materials rather than relying on battery suppliers to make those decisions.</p><p>\"Tesla performs on-site visits and audits to the best of our ability during the sourcing and vetting process for suppliers,\" the company said. \"All of our contracts require suppliers to adhere to our human rights policy and environmental and safety requirements.\" </p><p>The company sometimes finds it difficult to make on-site visits, however. In March, the company said it would be sending personnel to Congo, where cobalt is mined. As of September, it had not done so.</p><p>A few companies, meanwhile, have begun to respond to pressure for more disclosure, and some industry groups have initiated efforts to promote industry standards for the sourcing of cobalt. Apple annually publishes a list of its top suppliers, a rare move in an industry that prefers to keep supply details secret. And Umicore, a major supplier of battery parts, has hired the accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers, to judge whether it has adhered to its standards for making sure its cobalt is sourced responsibly.</p><p>But these efforts are the exception within the many industries reliant on lithium-ion batteries.</p><p>\"It's important for companies to demonstrate what they're doing and go beyond a mere verbal commitment,\" Jurewicz said. \"Companies that do anything beyond what is required by the [Dodd-Frank] law are few and far between.\"</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:peter.whoriskey@washpost.com\">peter.whoriskey@washpost.com</email></p><p>Ana Swanson contributed to this report.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPCOM-fff78334ce0d11e6a747d03044780a02</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPCOM2016</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5MHR-DTJ1-DYX1-H0C4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">265544</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-08-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1201\"/><timeReceived>11:03 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2016 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washingtonpost.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"33547\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"31\" month=\"12\" year=\"2016\"><dateText>December 31, 2016 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC000CA0B</classCode><className>TESLA MOTORS INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC00086Y6</classCode><className>LG CHEM LTD</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>TSLA (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><className>LGCD (LSE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><className>051910 (KSE)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Banking Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QjQyMUFCOUJBNURBNEFDREE3MTNCNDk5QkQ4NUM3RjI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Regulatory Conversion</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OUExQjU3NThFNDA2NDJENzlEMjc4MDc3MzU1Mjk3NDk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MEYzNTBDMDYwNTkyNDUyODlGQTJEMEQyMTZDOEE0MkY</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

The U.S. government and many environmentalists also view electric vehicles as key to combating climate change.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But the electric-vehicles revolution Musk and others envision depends on an immense escalation in the world's capacity to manufacture lithium-ion batteries, and the race for the raw materials to build those batteries is creating strains for people and the environment far from Silicon Valley, a Washington Post investigation has found.</p><p>The series of Post stories found that the manufacture of lithium-ion batteries - the power source for smartphones, laptops and electric cars - is linked to child labor in cobalt mines in Congo, severe air and water pollution around graphite plants in China and complaints of mistreatment of indigenous communities near lithium deposits in South America.</p><p>The mining companies tied to these problems supply some of the largest manufacturers of lithium-ion batteries, The Post found. And some of those battery makers directly supply Tesla and other big tech giants.</p><p>In response to these concerns, Tesla denied that the sources of its battery materials are tainted by abuses. At the same time, the company declined to identify what those sources are.</p><p>\"Tesla is committed to ensuring all supply chain practices are safe and humane, that workers are treated with respect and dignity, and that manufacturing processes are environmentally responsible,\" according to a statement from the company.</p><p>Samsung, LG Chem and other consumer companies likewise reliant on lithium-ion batteries have issued similar assurances.</p><p>Yet The Post investigation showed that large consumer companies may not know where the raw materials come from. The paths that cobalt, graphite, lithium and other materials take from mines to batteries involve multiple stops, and tracking batteries to their origins can be a logistical maze.</p><p>Some nonprofit organizations trying to correct abuses in the global supply chain say they believe that few companies take the care required to trace their raw materials back to their source, let alone correct any abuses they would find there.</p><p>\"Most consumers have an expectation that their products are sourced responsibly,\" said Patricia Jurewicz, director of the Responsible Sourcing Network, a group that seeks to correct human rights abuses in the way raw materials are harvested and mined. But \"it's like we are walking around with our hands over our eyes.\"</p><p>\"All the brands we know are so far removed from the abuse,\" Jurewicz said. \"They don't buy raw materials. They don't even buy processed materials in the form of metals. There may be anywhere from three to seven tiers of suppliers and sub-suppliers.\"</p><p>While the abuses in the production of raw materials span many industries - from food to textiles to high tech - the anticipated growth in the electric-vehicle industry means the demand for the materials for lithium-ion batteries may be especially acute. The demand for raw materials for lithium-ion batteries is expected to more than triple over the next 10 years, according to some industry analysts. </p><p>While many consumers may assume their products emerge from companies that treat workers and the environment well, there are few legal requirements for companies to track their supply chains.</p><p>The best known effort to regulate mining is the U.S. law regarding four \"conflict minerals\" from the Congo region: tin, tungsten, tantalum and gold.

The U.S. government and many environmentalists also view electric vehicles as key to combating climate change.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But the electric-vehicles revolution Musk and others envision depends on an immense escalation in the world's capacity to manufacture lithium-ion batteries, and the race for the raw materials to build those batteries is creating strains for people and the environment far from Silicon Valley, a Washington Post investigation has found.</p><p>The series of Post stories found that the manufacture of lithium-ion batteries - the power source for smartphones, laptops and electric cars - is linked to child labor in cobalt mines in Congo, severe air and water pollution around graphite plants in China and complaints of mistreatment of indigenous communities near lithium deposits in South America.</p><p>The mining companies tied to these problems supply some of the largest manufacturers of lithium-ion batteries, The Post found. And some of those battery makers directly supply Tesla and other big tech giants.</p><p>In response to these concerns, Tesla denied that the sources of its battery materials are tainted by abuses. At the same time, the company declined to identify what those sources are.</p><p>\"Tesla is committed to ensuring all supply chain practices are safe and humane, that workers are treated with respect and dignity, and that manufacturing processes are environmentally responsible,\" according to a statement from the company.</p><p>Samsung, LG Chem and other consumer companies likewise reliant on lithium-ion batteries have issued similar assurances.</p><p>Yet The Post investigation showed that large consumer companies may not know where the raw materials come from. The paths that cobalt, graphite, lithium and other materials take from mines to batteries involve multiple stops, and tracking batteries to their origins can be a logistical maze.</p><p>Some nonprofit organizations trying to correct abuses in the global supply chain say they believe that few companies take the care required to trace their raw materials back to their source, let alone correct any abuses they would find there.</p><p>\"Most consumers have an expectation that their products are sourced responsibly,\" said Patricia Jurewicz, director of the Responsible Sourcing Network, a group that seeks to correct human rights abuses in the way raw materials are harvested and mined. But \"it's like we are walking around with our hands over our eyes.\"</p><p>\"All the brands we know are so far removed from the abuse,\" Jurewicz said. \"They don't buy raw materials. They don't even buy processed materials in the form of metals. There may be anywhere from three to seven tiers of suppliers and sub-suppliers.\"</p><p>While the abuses in the production of raw materials span many industries - from food to textiles to high tech - the anticipated growth in the electric-vehicle industry means the demand for the materials for lithium-ion batteries may be especially acute. The demand for raw materials for lithium-ion batteries is expected to more than triple over the next 10 years, according to some industry analysts.</p><p>While many consumers may assume their products emerge from companies that treat workers and the environment well, there are few legal requirements for companies to track their supply chains.</p><p>The best known effort to regulate mining is the U.S. law regarding four \"conflict minerals\" from the Congo region: tin, tungsten, tantalum and gold. The 2010 legislation, known as the Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, aimed to stem the flow of money from those materials to Congo's militias and requires U.S. companies to attempt to trace the sources of these materials.</p><p>But other minerals are not part of those requirements, leaving consumers to rely on company assurances that their supply chains are managed in a way that protects workers and the environment.</p><p>It is difficult, and in most cases impossible, to know whether major brands in the United States are fulfilling their promises.</p><p>As an example, The Post traced ways that disputed raw materials are reaching or could be reaching Panasonic, the company that supplies batteries for Tesla.</p><p>Graphite from polluting Chinese factories is sold to BTR, a Chinese company, that supplies Panasonic. Panasonic said it found and corrected a problem in its graphite supply chain.</p><p>Lithium from Sales de Jujuy, a mining company in Argentina that some indigenous communities say has acted unfairly, was anticipated to be sold to Panasonic, according to a news release from the operators.</p><p>Cobalt from Zhejiang Huayou, a Chinese company accused of buying cobalt mined under harsh conditions in Congo, is shipped to Taiwan, according to the news accounts. In Taiwan, a company called Coremax was a supplier of Sumitomo in the past decade, according to company documents, and Japan-based Sumitomo supplies Panasonic.</p><p>In each case, Tesla denied that the products from those companies reached their batteries.</p><p>So if not from those companies, where does Tesla gets its graphite, cobalt and lithium? Tesla declined to identify sources. </p><p>As evidence of its concern that suppliers operate cleanly, Tesla officials note that the core of its mission involves improving the environment and that it has taken steps to make sure that the inputs to its forthcoming battery \"Gigafactory\" in Nevada will be clean. It will be powered in part by solar energy, they say, and the project will allow it to select and purchase its own raw materials rather than relying on battery suppliers to make those decisions.</p><p>\"Tesla performs on-site visits and audits to the best of our ability during the sourcing and vetting process for suppliers,\" the company said. \"All of our contracts require suppliers to adhere to our human rights policy and environmental and safety requirements.\" </p><p>The company sometimes finds it difficult to make on-site visits, however. In March, the company said it would be sending personnel to Congo, where cobalt is mined. As of September, it had not done so.</p><p>A few companies, meanwhile, have begun to respond to pressure for more disclosure, and some industry groups have initiated efforts to promote industry standards for the sourcing of cobalt. Apple annually publishes a list of its top suppliers, a rare move in an industry that prefers to keep supply details secret. And Umicore, a major supplier of battery parts, has hired the accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers, to judge whether it has adhered to its standards for making sure its cobalt is sourced responsibly.</p><p>But these efforts are the exception within the many industries reliant on lithium-ion batteries.</p><p>\"It's important for companies to demonstrate what they're doing and go beyond a mere verbal commitment,\" Jurewicz said. \"Companies that do anything beyond what is required by the [Dodd-Frank] law are few and far between.\"</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:peter.whoriskey@washpost.com\">peter.whoriskey@washpost.com</email></p><p>Ana Swanson contributed to this report.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPOST-70aafa6a-cee6-11e6-a87f-b917067331bb</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPOST2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5MHT-4H11-DXXY-31RS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8075</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-08-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1225\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Washington Post</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"12311\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Every Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"01\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>January 1, 2017 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC000CA0B</classCode><className>TESLA MOTORS INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC00086Y6</classCode><className>LG CHEM LTD</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>TSLA (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><className>LGCD (LSE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><className>051910 (KSE)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Banking Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QjQyMUFCOUJBNURBNEFDREE3MTNCNDk5QkQ4NUM3RjI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Regulatory Conversion</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OUExQjU3NThFNDA2NDJENzlEMjc4MDc3MzU1Mjk3NDk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MEYzNTBDMDYwNTkyNDUyODlGQTJEMEQyMTZDOEE0MkY</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

The electric car and solar panel maker has successfully opened a factory in China, introduced the Model Y electric SUV, made debt payments and posted profits for three straight quarters. Musk has also toned down his inflammatory posts on Twitter that had cost him and the company $40 million in penalties from U.S. securities regulators.<br/>Today, Tesla's market value is three times that of Ford, General Motors and FiatChrysler, combined. A single share of Tesla now goes for nearly $1,600 - a seven-fold increase from a year ago - making it one of the most expensive publicly traded shares in the world.<br/>\"Things just turned on a dime,\" said Garrett Nelson, an analyst at CFRA who specializes in the automotive industry. \"It's just been one positive announcement after another.\"<br/>The dizzying performance on Tuesday qualified Musk for his second huge payday in less than three months, this one worth more than $2 billion. His net worth has soared to an estimated $72 billion, just behind Warren Buffett on the Forbes Billionaires list after passing the famed investor earlier this month. In total, Musk and other Tesla shareholders have made about $240 billion since March 18 when the stock stood at $361 - its low point for this year.<br/>With second-quarter sales of Tesla vehicles outpacing the first despite a global pandemic, shares could jump again if Tesla surprises on Wednesday with a fourth consecutive profitable quarter. That could lead to Tesla's admission into the club of corporate giants: the S&amp;P 500 stock index.<br/>But analysts have begun to question if the shares are running too hot. Analysts polled by FactSet expect a $228 million net loss from April through June. Only one analyst has a 12-month stock price target above the current value. A message was left Tuesday seeking comment from Tesla.<br/>Nelson says shares have outpaced Tesla's fundamental performance, and he's telling clients to sell. He placed a price target at about two-thirds the current value of shares.<br/>In an interview, Nelson said April-to-June registrations of Tesla vehicles fell by nearly half in California, the company's biggest U.S. market. That's an indication of waning demand for its vehicles, which start at $37,990 for a base Model 3 but the car can easily hit $60,000 with options.<br/>Tesla also cut the price of its long-range Model Y by $3,000, which Nelson sees as a red flag. And the company is about to engage in a bout of heavy spending with new factories going up in Germany and the U.S.<br/>There are also market factors that have flung share prices far higher, Nelson said.<br/>Short sellers who perceived flaws at Tesla have since been buying shares to cover massive losses as the stock price leaped, Nelson said. Short-sellers now account for only 7.5% of Tesla's outstanding stock, down from over 23% a year ago, he said.<br/>Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas has a $740 price target on Tesla, arguing that the market overestimates the company's share of future electric vehicle and connected car revenue.<br/>Investors are treating Tesla like tech stocks Apple and Amazon, which took off years ago after hitting $300 billion in market value, Jonas wrote in an investor note. Tesla hit that mark last week, but its revenue and pretax earnings are far smaller than either tech company when they reached the $300 billion valuation, he wrote.<br/>Those who buy Tesla at around $1,500 per share have to believe that long-term U.S.-China trade relations will remain stable, older automakers will fail to make competitive electric vehicles, and big tech companies such as Google, Amazon and Apple won't be successful in developing electric vehicle systems, he wrote.<br/>Jonas, who is uneasy about deteriorating relations between the world's two biggest economies, says traditional automakers are ready to spend over $400 billion on electric vehicles in the next five years, and he expects tech companies to enter the transportation business.<br/>In the meantime, Musk is sitting pretty. The run-up in Tesla's stock positioned him for a big payday after the Palo Alto, California, company awarded him a stock package worth more than $700 million in May.<br/>That compensation is part of an incentive-laden deal that Tesla's board worked out two years ago to inspire Musk to build a company that eventually generates $175 billion in revenue, and is valued at $650 billion.<br/>Musk cleared another hurdle Tuesday when Tesla's market value averaged $150 billion for a six-month stretch, according to data compiled by FactSet Research. Hitting that threshold means Musk is in line to receive 1.69 million stock options valued at $350.02, or nearly 80% below Tuesday's closing price of $1,568.36.<br/>The huge gap would make those stock options worth $2.06 billion on paper, although Musk can't sell the shares for at least five years.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INDMAN-M1243071</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INDMAN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60DS-F7J1-JBYT-H0B4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">428670</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"870\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 FFC Information Solution Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Indian Manufacturing News</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5981\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 23, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0002R1H</classCode><className>FIAT CHRYSLER AUTOMOBILES NV</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC000CFF3</classCode><className>GENERAL MOTORS CO</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>NAICS336111 AUTOMOBILE MANUFACTURING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>SIC3711 MOTOR VEHICLES &amp;

It's Monday, August  20th.  Tonight, market analysts are turning on Tesla and Elon Musk.  I'll  speak to one of the company's biggest champions.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Pepsi makes a bet on bubbles with a $3 billion deal for SodaStream.  And  the end of an ominous era, Greece is finally out of its bailout program.   I'm Bianna Golodryga and this is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And tonight, Wall Street turns on Elon Musk.  Tesla stock is under pressure  once again.  Shares were down as much as 4 percent, crashing below $300.00  before recovering.  America's largest bank, JP Morgan slashed its price  target for Tesla to just $195.00 a share.  It's a far cry from where Musk  claimed he'd secure funding for a private takeover.  That was when it was  $420.00 a share.  </p><p>The Tesla CEO is also back on late night Twitter.  In a 2:30 a.m. tweet at  Arianna Huffington, Musk admitted his marathon shifts on the factory floor  are all that stands between Tesla and bankruptcy.  Huffington wrote a plea  for him to get more sleep.  Musk says that is not an option.  </p><p>Well, Ross Gerber is one of Tesla's most vocal and supportive investors.   He is joining us in Los Angeles.  Ross, you are still fighting for Tesla,  and a supporter of Elon Musk.  Why are you so optimistic when others are  turning sour?  </p><p>ROSS GERBER, TESLA INVESTOR:  Because I have the car and others do not.  So  they have no idea what they are talking about.  I literally drive this car  every day, and it's the best car that's ever been made since the original  Model T, so this product is a game-changer.  So while everybody is  distracted, worried about what Elon Musk is doing at 2:00 in the morning,  what he's done is built just an amazing, transformative product, and I  think that's being lost in this whole production.  </p><p>GOLODRYGA:  Well, the car has not gone without some of its issues and  hiccups along the way.  You've had whistleblowers, you've had the death of  a passenger who was driving in an autonomous car.  Tell me about beyond the  structure of a car, the structure of the company and the dire, some would  say dire financial shape that the company is currently in.  </p><p>GERBER:  Well, this dire financial shape with over $2.5 billion in cash and  now we think the company's cash flow break even as of now and possibly cash  flow positive going into the next quarter, but the main issue is scale.   Could they get to 5,000 cars?  Could they get this to 10,000 cars?  Now,  what they've been able to prove, at least in the last month is they can  maintain an over 5,000 car a week runway for the Tesla Model 3, and they're  moving towards 6,000 cars and now, some analysts are saying they might even  be at 8,000 cars by the end of the quarter.  </p><p>And we're modeling 10,000 cars a week by the end of the year, so the truth  of the matter is, things are going pretty well, because he's had to put in  a Herculean effort to make this work, but he is right, he has got to doing  what he's doing to make sure that this gets to where it needs to be.  </p><p>GOLODRYGA:  If Tesla - Tesla without Elon Musk at the top?  </p><p>GERBER:  No, it's not, and we're betting on Elon Musk.  I mean, this guy is  a genius, and we can all give him a hard time when he's down, but this is a  guy who can land rockets on moving ships.  This is a guy who has  transformed our space industry and has now has one of the greatest  solutions for global climate change.  It's so hot in the world, and we need  Tesla to be successful, and Elon Musk is the driver of this.  And some  people just like to kick a guy when he's down, but please.  </p><p>GOLODRYGA:  But he's not just any guy, he's the head of the company.  He's  the man who is tweeting, without admitting - even himself admitting that he  spoke to the Board about taking the company private.  The SEC is launching  an investigation.  You've got headlines saying that Tesla suppliers fret  about getting paid.  I mean, would this work for a CEO to act in such  erratic ways at any other company?  </p><p>GERBER:  Well, first of all, the President of the United States is the most  erratic person who has ever been on Twitter, and he's running the country  and somehow we're not all dead yet.  So, I think that this modern style of  management is new for a lot of people.  I'm sure if Steve Jobs had Twitter,  we might have different feelings, too.  </p><p>I don't know if I like the way he's handling his Twitter per se at this  point, but, you know, once again, this is the modern world and this is the  way people communicate, including myself and the media.  </p><p>[16:05:03]  </p><p>GOLODRYGA:  Elon has said that Tesla is going to be profitable and cash  flow positive this year.  If that doesn't happen, does your position on the  company and Elon Musk himself change?  </p><p>GERBER:  Not to the point of like if it's a dollar short or something.   We've modeled out that if they make 120,000 Model 3s in the next six  months, they'll be break even or cash flow positive.  So that's what is  most important to us is that the cash flow drain stops.  It doesn't  necessarily have to be a huge positive, but I think the main thing is  taking the financial stress off the company of that - of very heavy CapEx  spending.  </p><p>But what most people are discounting is that this pressure on Musk is  making him a more disciplined investor in Tesla, and the way they're  spending money in Tesla and the way they've slowed down the spending money  of money in Tesla is actually very positive for the shareholders.  </p><p>So, I think this pressure on Elon is a good thing to have to run the  company, to be more profitable or to be more sustainable, and I think  ultimately, when we look back at all of this, this will actually end up  helping Tesla a lot be a better company in the long-term.  </p><p>GOLODRYGA:  Yes, he says this has been his worst year yet, so from your  lips to - let's hope shareholders share your optimism going forward, and he  puts that - go ahead.  </p><p>GERBER:  Yes, I just wanted to say, I have yet to ever see a CEO work so  hard to achieve his goals, put so much - his whole life into it.  Honestly,  there are so few CEOs that even come close to putting in the effort that  Elon is putting in to be successful.  So we're going to back him and we  wish him the best and hopefully, he gets some rest, but at the same  respect, get these cars out there, they're a game-changer.  </p><p>GOLODRYGA:  Yes, we all wish him the best, that is for sure.  Ross Gerber,  thank you so much.  We appreciate it.  </p><p>Well, the future of PepsiCo just got a little bit clearer.  The company is  paying over $3 billion for SodaStream, the Israeli company known for home  sparkling water makers.  The deal is part of Pepsi's push into healthier  products.  CEO Indra Nooyi has split PepsiCo's offerings into three  categories: Fun for you, high calorie snacks and Doritos - it's like drinks  and Doritos, and well, of course Pepsi.  We have them on display here.   Better for you, things like diet sodas and smart food popcorn.  There it is  in the middle.  </p><p>And then good for you, SodasStream will land in this group with products  like the Naked Juice and the Sabra hummus.  Brand management expert Bruce  Turkel joins me live from Miami, Florida.  </p><p>So Bruce, Indra has announced that she's leaving the company.  This is, I  guess, her parting gift and parting decision - a huge decision as the CEO  with this acquisition.  Is it the right one?  </p><p>BRUCE TURKEL, CEO, TURKEL BRANDS:  Well, what you said earlier, the  segmenting of Pepsi products into those three areas, that's a very smart  way for them to deal with the different pressures they have.  </p><p>Now, notice they didn't call the first group of products bad for you, they  called them fun for you.  So clearly, it's a very strategic program.  And  the bottom line is, Pepsi sells soda, and they don't really care how it's  made, how it's manufactured.  They want to be in that distribution chain.  </p><p>So in the world of customization that we all live in today, if you want to  make it yourself, they want to make sure you're still buying it from them.  </p><p>GOLODRYGA:  You know, I remember SodaStream being a really hot product  around five or six years ago.  There were some celebrity endorsements.  It  was buzzed about almost on a daily basis.  I haven't heard much lately, and  that begs the question, why now?  And is $3 billion a bit too much?   </p><p>TURKEL:  Well, why now?  I think that's quite clear.  Pepsi is looking to  maintain its competitive level, and they want to make sure that they are  taking all these different routes.  Amazon has proved that direct to  consumer is the future.  And let's face it, if Pepsi doesn't do this,  Amazon will soon be selling Amazon soda and we will be going on our Echoes  and our smart devices and ordering it.  So they want to make sure that they  can put themselves into the area.  </p><p>Whether $3 billion is the right number or not depends on a lot of things.   I mean, the company wasn't worth that just a few years ago, so you could  question it.  The bigger question is, is it critical to Pepsi's future  plans?  Do they need this to make sure that they're not sitting on the  wayside while they're watching us make our own custom coffee, make our own  custom products, make our own custom soda.  </p><p>GOLODRYGA:  Well, it's clear that the trend line shows that the sale of  sugary beverages and pop sodas have gone down, the sale of water has gone  up.  People have become more health conscious.  So what does this decision  mean for Coca Cola, obviously, Pepsi's archrival?  </p><p>TURKEL:  Well, remember that Coca Cola had gone with Kuerig with their cold  device and they look to walk down this same path just a few years ago, they  didn't have much success with it.  </p><p>[16:10:04]  </p><p>TURKEL:  Does that mean it was a bad idea and will prove to be a bad idea  now or does it mean the timing was wrong back then, and now, the timing is  right?  I don't know the answer.  What I do know is that Pepsi owns a lot  of water brands, a lot of bottles that you buy, that have different names  on them that you like, are owned by Pepsi.  So I think you can be pretty  clear that Pepsi would build a brand extension model, where you'll be able  to use your SodaStream in order to incorporate those brand names.  </p><p>Once again, Pepsi doesn't care where the product comes from, they only care  that you buy it from them.  </p><p>GOLODRYGA:  And obviously like so many other companies, really watching  that behemoth Amazon take over market shares from lots of different areas  wanting to compete and avoid having to have Amazon eat their lunch.  All  right, we'll have to leave it there.  Thank you so much.  </p><p>TURKEL:  And eat their lunch or drink their water  --  </p><p>GOLODRYGA:  Or drink their water, that's right, in this case at least.   Well, U.S. markets closed higher across the board.  Nike shares helped  boost the Dow.  The S&amp;P 500 also finished close to an all-time high.  On  Wednesday, the current U.S. bull market will become, get this, the longest  in history.  This will be a big week for U.S. retail earnings.  Kohl's  reports tomorrow, Target on Wednesday and GAP on Thursday.  </p><p>Also on Thursday, new tariffs are scheduled to take effect in the trade war  between the U.S. and China.  On Friday, Jerome Powell speaks at the Federal  Reserve's annual symposium in Jackson Hole.  One trader told Paula Newton  on \"QUEST EXPRESS\" that he's still optimistic.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)  </p><p>MATTHEW CHESLOCK, EQUITY TRADER, VIRTU FINANCIAL:  We expect that U.S.  earnings to be good for by and large, they were good.  They took us to  these levels here.  Now we're seeing more of a broader based rally, which  is good.  We're not just seeing this tech focused or the FANG names really  drive us to new highs, we're starting to see other companies participate  and that's been the key to the strength of this market.  </p><p>PAULA NEWTON, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Now, the earnings have been stellar, but  what about the market's resilience or perhaps some would call it hear no  evil, see no evil about trade, just about some of the dark debt issues that  have been coming, both from the fiscal point of view, both from government,  and in corporate debt.  Any of those issues - higher interest rates,  anything - give me something, Matt.  Anything.  </p><p>CHESLOCK:  You know what, I'm normally kind of negative and bearish as a  whole  --  </p><p>NEWTON:  Cautious, right?  </p><p>CHESLOCK:  Yes, a little cautious is good, that would be nice.  But I think  right now, this is time.  I mean, we're seeing - if we can get retail back  on board this week, we've got a lot of big retailers coming out, and this  was after Walmart.  So we have Kohl's and we have got Target, we've got all  of these other U.S. company retailers that are - we're hoping for good  things.  This is a good sign for the economy.  This says that main stream  America is on board and they're using their money.  So, I don't see  anything right now.  The worry for me was always the midterm elections.  </p><p>NEWTON:  Got you.  </p><p>CHESLOCK:  And I'm not so sure that's raising its head just yet.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)  </p><p>GOLODRYGA:  The midterms just a few months away and I see some optimism  there though.  Well, Brazil, Zimbabwe, Turkey, and now Venezuela.  The  bolivar is getting its zeroes trimmed; it's part of Maduro's magic formula  for recovery.  So, will it work?  We're live in Caracas.  </p><p>And Greece has completed one of the biggest economic bailouts in history.   We'll hear from the country's former Finance Minister, Yanis Varoufakis   who says nothing has changed.  </p><p>[16:15:00]  </p><p>GOLODRYGA:  Venezuelan President, Nicolas Maduro claims he's found the  quote, \"magic formula\" to get his country's economy back on track.  A new  currency, the sovereign bolivar slashes five zeros off of the old one.  It  effectively drops the bolivar's value by more than 90 percent after rampant  inflation.  </p><p>He also announced that next month, the minimum wage will be multiplied by  60 times.  It all comes as thousands of Venezuelans fleeing the crisis are  facing increasing hostility in the region.  Brazil is deploying troops to  the border after a mob destroyed a migrant camp.  Peru and Ecuador are  putting restrictive measures in place to curb the exodus.  </p><p>Stefano Pozzebon is in Caracas with the latest.  So, Stefano, do the locals  there believe this magic formula will get the country out of the economic  crisis it's in?  </p><p>STEFANO POZZEBON, JOURNALIST:  It's hard to believe so, Bianna, because  what does formula do?  It's effectively just taking five zeros out of the  previous currency, the strong bolivar, the bolivar fuerte as it was called.   From today, starting today, all those zeros will be taken back.  We're  going to stop paying coffees by the million.  I remember yesterday, I paid  for a coffee with about 2.5 million bolivars and this will change.  I am  going to go back and spend and counting our currency by the units, like 25  bolivars, 20 bolivars.  </p><p>This is - I have here, this is the new bolivar.  So one thing that I wanted  to show you, Bianna, one of the reasons why people are so skeptical about  this measure is that nowhere in this bank note you can read the sovereign  bolivar, nowhere in this bank note - you can read that this note is  actually different from the previous one.  There is a lot of uncertainty, a  lack of clarification, a lot of traders are still asking themselves and  trying to ask the government what they're supposed to be doing with this  monetary transition - uncertainty, lack of - a lot of doubt, a lot of doubt  is definitely what's pervading the ground here in Caracas.  </p><p>Whilst it's been transpiring in this Monday here in Caracas that has been  declared a bank holiday, because the government wanted to avoid any trouble  and wanted to smooth this economic transition as much as possible.  So they  declared today, all offices and all - and most of the shops are closed, so  this uncertainly still prevails, Bianna.  </p><p>GOLODRYGA:  And Stefano, I was just in Peru a few weeks ago, and while they  said that they feel for Venezuelans there, and initially were opening the  doors for migrants to come in, as we mentioned in the lead, many of the  countries are just overwhelmed - the neighboring countries - by the  thousands of Venezuelans fleeing by the day.  What can be done?  </p><p>POZZZEBON:  Exactly.  The Venezuelan economic and social collapse is  spreading to the rest of Latin America, just a few days ago, the Ambassador  to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, was on the border between Venezuela and  Colombia.  She was on the border there to say to the Colombian authorities  and to show to the Colombian authorities that the U.S. where they are  present and ready to help.  </p><p>Hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans aren't leaving this country, fleeing  this social and economic collapse and they're going south.  They are going  mainly to Colombia, Ecuador, Peru as you mentioned, Argentina and Chile and  Brazil, of course on the other side.  The rest of the region has organized  themselves in a sort of informal group called the Group of Lima of  countries - 14 countries in the west hemisphere trying to put pressure on  Nicolas Maduro and his government - on the Maduro government to try and  open up the economy and try to at least decrease this massive, massive flow  of migrants that are spreading all over Latin America, Bianna.  </p><p>[16:20:06]  </p><p>GOLODRYGA:  And it's just heartbreaking to watch, and of course, this comes  just a week after that failed drone attack against Maduro as well.  Stefano  Pozzebon, thank you for joining us.  </p><p>Well, Greece has successfully finished the third and final round of its  emergency loan program.  The one that has stopped the country from going  bust.  It has been part of the biggest economic bailout in financial  history, with severe cost to the Greek people for nearly nine years.   Richard Quest reports.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)  </p><p>RICHARD QUEST, CNN INTERNATIONAL HOST:  Greece, a country about to stand on  its own two financial feet again.  At midnight on Monday, Greece exited its  final bailout program.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>PIERRE MOSCOVICI, EU FINANCE CHIEF:  There is no more program for Greece.   There won't be any more program for Greece.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>QUEST:  It marks an end, at least for now, to nearly a decade of financial  life support.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>THANOS VAMVAKIDIS, BANK OF AMERICA, MERRILL LYNCH:  This is a pause to  development particularly now that the Greek economy has finally started  recovering, and the end of the program coincides with an agreement on the  debt.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>QUEST:  Greece's odyssey began in the wake of the financial crisis.   Teetering on the brink of bankruptcy, the EU and IMF initiated the first of  three Greek bailouts.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>MOSCOVICI:  Last night, we reached an agreement.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>QUEST:  Hundreds of  billions of dollars were provided, in exchange, for a  promise of Greek government reforms, tax increases, and relentless  austerity for the Greek people.  The drama played out on the streets of  Athens and threatened to tear apart the architecture of the Eurozone.  </p><p>Cutting with a cord from financial rescue won't be easy.  Since 2010, the  Greek economy shrunk by more than a quarter, and unemployment still hovers  around 20 percent.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>VAMVAKIDIS:  There is no doubt that the fiscal assessment in Greece has  been brutal.  Historically, this has never happened before in any country.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>QUEST:  Despite Europe's generous relief package, Greece's debt levels are  still the highest in the EU.  And in a July report, the IMF was skeptical  about the country's long-term prospects.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>VAMVAKIDIS:  Is it going to be going back to old habits?  Which will be  very negative for markets, or we're going to finally see an ambitious  agenda for reforms that will lead to more investment and more growth in the  long-term?  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>QUEST:  Many Greeks saw the terms of the bailout as a humiliating life  sentence.  Monday's exit may be the start of a long parole. Richard Quest,  CNN.  </p><p>(END VIDEO TAPE)  </p><p>GOLODRYGA:  Well, since the Greek crisis started, Europe has gone through a  political transformation, from the rise of populist parties to Brexit, not  to mention a whole new system to cope with financial crises.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>MOSCOVICI:  Greece's transformative reforms have laid the foundations for  sustainable recovery, putting into place the fundamental conditions needed  for sustained growth, for job creation, and for sound public finances in  the years to come.  </p><p>And while I say it's the end of the crisis, it's the end of a cycle for  Greece, but it's also the end of a crisis for the Eurozone.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>GOLODRYGA:  But while the European union touts the success of the reforms,  the austerity has been brutally severe on much of the Greek people.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>MICHALIS KONSTANTINIDIS, ATHENS RESIDENT AND PENSIONER (Through a  translator):  I'm a pensioner, and on the 30th of every month, I await to  see whether my pension has been cut.  What have I got to celebrate?  </p><p>VICKY PAPACHISTOU, ATHENS RESIDENT AND ACCOUNTANT (Through a translator):   The exit from bailouts doesn't mean anything because wages won't rise,  health services are terrible - everything is terrible, so it means nothing  to us.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>GOLODRYGA:  George Papandreou is the former Prime Minister of Greece and  George Papaconstantinou is one of the country's former Finance Ministers.   Both men were in power during the first bailout and of course, gentlemen, I  remember the effortless work that you put in, the hours of dedication to  keeping your country from going off the brink.  Let me start with you, Mr.  Prime Minister.  Seeing where things are today, are things better than you  would have expected them to be or worse all these years later?  </p><p>GEORGE PAPANDREOU, FORMER PRIME MINISTER, GREECE:  Thank you for the  question.  Yes, we were at the brink of bankruptcy.  We were able to stop  that.  Luckily, it would be a great day to celebrate, but I don't think we  can celebrate.  I think as you mentioned in your program, the cost has been  huge - 25 percent loss of GDP, huge unemployment, a continuous sense of  insecurity over these years.  I think we could have done this with much  less pain much quicker.  </p><p>[16:24:55]  </p><p>PAPANDREOU:  And of course, I think we also still need to further deepen  reforms in our country.  I would say that the only justification of this,  of course, is that in the very beginning there was - we were in unchartered  waters in the European Union.  No country really knew how to deal with  this.  The European Union had never dealt with this, neither had even the  IMF dealt with something within a currency zone.  </p><p>So this was of course, a trial and error in the beginning, and unluckily,  there was also a sense of punishment that Greeks had overspent.  We did  have our problems, we did have our responsibilities.  The previous  government before I took over had ballooned the budget deficit and doubled  the debt, yes, but then we were there on making big reforms, and I think  rather having more solidarity from the European Union, there was a sense we  had to be punished and Greek people have taken the brunt of these  sacrifices.  </p><p>I think we could have done it much more easily.  Still, there would have  been pain, but we could have come out much more quickly.  There is another  one other point I would like to make is that, compared to other countries  such as Ireland, Portugal, and Cyprus, we did not have the political  consensus inside Greece, which was there in those countries, and I think  that played an important role in not giving the support but also the  credibility to the global markets and the European Union.  </p><p>GOLODRYGA:  Yes, that's an understatement.  We all recall the protests and  fires that we would witness there almost on a daily basis on the streets of  Athens.  Mr. Finance Minister, let me ask you this because we talk about  the country turning a page now, maybe very slowly, nonetheless turning a  page, but you have a third of the population of 10 million people near  poverty.  Unemployment has fallen, but it's still at 19.5 percent, the  highest in the Eurozone.  What can be done to avoid a dark decade or a lost  era and decade like we saw in Japan in the '80s?  </p><p>GEORGE PAPACONSTANTINOU, FORMER FINANCE MINISTER OF GREECE:  Well, if you  look forward, the main problem the country will have is that nobody gives  its growth prospects exceeding 1 percent, 1.5 percent a year in the long  run.  That's really slow.  It's too slow to repay the debt, it's too slow  to create jobs, it's too slow to increase people's incomes.  And the only  way to do better than that, is to have massive inward foreign investment.   And together, with something like a productivity revolution, that's the  only thing I will say it works.  </p><p>Because as it looks at the moment, we're going to be going in a slow growth  road, of which we'll simply not be able to bring back what Greeks have lost  over those years.  And make no mistake, given the situation we were eight  years ago, nine years ago, a lot of what happened was completely  unavoidable, but it's true, just like Mr. Papandreou said before me, part  of it was avoidable.  Part of it was due to mistakes made both on the Greek  side and the part of our European partners.  </p><p>GOLODRYGA:  Mr. Finance Minister, let me  ask you about the other crises  that are continuing to play out throughout Europe.  You've got Brexit,  obviously, you've got the economic crisis in Turkey.  What has you most  concerned as an expert and as somebody who has taken part in an economic  crisis?  </p><p>PAPACONSTANTINOU:  Well, we are now nine years since the Eurozone crisis  started.  We realized too late that it was not just a problem of one  country, Greece, we had a systemic problem having to do with the  architecture of the euro, and the financial architecture of the Eurozone.   This was a discovery that came too late.  </p><p>We started repairing the house.  We have done a number of things, but we're  not - we haven't yet been able to say that we have created an environment  which is - can withstand the future crisis better than it did the last one.  </p><p>Because remember, today, for example, debt levels are higher everywhere  than they were before.  We have no mechanisms to deal with crisis better,  but we're still susceptible.  So whenever we think of Italy and its debt  level, when we think of Turkey destabilizing the whole region, it is very  easy for the whole of the Eurozone to succumb to a repeat of the crisis,  and that's because we were not courageous enough at the European level to  complete the banking union, because the problem with the banks was at the  core of the Eurozone crisis to move much further in the fiscal union, and  to have a truly economic union, which was supposed to be designed in the  first place.  </p><p>GOLODRYGA:  And to add to that, you have the uncertainty coming from the  U.S. and the President's tariffs, as well, with European traders.  Mr.  Prime Minister, let me finally ask you -- </p><p>[16:30:16]  </p><p>PAPACONSTANTINOU: Indeed -- </p><p>GOLODRYGA:  Let me ask you about your thoughts on how one of your  successors Mr. Tsipras is doing now in his job as prime minister running  the country.  Do you have faith in the direction that he's taken the  country thus far and going forward? </p><p>PAPANDREOU:  Well, let me just add to the previous comment that Zoe  Konstantopoulou(ph) made, Europe show that when it works together in unison  -- for example, when Mario Draghi came out and said we will do whatever it  takes, we actually calm the markets.</p><p>So I think what came out of this is that, one hand, Greece said we want to  remain, we're not leaving Europe, we believe in Europe despite the fact  that we think things should change.  But on the other hand that we must  believe that Europe does have capacity, we slowly built up some mechanisms,  we hadn't completed this project, we need to do more. </p><p>And I think more Europe is what will be able to help us mitigate some of  the global crisis, whether it's called the refugee crisis, whether it's  dealing with Internet privacy, whether it's dealing with financial crisis  or pandemics or whatever.</p><p>I think we need to see on this experience that going back to the populous,  nationalist view of solving our problems is not going anywhere.  We're not  going to solve climate change or refugee issue by going it alone.  I think  that's the first thing.</p><p>I think the second point that you asked me about -- well, we are paying  dearly for the -- particularly the first few months of the Tsipras  government.  We avoided bankruptcy in 2010, we almost went to bankruptcy in  2015 with capital control of the banks, almost left to Europe, and that  cost him, cost him some credibility, cost him in more borrowing and cost  him more recession and  therefore more cuts to be able to deal with the  budget deficit.</p><p>Obviously, after that, Tsipras fell in line, but as he was an anti -- to  anti-adjustment program, he didn't really have much else to do, so when he  did fall in line, I believe he missed an opportunity to go deeper into  making the necessary reforms for Greece. </p><p>My belief is that austerity was over emphasized when you get to do deeper  reforms.  I'll just give you an example -- </p><p>GOLODRYGA:  OK -- </p><p>PAPANDREOU:  When we brought in -- </p><p>GOLODRYGA:  OK -- </p><p>PAPANDREOU:  Transparency -- </p><p>GOLODRYGA:  OK -- </p><p>PAPANDREOU:  The E-prescriptions in the medical sector, we cut graph that  cost like 50 percent, that's 3 billion, we cut -- that's as much as we make  and properly, that is in Greece.  So there are ways that we should have had  more emphasis on reform, less emphasis on austerity.</p><p>That's partly a European and the IMF blame and partly of course blame of  successive governments that were not really committed to make a deal with  vested interest and make the changes necessary.  That's what we need to do  now -- </p><p>GOLODRYGA:  We'll -- </p><p>PAPANDREOU:  I think now we can think about the rules of the crisis, it's a  new phase, but we need to move forward and research great capacities  sustainably following.</p><p>GOLODRYGA:  And this phase and nonetheless a big milestone as well.   Gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us, we appreciate it.  And we will  be right back.</p><p>[16:35:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>GOLODRYGA:  Hello, I'm Bianna Golodryga, coming up on the next half hour of  QUEST MEANS BUSINESS, Twitter's chief executive tells us the company may  have fallen behind in cleaning up the site.  And one of the world's biggest  oil companies is giving up on Iran as new sanctions loom ahead.</p><p>But first, these are the top news headlines we're following this hour.   Pope Francis has acknowledged the Catholic Church's failure to act over  sexual abuse against children, describing his shame and repentance.  A  thousand children were alleged abused by priests in Pennsylvania.</p><p>Pope Francis says the children were abandoned and that no apology would  ever be enough.  And in Italy's Calabria region, authorities say at least  eight people have been killed in flooding.  Heavy rains pushed what's  normally a small stream over its banks.</p><p>It's not clear how many people have gone missing, but more than 100  rescuers are searching for survivors.  And some news just in, U.S.  President Donald Trump is again criticizing the Federal Reserve over  raising interest rates.  In an interview with \"Reuters\", he said he was not  thrilled with Fed Chairman Jerome Powell. </p><p>Trump then said he should be given some help by the Fed.  Historically,  presidents private preserve the Fed's political independence by not  commenting on its policy.  </p><p>The United States has a disease, that's according to Iran's foreign  minister.  The country is addicted to sanctions.  In an exclusive interview  with Nick Paton Walsh, Mohammad Javad Zarif says he was wrong when he  believed America had learned from past mistakes. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MOHAMMAD JAVAD ZARIF, FOREIGN MINISTER, IRAN:  I believe there is a disease  in the United States, and that is the addiction to sanctions.  Even during  the Obama administration, the United States put more emphasis on keeping  the sanctions that they had not lifted rather than implementing its  obligations on the sanctions that they've lifted. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>GOLODRYGA:  Meanwhile, Iran's oil minister says Total has officially left  the country and pending U.S. sanctions forced the French oil giant to  unwind all its Iran operations including a major development to develop a  natural gas field.</p><p>John Defterios joins me now.  John, how significant is this move from  Total?</p><p>JOHN DEFTERIOS, CNN EMERGING MARKETS EDITOR:  Well, it's one of the most  telegraphed moves in the business, Bianna, that's for sure.  But it still  comes as a blow for Iran because total is the first international oil  company to go back in after the lifting of the sanctions.</p><p>In fact, Patrick Pouyanne; the CEO told me back in May during the CNN  roundtable there, Vladimir Putin summit that sometimes politics and  business don't dovetail together, and this is one of those instances  without exemptions they couldn't stay in the market. </p><p>And it boils down in large part because of Wall Street, that's where they  get a third of their shareholder base, two-thirds of their financing comes  from Wall Street, they have physical plans in America.  We also have to  think about the repatriation of funds, once you make money in Iran because  of their reach of the U.S. Treasury and the Federal Reserve. </p><p>CNPC of China was in the front seat to take over the share, but I would  imagine they're driving a pretty hard bargain because there's not a lot of  buyers out there.  So Iran was not able to announce somebody taking over  the state as Total decided to exit the market. </p><p>[16:40:00] GOLODRYGA:  What was the point that Zarif was trying to make in  his statements there that the U.S. has an addiction.  Who was he speaking  to?</p><p>DEFTERIOS:  Well, he was speaking in particular to the U.S. Congress  because they have to follow through in the Trump sanctions and both houses  of course controlled by the Republicans right now.  But as the trigger- happy Donald Trump using sanctions right across the board including with  the ally of Iran right now which is Turkey.</p><p>Let's take a look at where Iran stood in terms of overall production and  what's going to happen to their exports going forward.  They're the third  largest producer within OPEC right now, Bianna, at 3.8 million barrels.   But it's the exports, what I found interesting here.</p><p>They surged in the last couple of months at 2.9 million barrels a day.   When I went to those fields at the end of 2015, they were pumping out just  a million of exports and they said they would try to get it up to 2.5,  nobody thought they could get close to 3 million barrels a day.</p><p>The target by Donald Trump by the way is to take it down to zero in the  second round of this snap-back sanctions in November.  Realistically, FACTS  Global Energy is saying there should be about 700,000 barrels a day.  We  have to watch the big three buyers of that crude. </p><p>China, India of course are one and two, and number three is Korea.  Korea  has  a sanctions on by the U.S.  I don't see China bending because there  are investors in the projects right now, and India with a relationship  between Donald Trump and Mr. Modi; the Prime Minister, you could see them  caving, but the Prime Minister of India said we're going to try to stay  with Iran right now.</p><p>And again, they got a good deal because Iran doesn't have all the customers  they had just six months ago.</p><p>GOLODRYGA:  John Defterios, we'll have to leave it there, thank you, we  appreciate it.</p><p>DEFTERIOS:  Thanks. </p><p>GOLODRYGA:  Well, Kevin Spacey's latest film is giving Box Office laugh a  whole new meaning.  The movie is called \"Billionaires Boys Club\", but the  money, well, it isn't exactly falling in, we'll explain more coming up  next. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>GOLODRYGA:  Well, Kevin Spacey's new film has taken just $618, that's  right, $618 in theaters across the U.S. this weekend -- not millions or  even thousands.  Just $610.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The (INAUDIBLE) investors to pay investors, oh, you  knew? </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I'm from Wall Street.  You think people really get rich  playing by the rules?   </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>[16:45:00] GOLODRYGA:  The movie billionaire boys club actually gained a  little momentum over the weekend after it took just $126 at the Box Office,  Friday.  This all follows allegations of sexual misconduct against Kevin  Spacey.  CNN's Chloe Melas joins me now.</p><p>And a lot of people were having double takes right there, saying that  number, thinking there's no way a movie can only gross $618, it opened in  10 cities.</p><p>CHLOE MELAS, CNN ENTERTAINMENT REPORTER:  It is a jaw-dropping figure  especially when you're talking about a man, a leading man in Hollywood who  at one point had a $52.5 million opening for \"Superman Returns\" in 2006.   So obviously, that number right there is jarring. </p><p>Also there was a big cast in this movie, he had a supporting role, Kevin  Spacey.  You had Ansel Elgort who was a big heart drop here in the U.S.,  you had Emma Roberts, so you had some other big names that you would have  thought might help carry this.</p><p>So it only opened in 10 theaters, right? But again, if you're going to  compare it to some of like the worst movies of 2017 when it comes to Box  Office opening weekend, the movie, \"The Comedian\", starring Leslie Mann and  Robert De Niro, that made $10,000 at the Box Office, so again, not a lot. </p><p>Maybe if this had opened in more theaters, they put no marketing behind  this, and when you look at all the money in the world where Sony cut Spacey  out and recast him with Christopher Plummer. </p><p>The film studio behind this movie \"Billionaires Boys Club\", they said that  they didn't have the budget to go do that.  That's so expensive to have to  reshoot scenes and cut him out.  We were hoping that people were going to  still go see it. </p><p>GOLODRYGA:  It just makes Gillie(ph) look like a cash cow, but if this was  filmed three years ago, given everything that's developed over the past  year with the Me Too movement, why even release it at this point? </p><p>MELAS:  Well, so first of all, if this had been years ago, probably would  have done -- </p><p>GOLODRYGA:  Right -- </p><p>MELAS:  Millions at the Box Office.  I think that they felt as though Kevin  Spacey had a very small role in the film, well, not too small, but a  supporting role, and that the other big names would carry it.</p><p>I think that what this goes to show you is that the Me Too movement, when  allegations come out against these very powerful men in Hollywood, oh, how  mighty they fall and it really does affect Box Office success.  And that  is, now studios have to look at this as an example as to, all right, well,  if we have some other leading men have allegations against them, it might  hurt us.</p><p>So maybe better to recast or put the movie on pause and then revisit it  later.  But again, this is a perfect example of how the Me Too movement -- </p><p>GOLODRYGA:  Right -- </p><p>MELAS:  Can hurt Box Office success -- </p><p>GOLODRYGA:  Drizzle(ph) effect, and have we heard from Kevin Spacey at all? </p><p>MELAS:  Nothing.  I was just talking to Ashleigh Banfield who is an anchor  here at CNN about this, and Cricket from Kevin Spacey, ever since those  first allegations came out against him in October and after our exclusive  report at CNN about the misconduct on the set of \"House of Cards\" on his  show on Netflix.</p><p>So now we've heard nothing from him, you would expect some sort of a  statement at some point, nothing.  </p><p>GOLODRYGA:  A lot of negative reaction though when he said he was going in  for therapy and seem to equate his sexuality -- </p><p>MELAS:  Yes -- </p><p>GOLODRYGA:  With the accusations against him, which you know, the two are  extremely -- </p><p>MELAS:  Coming out and apologizing, but also saying, well, I didn't mean to  come on to that boy when he was a teenager, but I'm also gay.  Again -- </p><p>GOLODRYGA:  Yes -- </p><p>MELAS:  To equate these two things enraged many people.</p><p>GOLODRYGA:  Yes -- </p><p>MELAS:  But perhaps he still just doesn't have quite the right words of  what to say.</p><p>GOLODRYGA:  Well, I don't know how you respond to a movie opening at the  \"Billionaires Boys Club\" too at that title, $618 -- </p><p>MELAS:  No -- </p><p>GOLODRYGA:  Wow, yes, Chloe, great to have you on -- </p><p>MELAS:  Thank you -- </p><p>GOLODRYGA:  Good to see you, thank you.  Well, Twitter is facing a barrage  of criticism from spam and abuse to misinformation.  CEO Jack Dorsey opens  up to CNN about the challenges the company is facing, that's just ahead.</p><p>[16:50:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>GOLODRYGA:  The chief executive of Twitter says the social platform has a  toxic problem with content.  Jack Dorsey was speaking to our very own Brian  Stelter who is here with me.  Fascinating interview played -- </p><p>BRIAN STELTER, CNN SENIOR MEDIA CORRESPONDENT:  Yes -- </p><p>GOLODRYGA:  Out over the weekend.  You addressed a lot of issues, did you  walk away with the feeling that he has a grasp of the level of issues and  the severity of the issues that they're dealing with?</p><p>STELTER:  Well, I think he's asking the right questions, I think he's  addressing the right problems.  But he doesn't have all the answers yet, he  doesn't have the solutions, and he readily admits that.  You know, he  sounded at times like a philosopher, thinking about the impact of  technology. </p><p>And less like the CEO of a major tech company.  But he did acknowledge that  individuals increasingly have fears of big tech companies.  Here's a part  of what Dorsey told me.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>JACK DORSEY, CO-FOUNDER &amp; CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, TWITTER:  When we  started the company in the service 12 years ago, we weren't necessarily  thinking about some of the repercussions from our actions.  And they looked  quite small at the time.</p><p>For instance, we thought, you know, well, people are following you, so we  should count them and then we should put that count right on your profile  page and obviously people care about that, so we should make it big.</p><p>But that one small choice and it felt very small at the time and it felt  obvious at the time.  Put an incentive to grow that number, is that the  right attention? Is that the right incentive that we should be driving? I  don't think it is today, I don't think it matters as much in context of how  many conversations you have or how much you contribute back to the network.</p><p>And like is another good example where you know, when you tweet and you  don't get a lot of likes and you feel bad about it, is that the incentive  we really want to drive? Is that what we're actually trying to encourage  people to think about?</p><p>The answer is yes because it's in the product.  And another good example  that I think will help a lot of what we're trying to do and health is what  we see with eco-chambers.  We only give people one tool right now which is  to follow an account.</p><p>STELTER:  You want people to be able to follow stories or subjects or  hashtags?</p><p>DORSEY:  Yes, I mean, we've been focusing a lot of the service today more,  and vying(ph) it more towards topics or towards interests.</p><p>STELTER:  It sounds like you are willing and ready and willing to rebuild  the entire house, to renovate everything.</p><p>DORSEY:  We're ready to questions everything.  I mean, I -- we've cleaned  so much in Twitter over the past 12 years, and I know it doesn't always  feel that way, but we've changed a lot, but we haven't changed the  underlying fundamental.</p><p>STELTER:  What is the timeline for re-examining how you so follow accounts  or the use of the like button.</p><p>DORSEY:  You know, we're looking at and thinking about all these things.   Right now, we've definitely had conversations about them -- </p><p>STELTER:  But would you say like by the end of the year there's going to be  those fundamental changes to Twitter?</p><p>DORSEY:  I don't -- I worry about a timeframe like that because we also  need to take into consideration -- we're a small company, I mean, we in  comparison with our peers -- we're a small company, but we have this out- size impact and I believe the importance.</p><p>And there's a lot of what's in Twitter that you would find in a public  square, to use the older analogy -- </p><p>STELTER:  You mean all the graffiti on the walls?</p><p>DORSEY:  No, well, there's part of that, but there's also a really amazing  open conversation, and I'm going to see if we're ready to walk up to anyone  and strike something up.  So there's positives and there's what people  perceive to be negative as well.</p><p>[16:55:00] STELTER:  Look, I met my wife on Twitter, I'm always going to  love Twitter.  And I kind of feel like it's a garden that's been overrun by  weeds.  Do you feel like you're the gardener just struggling to keep up?</p><p>DORSEY:  There are certainly times where we felt like we're behind.  But  that goes back to my point of like we need to be really good with  prioritizing and sequencing and understanding what matters most.  So if the  incentives are going to have greatest impact, then we should prioritize  that.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>GOLODRYGA:  So clearly, a lot of challenges, he's addressing them, and you  said that was a big step for him to speak out to you.  The president also  is addressing this issue in an interview with \"Reuters\" as we speak -- </p><p>STELTER:  Yes, in an interview with \"Reuters\" in the past few minutes.  The  president is reiterating his complaints about these big tech companies,  saying it's very dangerous that they self-regulate content.  I think what  he means is the rules of the role, the Twitter and Facebook and Google have  to decide when you violate terms of service, when something might be hate  speech or something, these are issues that Twitter and Facebook grappling  with. </p><p>And we're hearing prominent conservatives including up to the president of  the United States saying, you know, these rules, you have to be careful, it  seems like you're targeting conservatives.  Now the companies very much  deny that.</p><p>Dorsey denied that to me in the interview, he said this is not a bad  ideology and we're deciding whether to suspend or block someone, we're not  doing it based on political point of view.  But that idea of discrimination  of bias is a very powerful potent idea and it's been used in the midterm  elections here in the U.S. to say the new problem is big tech.</p><p>That it used to be the liberal mainstream media, now it's the liberal  technology companies -- </p><p>GOLODRYGA:  Yes -- </p><p>STELTER:  And with that in mind, it's so interesting to hear Dorsey say  we're not that big.</p><p>GOLODRYGA:  Yes -- </p><p>STELTER:  We're small compared to our peers.</p><p>GOLODRYGA:  Yes -- </p><p>STELTER:  We don't have unlimited resources to monitor and police this  website.  It's kind of like hearing someone who is in charge of a town say  we only have so many cops, we can't hire more police officers, it's not a  very encouraging thing to hear.</p><p>GOLODRYGA:  Not as if he prefers to be in the shadows with the Facebook in  the spotlight, now that it's his turn, he's facing a lot of questions as  well, you've got the First Amendment, you've got hate speech, you've the  president weighing in, but I was happy to hear that there's good news  coming out of Twitter, and that people still fall in love, like you and  your wife.</p><p>STELTER:  Yes -- </p><p>GOLODRYGA:  You've got a beautiful baby out in the -- </p><p>STELTER:  I love Twitter for that reason -- </p><p>GOLODRYGA:  Yes -- </p><p>STELTER:  That's right, but Twitter seem really pleasant in those days, not  so much anymore.</p><p>GOLODRYGA:  Yes, lot to the world now -- </p><p>STELTER:  Yes -- </p><p>GOLODRYGA:  Same -- even for a so-called small company. </p><p>STELTER:  Yes -- </p><p>GOLODRYGA:  Brian, thank you -- </p><p>STELTER:  Thanks.</p><p>GOLODRYGA:  And that's QUEST MEANS BUSINESS.  I am Bianna Golodryga in New  York, the news continues right here on CNN. </p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and programming copyright 2018 Cable News Network, Inc.  ALL  RIGHTS  RESERVED.

It's Monday, August  20th.  Tonight, market analysts are turning on Tesla and Elon Musk.  I'll  speak to one of the company's biggest champions.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Pepsi makes a bet on bubbles with a $3 billion deal for SodaStream.  And  the end of an ominous era, Greece is finally out of its bailout program.   I'm Bianna Golodryga and this is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And tonight, Wall Street turns on Elon Musk.  Tesla stock is under pressure  once again.  Shares were down as much as 4 percent, crashing below $300.00  before recovering.  America's largest bank, JP Morgan slashed its price  target for Tesla to just $195.00 a share.  It's a far cry from where Musk  claimed he'd secure funding for a private takeover.  That was when it was  $420.00 a share.  </p><p>The Tesla CEO is also back on late night Twitter.  In a 2:30 a.m. tweet at  Arianna Huffington, Musk admitted his marathon shifts on the factory floor  are all that stands between Tesla and bankruptcy.  Huffington wrote a plea  for him to get more sleep.  Musk says that is not an option.  </p><p>Well, Ross Gerber is one of Tesla's most vocal and supportive investors.   He is joining us in Los Angeles.  Ross, you are still fighting for Tesla,  and a supporter of Elon Musk.  Why are you so optimistic when others are  turning sour?  </p><p>ROSS GERBER, TESLA INVESTOR:  Because I have the car and others do not.  So  they have no idea what they are talking about.  I literally drive this car  every day, and it's the best car that's ever been made since the original  Model T, so this product is a game-changer.  So while everybody is  distracted, worried about what Elon Musk is doing at 2:00 in the morning,  what he's done is built just an amazing, transformative product, and I  think that's being lost in this whole production.  </p><p>GOLODRYGA:  Well, the car has not gone without some of its issues and  hiccups along the way.  You've had whistleblowers, you've had the death of  a passenger who was driving in an autonomous car.  Tell me about beyond the  structure of a car, the structure of the company and the dire, some would  say dire financial shape that the company is currently in.  </p><p>GERBER:  Well, this dire financial shape with over $2.5 billion in cash and  now we think the company's cash flow break even as of now and possibly cash  flow positive going into the next quarter, but the main issue is scale.   Could they get to 5,000 cars?  Could they get this to 10,000 cars?  Now,  what they've been able to prove, at least in the last month is they can  maintain an over 5,000 car a week runway for the Tesla Model 3, and they're  moving towards 6,000 cars and now, some analysts are saying they might even  be at 8,000 cars by the end of the quarter.  </p><p>And we're modeling 10,000 cars a week by the end of the year, so the truth  of the matter is, things are going pretty well, because he's had to put in  a Herculean effort to make this work, but he is right, he has got to doing  what he's doing to make sure that this gets to where it needs to be.  </p><p>GOLODRYGA:  If Tesla - Tesla without Elon Musk at the top?  </p><p>GERBER:  No, it's not, and we're betting on Elon Musk.  I mean, this guy is  a genius, and we can all give him a hard time when he's down, but this is a  guy who can land rockets on moving ships.  This is a guy who has  transformed our space industry and has now has one of the greatest  solutions for global climate change.  It's so hot in the world, and we need  Tesla to be successful, and Elon Musk is the driver of this.  And some  people just like to kick a guy when he's down, but please.  </p><p>GOLODRYGA:  But he's not just any guy, he's the head of the company.  He's  the man who is tweeting, without admitting - even himself admitting that he  spoke to the Board about taking the company private.  The SEC is launching  an investigation.  You've got headlines saying that Tesla suppliers fret  about getting paid.  I mean, would this work for a CEO to act in such  erratic ways at any other company?  </p><p>GERBER:  Well, first of all, the President of the United States is the most  erratic person who has ever been on Twitter, and he's running the country  and somehow we're not all dead yet.  So, I think that this modern style of  management is new for a lot of people.  I'm sure if Steve Jobs had Twitter,  we might have different feelings, too.  </p><p>I don't know if I like the way he's handling his Twitter per se at this  point, but, you know, once again, this is the modern world and this is the  way people communicate, including myself and the media.  </p><p>[16:05:03]  </p><p>GOLODRYGA:  Elon has said that Tesla is going to be profitable and cash  flow positive this year.  If that doesn't happen, does your position on the  company and Elon Musk himself change?  </p><p>GERBER:  Not to the point of like if it's a dollar short or something.   We've modeled out that if they make 120,000 Model 3s in the next six  months, they'll be break even or cash flow positive.  So that's what is  most important to us is that the cash flow drain stops.  It doesn't  necessarily have to be a huge positive, but I think the main thing is  taking the financial stress off the company of that - of very heavy CapEx  spending.  </p><p>But what most people are discounting is that this pressure on Musk is  making him a more disciplined investor in Tesla, and the way they're  spending money in Tesla and the way they've slowed down the spending money  of money in Tesla is actually very positive for the shareholders.  </p><p>So, I think this pressure on Elon is a good thing to have to run the  company, to be more profitable or to be more sustainable, and I think  ultimately, when we look back at all of this, this will actually end up  helping Tesla a lot be a better company in the long-term.  </p><p>GOLODRYGA:  Yes, he says this has been his worst year yet, so from your  lips to - let's hope shareholders share your optimism going forward, and he  puts that - go ahead.  </p><p>GERBER:  Yes, I just wanted to say, I have yet to ever see a CEO work so  hard to achieve his goals, put so much - his whole life into it.  Honestly,  there are so few CEOs that even come close to putting in the effort that  Elon is putting in to be successful.  So we're going to back him and we  wish him the best and hopefully, he gets some rest, but at the same  respect, get these cars out there, they're a game-changer.  </p><p>GOLODRYGA:  Yes, we all wish him the best, that is for sure.  Ross Gerber,  thank you so much.  We appreciate it.  </p><p>Well, the future of PepsiCo just got a little bit clearer.  The company is  paying over $3 billion for SodaStream, the Israeli company known for home  sparkling water makers.  The deal is part of Pepsi's push into healthier  products.  CEO Indra Nooyi has split PepsiCo's offerings into three  categories: Fun for you, high calorie snacks and Doritos - it's like drinks  and Doritos, and well, of course Pepsi.  We have them on display here.   Better for you, things like diet sodas and smart food popcorn.  There it is  in the middle.  </p><p>And then good for you, SodasStream will land in this group with products  like the Naked Juice and the Sabra hummus.  Brand management expert Bruce  Turkel joins me live from Miami, Florida.  </p><p>So Bruce, Indra has announced that she's leaving the company.  This is, I  guess, her parting gift and parting decision - a huge decision as the CEO  with this acquisition.  Is it the right one?  </p><p>BRUCE TURKEL, CEO, TURKEL BRANDS:  Well, what you said earlier, the  segmenting of Pepsi products into those three areas, that's a very smart  way for them to deal with the different pressures they have.  </p><p>Now, notice they didn't call the first group of products bad for you, they  called them fun for you.  So clearly, it's a very strategic program.  And  the bottom line is, Pepsi sells soda, and they don't really care how it's  made, how it's manufactured.  They want to be in that distribution chain.  </p><p>So in the world of customization that we all live in today, if you want to  make it yourself, they want to make sure you're still buying it from them.  </p><p>GOLODRYGA:  You know, I remember SodaStream being a really hot product  around five or six years ago.  There were some celebrity endorsements.  It  was buzzed about almost on a daily basis.  I haven't heard much lately, and  that begs the question, why now?  And is $3 billion a bit too much?   </p><p>TURKEL:  Well, why now?  I think that's quite clear.  Pepsi is looking to  maintain its competitive level, and they want to make sure that they are  taking all these different routes.  Amazon has proved that direct to  consumer is the future.  And let's face it, if Pepsi doesn't do this,  Amazon will soon be selling Amazon soda and we will be going on our Echoes  and our smart devices and ordering it.  So they want to make sure that they  can put themselves into the area.  </p><p>Whether $3 billion is the right number or not depends on a lot of things.   I mean, the company wasn't worth that just a few years ago, so you could  question it.  The bigger question is, is it critical to Pepsi's future  plans?  Do they need this to make sure that they're not sitting on the  wayside while they're watching us make our own custom coffee, make our own  custom products, make our own custom soda.  </p><p>GOLODRYGA:  Well, it's clear that the trend line shows that the sale of  sugary beverages and pop sodas have gone down, the sale of water has gone  up.  People have become more health conscious.  So what does this decision  mean for Coca Cola, obviously, Pepsi's archrival?  </p><p>TURKEL:  Well, remember that Coca Cola had gone with Kuerig with their cold  device and they look to walk down this same path just a few years ago, they  didn't have much success with it.  </p><p>[16:10:04]  </p><p>TURKEL:  Does that mean it was a bad idea and will prove to be a bad idea  now or does it mean the timing was wrong back then, and now, the timing is  right?  I don't know the answer.  What I do know is that Pepsi owns a lot  of water brands, a lot of bottles that you buy, that have different names  on them that you like, are owned by Pepsi.  So I think you can be pretty  clear that Pepsi would build a brand extension model, where you'll be able  to use your SodaStream in order to incorporate those brand names.  </p><p>Once again, Pepsi doesn't care where the product comes from, they only care  that you buy it from them.  </p><p>GOLODRYGA:  And obviously like so many other companies, really watching  that behemoth Amazon take over market shares from lots of different areas  wanting to compete and avoid having to have Amazon eat their lunch.  All  right, we'll have to leave it there.  Thank you so much.  </p><p>TURKEL:  And eat their lunch or drink their water  --  </p><p>GOLODRYGA:  Or drink their water, that's right, in this case at least.   Well, U.S. markets closed higher across the board.  Nike shares helped  boost the Dow.  The S&amp;P 500 also finished close to an all-time high.  On  Wednesday, the current U.S. bull market will become, get this, the longest  in history.  This will be a big week for U.S. retail earnings.  Kohl's  reports tomorrow, Target on Wednesday and GAP on Thursday.  </p><p>Also on Thursday, new tariffs are scheduled to take effect in the trade war  between the U.S. and China.  On Friday, Jerome Powell speaks at the Federal  Reserve's annual symposium in Jackson Hole.  One trader told Paula Newton  on \"QUEST EXPRESS\" that he's still optimistic.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)  </p><p>MATTHEW CHESLOCK, EQUITY TRADER, VIRTU FINANCIAL:  We expect that U.S.  earnings to be good for by and large, they were good.  They took us to  these levels here.  Now we're seeing more of a broader based rally, which  is good.  We're not just seeing this tech focused or the FANG names really  drive us to new highs, we're starting to see other companies participate  and that's been the key to the strength of this market.  </p><p>PAULA NEWTON, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Now, the earnings have been stellar, but  what about the market's resilience or perhaps some would call it hear no  evil, see no evil about trade, just about some of the dark debt issues that  have been coming, both from the fiscal point of view, both from government,  and in corporate debt.  Any of those issues - higher interest rates,  anything - give me something, Matt.  Anything.  </p><p>CHESLOCK:  You know what, I'm normally kind of negative and bearish as a  whole  --  </p><p>NEWTON:  Cautious, right?  </p><p>CHESLOCK:  Yes, a little cautious is good, that would be nice.  But I think  right now, this is time.  I mean, we're seeing - if we can get retail back  on board this week, we've got a lot of big retailers coming out, and this  was after Walmart.  So we have Kohl's and we have got Target, we've got all  of these other U.S. company retailers that are - we're hoping for good  things.  This is a good sign for the economy.  This says that main stream  America is on board and they're using their money.  So, I don't see  anything right now.  The worry for me was always the midterm elections.  </p><p>NEWTON:  Got you.  </p><p>CHESLOCK:  And I'm not so sure that's raising its head just yet.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)  </p><p>GOLODRYGA:  The midterms just a few months away and I see some optimism  there though.  Well, Brazil, Zimbabwe, Turkey, and now Venezuela.  The  bolivar is getting its zeroes trimmed; it's part of Maduro's magic formula  for recovery.  So, will it work?  We're live in Caracas.  </p><p>And Greece has completed one of the biggest economic bailouts in history.   We'll hear from the country's former Finance Minister, Yanis Varoufakis   who says nothing has changed.  </p><p>[16:15:00]  </p><p>GOLODRYGA:  Venezuelan President, Nicolas Maduro claims he's found the  quote, \"magic formula\" to get his country's economy back on track.  A new  currency, the sovereign bolivar slashes five zeros off of the old one.  It  effectively drops the bolivar's value by more than 90 percent after rampant  inflation.  </p><p>He also announced that next month, the minimum wage will be multiplied by  60 times.  It all comes as thousands of Venezuelans fleeing the crisis are  facing increasing hostility in the region.  Brazil is deploying troops to  the border after a mob destroyed a migrant camp.  Peru and Ecuador are  putting restrictive measures in place to curb the exodus.  </p><p>Stefano Pozzebon is in Caracas with the latest.  So, Stefano, do the locals  there believe this magic formula will get the country out of the economic  crisis it's in?  </p><p>STEFANO POZZEBON, JOURNALIST:  It's hard to believe so, Bianna, because  what does formula do?  It's effectively just taking five zeros out of the  previous currency, the strong bolivar, the bolivar fuerte as it was called.   From today, starting today, all those zeros will be taken back.  We're  going to stop paying coffees by the million.  I remember yesterday, I paid  for a coffee with about 2.5 million bolivars and this will change.  I am  going to go back and spend and counting our currency by the units, like 25  bolivars, 20 bolivars.  </p><p>This is - I have here, this is the new bolivar.  So one thing that I wanted  to show you, Bianna, one of the reasons why people are so skeptical about  this measure is that nowhere in this bank note you can read the sovereign  bolivar, nowhere in this bank note - you can read that this note is  actually different from the previous one.  There is a lot of uncertainty, a  lack of clarification, a lot of traders are still asking themselves and  trying to ask the government what they're supposed to be doing with this  monetary transition - uncertainty, lack of - a lot of doubt, a lot of doubt  is definitely what's pervading the ground here in Caracas.  </p><p>Whilst it's been transpiring in this Monday here in Caracas that has been  declared a bank holiday, because the government wanted to avoid any trouble  and wanted to smooth this economic transition as much as possible.  So they  declared today, all offices and all - and most of the shops are closed, so  this uncertainly still prevails, Bianna.  </p><p>GOLODRYGA:  And Stefano, I was just in Peru a few weeks ago, and while they  said that they feel for Venezuelans there, and initially were opening the  doors for migrants to come in, as we mentioned in the lead, many of the  countries are just overwhelmed - the neighboring countries - by the  thousands of Venezuelans fleeing by the day.  What can be done?  </p><p>POZZZEBON:  Exactly.  The Venezuelan economic and social collapse is  spreading to the rest of Latin America, just a few days ago, the Ambassador  to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, was on the border between Venezuela and  Colombia.  She was on the border there to say to the Colombian authorities  and to show to the Colombian authorities that the U.S. where they are  present and ready to help.  </p><p>Hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans aren't leaving this country, fleeing  this social and economic collapse and they're going south.  They are going  mainly to Colombia, Ecuador, Peru as you mentioned, Argentina and Chile and  Brazil, of course on the other side.  The rest of the region has organized  themselves in a sort of informal group called the Group of Lima of  countries - 14 countries in the west hemisphere trying to put pressure on  Nicolas Maduro and his government - on the Maduro government to try and  open up the economy and try to at least decrease this massive, massive flow  of migrants that are spreading all over Latin America, Bianna.  </p><p>[16:20:06]  </p><p>GOLODRYGA:  And it's just heartbreaking to watch, and of course, this comes  just a week after that failed drone attack against Maduro as well.  Stefano  Pozzebon, thank you for joining us.  </p><p>Well, Greece has successfully finished the third and final round of its  emergency loan program.  The one that has stopped the country from going  bust.  It has been part of the biggest economic bailout in financial  history, with severe cost to the Greek people for nearly nine years.   Richard Quest reports.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)  </p><p>RICHARD QUEST, CNN INTERNATIONAL HOST:  Greece, a country about to stand on  its own two financial feet again.  At midnight on Monday, Greece exited its  final bailout program.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>PIERRE MOSCOVICI, EU FINANCE CHIEF:  There is no more program for Greece.   There won't be any more program for Greece.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>QUEST:  It marks an end, at least for now, to nearly a decade of financial  life support.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>THANOS VAMVAKIDIS, BANK OF AMERICA, MERRILL LYNCH:  This is a pause to  development particularly now that the Greek economy has finally started  recovering, and the end of the program coincides with an agreement on the  debt.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>QUEST:  Greece's odyssey began in the wake of the financial crisis.   Teetering on the brink of bankruptcy, the EU and IMF initiated the first of  three Greek bailouts.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>MOSCOVICI:  Last night, we reached an agreement.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>QUEST:  Hundreds of  billions of dollars were provided, in exchange, for a  promise of Greek government reforms, tax increases, and relentless  austerity for the Greek people.  The drama played out on the streets of  Athens and threatened to tear apart the architecture of the Eurozone.  </p><p>Cutting with a cord from financial rescue won't be easy.  Since 2010, the  Greek economy shrunk by more than a quarter, and unemployment still hovers  around 20 percent.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>VAMVAKIDIS:  There is no doubt that the fiscal assessment in Greece has  been brutal.  Historically, this has never happened before in any country.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>QUEST:  Despite Europe's generous relief package, Greece's debt levels are  still the highest in the EU.  And in a July report, the IMF was skeptical  about the country's long-term prospects.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>VAMVAKIDIS:  Is it going to be going back to old habits?  Which will be  very negative for markets, or we're going to finally see an ambitious  agenda for reforms that will lead to more investment and more growth in the  long-term?  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>QUEST:  Many Greeks saw the terms of the bailout as a humiliating life  sentence.  Monday's exit may be the start of a long parole. Richard Quest,  CNN.  </p><p>(END VIDEO TAPE)  </p><p>GOLODRYGA:  Well, since the Greek crisis started, Europe has gone through a  political transformation, from the rise of populist parties to Brexit, not  to mention a whole new system to cope with financial crises.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>MOSCOVICI:  Greece's transformative reforms have laid the foundations for  sustainable recovery, putting into place the fundamental conditions needed  for sustained growth, for job creation, and for sound public finances in  the years to come.  </p><p>And while I say it's the end of the crisis, it's the end of a cycle for  Greece, but it's also the end of a crisis for the Eurozone.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>GOLODRYGA:  But while the European union touts the success of the reforms,  the austerity has been brutally severe on much of the Greek people.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>MICHALIS KONSTANTINIDIS, ATHENS RESIDENT AND PENSIONER (Through a  translator):  I'm a pensioner, and on the 30th of every month, I await to  see whether my pension has been cut.  What have I got to celebrate?  </p><p>VICKY PAPACHISTOU, ATHENS RESIDENT AND ACCOUNTANT (Through a translator):   The exit from bailouts doesn't mean anything because wages won't rise,  health services are terrible - everything is terrible, so it means nothing  to us.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>GOLODRYGA:  George Papandreou is the former Prime Minister of Greece and  George Papaconstantinou is one of the country's former Finance Ministers.   Both men were in power during the first bailout and of course, gentlemen, I  remember the effortless work that you put in, the hours of dedication to  keeping your country from going off the brink.  Let me start with you, Mr.  Prime Minister.  Seeing where things are today, are things better than you  would have expected them to be or worse all these years later?  </p><p>GEORGE PAPANDREOU, FORMER PRIME MINISTER, GREECE:  Thank you for the  question.  Yes, we were at the brink of bankruptcy.  We were able to stop  that.  Luckily, it would be a great day to celebrate, but I don't think we  can celebrate.  I think as you mentioned in your program, the cost has been  huge - 25 percent loss of GDP, huge unemployment, a continuous sense of  insecurity over these years.  I think we could have done this with much  less pain much quicker.  </p><p>[16:24:55]  </p><p>PAPANDREOU:  And of course, I think we also still need to further deepen  reforms in our country.  I would say that the only justification of this,  of course, is that in the very beginning there was - we were in unchartered  waters in the European Union.  No country really knew how to deal with  this.  The European Union had never dealt with this, neither had even the  IMF dealt with something within a currency zone.  </p><p>So this was of course, a trial and error in the beginning, and unluckily,  there was also a sense of punishment that Greeks had overspent.  We did  have our problems, we did have our responsibilities.  The previous  government before I took over had ballooned the budget deficit and doubled  the debt, yes, but then we were there on making big reforms, and I think  rather having more solidarity from the European Union, there was a sense we  had to be punished and Greek people have taken the brunt of these  sacrifices.  </p><p>I think we could have done it much more easily.  Still, there would have  been pain, but we could have come out much more quickly.  There is another  one other point I would like to make is that, compared to other countries  such as Ireland, Portugal, and Cyprus, we did not have the political  consensus inside Greece, which was there in those countries, and I think  that played an important role in not giving the support but also the  credibility to the global markets and the European Union.  </p><p>GOLODRYGA:  Yes, that's an understatement.  We all recall the protests and  fires that we would witness there almost on a daily basis on the streets of  Athens.  Mr. Finance Minister, let me ask you this because we talk about  the country turning a page now, maybe very slowly, nonetheless turning a  page, but you have a third of the population of 10 million people near  poverty.  Unemployment has fallen, but it's still at 19.5 percent, the  highest in the Eurozone.  What can be done to avoid a dark decade or a lost  era and decade like we saw in Japan in the '80s?  </p><p>GEORGE PAPACONSTANTINOU, FORMER FINANCE MINISTER OF GREECE:  Well, if you  look forward, the main problem the country will have is that nobody gives  its growth prospects exceeding 1 percent, 1.5 percent a year in the long  run.  That's really slow.  It's too slow to repay the debt, it's too slow  to create jobs, it's too slow to increase people's incomes.  And the only  way to do better than that, is to have massive inward foreign investment.   And together, with something like a productivity revolution, that's the  only thing I will say it works.  </p><p>Because as it looks at the moment, we're going to be going in a slow growth  road, of which we'll simply not be able to bring back what Greeks have lost  over those years.  And make no mistake, given the situation we were eight  years ago, nine years ago, a lot of what happened was completely  unavoidable, but it's true, just like Mr. Papandreou said before me, part  of it was avoidable.  Part of it was due to mistakes made both on the Greek  side and the part of our European partners.  </p><p>GOLODRYGA:  Mr. Finance Minister, let me  ask you about the other crises  that are continuing to play out throughout Europe.  You've got Brexit,  obviously, you've got the economic crisis in Turkey.  What has you most  concerned as an expert and as somebody who has taken part in an economic  crisis?  </p><p>PAPACONSTANTINOU:  Well, we are now nine years since the Eurozone crisis  started.  We realized too late that it was not just a problem of one  country, Greece, we had a systemic problem having to do with the  architecture of the euro, and the financial architecture of the Eurozone.   This was a discovery that came too late.  </p><p>We started repairing the house.  We have done a number of things, but we're  not - we haven't yet been able to say that we have created an environment  which is - can withstand the future crisis better than it did the last one.  </p><p>Because remember, today, for example, debt levels are higher everywhere  than they were before.  We have no mechanisms to deal with crisis better,  but we're still susceptible.  So whenever we think of Italy and its debt  level, when we think of Turkey destabilizing the whole region, it is very  easy for the whole of the Eurozone to succumb to a repeat of the crisis,  and that's because we were not courageous enough at the European level to  complete the banking union, because the problem with the banks was at the  core of the Eurozone crisis to move much further in the fiscal union, and  to have a truly economic union, which was supposed to be designed in the  first place.  </p><p>GOLODRYGA:  And to add to that, you have the uncertainty coming from the  U.S. and the President's tariffs, as well, with European traders.  Mr.  Prime Minister, let me finally ask you -- </p><p>[16:30:16]  </p><p>PAPACONSTANTINOU: Indeed -- </p><p>GOLODRYGA:  Let me ask you about your thoughts on how one of your  successors Mr. Tsipras is doing now in his job as prime minister running  the country.  Do you have faith in the direction that he's taken the  country thus far and going forward? </p><p>PAPANDREOU:  Well, let me just add to the previous comment that Zoe  Konstantopoulou(ph) made, Europe show that when it works together in unison  -- for example, when Mario Draghi came out and said we will do whatever it  takes, we actually calm the markets.</p><p>So I think what came out of this is that, one hand, Greece said we want to  remain, we're not leaving Europe, we believe in Europe despite the fact  that we think things should change.  But on the other hand that we must  believe that Europe does have capacity, we slowly built up some mechanisms,  we hadn't completed this project, we need to do more. </p><p>And I think more Europe is what will be able to help us mitigate some of  the global crisis, whether it's called the refugee crisis, whether it's  dealing with Internet privacy, whether it's dealing with financial crisis  or pandemics or whatever.</p><p>I think we need to see on this experience that going back to the populous,  nationalist view of solving our problems is not going anywhere.  We're not  going to solve climate change or refugee issue by going it alone.  I think  that's the first thing.</p><p>I think the second point that you asked me about -- well, we are paying  dearly for the -- particularly the first few months of the Tsipras  government.  We avoided bankruptcy in 2010, we almost went to bankruptcy in  2015 with capital control of the banks, almost left to Europe, and that  cost him, cost him some credibility, cost him in more borrowing and cost  him more recession and  therefore more cuts to be able to deal with the  budget deficit.</p><p>Obviously, after that, Tsipras fell in line, but as he was an anti -- to  anti-adjustment program, he didn't really have much else to do, so when he  did fall in line, I believe he missed an opportunity to go deeper into  making the necessary reforms for Greece. </p><p>My belief is that austerity was over emphasized when you get to do deeper  reforms.  I'll just give you an example -- </p><p>GOLODRYGA:  OK -- </p><p>PAPANDREOU:  When we brought in -- </p><p>GOLODRYGA:  OK -- </p><p>PAPANDREOU:  Transparency -- </p><p>GOLODRYGA:  OK -- </p><p>PAPANDREOU:  The E-prescriptions in the medical sector, we cut graph that  cost like 50 percent, that's 3 billion, we cut -- that's as much as we make  and properly, that is in Greece.  So there are ways that we should have had  more emphasis on reform, less emphasis on austerity.</p><p>That's partly a European and the IMF blame and partly of course blame of  successive governments that were not really committed to make a deal with  vested interest and make the changes necessary.  That's what we need to do  now -- </p><p>GOLODRYGA:  We'll -- </p><p>PAPANDREOU:  I think now we can think about the rules of the crisis, it's a  new phase, but we need to move forward and research great capacities  sustainably following.</p><p>GOLODRYGA:  And this phase and nonetheless a big milestone as well.   Gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us, we appreciate it.  And we will  be right back.</p><p>[16:35:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>GOLODRYGA:  Hello, I'm Bianna Golodryga, coming up on the next half hour of  QUEST MEANS BUSINESS, Twitter's chief executive tells us the company may  have fallen behind in cleaning up the site.  And one of the world's biggest  oil companies is giving up on Iran as new sanctions loom ahead.</p><p>But first, these are the top news headlines we're following this hour.   Pope Francis has acknowledged the Catholic Church's failure to act over  sexual abuse against children, describing his shame and repentance.  A  thousand children were alleged abused by priests in Pennsylvania.</p><p>Pope Francis says the children were abandoned and that no apology would  ever be enough.  And in Italy's Calabria region, authorities say at least  eight people have been killed in flooding.  Heavy rains pushed what's  normally a small stream over its banks.</p><p>It's not clear how many people have gone missing, but more than 100  rescuers are searching for survivors.  And some news just in, U.S.  President Donald Trump is again criticizing the Federal Reserve over  raising interest rates.  In an interview with \"Reuters\", he said he was not  thrilled with Fed Chairman Jerome Powell. </p><p>Trump then said he should be given some help by the Fed.  Historically,  presidents private preserve the Fed's political independence by not  commenting on its policy.  </p><p>The United States has a disease, that's according to Iran's foreign  minister.  The country is addicted to sanctions.  In an exclusive interview  with Nick Paton Walsh, Mohammad Javad Zarif says he was wrong when he  believed America had learned from past mistakes. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MOHAMMAD JAVAD ZARIF, FOREIGN MINISTER, IRAN:  I believe there is a disease  in the United States, and that is the addiction to sanctions.  Even during  the Obama administration, the United States put more emphasis on keeping  the sanctions that they had not lifted rather than implementing its  obligations on the sanctions that they've lifted. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>GOLODRYGA:  Meanwhile, Iran's oil minister says Total has officially left  the country and pending U.S. sanctions forced the French oil giant to  unwind all its Iran operations including a major development to develop a  natural gas field.</p><p>John Defterios joins me now.  John, how significant is this move from  Total?</p><p>JOHN DEFTERIOS, CNN EMERGING MARKETS EDITOR:  Well, it's one of the most  telegraphed moves in the business, Bianna, that's for sure.  But it still  comes as a blow for Iran because total is the first international oil  company to go back in after the lifting of the sanctions.</p><p>In fact, Patrick Pouyanne; the CEO told me back in May during the CNN  roundtable there, Vladimir Putin summit that sometimes politics and  business don't dovetail together, and this is one of those instances  without exemptions they couldn't stay in the market. </p><p>And it boils down in large part because of Wall Street, that's where they  get a third of their shareholder base, two-thirds of their financing comes  from Wall Street, they have physical plans in America.  We also have to  think about the repatriation of funds, once you make money in Iran because  of their reach of the U.S. Treasury and the Federal Reserve. </p><p>CNPC of China was in the front seat to take over the share, but I would  imagine they're driving a pretty hard bargain because there's not a lot of  buyers out there.  So Iran was not able to announce somebody taking over  the state as Total decided to exit the market. </p><p>[16:40:00] GOLODRYGA:  What was the point that Zarif was trying to make in  his statements there that the U.S. has an addiction.  Who was he speaking  to?</p><p>DEFTERIOS:  Well, he was speaking in particular to the U.S. Congress  because they have to follow through in the Trump sanctions and both houses  of course controlled by the Republicans right now.  But as the trigger- happy Donald Trump using sanctions right across the board including with  the ally of Iran right now which is Turkey.</p><p>Let's take a look at where Iran stood in terms of overall production and  what's going to happen to their exports going forward.  They're the third  largest producer within OPEC right now, Bianna, at 3.8 million barrels.   But it's the exports, what I found interesting here.</p><p>They surged in the last couple of months at 2.9 million barrels a day.   When I went to those fields at the end of 2015, they were pumping out just  a million of exports and they said they would try to get it up to 2.5,  nobody thought they could get close to 3 million barrels a day.</p><p>The target by Donald Trump by the way is to take it down to zero in the  second round of this snap-back sanctions in November.  Realistically, FACTS  Global Energy is saying there should be about 700,000 barrels a day.  We  have to watch the big three buyers of that crude. </p><p>China, India of course are one and two, and number three is Korea.  Korea  has  a sanctions on by the U.S.  I don't see China bending because there  are investors in the projects right now, and India with a relationship  between Donald Trump and Mr. Modi; the Prime Minister, you could see them  caving, but the Prime Minister of India said we're going to try to stay  with Iran right now.</p><p>And again, they got a good deal because Iran doesn't have all the customers  they had just six months ago.</p><p>GOLODRYGA:  John Defterios, we'll have to leave it there, thank you, we  appreciate it.</p><p>DEFTERIOS:  Thanks. </p><p>GOLODRYGA:  Well, Kevin Spacey's latest film is giving Box Office laugh a  whole new meaning.  The movie is called \"Billionaires Boys Club\", but the  money, well, it isn't exactly falling in, we'll explain more coming up  next. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>GOLODRYGA:  Well, Kevin Spacey's new film has taken just $618, that's  right, $618 in theaters across the U.S. this weekend -- not millions or  even thousands.  Just $610.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The (INAUDIBLE) investors to pay investors, oh, you  knew? </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I'm from Wall Street.  You think people really get rich  playing by the rules?   </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>[16:45:00] GOLODRYGA:  The movie billionaire boys club actually gained a  little momentum over the weekend after it took just $126 at the Box Office,  Friday.  This all follows allegations of sexual misconduct against Kevin  Spacey.  CNN's Chloe Melas joins me now.</p><p>And a lot of people were having double takes right there, saying that  number, thinking there's no way a movie can only gross $618, it opened in  10 cities.</p><p>CHLOE MELAS, CNN ENTERTAINMENT REPORTER:  It is a jaw-dropping figure  especially when you're talking about a man, a leading man in Hollywood who  at one point had a $52.5 million opening for \"Superman Returns\" in 2006.   So obviously, that number right there is jarring. </p><p>Also there was a big cast in this movie, he had a supporting role, Kevin  Spacey.  You had Ansel Elgort who was a big heart drop here in the U.S.,  you had Emma Roberts, so you had some other big names that you would have  thought might help carry this.</p><p>So it only opened in 10 theaters, right? But again, if you're going to  compare it to some of like the worst movies of 2017 when it comes to Box  Office opening weekend, the movie, \"The Comedian\", starring Leslie Mann and  Robert De Niro, that made $10,000 at the Box Office, so again, not a lot. </p><p>Maybe if this had opened in more theaters, they put no marketing behind  this, and when you look at all the money in the world where Sony cut Spacey  out and recast him with Christopher Plummer. </p><p>The film studio behind this movie \"Billionaires Boys Club\", they said that  they didn't have the budget to go do that.  That's so expensive to have to  reshoot scenes and cut him out.  We were hoping that people were going to  still go see it. </p><p>GOLODRYGA:  It just makes Gillie(ph) look like a cash cow, but if this was  filmed three years ago, given everything that's developed over the past  year with the Me Too movement, why even release it at this point? </p><p>MELAS:  Well, so first of all, if this had been years ago, probably would  have done -- </p><p>GOLODRYGA:  Right -- </p><p>MELAS:  Millions at the Box Office.  I think that they felt as though Kevin  Spacey had a very small role in the film, well, not too small, but a  supporting role, and that the other big names would carry it.</p><p>I think that what this goes to show you is that the Me Too movement, when  allegations come out against these very powerful men in Hollywood, oh, how  mighty they fall and it really does affect Box Office success.  And that  is, now studios have to look at this as an example as to, all right, well,  if we have some other leading men have allegations against them, it might  hurt us.</p><p>So maybe better to recast or put the movie on pause and then revisit it  later.  But again, this is a perfect example of how the Me Too movement -- </p><p>GOLODRYGA:  Right -- </p><p>MELAS:  Can hurt Box Office success -- </p><p>GOLODRYGA:  Drizzle(ph) effect, and have we heard from Kevin Spacey at all? </p><p>MELAS:  Nothing.  I was just talking to Ashleigh Banfield who is an anchor  here at CNN about this, and Cricket from Kevin Spacey, ever since those  first allegations came out against him in October and after our exclusive  report at CNN about the misconduct on the set of \"House of Cards\" on his  show on Netflix.</p><p>So now we've heard nothing from him, you would expect some sort of a  statement at some point, nothing.  </p><p>GOLODRYGA:  A lot of negative reaction though when he said he was going in  for therapy and seem to equate his sexuality -- </p><p>MELAS:  Yes -- </p><p>GOLODRYGA:  With the accusations against him, which you know, the two are  extremely -- </p><p>MELAS:  Coming out and apologizing, but also saying, well, I didn't mean to  come on to that boy when he was a teenager, but I'm also gay.  Again -- </p><p>GOLODRYGA:  Yes -- </p><p>MELAS:  To equate these two things enraged many people.</p><p>GOLODRYGA:  Yes -- </p><p>MELAS:  But perhaps he still just doesn't have quite the right words of  what to say.</p><p>GOLODRYGA:  Well, I don't know how you respond to a movie opening at the  \"Billionaires Boys Club\" too at that title, $618 -- </p><p>MELAS:  No -- </p><p>GOLODRYGA:  Wow, yes, Chloe, great to have you on -- </p><p>MELAS:  Thank you -- </p><p>GOLODRYGA:  Good to see you, thank you.  Well, Twitter is facing a barrage  of criticism from spam and abuse to misinformation.  CEO Jack Dorsey opens  up to CNN about the challenges the company is facing, that's just ahead.</p><p>[16:50:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>GOLODRYGA:  The chief executive of Twitter says the social platform has a  toxic problem with content.  Jack Dorsey was speaking to our very own Brian  Stelter who is here with me.  Fascinating interview played -- </p><p>BRIAN STELTER, CNN SENIOR MEDIA CORRESPONDENT:  Yes -- </p><p>GOLODRYGA:  Out over the weekend.  You addressed a lot of issues, did you  walk away with the feeling that he has a grasp of the level of issues and  the severity of the issues that they're dealing with?</p><p>STELTER:  Well, I think he's asking the right questions, I think he's  addressing the right problems.  But he doesn't have all the answers yet, he  doesn't have the solutions, and he readily admits that.  You know, he  sounded at times like a philosopher, thinking about the impact of  technology. </p><p>And less like the CEO of a major tech company.  But he did acknowledge that  individuals increasingly have fears of big tech companies.  Here's a part  of what Dorsey told me.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>JACK DORSEY, CO-FOUNDER &amp; CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, TWITTER:  When we  started the company in the service 12 years ago, we weren't necessarily  thinking about some of the repercussions from our actions.  And they looked  quite small at the time.</p><p>For instance, we thought, you know, well, people are following you, so we  should count them and then we should put that count right on your profile  page and obviously people care about that, so we should make it big.</p><p>But that one small choice and it felt very small at the time and it felt  obvious at the time.  Put an incentive to grow that number, is that the  right attention? Is that the right incentive that we should be driving? I  don't think it is today, I don't think it matters as much in context of how  many conversations you have or how much you contribute back to the network.</p><p>And like is another good example where you know, when you tweet and you  don't get a lot of likes and you feel bad about it, is that the incentive  we really want to drive? Is that what we're actually trying to encourage  people to think about?</p><p>The answer is yes because it's in the product.  And another good example  that I think will help a lot of what we're trying to do and health is what  we see with eco-chambers.  We only give people one tool right now which is  to follow an account.</p><p>STELTER:  You want people to be able to follow stories or subjects or  hashtags?</p><p>DORSEY:  Yes, I mean, we've been focusing a lot of the service today more,  and vying(ph) it more towards topics or towards interests.</p><p>STELTER:  It sounds like you are willing and ready and willing to rebuild  the entire house, to renovate everything.</p><p>DORSEY:  We're ready to questions everything.  I mean, I -- we've cleaned  so much in Twitter over the past 12 years, and I know it doesn't always  feel that way, but we've changed a lot, but we haven't changed the  underlying fundamental.</p><p>STELTER:  What is the timeline for re-examining how you so follow accounts  or the use of the like button.</p><p>DORSEY:  You know, we're looking at and thinking about all these things.   Right now, we've definitely had conversations about them -- </p><p>STELTER:  But would you say like by the end of the year there's going to be  those fundamental changes to Twitter?</p><p>DORSEY:  I don't -- I worry about a timeframe like that because we also  need to take into consideration -- we're a small company, I mean, we in  comparison with our peers -- we're a small company, but we have this out- size impact and I believe the importance.</p><p>And there's a lot of what's in Twitter that you would find in a public  square, to use the older analogy -- </p><p>STELTER:  You mean all the graffiti on the walls?</p><p>DORSEY:  No, well, there's part of that, but there's also a really amazing  open conversation, and I'm going to see if we're ready to walk up to anyone  and strike something up.  So there's positives and there's what people  perceive to be negative as well.</p><p>[16:55:00] STELTER:  Look, I met my wife on Twitter, I'm always going to  love Twitter.  And I kind of feel like it's a garden that's been overrun by  weeds.  Do you feel like you're the gardener just struggling to keep up?</p><p>DORSEY:  There are certainly times where we felt like we're behind.  But  that goes back to my point of like we need to be really good with  prioritizing and sequencing and understanding what matters most.  So if the  incentives are going to have greatest impact, then we should prioritize  that.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>GOLODRYGA:  So clearly, a lot of challenges, he's addressing them, and you  said that was a big step for him to speak out to you.  The president also  is addressing this issue in an interview with \"Reuters\" as we speak -- </p><p>STELTER:  Yes, in an interview with \"Reuters\" in the past few minutes.  The  president is reiterating his complaints about these big tech companies,  saying it's very dangerous that they self-regulate content.  I think what  he means is the rules of the role, the Twitter and Facebook and Google have  to decide when you violate terms of service, when something might be hate  speech or something, these are issues that Twitter and Facebook grappling  with. </p><p>And we're hearing prominent conservatives including up to the president of  the United States saying, you know, these rules, you have to be careful, it  seems like you're targeting conservatives.  Now the companies very much  deny that.</p><p>Dorsey denied that to me in the interview, he said this is not a bad  ideology and we're deciding whether to suspend or block someone, we're not  doing it based on political point of view.  But that idea of discrimination  of bias is a very powerful potent idea and it's been used in the midterm  elections here in the U.S. to say the new problem is big tech.</p><p>That it used to be the liberal mainstream media, now it's the liberal  technology companies -- </p><p>GOLODRYGA:  Yes -- </p><p>STELTER:  And with that in mind, it's so interesting to hear Dorsey say  we're not that big.</p><p>GOLODRYGA:  Yes -- </p><p>STELTER:  We're small compared to our peers.</p><p>GOLODRYGA:  Yes -- </p><p>STELTER:  We don't have unlimited resources to monitor and police this  website.  It's kind of like hearing someone who is in charge of a town say  we only have so many cops, we can't hire more police officers, it's not a  very encouraging thing to hear.</p><p>GOLODRYGA:  Not as if he prefers to be in the shadows with the Facebook in  the spotlight, now that it's his turn, he's facing a lot of questions as  well, you've got the First Amendment, you've got hate speech, you've the  president weighing in, but I was happy to hear that there's good news  coming out of Twitter, and that people still fall in love, like you and  your wife.</p><p>STELTER:  Yes -- </p><p>GOLODRYGA:  You've got a beautiful baby out in the -- </p><p>STELTER:  I love Twitter for that reason -- </p><p>GOLODRYGA:  Yes -- </p><p>STELTER:  That's right, but Twitter seem really pleasant in those days, not  so much anymore.</p><p>GOLODRYGA:  Yes, lot to the world now -- </p><p>STELTER:  Yes -- </p><p>GOLODRYGA:  Same -- even for a so-called small company. </p><p>STELTER:  Yes -- </p><p>GOLODRYGA:  Brian, thank you -- </p><p>STELTER:  Thanks.</p><p>GOLODRYGA:  And that's QUEST MEANS BUSINESS.  I am Bianna Golodryga in New  York, the news continues right here on CNN. </p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and programming copyright 2018 Cable News Network, Inc.  ALL  RIGHTS  RESERVED.

It's Monday, August 20th. Tonight, market analysts are turning on Tesla and Elon Musk. I'll speak to one of the company's biggest champions.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Pepsi makes a bet on bubbles with a $3 billion deal for SodaStream. And the end of an ominous era, Greece is finally out of its bailout program. I'm Bianna Golodryga and this is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And tonight, Wall Street turns on Elon Musk. Tesla stock is under pressure once again. Shares were down as much as 4 percent, crashing below $300.00 before recovering. America's largest bank, JP Morgan slashed its price target for Tesla to just $195.00 a share. It's a far cry from where Musk claimed he'd secure funding for a private takeover. That was when it was $420.00 a share.</p><p>The Tesla CEO is also back on late night Twitter. In a 2:30 a.m. tweet at Arianna Huffington, Musk admitted his marathon shifts on the factory floor are all that stands between Tesla and bankruptcy. Huffington wrote a plea for him to get more sleep. Musk says that is not an option.</p><p>Well, Ross Gerber is one of Tesla's most vocal and supportive investors. He is joining us in Los Angeles. Ross, you are still fighting for Tesla, and a supporter of Elon Musk. Why are you so optimistic when others are turning sour?</p><p>ROSS GERBER, TESLA INVESTOR: Because I have the car and others do not. So they have no idea what they are talking about. I literally drive this car every day, and it's the best car that's ever been made since the original Model T, so this product is a game-changer. So while everybody is distracted, worried about what Elon Musk is doing at 2:00 in the morning, what he's done is built just an amazing, transformative product, and I think that's being lost in this whole production.</p><p>GOLODRYGA: Well, the car has not gone without some of its issues and hiccups along the way. You've had whistleblowers, you've had the death of a passenger who was driving in an autonomous car. Tell me about beyond the structure of a car, the structure of the company and the dire, some would say dire financial shape that the company is currently in.</p><p>GERBER: Well, this dire financial shape with over $2.5 billion in cash and now we think the company's cash flow break even as of now and possibly cash flow positive going into the next quarter, but the main issue is scale. Could they get to 5,000 cars? Could they get this to 10,000 cars? Now, what they've been able to prove, at least in the last month is they can maintain an over 5,000 car a week runway for the Tesla Model 3, and they're moving towards 6,000 cars and now, some analysts are saying they might even be at 8,000 cars by the end of the quarter.</p><p>And we're modeling 10,000 cars a week by the end of the year, so the truth of the matter is, things are going pretty well, because he's had to put in a Herculean effort to make this work, but he is right, he has got to doing what he's doing to make sure that this gets to where it needs to be.</p><p>GOLODRYGA: If Tesla - Tesla without Elon Musk at the top?</p><p>GERBER: No, it's not, and we're betting on Elon Musk. I mean, this guy is a genius, and we can all give him a hard time when he's down, but this is a guy who can land rockets on moving ships. This is a guy who has transformed our space industry and has now has one of the greatest solutions for global climate change. It's so hot in the world, and we need Tesla to be successful, and Elon Musk is the driver of this. And some people just like to kick a guy when he's down, but please.</p><p>GOLODRYGA: But he's not just any guy, he's the head of the company. He's the man who is tweeting, without admitting - even himself admitting that he spoke to the Board about taking the company private. The SEC is launching an investigation. You've got headlines saying that Tesla suppliers fret about getting paid. I mean, would this work for a CEO to act in such erratic ways at any other company?</p><p>GERBER: Well, first of all, the President of the United States is the most erratic person who has ever been on Twitter, and he's running the country and somehow we're not all dead yet. So, I think that this modern style of management is new for a lot of people. I'm sure if Steve Jobs had Twitter, we might have different feelings, too.</p><p>I don't know if I like the way he's handling his Twitter per se at this point, but, you know, once again, this is the modern world and this is the way people communicate, including myself and the media.</p><p>[16:05:03]</p><p>GOLODRYGA: Elon has said that Tesla is going to be profitable and cash flow positive this year. If that doesn't happen, does your position on the company and Elon Musk himself change?</p><p>GERBER: Not to the point of like if it's a dollar short or something. We've modeled out that if they make 120,000 Model 3s in the next six months, they'll be break even or cash flow positive. So that's what is most important to us is that the cash flow drain stops. It doesn't necessarily have to be a huge positive, but I think the main thing is taking the financial stress off the company of that - of very heavy CapEx spending.</p><p>But what most people are discounting is that this pressure on Musk is making him a more disciplined investor in Tesla, and the way they're spending money in Tesla and the way they've slowed down the spending money of money in Tesla is actually very positive for the shareholders.</p><p>So, I think this pressure on Elon is a good thing to have to run the company, to be more profitable or to be more sustainable, and I think ultimately, when we look back at all of this, this will actually end up helping Tesla a lot be a better company in the long-term.</p><p>GOLODRYGA: Yes, he says this has been his worst year yet, so from your lips to - let's hope shareholders share your optimism going forward, and he puts that - go ahead.</p><p>GERBER: Yes, I just wanted to say, I have yet to ever see a CEO work so hard to achieve his goals, put so much - his whole life into it. Honestly, there are so few CEOs that even come close to putting in the effort that Elon is putting in to be successful. So we're going to back him and we wish him the best and hopefully, he gets some rest, but at the same respect, get these cars out there, they're a game-changer.</p><p>GOLODRYGA: Yes, we all wish him the best, that is for sure. Ross Gerber, thank you so much. We appreciate it.</p><p>Well, the future of PepsiCo just got a little bit clearer. The company is paying over $3 billion for SodaStream, the Israeli company known for home sparkling water makers. The deal is part of Pepsi's push into healthier products. CEO Indra Nooyi has split PepsiCo's offerings into three categories: Fun for you, high calorie snacks and Doritos - it's like drinks and Doritos, and well, of course Pepsi. We have them on display here. Better for you, things like diet sodas and smart food popcorn. There it is in the middle.</p><p>And then good for you, SodasStream will land in this group with products like the Naked Juice and the Sabra hummus. Brand management expert Bruce Turkel joins me live from Miami, Florida.</p><p>So Bruce, Indra has announced that she's leaving the company. This is, I guess, her parting gift and parting decision - a huge decision as the CEO with this acquisition. Is it the right one?</p><p>BRUCE TURKEL, CEO, TURKEL BRANDS: Well, what you said earlier, the segmenting of Pepsi products into those three areas, that's a very smart way for them to deal with the different pressures they have.</p><p>Now, notice they didn't call the first group of products bad for you, they called them fun for you. So clearly, it's a very strategic program. And the bottom line is, Pepsi sells soda, and they don't really care how it's made, how it's manufactured. They want to be in that distribution chain.</p><p>So in the world of customization that we all live in today, if you want to make it yourself, they want to make sure you're still buying it from them.</p><p>GOLODRYGA: You know, I remember SodaStream being a really hot product around five or six years ago. There were some celebrity endorsements. It was buzzed about almost on a daily basis. I haven't heard much lately, and that begs the question, why now? And is $3 billion a bit too much?</p><p>TURKEL: Well, why now? I think that's quite clear. Pepsi is looking to maintain its competitive level, and they want to make sure that they are taking all these different routes. Amazon has proved that direct to consumer is the future. And let's face it, if Pepsi doesn't do this, Amazon will soon be selling Amazon soda and we will be going on our Echoes and our smart devices and ordering it. So they want to make sure that they can put themselves into the area.</p><p>Whether $3 billion is the right number or not depends on a lot of things. I mean, the company wasn't worth that just a few years ago, so you could question it. The bigger question is, is it critical to Pepsi's future plans? Do they need this to make sure that they're not sitting on the wayside while they're watching us make our own custom coffee, make our own custom products, make our own custom soda.</p><p>GOLODRYGA: Well, it's clear that the trend line shows that the sale of sugary beverages and pop sodas have gone down, the sale of water has gone up. People have become more health conscious. So what does this decision mean for Coca Cola, obviously, Pepsi's archrival?</p><p>TURKEL: Well, remember that Coca Cola had gone with Kuerig with their cold device and they look to walk down this same path just a few years ago, they didn't have much success with it.</p><p>[16:10:04]</p><p>TURKEL: Does that mean it was a bad idea and will prove to be a bad idea now or does it mean the timing was wrong back then, and now, the timing is right? I don't know the answer. What I do know is that Pepsi owns a lot of water brands, a lot of bottles that you buy, that have different names on them that you like, are owned by Pepsi. So I think you can be pretty clear that Pepsi would build a brand extension model, where you'll be able to use your SodaStream in order to incorporate those brand names.</p><p>Once again, Pepsi doesn't care where the product comes from, they only care that you buy it from them.</p><p>GOLODRYGA: And obviously like so many other companies, really watching that behemoth Amazon take over market shares from lots of different areas wanting to compete and avoid having to have Amazon eat their lunch. All right, we'll have to leave it there. Thank you so much.</p><p>TURKEL: And eat their lunch or drink their water --</p><p>GOLODRYGA: Or drink their water, that's right, in this case at least. Well, U.S. markets closed higher across the board. Nike shares helped boost the Dow. The S&amp;P 500 also finished close to an all-time high. On Wednesday, the current U.S. bull market will become, get this, the longest in history. This will be a big week for U.S. retail earnings. Kohl's reports tomorrow, Target on Wednesday and GAP on Thursday.</p><p>Also on Thursday, new tariffs are scheduled to take effect in the trade war between the U.S. and China. On Friday, Jerome Powell speaks at the Federal Reserve's annual symposium in Jackson Hole. One trader told Paula Newton on \"QUEST EXPRESS\" that he's still optimistic.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)</p><p>MATTHEW CHESLOCK, EQUITY TRADER, VIRTU FINANCIAL: We expect that U.S. earnings to be good for by and large, they were good. They took us to these levels here. Now we're seeing more of a broader based rally, which is good. We're not just seeing this tech focused or the FANG names really drive us to new highs, we're starting to see other companies participate and that's been the key to the strength of this market.</p><p>PAULA NEWTON, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Now, the earnings have been stellar, but what about the market's resilience or perhaps some would call it hear no evil, see no evil about trade, just about some of the dark debt issues that have been coming, both from the fiscal point of view, both from government, and in corporate debt. Any of those issues - higher interest rates, anything - give me something, Matt. Anything.</p><p>CHESLOCK: You know what, I'm normally kind of negative and bearish as a whole --</p><p>NEWTON: Cautious, right?</p><p>CHESLOCK: Yes, a little cautious is good, that would be nice. But I think right now, this is time. I mean, we're seeing - if we can get retail back on board this week, we've got a lot of big retailers coming out, and this was after Walmart. So we have Kohl's and we have got Target, we've got all of these other U.S. company retailers that are - we're hoping for good things. This is a good sign for the economy. This says that main stream America is on board and they're using their money. So, I don't see anything right now. The worry for me was always the midterm elections.</p><p>NEWTON: Got you.</p><p>CHESLOCK: And I'm not so sure that's raising its head just yet.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GOLODRYGA: The midterms just a few months away and I see some optimism there though. Well, Brazil, Zimbabwe, Turkey, and now Venezuela. The bolivar is getting its zeroes trimmed; it's part of Maduro's magic formula for recovery. So, will it work? We're live in Caracas.</p><p>And Greece has completed one of the biggest economic bailouts in history. We'll hear from the country's former Finance Minister, Yanis Varoufakis who says nothing has changed.</p><p>[16:15:00]</p><p>GOLODRYGA: Venezuelan President, Nicolas Maduro claims he's found the quote, \"magic formula\" to get his country's economy back on track. A new currency, the sovereign bolivar slashes five zeros off of the old one. It effectively drops the bolivar's value by more than 90 percent after rampant inflation.</p><p>He also announced that next month, the minimum wage will be multiplied by 60 times. It all comes as thousands of Venezuelans fleeing the crisis are facing increasing hostility in the region. Brazil is deploying troops to the border after a mob destroyed a migrant camp. Peru and Ecuador are putting restrictive measures in place to curb the exodus.</p><p>Stefano Pozzebon is in Caracas with the latest. So, Stefano, do the locals there believe this magic formula will get the country out of the economic crisis it's in?</p><p>STEFANO POZZEBON, JOURNALIST: It's hard to believe so, Bianna, because what does formula do? It's effectively just taking five zeros out of the previous currency, the strong bolivar, the bolivar fuerte as it was called. From today, starting today, all those zeros will be taken back. We're going to stop paying coffees by the million. I remember yesterday, I paid for a coffee with about 2.5 million bolivars and this will change. I am going to go back and spend and counting our currency by the units, like 25 bolivars, 20 bolivars.</p><p>This is - I have here, this is the new bolivar. So one thing that I wanted to show you, Bianna, one of the reasons why people are so skeptical about this measure is that nowhere in this bank note you can read the sovereign bolivar, nowhere in this bank note - you can read that this note is actually different from the previous one. There is a lot of uncertainty, a lack of clarification, a lot of traders are still asking themselves and trying to ask the government what they're supposed to be doing with this monetary transition - uncertainty, lack of - a lot of doubt, a lot of doubt is definitely what's pervading the ground here in Caracas.</p><p>Whilst it's been transpiring in this Monday here in Caracas that has been declared a bank holiday, because the government wanted to avoid any trouble and wanted to smooth this economic transition as much as possible. So they declared today, all offices and all - and most of the shops are closed, so this uncertainly still prevails, Bianna.</p><p>GOLODRYGA: And Stefano, I was just in Peru a few weeks ago, and while they said that they feel for Venezuelans there, and initially were opening the doors for migrants to come in, as we mentioned in the lead, many of the countries are just overwhelmed - the neighboring countries - by the thousands of Venezuelans fleeing by the day. What can be done?</p><p>POZZZEBON: Exactly. The Venezuelan economic and social collapse is spreading to the rest of Latin America, just a few days ago, the Ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, was on the border between Venezuela and Colombia. She was on the border there to say to the Colombian authorities and to show to the Colombian authorities that the U.S. where they are present and ready to help.</p><p>Hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans aren't leaving this country, fleeing this social and economic collapse and they're going south. They are going mainly to Colombia, Ecuador, Peru as you mentioned, Argentina and Chile and Brazil, of course on the other side. The rest of the region has organized themselves in a sort of informal group called the Group of Lima of countries - 14 countries in the west hemisphere trying to put pressure on Nicolas Maduro and his government - on the Maduro government to try and open up the economy and try to at least decrease this massive, massive flow of migrants that are spreading all over Latin America, Bianna.</p><p>[16:20:06]</p><p>GOLODRYGA: And it's just heartbreaking to watch, and of course, this comes just a week after that failed drone attack against Maduro as well. Stefano Pozzebon, thank you for joining us.</p><p>Well, Greece has successfully finished the third and final round of its emergency loan program. The one that has stopped the country from going bust.

Richard Quest, CNN.</p><p>(END VIDEO TAPE)</p><p>GOLODRYGA: Well, since the Greek crisis started, Europe has gone through a political transformation, from the rise of populist parties to Brexit, not to mention a whole new system to cope with financial crises.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MOSCOVICI: Greece's transformative reforms have laid the foundations for sustainable recovery, putting into place the fundamental conditions needed for sustained growth, for job creation, and for sound public finances in the years to come.</p><p>And while I say it's the end of the crisis, it's the end of a cycle for Greece, but it's also the end of a crisis for the Eurozone.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GOLODRYGA: But while the European union touts the success of the reforms, the austerity has been brutally severe on much of the Greek people.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MICHALIS KONSTANTINIDIS, ATHENS RESIDENT AND PENSIONER (Through a translator): I'm a pensioner, and on the 30th of every month, I await to see whether my pension has been cut. What have I got to celebrate?</p><p>VICKY PAPACHISTOU, ATHENS RESIDENT AND ACCOUNTANT (Through a translator): The exit from bailouts doesn't mean anything because wages won't rise, health services are terrible - everything is terrible, so it means nothing to us.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GOLODRYGA: George Papandreou is the former Prime Minister of Greece and George Papaconstantinou is one of the country's former Finance Ministers. Both men were in power during the first bailout and of course, gentlemen, I remember the effortless work that you put in, the hours of dedication to keeping your country from going off the brink. Let me start with you, Mr. Prime Minister. Seeing where things are today, are things better than you would have expected them to be or worse all these years later?</p><p>GEORGE PAPANDREOU, FORMER PRIME MINISTER, GREECE: Thank you for the question. Yes, we were at the brink of bankruptcy. We were able to stop that. Luckily, it would be a great day to celebrate, but I don't think we can celebrate. I think as you mentioned in your program, the cost has been huge - 25 percent loss of GDP, huge unemployment, a continuous sense of insecurity over these years. I think we could have done this with much less pain much quicker.</p><p>[16:24:55]</p><p>PAPANDREOU: And of course, I think we also still need to further deepen reforms in our country. I would say that the only justification of this, of course, is that in the very beginning there was - we were in unchartered waters in the European Union. No country really knew how to deal with this. The European Union had never dealt with this, neither had even the IMF dealt with something within a currency zone.</p><p>So this was of course, a trial and error in the beginning, and unluckily, there was also a sense of punishment that Greeks had overspent. We did have our problems, we did have our responsibilities. The previous government before I took over had ballooned the budget deficit and doubled the debt, yes, but then we were there on making big reforms, and I think rather having more solidarity from the European Union, there was a sense we had to be punished and Greek people have taken the brunt of these sacrifices.</p><p>I think we could have done it much more easily. Still, there would have been pain, but we could have come out much more quickly. There is another one other point I would like to make is that, compared to other countries such as Ireland, Portugal, and Cyprus, we did not have the political consensus inside Greece, which was there in those countries, and I think that played an important role in not giving the support but also the credibility to the global markets and the European Union.</p><p>GOLODRYGA: Yes, that's an understatement. We all recall the protests and fires that we would witness there almost on a daily basis on the streets of Athens. Mr. Finance Minister, let me ask you this because we talk about the country turning a page now, maybe very slowly, nonetheless turning a page, but you have a third of the population of 10 million people near poverty. Unemployment has fallen, but it's still at 19.5 percent, the highest in the Eurozone. What can be done to avoid a dark decade or a lost era and decade like we saw in Japan in the '80s?</p><p>GEORGE PAPACONSTANTINOU, FORMER FINANCE MINISTER OF GREECE: Well, if you look forward, the main problem the country will have is that nobody gives its growth prospects exceeding 1 percent, 1.5 percent a year in the long run. That's really slow. It's too slow to repay the debt, it's too slow to create jobs, it's too slow to increase people's incomes. And the only way to do better than that, is to have massive inward foreign investment. And together, with something like a productivity revolution, that's the only thing I will say it works.</p><p>Because as it looks at the moment, we're going to be going in a slow growth road, of which we'll simply not be able to bring back what Greeks have lost over those years. And make no mistake, given the situation we were eight years ago, nine years ago, a lot of what happened was completely unavoidable, but it's true, just like Mr. Papandreou said before me, part of it was avoidable. Part of it was due to mistakes made both on the Greek side and the part of our European partners.</p><p>GOLODRYGA: Mr. Finance Minister, let me ask you about the other crises that are continuing to play out throughout Europe. You've got Brexit, obviously, you've got the economic crisis in Turkey. What has you most concerned as an expert and as somebody who has taken part in an economic crisis?</p><p>PAPACONSTANTINOU: Well, we are now nine years since the Eurozone crisis started. We realized too late that it was not just a problem of one country, Greece, we had a systemic problem having to do with the architecture of the euro, and the financial architecture of the Eurozone. This was a discovery that came too late.</p><p>We started repairing the house. We have done a number of things, but we're not - we haven't yet been able to say that we have created an environment which is - can withstand the future crisis better than it did the last one.</p><p>Because remember, today, for example, debt levels are higher everywhere than they were before. We have no mechanisms to deal with crisis better, but we're still susceptible. So whenever we think of Italy and its debt level, when we think of Turkey destabilizing the whole region, it is very easy for the whole of the Eurozone to succumb to a repeat of the crisis, and that's because we were not courageous enough at the European level to complete the banking union, because the problem with the banks was at the core of the Eurozone crisis to move much further in the fiscal union, and to have a truly economic union, which was supposed to be designed in the first place.</p><p>GOLODRYGA: And to add to that, you have the uncertainty coming from the U.S. and the President's tariffs, as well, with European traders. Mr. Prime Minister, let me finally ask you --</p><p>[16:30:16]</p><p>PAPACONSTANTINOU: Indeed --</p><p>GOLODRYGA: Let me ask you about your thoughts on how one of your successors Mr. Tsipras is doing now in his job as prime minister running the country. Do you have faith in the direction that he's taken the country thus far and going forward?</p><p>PAPANDREOU: Well, let me just add to the previous comment that Zoe Konstantopoulou(ph) made, Europe show that when it works together in unison -- for example, when Mario Draghi came out and said we will do whatever it takes, we actually calm the markets.</p><p>So I think what came out of this is that, one hand, Greece said we want to remain, we're not leaving Europe, we believe in Europe despite the fact that we think things should change. But on the other hand that we must believe that Europe does have capacity, we slowly built up some mechanisms, we hadn't completed this project, we need to do more.</p><p>And I think more Europe is what will be able to help us mitigate some of the global crisis, whether it's called the refugee crisis, whether it's dealing with Internet privacy, whether it's dealing with financial crisis or pandemics or whatever.</p><p>I think we need to see on this experience that going back to the populous, nationalist view of solving our problems is not going anywhere. We're not going to solve climate change or refugee issue by going it alone. I think that's the first thing.</p><p>I think the second point that you asked me about -- well, we are paying dearly for the -- particularly the first few months of the Tsipras government. We avoided bankruptcy in 2010, we almost went to bankruptcy in 2015 with capital control of the banks, almost left to Europe, and that cost him, cost him some credibility, cost him in more borrowing and cost him more recession and therefore more cuts to be able to deal with the budget deficit.</p><p>Obviously, after that, Tsipras fell in line, but as he was an anti -- to anti-adjustment program, he didn't really have much else to do, so when he did fall in line, I believe he missed an opportunity to go deeper into making the necessary reforms for Greece.</p><p>My belief is that austerity was over emphasized when you get to do deeper reforms. I'll just give you an example --</p><p>GOLODRYGA: OK --</p><p>PAPANDREOU: When we brought in --</p><p>GOLODRYGA: OK --</p><p>PAPANDREOU: Transparency --</p><p>GOLODRYGA: OK --</p><p>PAPANDREOU: The E-prescriptions in the medical sector, we cut graph that cost like 50 percent, that's 3 billion, we cut -- that's as much as we make and properly, that is in Greece. So there are ways that we should have had more emphasis on reform, less emphasis on austerity.</p><p>That's partly a European and the IMF blame and partly of course blame of successive governments that were not really committed to make a deal with vested interest and make the changes necessary. That's what we need to do now --</p><p>GOLODRYGA: We'll --</p><p>PAPANDREOU: I think now we can think about the rules of the crisis, it's a new phase, but we need to move forward and research great capacities sustainably following.</p><p>GOLODRYGA: And this phase and nonetheless a big milestone as well. Gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us, we appreciate it. And we will be right back.</p><p>[16:35:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>GOLODRYGA: Hello, I'm Bianna Golodryga, coming up on the next half hour of QUEST MEANS BUSINESS, Twitter's chief executive tells us the company may have fallen behind in cleaning up the site. And one of the world's biggest oil companies is giving up on Iran as new sanctions loom ahead.</p><p>But first, these are the top news headlines we're following this hour. Pope Francis has acknowledged the Catholic Church's failure to act over sexual abuse against children, describing his shame and repentance. A thousand children were alleged abused by priests in Pennsylvania.</p><p>Pope Francis says the children were abandoned and that no apology would ever be enough. And in Italy's Calabria region, authorities say at least eight people have been killed in flooding. Heavy rains pushed what's normally a small stream over its banks.</p><p>It's not clear how many people have gone missing, but more than 100 rescuers are searching for survivors. And some news just in, U.S. President Donald Trump is again criticizing the Federal Reserve over raising interest rates. In an interview with \"Reuters\", he said he was not thrilled with Fed Chairman Jerome Powell.</p><p>Trump then said he should be given some help by the Fed. Historically, presidents private preserve the Fed's political independence by not commenting on its policy.</p><p>The United States has a disease, that's according to Iran's foreign minister. The country is addicted to sanctions. In an exclusive interview with Nick Paton Walsh, Mohammad Javad Zarif says he was wrong when he believed America had learned from past mistakes.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MOHAMMAD JAVAD ZARIF, FOREIGN MINISTER, IRAN: I believe there is a disease in the United States, and that is the addiction to sanctions. Even during the Obama administration, the United States put more emphasis on keeping the sanctions that they had not lifted rather than implementing its obligations on the sanctions that they've lifted.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GOLODRYGA: Meanwhile, Iran's oil minister says Total has officially left the country and pending U.S. sanctions forced the French oil giant to unwind all its Iran operations including a major development to develop a natural gas field.</p><p>John Defterios joins me now. John, how significant is this move from Total?</p><p>JOHN DEFTERIOS, CNN EMERGING MARKETS EDITOR: Well, it's one of the most telegraphed moves in the business, Bianna, that's for sure. But it still comes as a blow for Iran because total is the first international oil company to go back in after the lifting of the sanctions.</p><p>In fact, Patrick Pouyanne; the CEO told me back in May during the CNN roundtable there, Vladimir Putin summit that sometimes politics and business don't dovetail together, and this is one of those instances without exemptions they couldn't stay in the market.</p><p>And it boils down in large part because of Wall Street, that's where they get a third of their shareholder base, two-thirds of their financing comes from Wall Street, they have physical plans in America. We also have to think about the repatriation of funds, once you make money in Iran because of their reach of the U.S. Treasury and the Federal Reserve.</p><p>CNPC of China was in the front seat to take over the share, but I would imagine they're driving a pretty hard bargain because there's not a lot of buyers out there. So Iran was not able to announce somebody taking over the state as Total decided to exit the market.</p><p>[16:40:00] GOLODRYGA: What was the point that Zarif was trying to make in his statements there that the U.S. has an addiction. Who was he speaking to?</p><p>DEFTERIOS: Well, he was speaking in particular to the U.S. Congress because they have to follow through in the Trump sanctions and both houses of course controlled by the Republicans right now. But as the trigger- happy Donald Trump using sanctions right across the board including with the ally of Iran right now which is Turkey.</p><p>Let's take a look at where Iran stood in terms of overall production and what's going to happen to their exports going forward. They're the third largest producer within OPEC right now, Bianna, at 3.8 million barrels. But it's the exports, what I found interesting here.</p><p>They surged in the last couple of months at 2.9 million barrels a day. When I went to those fields at the end of 2015, they were pumping out just a million of exports and they said they would try to get it up to 2.5, nobody thought they could get close to 3 million barrels a day.</p><p>The target by Donald Trump by the way is to take it down to zero in the second round of this snap-back sanctions in November. Realistically, FACTS Global Energy is saying there should be about 700,000 barrels a day. We have to watch the big three buyers of that crude.</p><p>China, India of course are one and two, and number three is Korea. Korea has a sanctions on by the U.S. I don't see China bending because there are investors in the projects right now, and India with a relationship between Donald Trump and Mr. Modi; the Prime Minister, you could see them caving, but the Prime Minister of India said we're going to try to stay with Iran right now.</p><p>And again, they got a good deal because Iran doesn't have all the customers they had just six months ago.</p><p>GOLODRYGA: John Defterios, we'll have to leave it there, thank you, we appreciate it.</p><p>DEFTERIOS: Thanks.</p><p>GOLODRYGA: Well, Kevin Spacey's latest film is giving Box Office laugh a whole new meaning. The movie is called \"Billionaires Boys Club\", but the money, well, it isn't exactly falling in, we'll explain more coming up next.</p><p>GOLODRYGA: Well, Kevin Spacey's new film has taken just $618, that's right, $618 in theaters across the U.S. this weekend -- not millions or even thousands. Just $610.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The (INAUDIBLE) investors to pay investors, oh, you knew?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm from Wall Street. You think people really get rich playing by the rules?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>[16:45:00] GOLODRYGA: The movie billionaire boys club actually gained a little momentum over the weekend after it took just $126 at the Box Office, Friday. This all follows allegations of sexual misconduct against Kevin Spacey. CNN's Chloe Melas joins me now.</p><p>And a lot of people were having double takes right there, saying that number, thinking there's no way a movie can only gross $618, it opened in 10 cities.</p><p>CHLOE MELAS, CNN ENTERTAINMENT REPORTER: It is a jaw-dropping figure especially when you're talking about a man, a leading man in Hollywood who at one point had a $52.5 million opening for \"Superman Returns\" in 2006. So obviously, that number right there is jarring.</p><p>Also there was a big cast in this movie, he had a supporting role, Kevin Spacey. You had Ansel Elgort who was a big heart drop here in the U.S., you had Emma Roberts, so you had some other big names that you would have thought might help carry this.</p><p>So it only opened in 10 theaters, right? But again, if you're going to compare it to some of like the worst movies of 2017 when it comes to Box Office opening weekend, the movie, \"The Comedian\", starring Leslie Mann and Robert De Niro, that made $10,000 at the Box Office, so again, not a lot.</p><p>Maybe if this had opened in more theaters, they put no marketing behind this, and when you look at all the money in the world where Sony cut Spacey out and recast him with Christopher Plummer.</p><p>The film studio behind this movie \"Billionaires Boys Club\", they said that they didn't have the budget to go do that. That's so expensive to have to reshoot scenes and cut him out. We were hoping that people were going to still go see it.</p><p>GOLODRYGA: It just makes Gillie(ph) look like a cash cow, but if this was filmed three years ago, given everything that's developed over the past year with the Me Too movement, why even release it at this point?</p><p>MELAS: Well, so first of all, if this had been years ago, probably would have done --</p><p>GOLODRYGA: Right --</p><p>MELAS: Millions at the Box Office. I think that they felt as though Kevin Spacey had a very small role in the film, well, not too small, but a supporting role, and that the other big names would carry it.</p><p>I think that what this goes to show you is that the Me Too movement, when allegations come out against these very powerful men in Hollywood, oh, how mighty they fall and it really does affect Box Office success. And that is, now studios have to look at this as an example as to, all right, well, if we have some other leading men have allegations against them, it might hurt us.</p><p>So maybe better to recast or put the movie on pause and then revisit it later. But again, this is a perfect example of how the Me Too movement --</p><p>GOLODRYGA: Right --</p><p>MELAS: Can hurt Box Office success --</p><p>GOLODRYGA: Drizzle(ph) effect, and have we heard from Kevin Spacey at all?</p><p>MELAS: Nothing. I was just talking to Ashleigh Banfield who is an anchor here at CNN about this, and Cricket from Kevin Spacey, ever since those first allegations came out against him in October and after our exclusive report at CNN about the misconduct on the set of \"House of Cards\" on his show on Netflix.</p><p>So now we've heard nothing from him, you would expect some sort of a statement at some point, nothing.</p><p>GOLODRYGA: A lot of negative reaction though when he said he was going in for therapy and seem to equate his sexuality --</p><p>MELAS: Yes --</p><p>GOLODRYGA: With the accusations against him, which you know, the two are extremely --</p><p>MELAS: Coming out and apologizing, but also saying, well, I didn't mean to come on to that boy when he was a teenager, but I'm also gay. Again --</p><p>GOLODRYGA: Yes --</p><p>MELAS: To equate these two things enraged many people.</p><p>GOLODRYGA: Yes --</p><p>MELAS: But perhaps he still just doesn't have quite the right words of what to say.</p><p>GOLODRYGA: Well, I don't know how you respond to a movie opening at the \"Billionaires Boys Club\" too at that title, $618 --</p><p>MELAS: No --</p><p>GOLODRYGA: Wow, yes, Chloe, great to have you on --</p><p>MELAS: Thank you --</p><p>GOLODRYGA: Good to see you, thank you. Well, Twitter is facing a barrage of criticism from spam and abuse to misinformation. CEO Jack Dorsey opens up to CNN about the challenges the company is facing, that's just ahead.</p><p>[16:50:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>GOLODRYGA: The chief executive of Twitter says the social platform has a toxic problem with content. Jack Dorsey was speaking to our very own Brian Stelter who is here with me. Fascinating interview played --</p><p>BRIAN STELTER, CNN SENIOR MEDIA CORRESPONDENT: Yes --</p><p>GOLODRYGA: Out over the weekend. You addressed a lot of issues, did you walk away with the feeling that he has a grasp of the level of issues and the severity of the issues that they're dealing with?</p><p>STELTER: Well, I think he's asking the right questions, I think he's addressing the right problems. But he doesn't have all the answers yet, he doesn't have the solutions, and he readily admits that. You know, he sounded at times like a philosopher, thinking about the impact of technology.</p><p>And less like the CEO of a major tech company. But he did acknowledge that individuals increasingly have fears of big tech companies. Here's a part of what Dorsey told me.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JACK DORSEY, CO-FOUNDER &amp; CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, TWITTER: When we started the company in the service 12 years ago, we weren't necessarily thinking about some of the repercussions from our actions. And they looked quite small at the time.</p><p>For instance, we thought, you know, well, people are following you, so we should count them and then we should put that count right on your profile page and obviously people care about that, so we should make it big.</p><p>But that one small choice and it felt very small at the time and it felt obvious at the time. Put an incentive to grow that number, is that the right attention? Is that the right incentive that we should be driving? I don't think it is today, I don't think it matters as much in context of how many conversations you have or how much you contribute back to the network.</p><p>And like is another good example where you know, when you tweet and you don't get a lot of likes and you feel bad about it, is that the incentive we really want to drive? Is that what we're actually trying to encourage people to think about?</p><p>The answer is yes because it's in the product. And another good example that I think will help a lot of what we're trying to do and health is what we see with eco-chambers. We only give people one tool right now which is to follow an account.</p><p>STELTER: You want people to be able to follow stories or subjects or hashtags?</p><p>DORSEY: Yes, I mean, we've been focusing a lot of the service today more, and vying(ph) it more towards topics or towards interests.</p><p>STELTER: It sounds like you are willing and ready and willing to rebuild the entire house, to renovate everything.</p><p>DORSEY: We're ready to questions everything. I mean, I -- we've cleaned so much in Twitter over the past 12 years, and I know it doesn't always feel that way, but we've changed a lot, but we haven't changed the underlying fundamental.</p><p>STELTER: What is the timeline for re-examining how you so follow accounts or the use of the like button.</p><p>DORSEY: You know, we're looking at and thinking about all these things. Right now, we've definitely had conversations about them --</p><p>STELTER: But would you say like by the end of the year there's going to be those fundamental changes to Twitter?</p><p>DORSEY: I don't -- I worry about a timeframe like that because we also need to take into consideration -- we're a small company, I mean, we in comparison with our peers -- we're a small company, but we have this out- size impact and I believe the importance.</p><p>And there's a lot of what's in Twitter that you would find in a public square, to use the older analogy --</p><p>STELTER: You mean all the graffiti on the walls?</p><p>DORSEY: No, well, there's part of that, but there's also a really amazing open conversation, and I'm going to see if we're ready to walk up to anyone and strike something up. So there's positives and there's what people perceive to be negative as well.</p><p>[16:55:00] STELTER: Look, I met my wife on Twitter, I'm always going to love Twitter. And I kind of feel like it's a garden that's been overrun by weeds. Do you feel like you're the gardener just struggling to keep up?</p><p>DORSEY: There are certainly times where we felt like we're behind. But that goes back to my point of like we need to be really good with prioritizing and sequencing and understanding what matters most. So if the incentives are going to have greatest impact, then we should prioritize that.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GOLODRYGA: So clearly, a lot of challenges, he's addressing them, and you said that was a big step for him to speak out to you. The president also is addressing this issue in an interview with \"Reuters\" as we speak --</p><p>STELTER: Yes, in an interview with \"Reuters\" in the past few minutes. The president is reiterating his complaints about these big tech companies, saying it's very dangerous that they self-regulate content. I think what he means is the rules of the role, the Twitter and Facebook and Google have to decide when you violate terms of service, when something might be hate speech or something, these are issues that Twitter and Facebook grappling with.</p><p>And we're hearing prominent conservatives including up to the president of the United States saying, you know, these rules, you have to be careful, it seems like you're targeting conservatives. Now the companies very much deny that.</p><p>Dorsey denied that to me in the interview, he said this is not a bad ideology and we're deciding whether to suspend or block someone, we're not doing it based on political point of view. But that idea of discrimination of bias is a very powerful potent idea and it's been used in the midterm elections here in the U.S. to say the new problem is big tech.</p><p>That it used to be the liberal mainstream media, now it's the liberal technology companies --</p><p>GOLODRYGA: Yes --</p><p>STELTER: And with that in mind, it's so interesting to hear Dorsey say we're not that big.</p><p>GOLODRYGA: Yes --</p><p>STELTER: We're small compared to our peers.</p><p>GOLODRYGA: Yes --</p><p>STELTER: We don't have unlimited resources to monitor and police this website. It's kind of like hearing someone who is in charge of a town say we only have so many cops, we can't hire more police officers, it's not a very encouraging thing to hear.</p><p>GOLODRYGA: Not as if he prefers to be in the shadows with the Facebook in the spotlight, now that it's his turn, he's facing a lot of questions as well, you've got the First Amendment, you've got hate speech, you've the president weighing in, but I was happy to hear that there's good news coming out of Twitter, and that people still fall in love, like you and your wife.</p><p>STELTER: Yes --</p><p>GOLODRYGA: You've got a beautiful baby out in the --</p><p>STELTER: I love Twitter for that reason --</p><p>GOLODRYGA: Yes --</p><p>STELTER: That's right, but Twitter seem really pleasant in those days, not so much anymore.</p><p>GOLODRYGA: Yes, lot to the world now --</p><p>STELTER: Yes --</p><p>GOLODRYGA: Same -- even for a so-called small company.</p><p>STELTER: Yes --</p><p>GOLODRYGA: Brian, thank you --</p><p>STELTER: Thanks.</p><p>GOLODRYGA: And that's QUEST MEANS BUSINESS. I am Bianna Golodryga in New York, the news continues right here on CNN.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNI-2018082001cbk27</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNNI2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5T34-67P1-JB20-G01V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">246052</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7789\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN INTERNATIONAL</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"08\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>August 20, 2018 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC000CFK7</classCode><className>TWITTER INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC0002KPD</classCode><className>TOTAL SA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC00027NH</classCode><className>JPMORGAN CHASE &amp;

Editor's note: This article is part of a series ValueWalk is doing on tail risk hedge funds. The series is based on over a month of research and discussions with over a dozen experts in the field. All the content will be first available to our premium subscribers and some will be released at a Read More[4] Jonas noted that the power of hope has changed the world and that \"the power of hope, the formation of capital and the movement of share prices have long co-existed in a symbiotic relationship.\" In Tesla's case, he believes that in addition to the company's proven leadership in electric vehicles and sustainable transportation, investor hope has been driving its stock price higher. He described Tesla's higher stock price as a \"stimulus[5] for investors\" to come up with predictions that can justify it. As the market communicates and considers these predictions and scenarios, even more hope or a validation of the hope that already exists drives Tesla stock even higher. He explained that his discussions with investors and other stakeholders have indicated to him that the \"engine of hope\" has been a contributing factor behind the increase in Tesla's stock price, \"further expanding the collective investor imagination of what is possible.\"From \"controversial\" to \"cash flow powerhouse\"?Jonas noted that unlike other extreme bull case stores like bitcoin, Tesla is a real business developing real, attractive products and making real investments[6]. The company is hiring real people like at its second U.S. Gigafactory, attracting real talent, and deploying real technology that's mostly in short supply. He added that he isn't suggesting that Tesla is the first of its kind in recent market history. His colleagues who cover tech stocks offered other high-profile examples of \"several tera-cap tech platforms\" that eventually \"moved from being 'controversial' cash burning names to cash flow powerhouses in the portfolio.\" The Morgan Stanley analyst remains Underweight in his Tesla stock prediction because at $1,400 a share, he believes that the company is a story of where the possible meets the \"reality-check of the probable.\" He said the story is also where the premium of Tesla's innovation meets the \"certainty of status quo\" from others.Risks for Tesla stock predictionsJonas' bull case prediction for Tesla stock is $2,070, which leaves plenty of room for upside even from $1,300 or $1,400 a share. However, he remains Underweight as his base case on the stock due to several risks. He highlighted China as a key risk. The company's second-quarter delivery numbers provided more evidence of how he believes its growth and profitability are underpinned by the ability to freely sell vehicles in China[7]. He is concerned about the sustainability of Tesla's business model in the long term and believes investors should apply a discount to the company's growth and profit in China. He also highlighted competition from big tech companies. He said investors aren't very concerned about competing EV offerings from legacy automakers, but that isn't where he believes the biggest threat comes from. He has been following Amazon's progress in building its captive transportation network, which he believes could end up being a formidable competitor for Tesla in many markets. He advises investors to prepare for similar moves from Alphabet and Waymo, Apple and other big tech firms.High expectations baked into Tesla stock predictionsJonas also noted that expectations for Tesla are extremely high. At $1,400 a share, he estimates Tesla's stock price was discounting a 2030 volume of about 5 million vehicles, which is more than 10 times the volume the automaker appears on track to do this year. He estimates that the earnings power implied in the current market capitalization[8] suggests group EBITDA margins of 20% or higher. He doesn't think that these numbers are impossible, but they are a significant jump from what the company has been doing so far. These numbers also imply commercial success in a global EV market that's at less than 2% penetration today. The analyst also advised investors to be cautious about Tesla's path to commercialization in autonomous vehicle technology. He does see significant long-term potential for the technology, but he is cautious on adoption rates in the next 10 years. He expects self-driving vehicles to represent less than 0.3% of global miles traveled by 2030. He remains concerned about the moral, ethical, legal, regulatory and technological barriers that must be overcome. He warned that the market seems to be ignoring these barriers. He believes Tesla may disappoint because the total addressable market for autonomous vehicles will be lower than what investors expect. Based on Tesla's high stock price, Jonas also believes the risk/ reward is better in other parts of the electric vehicle value chain. If Tesla does execute on the volumes embedded in its $250 billion valuation, he expects other verticals of the value chain to benefit, like battery suppliers, semis, capital goods, tech hardware and specialty chemicals. Tesla stock is in the red at the time of this writing after falling below $1,400 a share again.

Good Thursday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I'm Maria Bartiromo. And it is Thursday, April 4th.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Your top stories right now 7:00 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Investors are waiting on any China trade news. The President will meet with China's top negotiator today at the White House.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Markets are flat, S&amp;P 500 down a fraction, Dow Jones Industrial average up a fraction. This after markets were little changed yesterday. The Nasdaq was the top performer on the day yesterday. It was up two-thirds of 1 percent, 46 points higher. The other major indices higher but just fractionally. Dow Industrials up about 39 points yesterday.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In Europe this morning, take a look at the story and it is mixed. FT 100 down 30 points. CAC 40 in Paris down 9 points. But the DAX index in Germany up 26.</p><p>In Asia overnight markets were mostly higher as you can see here with the exception of Hong Kong.</p><p>We are waiting on the jobs report. It's jobs Friday tomorrow, that may very well be a market mover.</p><p>Cracking down on e-cigarettes. The FDA is warning of serious health concerns after some users are reporting they're getting seizures after vaping.</p><p>The college admissions scandal continues. Lori Loughlin and Felicity Huffman appearing in a Boston court yesterday, after they signed autographs outside. We have the very latest.</p><p>Plus the vests take over Wall Street. But now the company behind them, Patagonia, is saying no more. Wait until you hear that story.</p><p>All those stories coming up this Thursday morning and joining me to break it all down: Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell; the \"Wall Street Journal's\" assistant editorial page editor James Freeman; and Republican strategist Erin Elmore.</p><p>Great to see you this morning.</p><p>Jamie Dimon has his annual letter out. The CEO of JPMorgan Chase out with his annual letter. And he writes this, \"There are legitimate concerns around China's economy in addition to trade but they are manageable.\" He also calls the U.S. trade issues with China substantial and real.</p><p>The letter has become something that Jamie Dimon is real proud of, you know, as he takes a whack at policy issues and talks about concerns for the country, not just JPMorgan.</p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, ASSISTANT EDITORIAL PAGE EDITOR, \"WALL STREET JOURNAL\": Yes. I think China obviously the big issue on the table. I think he's speaking for the business community, where they don't like tariffs but they recognize that the game in China is not fair to foreign companies. It's not fair on intellectual property, et cetera.</p><p>Larger policy points in there, I think some of them are laudable. But I don't like the idea that businesses have a sort of a social responsibility to advocate for different public policies. I think the job of a bank, for example, and his bank does it very well, is to fund businesses, allow companies to grow, allow people to have the financial services and I think that's a great service. You don't need to be involved in public policy.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You're right.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: This reads like a 10-point plan for a man who is running for the nomination of some party. I don't know which party it is.</p><p>But he talks about infrastructure spending and the infrastructure plan to improve our highways and such. That is the role of the government, how to pay for it is the question. Also things like --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Education.</p><p>MCDOWELL: -- education. Those are the big l policy issues. I mean, he's kind of -- again, tell us something we don't know.</p><p>BARTIROMO: He says ten ways to address what's holding back growth and opportunity, education, healthcare costs, regulatory reform, infrastructure, tax system, litigation reform, immigration reform, mortgage reform, labor market, budgeting and planning.</p><p>ERIN ELMORE, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST: Jamie Dimon, 2020.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. No, he said he's not going to run.</p><p>ELMORE: No, no. Definitely not.</p><p>MCDOWELL: He's not woke enough, I don't think, to certainly win the Democratic nomination and you already got like a Howard Schultz possibly running as an independent candidate. I wasn't suggesting that. I'm just saying it reads like a policy platform.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It does. You're absolutely right. But I will say this, he's probably going to be getting some good news recently -- good news in the near term on China because the Chinese are agreeing to open up their markets, particularly to financial services.</p><p>UBS was the first bank to get an opportunity to own a bank out and out, 51 percent. But it looks like financial services are going to be the first industry that really gets a shot to sell to the 1.4 billion people in China, which is a big opportunity.</p><p>FREEMAN: Yes. And if you look at what the Chinese have said recently, it sounds like reform. Obviously, there's this question, and this is sort of the sticking point in the trade negotiations right now, what is the enforcement mechanism? When do you take the tariffs off? How do you punish if they're not following the deal.</p><p>I think on the U.S. side, they are convinced that Liu He is a genuine reformer. He wants to move the Chinese economy toward open markets, the rule of law, respect for property. Can he sell that to Xi Jinping who is really an old-fashioned communist. And we'll hear from Gordon Chang who obviously covers this extremely well but covers this extremely well. But that's really the he question, I think is can He sell that reform opportunity back home.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And I'm expecting that meeting between the President and Xi Jinping in May, early May, is the guidance that I'm getting in terms of the meeting in Mar-a-Lago -- that must mean reform that they are really down to the final items as we told you yesterday actually.</p><p>Coming up this morning, we've got a great show.</p><p>Florida Congressman and House Judiciary Committee member Matt Gaetz is here. He'll be on the panel with New Jersey Congressman and House agriculture committee member Jeff Van Drew. We'll get both of their ideas.</p><p>Plus the author of \"The Coming Collapse Of China\", Gordon Chang is with us to talk about where we are in that deal. And former McDonald's CEO, and Fat Brands international chairman Ed Rensi joining is us as well. Don't miss a moment of it.</p><p>Now to the Securities and Exchange Commission versus Elon Musk, the Tesla chief headed to court today over his controversial tweets that have triggered a legal t battle between his company and the SEC. A federal judge will hear arguments in a lawsuit filed by the agency which is the court to hold Musk in contempt for violating a $40 million settlement.</p><p>Joining us now is ARK investment analyst Tasha Keeney. Tasha Keeney. Tasha it's god to see you.</p><p>TASHA KEENEY, ARK INVESTMENT ANALYST: Thanks for having me.</p><p>Have you been trading or recommending this stock in light of all this -- Tesla?</p><p>KEENEY: In light of the SEC Investigation?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>Keeney: Well, we know -- we don't try to predict legal outcomes. We certainly don't know. But you know, Dagen I heard you say earlier, you don't think that he'll be removed as CEO. That's really most important to us. We want him to stay at the helm of the company. Especially if Tesla is still reaching for autonomy with its vehicles which what we think the largest market opportunity ahead of it.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Think about the outrage about that, if a federal judge because of a tweet -- a tweet violates a settlement with a securities regulator which has no really criminal authority over companies, it has -- it can file civil cases, having a judge remove a CEO for a tweet ain't going to happen.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, they want to remove President Trump for his lies; for his tweets.</p><p>ELMORE: And Tasha How do you manage your expectations given the fact that Elon Musk has such volatility in his behavior?</p><p>KEENEY: You know, we look at Musk really as a visionary. He's accomplished the impossible. I mean he's changing the face of the auto industry. So there's a lot of transparency in what he does because he uses Twitter.</p><p>And he has made mistakes in the past and he's admitted those and paid for those mistakes.</p><p>You know, I think, again, for the long term goal of the company in terms of getting to full autonomy, being a leader in electric vehicles, he seems to have a accomplished that. We're happy so far with how things are going.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. But the company's new vehicle deliveries plummeted 31 percent in the first quarter. Tesla is citing challenges associated with taking the Model 3 overseas for the first time. How are they going to deal with this?</p><p>KEENEY: You know, it think there's too much focus on deliveries. Again, with an innovative company like this you have to look at the long-term picture. So if Tesla's late by say a month or what have you on those numbers -- I mean, are they -- it's still the best selling mid-size premium sedan. I mean there's no demand issue.</p><p>MCDOWELL: but again but it doers reflect and the \"Wall Street Journal\" writes about this in its analysis today.</p><p>\"Tesla has trouble planning. And if you're going to be in the manufacturing business, you really need to learn how to cross your t's and dot your i's so-to-speak. Because Tesla produced 22 percent more cars than it was able to deliver in the first quarter. This shows in part a logistics problem. Now --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Is it going to hurt income --</p><p>MCDOWELL: It's more likely but Elon Musk kind -- and Tasha can attack about this. Elon Musk kind of forecast several weeks ago -- we were talking, remember about the debt payment. It was really about him saying that the company might not be profitable in the first quarter after two straight quarters of producing a profit because of some of the issues.</p><p>And in part, they are losing that tax credit as well. It was at $7,500. Now it's essentially been cut in half.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Stock is down 8 percent right now.</p><p>KEENEY: Yes. Exactly. So I think -- well, so one, in terms of profitability, I think so Tesla said they have enough cash on-hand at the end of the quarter and I think in general with the delivery figures, I mean, have you to ask yourself, are these logistic challenges going to kill the company? No. You know.</p><p>If you're a long-term investor, I don't think this should phase you.</p><p>FREEMAN: Wanted to ask about the tweets. Obviously this is a mechanism to speak to the markets and the company has said that, but people just like with the president, they argue are the tweets critical to his success or is he hurting himself with tweets.</p><p>I wonder how you view the Musk communications generally, whether it's Twitter, whether it's going on pod casts and smoking weed -- is this part of the brand and part of the genius or is it a downside and you wish he would stop talking?</p><p>KEENEY: You know, again, as I said earlier, with Twitter we get a lot of transparency. And you don't get that with other CEOs. So I think in a lot of ways investors, this gives us more information. Now, sometimes he does unpredictable things like the 420 but in general, you know, 420 tweet.</p><p>In general, again, we see the board supporting Musk which is really important for an innovative company like Tesla. And, you know, as we look forward as the auto industry transitions to electric autonomous vehicles, Tesla's years ahead of the competition.</p><p>And so we don't think that little blips like this are going to sort of affect that competitive advantage that Tesla's built in terms of batteries, in terms of autonomous hardware and in terms of autonomous data.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And you don't even need to look ahead to autonomous vehicles. I had this discussion with someone I'm very close to over the weekend who works in Silicon Valley. Every other automaker, even luxury automakers in Germany, Japanese and American -- they are awful at software.</p><p>There is no other car and no other car company that compares to a Tesla. We all as drivers and consumers ought to be rooting for this company. You don't have to own stock in it but you ought to be rooting for them because hopefully all these other automakers will realize oh, our software stinks.</p><p>KEENEY: Exactly. And automakers really haven't even owned that part of the supply chain. The software side of things. They're bringing in all of these components from different suppliers and Tesla's vertically integrated.</p><p>So this is a huge challenge to the traditional companies. And I mean if you don't -- just take one thing over the air updates. the car gets better overnight. Why haven't other automakers been able to do this? I mean it's ridiculous that Tesla's actually been doing this for years now. And no one has caught up.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Because they're dug in and they literally don't know now to run a car company in the new century. That's literally what these companies look like.</p><p>If you -- I'm surprised. And I'm surprised that Apple and Google haven't done more to try and manufacture a car or produce software for one.</p><p>FREEMAN: How secured is Tesla's funding?</p><p>Keeney: So, you know, I think in general if we look at funding for Tesla, ok, so say if you were worried about cash, we actually as investors would be ok with an equity dilution because we just want them to get as many cars on the road as possible. Each of the cars acts like a mini R&amp;D center. It collects data for Tesla and it gets it toward that vision of full autonomy because Machine learning improves with the more data you feed it.</p><p>So we're actually factoring in a $10 billion to $20 billion equity dilution over the next five years. And again, we would be ok with that.</p><p>FREEMAN: How soon do they need to raise more capital?</p><p>KEENEY: So you know they've again, they said that they're ok with cash at the end of the quarter. So no immediate expectations for that to happen. Now, if things were to change which we certainly think they could, again, that would be ok.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Just to be clear, the stock is down almost 9 percent right now. Would you buy it here?</p><p>KEENEY: You know, I can't say whether or not we would buy or sell but you know, again, our long term visit .</p><p>BARTIROMO: You have to tell clients something, right?</p><p>KEENEY: Well, you know, the market hasn't opened yet. But the long-term vision for Tesla has not changed.</p><p>I mean we still think they're the largest producer of batteries in the world. They're the only company that's collecting data off its customer cars on the road, we've seen every other company that's working on autonomous driving have issues, Waymo is having technical issues, the commercial launch was much watered down than what se expected.</p><p>I mean Tesla could launch a fully autonomous car in the next couple of years and then they're really going to run away from the competition.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I still think he's acted like a jerk in the past but again, like I said everybody in this country ought to be rooting for the success of this company in one way shape or form because it is 's the way of the future.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Tasha -- thanks for being here.</p><p>KEENEY: Thanks for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Good to see you. Tasha Keeney, ARK Investment.</p><p>Coming up a major e-cigarettes warning this morning, dozens of users reporting to the FDA that they're suffering features.

Back in a minute.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>A new potential health risk for e-cigarette users. Cheryl Casone with headlines now -- Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: Pretty serious one, Maria.</p><p>The Food and Drug administration is revealing about three dozen reports of seizures among e-cigarette users, mainly younger people. Nicotine poisoning is believed to cause seizures and even brain injury. Last month the FDA outlined new restrictions on sales of most flavored e-cigs to fight underage use of them.</p><p>Well, billionaire/investor, Carl Icahn reportedly sold his stake in Lyft to fellow billionaire, George Soros before the company's IPO last week. Sources telling the \"Wall Street Journal\" that Icahn held about a 2.7 percent stake in Lyft which was valued at about $550 million -- that's the IPO price.</p><p>It is not known why Icahn sold his stake or how much Soros paid for it. Lyft is up about a fraction of a percent this morning.</p><p>Three global automakers teaming up to create safety standards for self- driving cars. Ford, GM and Toyota plan to set up the automated vehicle safety consortium, focusing on building a safety framework for autonomous vehicles. Self-driving cars have come under increased scrutiny since, of course, the fatal crash of an Uber test vehicle last year. The Ford, GM, Toyota initiative is notable because it involves large car makers but no technology firms who probably will want to weigh in on any new rules.</p><p>And those are your headlines -- Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: all right. Cheryl -- thank you.</p><p>Coming up, the delay in the U.K., trying to avoid a no deal exit from the European Union. British lawmakers are now looking for another deadline extension. We've got the details out of London coming up. then the college admissions scandal, Lori Loughlin and Felicity Huffman facing a judge. The courtroom drama coming up.</p><p>BARTIROMO: British lawmakers are voting to force prime minister Theresa May to ask the E.U. for another extension to exit the European Union.</p><p>Ashley Webster with the very latest right now.</p><p>WEBSTER: We go around and around and --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Round and round and round.</p><p>WEBSTER: -- and around we go. Nothing much as changes other than yes there is a bill that whisked it went through the House of commons yesterday, basically telling Theresa May that she must go to The European Union and ask for an extension which, by the way, the new deadline is a week from tomorrow.</p><p>That went through the House of commons. It's now in the House of Lords. It's kind of like the House and the Senate in the U.K.</p><p>Generally nothing of interest ever happens in the House of Lords so this is ground-breaking by itself, that they're actually debating this issue in the House of Lords and doing it quickly. Nothing quickly happens in the House of Lords.</p><p>And now there's a belief that some conservatives in the House of Lords are so upset with this whole process they may filibuster. They may talk for hours and hours and hours and hours and hours to try to prevent this from going through.</p><p>The bottom line ok, Prime Minister go ask for another deadline from the E.U. It doesn't mean the E.U. is going to give it to them. for the an tension, doesn't mean the E.U. is going to give it to them.</p><p>What's interesting is this whole affair has not really moved forward in three years. You can't come to a majority, a consensus on what the plan is to get the heck out of the E.U.</p><p>What's interesting though is there's a new poll out in the U.K., that says 83 percent of U.K. citizens, sick of talking about Brexit, 64 percent believe it's harmful to their mental health.</p><p>I think we can all agree with that. But it's certainly --</p><p>And another interesting angle to this, Maria and gang, there are 10,000 riot police that have been undergoing extensive training in the last couple of weeks. They are ready to deploy in a heartbeat. That doesn't mean to say they're going to be needed but there has been a ramping up of emotions</p><p>The number of crimes related to Brexit have doubled in the last two weeks. Not a huge amount but there are incidents where harsh rhetoric is now being translated into actual action. And there's actual a concern if this continues to drag on and Brexit is not delivered as it was requested by the British people in that referendum, that things could spill on the streets.</p><p>There are 10,000 riot troops ready to go. It's a little . And there's a concern if this continues to drag on and the Brexit is not delivered as it was requested by the British riot troops ready to go.</p><p>It's a little bit of a scare thing. Haven't been used and so far, it's been pretty civil, I have to say. But there's no doubt tensions and emotions are frayed.</p><p>MCDOWELL: There are always people looking for a reason to loot, aren't they?</p><p>WEBSTER: Certainly in France. There's always a small group of anarchists who will jump onto any cause just so they can smash up some shops.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And get what?</p><p>WEBSTER: Get some free jeans. Get free stuff. There's always that.</p><p>MCDOWELL: That's Ashley's -- East London accent.</p><p>WEBSTER: Yes. But there are people who would jump on any cause just to create problems. So there is that kind of lurking in the background.</p><p>Bottom line is can Theresa May survive this? Who knows? Who would want her job right now.</p><p>FREEMAN: But if she cuts a deal with the Labour Party --</p><p>WEBSTER: Jeremy Corbyn.</p><p>FREEMAN: this is going to be either no Brexit or something that's VERY close to no Brexit.</p><p>WEBSTER: Correct. It's going to be a very soft Brexit. And you know, will Corbyn insist on a second referendum, no matter what deal they make, the choice going back to the people, saying this is the deal we've got.</p><p>Vote for this or we forget the whole thing and stay in Europe. That could be the next move.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What will that do to markets.</p><p>WEBSTER: Uncertainties, sterling ha taken another hit. We know that it's funny, you know the economic news out of Europe, German manufacturing again came out really poor.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. And Italy and Germany GDP were cut.</p><p>WEBSTER: This is not a good time economically for the E.U. and certainly the U.K. slowed down. None of this is good because of the uncertainty. Businesses aren't spending. Businesses don't know what to do, especially if you have a lot of exposure to the continent.</p><p>FREEMAN: This referendum the people voted for -- they voted for Brexit --</p><p>WEBSTER: 52 to 48 percent.</p><p>FREEMAN: -- is basically being ignored on the installment plan, by the politicians.</p><p>WEBSTER: Correct. It was always 70 something percent of MPs who voted to remain and there's this strong belief that they would do anything they can to prevent it from happening. And one way to do that is to drag it out, get the U.K. involved in the European parliament elections coming up in May. They do that this thing gets pushed further and further and further down the line. And that happens is no Brexit. That is the fear.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And it's all having an impact across the world. I'm glad you mentioned the factory orders report out of Germany because you're the Eurozone economic numbers do not look good.</p><p>WEBSTER: There you go.</p><p>BARTIROMO: This morning the GDP expectations for Italy and Germany were cut again. They're lucky to get 1 percent growth if at all in the Eurozone.</p><p>WEBSTER: Right. Completely stagnant.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That has to hit the U.S. at some point.</p><p>WEBSTER: Of course it does. And you know, no matter what you think of the E.U. it's a huge trading bloc. It is enormous and there's a lot of business done between the U.S. and the E.U. So it is going to have an impact.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I was going to say, meantime you have political candidates here in the United States pointing to Europe as kind of the gold standard. Yes, their economy can't grow.</p><p>WEBSTER: Good point.</p><p>MCDOWELL: This is what socialism gets you.</p><p>FREEMAN: This could be an upside for us. I was talking to one European BANK and he was saying this all of this debate and concern and uncertainty helps New York remain the world's financial center.</p><p>WEBSTER: It does. It's the only game in town. And where are you going to put your money right now? U.S. equities look pretty good.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's a good point. Are American businesses, JPMorgans of the world, have they made a plan to stay in the U.K. or move some of their people to Germany? What's the story.</p><p>WEBSTER: There have been a lot of movement. Bank of America moved a lot of its employees out of the -- out of London and to Dublin, to Ireland because their because they'll remain in the E.U.</p><p>FREEMAN: I THINK There's no obvious competitor in Europe, Dublin, Frankfurt maybe has an argument, but I think London remains the European financial center because of the tradition, rule of law, people want to operate there.</p><p>WEBSTER: Certainly hope so.</p><p>FREEMAN: I think that's probably true regardless of what the is.</p><p>WEBSTER: Yes. I think you're right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Ashley -- great stuff.

Griff, good morning.</p><p>GRIFF JENKINS, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Good morning, Maria. We just got some numbers here in the Rio Grande Valley. I'm just steps from the border here. That there were over 1,100 apprehensions of illegal crossers last night. That is the 13th day of more than a thousand apprehensions that they're having in this surge of migrants, many of them family units. We encountered more than 180 when we spent all day with the border patrol out on watch. But they don't all surrender peacefully seeking asylum, sometimes they seek to evade being caught. And we went into the sticks with them. It's tough work. Here's what happened.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JENKINS: It's unbelievably difficult terrain. I'm cut, my gloves torn. This man rushing through here and we found a group, this is the first one we found, just nothing but thorns, bushes, bugs, snakes, spiders.</p><p>This is a spotlight. You can see (INAUDIBLE), there they are. They've got two more.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (INAUDIBLE) they tried to run. This one right here was hiding underneath this brush to my left and this one right here just got up from the brush and took off running south but I was able to get him before he went got away.</p><p>JENKINS: This is the brush underneath here, right where I am, where the last illegal crosser was laid down and Herman had to crawl in like this and go through these bushes and thorns. It's just treacherous.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JENKINS: And that is not an extraordinary night by any stretch. That's what they go through every night here. Also folks are worried about this border closing.</p><p>As you know, Maria, Mexico is Texas' biggest trade partner to the tune of $187 billion. We wait to see what happens as DHS Secretary Nielsen visits Arizona today, the president to California tomorrow.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wow, it really looks like a crisis there, Griff. Thank you. Griff Jenkins joining us in McAllen this morning.</p><p>President Trump is threatening to close the southern border all together. Mexican officials along the border are warning a port of entry delays are already causing tens of millions of dollars in losses for companies that do business along the border. White House Economic director Larry Kudlow said that there's a way to keep freight lanes open should the border close.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LARRY KUDLOW NATIONAL ECONOMIC COUNCIL DIRECTOR, WHITE HOUSE: But regarding the economic impact of closing the border, which has not -- the president has not made a decision yet, as you know, I'm not aware that he has, one area we've explored is to try to keep the freight lanes open. The truck lanes.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Joining me right now is congressman and House Agricultural Committee member, Jeff Van Drew. Congressman, it's always a pleasure to see you. Thank you so much for being here.</p><p>REP. JEFF VAN DREW (D-NJ), HOUSE AGRICULTURAL COMMITTEE MEMBER: Thanks, and it's always a pleasure to be here with you. Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, your reaction to this news this morning. We're seeing the lines get longer. We're seeing a lot of worry over the threat that the president could close the border. How do you see it?</p><p>VAN DREW: I sure -- I certainly hope he doesn't have to close the border. I wouldn't want to see that. It's obviously not good for business, it's not good for the economy. So I'm hopeful that we can work this out.</p><p>Yet another example, and I know I drive it over and over again, but where we just need to have -- you know, more conversation, more bipartisanship. We really need to do more here at the border to try to straighten this out. If we can get the border under control, then we won't have the problem at the ports of entry with moving things through quickly enough. And that's the issue.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You know, congressman, this is one of those examples of there are real issues happening in the country and in the world and instead, we have been focused in the last two years on this collusion narrative. I know that you have come to Washington to get things done. How are you dealing with your colleagues that seem to only want to take down Donald Trump and have ignored all of the issues going on that affect the American people?</p><p>VAN DREW: Well, I had a serious conversation with some of them just last night where we sat around a table and talked about it and I agree with exactly what you're saying. I want to get things done. People don't even realize at this point the bills that you hear about moving through the House of Representatives. Most of them, the vast majority of them are not going anywhere. They're going to get stopped at the senate, because, again, we're not having that conversation. They're not moving through and becoming law.</p><p>So, I think at so many levels we need to take care of the issues that are real, whether it's Social Security, Medicare, healthcare, making sure that our veterans are taken care of. I can go through an entire list for about 10 minutes of things that we need to do. We need to get past this other part.</p><p>So, we're going to get the report. Let's get the report, get as much that -- of it that is legal, and I want to emphasize that, that we legally can get, take a look at it. If there's something there, deal with it. If there's nothing there, that is horrendous, let's move on. Let's get laws passed that -- you know, really can make a difference. Let's get our business sector going even better. Let's take care of the border issues so that we don't have what's now -- was first just a crisis of safety, is now also a humanitarian crisis and a business crisis.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes for sure. Then there's China and this of course impacts your constituents being on the Agricultural Committee. I want to ask you about what's going on in China because I heard a story last night which really concerned me. There is a swine flu outbreak in China, this deadly virus said to be spreading throughout the country, affecting a shocking number of pigs. China consumes and produces 50 percent of the world's pork. But apparently 20 percent of the pigs are sick from this swine flu and they've got a hundred million pigs to dispose of. Dead pigs.</p><p>In the past they would put the pigs in the -- in the ocean and just leave it. But there are literally a hundred million dead pigs in China. Have you heard about this? Do you think there's going to be an impact to our agriculture? Some people expect that this situation is going to ripple through different meats, chicken and steak, in terms of prices. It's going to push all prices higher. What do you think?</p><p>VAN DREW: Well, it's definitely going to push some prices higher, there's no question. When -- you're going to have a shortage of meat and you're going to certainly going to have a shortage of pork and the prices are going to go up, number one.</p><p>Secondly, you know, we just have to make sure and thank God we have got a good Department of AGs to make sure that we keep everything safe over here. Just to -- you know, arrest everybody's fears, this is nothing that you or I can catch from eating something. This is something that goes from animal to animal through a variety of ways, sometimes when they eat waste that is infected from the flies and the transient insects that move around. But it's a serious issue. It's another serious issue. It's another economic issue. These are the types of issues that government should be working on.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What are you expecting out of a China deal? The president is expected to tell us later today when he will meet President Xi in Mar-a- Lago. I'm thinking -- I'm hearing it's either end of April, but likely -- more likely the beginning of May. Do you think the U.S. is going to be able to get an enforcement mechanism in there to ensure that the Chinese do not steal intellectual property from America?</p><p>VAN DREW: It may not be as good as we would want, but it's got to be better than it is. Because it's something we can't put up with anymore. And the stealing of intellectual property, the tampering with their monetary system as you know and many of the other things that they do are things that we just can't tolerate. I think there's truth to those who say that for too long China has had the better end of the deal and I think we have to protect our American interest.</p><p>So I think this, again, is another very, very important issue that we've got to work on. I think we're going to do better. I believe we're going to do better. But you know, Maria, this is going to be some hard, tough negotiating that's going to take place. We're not playing with amateurs here. These folks are serious. And they're serious about being the new number one in the world.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's right. And they're looking long term but I think during the whole -- you know, Mueller report drama, the Chinese were questioning if they're even going to have to deal with Donald Trump. Now after we know officially no collusion, the Chinese are saying we might have to deal with this guy for another eight years. It just also underlines how irresponsible there was -- it was out there, the media, the Democrats, you know, parading around with this collusion story, basically giving an upper hand to the Chinese while he's trying to do a deal with them.</p><p>You mentioned the Mueller report a moment ago. It's going to come out. The Judiciary Committee voted 24-17 to subpoena the entire report. Some members of the special counsel team reportedly saying that the results are more damaging to President Trump than Attorney General William Barr led on, that's coming from the New York Times today, the New York Times is clinging to this narrative, obviously. Would the A.G. hide something? I mean, would the new A.G. hide something in the Mueller report?</p><p>VAN DREW: Well, call me naive, but I really believe in the system of law. And I believe he wants to ensure to keep his good name, so I believe he's going to release what is supposed to be released. (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Not the grand jury testimony, right, though?</p><p>VAN DREW: Correct. He can't release that. That's by law. But those areas where we're not going to hurt people, not the grand jury testimony, not something obviously that's confidential for certain reasons but the majority of it, a good piece of that report could be released.</p><p>And if that's true, then that will come out. I'm one -- let me say this, you know, I'm a Democrat. But frankly, I was glad when it seems to be that there might not be much there because it's important that we can move forward for the next year and-a-half that our president can be effective. We're going to have an election, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>VAN DREW: When we have that election, we can hash --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Let the voters decide.</p><p>VAN DREW: Exactly. Let the voters decide. Let's hash this out. Let's have the big, grand argument that everybody wants to have.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>VAN DREW: Right now is the time to accomplish goals and get things done. And the China deal is an example.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, one thing that the voters are going to decide on -- one thing that the voters are going to decide on are some of these radical ideas, congressman. I mean, Senator Elizabeth Warren introduced a bill for CEOs to receive jail time after data breaches. Warren treated this yesterday, today I'm proposing a new law that expands criminal liability to any corporate executive who negligently oversees a company that causes severe and widespread harm to families. Our justice system should ensure that if you cheat working Americans, you'll go to jail. She wants to make it easier for CEOs to go to jail, congressman. What do you think?</p><p>VAN DREW: Well, I think if they've done something truly wrong, truly hurtful and truly illegal, then there can be some truth to that.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>VAN DREW: But I don't necessarily love a full-fledged attack that's occurring in certain sectors on business in general. That business is bad, that the capitalistic system is bad, that we should change the whole playing field. You know, I've said this to you before I'm a capitalist. I'm proud to be a capitalist. I'm a capitalist and I like to -- you know, have a little phone that I'm a compassionate capitalist. But that -- I mean that for real that -- you know, there is a place for government. We want to make sure people don't fall through the cracks. This is not just Laissez-faire capitalism.</p><p>However, we want to make sure that this economic engine that is taking so many of us to such good places in so many ways is even expanded more and even takes more of us and enables us to live the American dream.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, well-said, congressman. Good to see you, sir. Thanks so much.</p><p>VAN DREW: Thanks.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Jeff Van Drew.</p><p>Coming up, the college admissions scandal is next.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Constellation Brands out with earnings right now. Cheryl Casone with the details, Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: We've got the numbers, Maria. Constellation Brands reporting better than expected results for Q4. The company posting adjusted profit of a $1.84 a share, revenue of $1.8 billion. The company also selling about 30 of its lower priced wine brands to E. &amp; J. Gallo for $1.7 billion. Some of the names, Clos du Bois, Mark West wines and several others. Shares of Constellation Brands higher in the premarket.</p><p>All right. Well, actresses Felicity Huffman and Lori Loughlin appearing for the first time in federal court in Boston over the college admissions scandal. Both are charged with conspiracy to commit fraud. Prosecutors reportedly asking for jail time for everyone charged in the case. Now the actresses have forfeited their passports. Loughlin, we should ask, stopped to sign autographs outside of the courthouse after her appearance, Aunt Becky fans in Boston yesterday.</p><p>All right, Patagonia no longer selling its popular vest through corporate sales programs. These vests with finance from logos on them , kind of a wardrobe staple on Wall Street if you're a New Yorker, especially for those workers that trade in those formal suits for that more casual look for the trading floor. Patagonia says it wants to add new businesses to its client list, ones that quote, meet certain environmental, social and transparency standards. The company adding existing corporate customers can remain in the program. OK, way to make your views there.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wow.</p><p>CASONE: Patagonia.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's too much.</p><p>CASONE: I know.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, thank you, Cheryl.</p><p>Coming up, real estate is heating up. Investors are finding it's the perfect time to make a buck in the housing market. Details on the making - - the money making opportunity rather. Back in a moment.</p><p>BARTIROMO: President Trump just tweeted on the GOP. Here's what the president writes, the Republican Party is the party of the American dream.</p><p>Well, let's talk about that because spring has sprung for potential home buyers, falling rates and increased inventory pushing a buyer's market. Joining us now to give us the state of business is Dolly Lenz Real Estate co-founder, Dolly Lenz and Dolly Lenz Real Estate managing director, Jenny Lenz. Jenny and Dolly, it is good to see you both.</p><p>DOLLY LENZ, CO-FOUNDER, DOLLY LENZ REAL ESTATE: You too.</p><p>JENNY LENZ, MANAGING DIRECTOR, DOLLY LENZ REAL ESTATE: Good to see you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Asses the market for us, what are you expecting this summer in real estate?</p><p>D. LENZ: Well, we're seeing a lot more inquiries, we're seeing lots of people at open houses, which is great, right? That starts the process. And we're seeing people happy that it's spring.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>D. LENZ: Right? They go outside, there's flowers blooming.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, but you think the prices are going to come down?</p><p>D. LENZ: Yes. But it doesn't mean they're not going to take advantage of those prices coming down, right? Buyers will buy if they get a bargain. So they're looking for that bargain. Interest rates are so good now that anybody looking to buy is saving, what, 0.3 percent from just a month ago.</p><p>J. LENZ: And as sellers become more realistic, you know, we're going to see a lot more traction, a lot more buyers in the market. As she said, you know, spring is just the best time of year for New Yorkers. It really is a seasonal, somewhat of a seasonal market. No one wants to go see stuff in the winter, it's cold, everything looks terrible.</p><p>BARTIROMO: But what about the millionaire's tax? Let's get into the taxes that are -- that are taking effect.</p><p>D. LENZ: Not good -- not good. Millionaire's tax is really another trifecta problem, right? So, large supply of inventory, over-supply of inventory, lack of foreign buyers and now this tax, right? And plus the original tax, it's not good.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: The cap on state and local tax deductions.</p><p>D. LENZ: Exactly, right.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Deduction on the mortgage interest (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>D. LENZ: Which isn't even a cap, it's really a elimination, right?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right.</p><p>D. LENZ: Because most people pay more than $10,000, so it is an elimination of real estate tax reductions.</p><p>MCDOWELL: The number transactions in Manhattan in the first quarter I read was the lowest in 10 years. So it is having -- people don't want to buy in high tax states for myriad reasons.</p><p>D. LENZ: Exactly, and we're also seeing the huge move down to places like Florida because it's not a -- you know, a tax state.</p><p>J. LENZ: Right, and ultimately, this will all be priced into condos in Manhattan, right? If you're going to make us pay higher taxes, we're not going to pay as much for an apartment. That's what we're seeing.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, just to be clear, James, in California high earners are taxed 9.3 percent, plus an additional one percent surcharge on income over a million dollars. On the opposite coast, New York's upper cast taxed 8.82 percent on income over a million in 2018. And that's not including an additional millionaire's tax.</p><p>D. LENZ: Exactly.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, go ahead.</p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Or the New York city tax.</p><p>D.

If you think it's Bitcoin, which accounts for about 70 per cent of all the digital-asset world's market value, you're probably wrong.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">While concrete figures on trading volumes are hard to come by in this often murky corner of finance, data from CoinMarketCap.com show that the token with the highest daily and monthly trading volume is Tether, whose market capitalization is more than 30 times smaller. Tether's volume surpassed that of Bitcoin's for the first time in April and has consistently exceeded it since early August at about $21 billion per day (U.S.), the data provider says.</p><p>With Tether's monthly trading volume about 18 per cent higher than that of Bitcoin, it's arguably the most important coin in the crypto ecosystem. Tether's also one of the main reasons why regulators regard cryptocurrencies with a wary eye, and have put the brakes on crypto exchange-traded funds amid concern of market manipulation.</p><p>\"If there is no Tether, we lose a massive amount of daily volume - around $1 billion or more depending on the data source,\" said Lex Sokolin, global financial technology co-head at ConsenSys, which offers blockchain technology. \"Some of the concerning potential patters of trading in the market may start to fall away.\"</p><p>Tether is the world's most used stablecoin, a category of tokens that seek to avoid price fluctuations, often through pegs or reserves. It's also a pathway for most of the world's active traders into the crypto market. In countries like China, where crypto exchanges are banned, people can pay cash over the counter to get Tethers with few questions asked, according to Sokolin. From there, they can trade Tethers for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, he said.</p><p>\"For many people in Asia, they like the idea that it's this offshore, opaque thing out of reach of the U.S. government,\" said Jeremy Allaire, chief executive officer of Circle, which supports a rival stablecoin called USD Coin. \"It's a feature, not a problem.\"</p><p>Tether, which is being sued by New York for allegedly commingling funds including reserves, says using a know-your-customer form and approval process is required to issue and redeem the coin.</p><p>Asian traders account for about 70 per cent of all crypto trading volume, according to Allaire, and Tether was used in 40 per cent and 80 per cent of all transactions on two of the world's top exchanges, Binance and Huobi, respectively, Coin Metrics said earlier this year.</p><p>Many people don't even know they use Tether, said Thaddeus Dryja, a research scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Because traditional financial institutions worry that they don't sniff out criminals and money launderers well enough, most crypto exchanges still don't have bank accounts and can't hold dollars on behalf of customers. So they use Tether as a substitute, Dryja said.</p><p>\"I don't think people actually trust Tether - I think people use Tether without realizing that they are using it, and instead think they have actual dollars in a bank account somewhere,\" Dryja said. Some exchanges mislabel their pages, to convey the impression that customers are holding dollars instead of Tethers, he said.</p><p>The way Tether is managed and governed makes it a black box. While Bitcoin belongs to no one, Tether is issued by a Hong Kong-based private company whose proprietors also own the Bitfinex crypto exchange. The exact mechanism by which Tether's supply is increased and decreased is unclear. Exactly how much of the supply is covered by fiat reserves is in question, too, as Tether is not independently audited. In April, Tether disclosed that 74 per cent of the Tethers are covered by cash and short-term securities, while it previously said it had a 100 per cent reserve.</p><p>The disclosure was a part of an ongoing investigation into Tether by the New York Attorney General, which accused the companies behind the coin of a coverup to hide the loss of $850 million of comingled client and corporate funds.</p><p>John Griffin, a finance professor at the University of Texas at Austin, said that half of Bitcoin's runup in 2017 was the result of market manipulation using Tether. Last year Bloomberg reported that the U.S. Justice Department is investigating Tether's role in this market manipulation.</p><p>Convenience versus risk</p><p>\"Being controlled by centralized parties defeats the entire original purpose of blockchain and decentralized cryptocurrencies,\" Griffin said. \"By avoiding government powers, stablecoins place trust instead in the hands of big tech companies, who have mixed accountability. So while the idea is great in theory, in practice it is risky, open to abuse, and plagued by similar problems to traditional fiat currencies.\"</p><p>On the other hand, because Tether is key to their growth, many crypto exchanges would likely be willing to bail it out if needed, said Dan Raykhman, who is developing a platform for issuing digital assets and used to be head of trading technologies for Galaxy Digital.</p><p>\"There's this implicit support from all these exchanges to help Tether stay afloat,\" he said.</p><p>While dozens of stablecoins have come out in the past year, many of them independently audited and regulated, Tether remains the favourite, by far.</p><p>\"Tether has been around since 2014 - ancient antecedents in crypto - and has retained its value,\" said Aaron Brown, an investor and a writer for Bloomberg Opinion. \"I don't say it's perfect, but its convenience outweighs its risk for many people.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MTRNWS-2019100155842221</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MTRNWS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X5P-D5S1-JDH1-C352-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438721</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"913\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Free Daily News Group Inc.
