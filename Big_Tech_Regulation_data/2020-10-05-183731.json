Turnberry ''offered perspective to T-Mobileon a variety of topics, including the pending transaction,'' the carrier said. The Wall Street Journal first reported Mr. Lewandowski's role on Friday.</p><p>T-Mobileand Sprint late last month announced their plans to merge, hoping that regulators in the United States would allow a deal they had effectively blocked four years earlier. The Trump administration's attitude toward the merger is not clear, though analysts have highlighted the legal obstacles it might face. The administration has sued to block AT&amp;T's purchase of Time Warner.</p><p>  Mr. Lewandowski left the Trump campaign in June 2016 amid concerns among donors and party officials about his stewardship. Last year, he set up a consulting business that advised clients with business before the Trump administration. In an article last year in Politico, Mr. Lewandowski said he had nothing to do with Turnberry, which was founded by two of his associates, Jason Osborne and Mike Rubino. Calls on Friday to a number listed for Mr. Rubino were not answered and the voicemail was not receiving messages.</p><p>  - Peter Eavis</p><p>Moody's may cut Italy's rating</p><p>  In a one-two punch familiar to many highly indebted countries, Italy this week suffered a drubbing in its government bond markets and then late Friday took a blow from a major credit ratings agency.</p><p>Moody's Investors Service said it was placing the government of Italy's rating on review for a downgrade, citing the fiscal plans of the country's new coalition government. Moody's currently gives Italy a Baa2 rating, its second lowest ''investment grade'' rating.</p><p>  Just the threat of a downgrade is likely to increase pressure on Italy's government.</p><p>  Its leaders proposed policies that are aimed at raising Italy's anemic economic growth rate. But the measures could also weaken the government's finances and bring it into sharp conflict with other countries in the European Union. Italy's public debt is equivalent to 132 percent of its gross domestic product, a relatively high level.</p><p>Moody's said two main concerns drove its decision. The ratings agency said there was a ''significant risk of a material weakening in Italy's fiscal strength, given the fiscal plans of the new coalition government.'' Moody's also said there was a risk that overhauls aimed at making Italy's economy more efficient might now stall.</p><p>  Yields on Italian government bonds, which move in the opposite direction to their price, have spiked higher in recent days. Italy's 10-year government bond had a yield of 2.46 percent on Friday, up from 1.79 percent at the end of April. The Wall Street Journal on Friday reported that investors have upped their bets against the bonds.</p><p>  - Peter Eavis</p><p>  The problem with problems in Europe is that they can drag on for so long.</p><p>  The Greek debt crisis has been a confidence-sapping, multi-year saga that is still not over, while tensions over Britain's departure from the European Union could persist beyond the official exit date in March next year. And the big question now: How long might a battle between the European Union and Italy's new government last?</p><p>  Italy's leaders are proposing fiscal policies that could bring it into confrontation with other countries in the E.U. Italian government bonds have sold off, and the nervousness has started to weigh on the bonds of Spain, Portugal and Greece. Rising interest rates could dampen an economic recovery in Europe that has already appeared to have lost some steam.</p><p>  There are ways in which the ''Italian problem'' might get dealt with swiftly. The country's government bonds may get such a pounding in the markets that the new government backtracks from policies that put it at loggerheads with the E.U. And, as analysts at the Peterson Institute for International Economics note, Italy's government may struggle to get its fiscal policies through the country's own parliament:</p><p>  The governing coalition's majority in the upper one -- the Senate -- is slim: six votes. In the course of a sharp increase in borrowing costs triggered by an irresponsible budget (or its anticipation), that majority may well erode quickly.</p><p>  But even if Italy's government backed away from its policies, the country's problems -- a high debt load and a sluggish economy -- would remain. It might thus only be a matter of time before Italy again attempts to stand up to the E.U. Some analysts might contend that Italy should soldier on with orthodox, fiscally responsible policies and become more like Spain, whose economy has done well in recent years. But, as Ben Chu, economics editor of The Independent, asserted on Twitter, Italy's governments in recent years have not been profligate.</p><p>  And the fact that Italy is not Greece presents the European Union with an opportunity. The bloc could give Italy some leeway on fiscal policy and take seriously its government's desire to tap the European Social Fund, a special pool of E.U. money whose aim is to bolster employment. Of course, any time a country wants to bend the European Union's rules or push back against its policies, it is accused of wanting to have its cake and eat it, too. But sometimes the complexity and depth of Europe's underlying problems require more compromise than the E.U. is willing or able to make. After Greece's trials and Britain's vote to leave the bloc, Europe's leaders now may want to shake free of some of its built-in constraints and offer Italy something early on.</p><p>  - Peter Eavis</p><p>  Smart speakers are listening in. Can we control what's done with the things they hear?</p><p>  Something like this was bound to happen: Unbeknown to its owners, an Amazon Echo recorded a couple's conversation, then sent it to someone on their contact list. But even with sweeping new data laws going into effect in Europe, it's unclear exactly how the use of data gobbled up by such devices will be regulated.</p><p>Amazon blamed the new invasion of privacy on an improbable chain of events. Alexa, says the company, woke up when it thought it heard its name in a conversation taking place between the husband and wife in Portland. Then, it took action upon hearing a ''send message'' request, the name of a friend, and finally a confirmatory ''right,'' in that order. Minutes later, an employee of the husband received an audio recording of the couple's conversation.</p><p>  Ultimately, the incident wasn't as awkward as it might've been -- the couple was discussing hardwood flooring. But it raises questions about the accuracy of the A.I. assistants on these devices, what they do with your data, and how that might be regulated.</p><p>  Anyone who has used an Amazon Echo (or Google Home, or Apple HomePod) knows that their interfaces can be unreliable. While artificial intelligence has made bounds in recent years, voice recognition is complex, and strange accents, muffled voices, and external noise can lead to mistakes. That means misfires -- like the ones Amazon pointed to -- can and do happen.</p><p>  Misidentification of a wake word by a device -- on Amazon's, that's ''Alexa'' by default -- automatically sends data to the company's servers. Why? Because the small speakers don't have the computing power required to make sense of entire sentences, so that must be done on the cloud.</p><p>  You can't turn off the always-listening feature of these devices, because, if you could, they wouldn't be able to respond to your voice, rendering them useless. But misidentification of words can, according to Amazon, set in motion a chain of events that are troubling from a privacy perspective.</p><p>  The question: What happens to that data? And what should these devices be able to do with it?</p><p>  In answer to the first question: It will stay on the servers of tech companies indefinitely. (Unless you choose to delete, which isn't too hard. Here's how.) And once it's on those servers, it can be used by engineers to tune their artificial intelligence algorithms so that they can better understand your voice commands in future.</p><p>  Did you know all that? Maybe not. While companies like Amazon do explain in their terms of service that user data will be stored on servers and used to improve their products, it's perfectly possible to start using such a device in your home without being alerted to the fact. Data privacy is weakly regulated in the U.S., and there's no rule that demands Alexa tell you through its speaker what it will do with your data. So many people remain unaware of how their data is being used.</p><p>  In Europe, that should change Friday, with the introduction of the General Data Protection Regulation -- a set of strict data privacy rules that will be enforced across the entire E.U., with harsh penalties for organizations that don't comply. In theory, the rules could mean that smart speakers have to somehow tell consumers about their information collection--what's being recorded, how it's being used, where it's being stored, and whether it's being secured, for instance.</p><p>  Responding to a request for details about the ways in which Amazon is making its Echo devices G.D.P.R.-compliant, a spokesperson told DealBook:</p><p>  ''Protecting the privacy of customers has always been a top priority for Amazon. The Alexa privacy settings give customers insight and control over their data; they can use it to easily manage and delete their audio recordings, configure third-party skill permissions, and opt-out of having their voice data used to develop new Alexa features.''</p><p>  A spokesman for Google told DealBook that any requests made to the company's Home devices are treated in much the same way as the search data that is stored about users. In a blog post about its preparations for G.D.P.R., the company points out that ''nothing is changing'' about the way the firm collects or processes such data in order for it be compliant with the new rules.</p><p>  So, that's Europe. What about the U.S.? Big tech firms -- in particular, Facebook -- say they are responding to those new European rules with policies that will also apply in America. The same is likely to be true of smart speakers.</p><p>  But for now, the best way to control what's done with your data is to regularly delete the audio recorded by the devices, and opt out of any arrangement that allows the companies to use it to improve their services.</p><p>  -- Jamie Condliffe</p><p>  What's happened since Europe's new data rules went into action</p><p>  We're not even a full day into a new era in which the E.U.'s General Data Protection Regulation clamps down on what organizations do with the data of European citizens. But it's already causing headaches. So far:</p><p>   Some U.S. news outlets have blocked European readers</p><p>   A nonprofit has filed official complaints about Google, Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram with E.U. privacy regulators</p><p>   Read-it-later app Instapaper is currently not accessible by European users</p><p>  It'd take the average worker 275 years to earn a C.E.O.'s annual pay</p><p>  It's not surprising to hear that many C.E.O.s are handsomely paid -- Doug McMillon of Walmart, for example, earned $22 million last year. (That said, the $102 million collected by Frank Bisignano of the credit card processor First Data is still eye-popping.)</p><p>  But now corporate America is required to disclose pay ratios, which reveal how the C.E.O.'s pay stacks up to that of median workers. (The median ratio is 275.) Here's what the NYT uncovered as part of its annual executive pay report:</p><p>   The median Walmart employee would need 1,188 years to match Mr. McMillon's 2017 compensation.</p><p>   At Live Nation, it would take 2,893 years.</p><p>   At Time Warner, it's a comparatively low 651 years.</p><p>  The caveats: Some companies reporting high ratios rely on overseas workers who earn far less than counterparts in the U.S. Some reporting low ratios achieve high median incomes by outsourcing labor. And many C.E.O. pay packages rely on stock, which could make their payouts smaller -- or much larger -- in the end.</p><p>  A day few in Hollywood thought possible</p><p>  The once-untouchable Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein turned himself in to Manhattan police today. The NYT reports was charged with rape and a first-degree criminal sex act, continuing a downfall that led to a global reckoning with sexual harassment and assault.</p><p>  As part of a bail package negotiated in advance, Mr. Weinstein will have to put up $1 million in cash, surrender his passport and agree to wear an ankle-monitoring device. But the charges may not be the last against him, according to the NYT:</p><p>  An investigative grand jury, still convened, will look into other sexual assault allegations against Mr. Weinstein as well as possible financial crimes relating to how he paid women to stay silent, people familiar with the proceedings said.</p><p>  The fallout from the #MeToo movement hasn't stopped yet. The actor Morgan Freeman apologized after several women accused him of sexual harassment.</p><p>FiatChrysler: Don't use cruise control</p><p>FiatChrysler is recalling 4.8 million vehicles in the United States, saying in rare circumstances drivers may not be able to turn off the cruise control, the Associated Press reports.</p><p>  The auto maker warned owners not to use cruise control until the cars, S.U.V.s and trucks can be fixed with a software update. The recall includes 15 Jeep, Dodge, Chrysler and Ram models from six model years.</p><p/><p/><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

Since 2011, T-Mobile U.S.'s parent company, Deutsche Telekom, has been exploring several options to divest its U.S. operations. Recently, the New York Post reported that French broadband service provider, Iliad SA, is considering renewed bid for T-Mobile U.S.</p><p><br/><br/> Earlier this month, Iliad offered $15 billion for a 56.6% stake in the nation's fourth largest telecom operator. However, T-Mobile U.S.'s management immediately rejected the offer on ground of inadequacy. Meanwhile, the New York Post revealed that Iliad is pursuing tech giants Google Inc.(GOOG[2]) and Microsoft Corp.(MSFT[3]) to help it to bid for the second time for T-Mobile U.S.<br/><br/> Both Google and Microsoftprimarily function as software developers. However, in recent times, both of these companies have given clear signals of opting for operational diversification. In keeping with this, Googleacquired the smartphone business of Motorola Mobility, which was later sold to Lenovo and <person><nameText>Microsoft </nameText></person>took over Nokia's smartphone division.<br/><br/> Nevertheless, a direct involvement in the telecom, especially in the wireless business is altogether a different ball game. It is still not clear whether either Googleor <person><nameText>Microsoft </nameText></person>will become a partner of Iliad for its renewed bid for T-Mobile U.S.<br/><br/> Way back in 2011, ATT Inc. (T[4]) placed the first bid for T-Mobile U.S. After a close scrutiny, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) thwarted ATT's attempt to acquire T-Mobile U.S., stating that it seeks a minimum four national carriers in order to maintain competitiveness.<br/><br/> In Jul 2014, Sprint Corp.(S[5]) offered $16 billion for a little over 50% stake in T-Mobile U.S. Again the deal was thoroughly evaluated by both the FCC and the U.S. Department of Justice. The regulators decided for the same opinion. Consequently Sprint opted out from the race. <br/><br/> Meanwhile, satellite TV operator DISH Network Corp.(DISH[6]) has been pursuing the idea to acquire T-Mobile U.S.DISH Networkhas created an extensive portfolio of spectrum, the most important component of wireless networks. Recently, DISH Networkconfirmed its intentions of taking over T-Mobile U.S. after Sprint's bid was stifled down by regulators.<br/><br/> According to industry rumors, cable TV operator Charter Communications Inc., which lost to Comcast Corp.(CMCSA[7]) in its efforts to acquire Time Warner cable Inc., may also submit a proposal for T-Mobile U.S. However, both DISH Networkand Charter Communications have yet to come up with a firm bid. T-Mobile U.S. currently has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).<br/> Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

Certainly, tech sector respondents to our Megatrends Survey 2020 were notably more aware than their peers in other industries of the extent to which new technology can impact existing business models.Even so, we believe that transformation will not be easily achieved as the most influential industry stakeholders are likely to remain wedded to business models that are already less relevant and not easily re-defined. New players will most likely enter the field, augmenting and widening the competitive landscape, diluting market power currently held by just a few multi-disciplined companies.<table><tgroup cols=\"1\" xml:id=\"tgroup_2\"><colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col1\" colwidth=\"640\"/><tbody valign=\"bottom\"><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p> Tech Respondents Grappling With Multiple Challenges </p></entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p>Percentage Of Tech Industry Respondents Identifying 'High Impact' To Business Models By Factor</p></entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"file2028VOfHm26Udw150\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"47764\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></p></entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> Source: Fitch Solutions - Megatrends Survey 2020 </emphasis></p></entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table>Few tech industry respondents believe there will be a 'low' or 'moderate' impact from new technology on existing business models over five- and 30-year periods. Most assigned high-impact scores, with the IoT and smart devices considered to be the most impactful in the short term, and artificial intelligence (AI) attracting greater scrutiny in the longer-term scenarios. In both instances, the advent of greater automation and robotics is seen as having a high impact, too.Increasingly, AI and robotics are expected to have a more tangible and therefore profound impact on human relations with technology, with considerable advances likely to be made over the next 30 years. While we believe that AI will remain not much smarter than it is at present, overly-rapid moves to apply it to autonomous devices, such as vehicles and medical robots, will require more complex legislation to govern its use and misuse.The prospect of, or need for, changing regulations and/or public policy shifts secured notably high-impact scores amongst tech sector respondents, well ahead of participants from almost all other industries who are maybe inured to or dependent upon slow developments in regulation to insulate themselves from disruption to the competitive landscape. Tech companies firmly believe that they are only somewhat prepared to adapt to changing regulations and more so in the case of changing consumer preferences, again highlighting the issue of companies being wedded to outdated business models.<table><tgroup cols=\"1\" xml:id=\"tgroup_3\"><colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col1\" colwidth=\"640\"/><tbody valign=\"bottom\"><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p> Tech Sector Switches To Low-Carbon Footing, But Tech Innovation Will Lead </p></entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p>Percentage of Tech Respondents Identifying Impact Of External Issues On Competitive Landscape</p></entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"file2052z9RmaOd18G936\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"47764\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></p></entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> Source: Fitch Solutions - Megatrends Survey 2020 </emphasis></p></entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">A Data-Driven Economy: Some Context</emphasis> The 'always-on' internet economy is generating massive amounts of data as more devices become connected and those devices become more sophisticated and multi-functional. Computing, communicating and entertainment are the main generators of data at present, but as more autonomous devices - including humans, to a certain extent - are connected to the internet, there will be cycles of exponential growth in data creation.Globally, devices and connections to the internet are growing faster than both the population and the number of human internet users, at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 10% over the 2019-2023 period according to <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Cisco Systems</emphasis>. According to Fitch Solutions forecasts, there will be 65.5bn connected devices in use by 2050, up from 20.2bn at the end of 2020.Driving that growth will be machine-based connections such as smart home systems, robots, connected cars and smart city grids, as well as IoT devices such as remote livestock and crop monitors. We believe that such connections will soon outnumber smartphones and mobile computers and become the principal form of internet device. Globally, machine connections will number 44.8bn by 2050.<table><tgroup cols=\"1\" xml:id=\"tgroup_4\"><colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col1\" colwidth=\"296\"/><tbody valign=\"bottom\"><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p> IoT Devices To Proliferate </p></entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p>Connected Devices By Type (mn)</p></entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"file2085zZgMK7b3Bv689\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"47764\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></p></entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> f = forecast. Source: Fitch Solutions </emphasis></p></entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table>Traditionally, the volume of traffic generated by machine-based connections has been many times smaller than that created by human-operated devices (smartphones, PCs, TVs); however, it is growing faster than the number of connections due to the increasing sophistication of machines and their widening use in an ever-expanding ecosystem of applications that require greater bandwidth and lower latency.Telecoms operators are rapidly losing what little ability they have to both effectively monetise use of services via these connections. The concept of the telco as a 'dumb pipe' - a conduit for third parties' content and services - is not a new one and has been vigorously resisted as telcos have sought to become more diversified through acquiring specialised companies and deploying new technologies. Such strategies have rarely worked as telcos use very rigid, heavily-regulated business models that do not allow for innovation and agility. This becomes an inhibitor of growth in an increasingly service-led industry. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Service-Led Business Models</emphasis> In our view, the Telecoms sector is in urgent need of a paradigm-shift away from an infrastructure-led approach to serving end users, towards a highly service-orientated business model. We have long referred to the end-result as 'Operator-as-a-Service': today's public telecommunications operators will gradually reinvent themselves as pure service providers, fully separate from physical carriage and delivery networks.The process has been underway for some time: in order to manage spiralling costs of building out successive new generations of mobile and wireline broadband infrastructure, operators initially collaborated and subsequently created financially independent businesses to handle network build-out. Selling off passive infrastructure networks (most often towers and supporting connectivity, such as fibre links) represents the latest stage in this process - as just two examples, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Vodafone</emphasis> and <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Orange</emphasis> will be moving very rapidly down this path in 2020 - while others, such as Spain's <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Telefonica</emphasis>, are going further by offloading entire operators in challenging markets that they may yet return to as 'virtual' digital-only service brands.Two traditional operators have so far fully embraced this new paradigm: <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">O2</emphasis> in the Czech Republic and <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Spark</emphasis> in New Zealand. We believe more will follow, but there needs to be greater financial and regulatory incentive for them to commit as companies' debt portfolios and workers' jobs are inextricably linked to infrastructure assets, for which there are relatively few buyers and cannot simply be turned off.Operators such as <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">VEON</emphasis> (Russia) and <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Turkcell</emphasis> (Turkey) have sought to stave off the inevitable by reinventing themselves as digital service-first players, unveiling a raft of productivity, utility, workflow and infotainment services to deepen their relationship with, and extract more income from, end-users. There is, however, a limit to these deepening strategies, as competition from network-agnostic third parties is driving prices down and undermining operators' investments in services. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Therefore, we believe that a full separation of digital infrastructure and digital service will become, by commercial necessity, the new industry paradigm and will have remodelled the TMT competitive landscape by 2050.</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Data Management &amp; Security</emphasis> Ubiquitous connectivity also poses a heightened security risk to the connected planet. As more mass-market devices are connected to the internet - and, therefore, to the IoT - vendors will increasingly compete on cost. The temptation to skimp on security as a means of cutting costs and raising profit margins means that many devices going online over the forthcoming decades may have inadequate security. At the same time, as older devices remain connected to the IoT, so their original security systems will increasingly become ineffective, exposing users and their entire value/production chains to exploitation.<table><tgroup cols=\"1\" xml:id=\"tgroup_5\"><colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col1\" colwidth=\"624\"/><tbody valign=\"bottom\"><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p> More Machines, More Security Needed </p></entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p>Percentage of Tech Respondents Identifying Near-Term Areas Of Investment Focus</p></entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"file20772QMuCGVA1o892\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"47764\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></p></entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> Source: Fitch Solutions - Megatrends Survey 2020 </emphasis></p></entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table>Advances in device technology must be accompanied by advances in digital security, and considerable investment in improved biometrics and data storage will be needed on an ongoing basis. Telecoms companies have progressively moved to add IT services and solutions to their internal skillsets, and some of the more progressive players - such as <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Deutsche Telekom</emphasis> via <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">T-Systems</emphasis> - have been able to commercialise these businesses. Similarly, IT companies - particularly those in the data centres market - are evolving in tandem with their counterparts in the telco space. This trend will also continue through to 2050 and beyond.We expect most of the new technologies mentioned above to be fully ready by 2050, and to have attained critical mass in terms of usage. However, this will only be the case if consumers and users can trust the technology, and therefore must want to use it. High-profile hacks, the growing prevalence of ransomware, and even critical flaws in hardware represent just a few of the vulnerabilities, as more and more data is tracked, collected and analysed. Issues of privacy and regulatory will necessarily mean the involvement of regulation, with a balance required to ensure technology is safe and trustworthy, while giving enough room for entrepreneurs to innovate. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Remote Computing</emphasis> Our over-arching view of technology as a driver/disrupter of business models through to 2050 dwells on the impact of key discrete technologies such as cybersecurity, AI and quantum computing. All three will certainly have an impact on the tech sector as all industry stakeholders will need to make use of them to support their end-users' digital transformation strategies.However, for the TMT sector specifically, we want to highlight the importance of remote computing because user data, analysis of that data and using insights from that analysis to create more bespoke (and therefore more valuable) services will be crucial to the industry players of the future.Cloud computing is often viewed as the core application powered by the IoT. Basic cloud services such as Gmail and iTunes have been available for more than a decade, enabling end-users to access digital content from anywhere in the world, regardless of their physical 'home'. The proliferation of connected devices means that consumers are creating and acquiring digital content across multiple platforms and the way in which they use and share that content itself creates an extensive data footprint. 'Big Data' applications - quantifying, interpreting and responding to individuals', groups', companies' and governments' activities on a real-time basis - will depend heavily on the proliferation of cloud computing services and infrastructure.Increasingly, the ability to analyse the most time-sensitive pieces of data, where speed and latency become key issues, will drive the development of remote computing. An example can be cars, where an autonomous vehicle must know it needs to stop before it hits an unexpected object or person in its path. As such, there have been developments in moving the analytics to the 'edge', which would allow for the analysis to take place in real-time, within the device itself. Analytics at the edge will be applied within individual devices, but the cloud allows for far greater scale, and will therefore have a role in disseminating all the analysis and knowledge collected.<table><tgroup cols=\"1\" xml:id=\"tgroup_6\"><colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col1\" colwidth=\"624\"/><tbody valign=\"bottom\"><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p> North America And Asia Vie For Cloud Dominance </p></entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p>Cloud Traffic Growth By Region (EB), 2015-2035</p></entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"file2049fkHjRn1XBO94\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"47764\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></p></entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> Note: EB = exabyte; 1EB = equivalent content of 250mn DVDs. f = forecast. Source: Fitch Solutions </emphasis></p></entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table>Telcos that engage in IoT service provision will become heavily dependent on third parties' cloud solutions, because they lack the scale and agility to profitably perform these tasks themselves. A clear trend in recent years has been for telcos to sell off their data centres to specialised providers which, in turn, turn to global cloud solutions vendors such as <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Amazon Web Services</emphasis> (AWS) and <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Google</emphasis> to provide the computing part of the equation.Telcos possibly have a greater role to play in edge computing, however, particularly those that either choose to become infrastructure-focused players (thus, building and operating micro data centres serving street furniture in the case of smart city grids, to use the connected cars scenario) or where they act as service providers on large campuses run by major enterprises. In the telecoms space, we believe tower companies have the most to benefit from the emergence of edge computing, as the majority of edge compute instances will involve wirelessly-connected devices that will continuously switch from one tower to another as they change location. Micro data centres built alongside towers can share power supplies, as well as onward communication to larger cloud facilities via the towers' fibre backhaul cables. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Digital-First Regulation</emphasis> Globally, development of smarter infrastructures using disruptive technology will be driven by corporates, in turn driven by their own agendas. This will not always mean that such activities will be undertaken with wider societal and economic considerations in mind. Over the next three decades, we expect to see greater government focus on developing regulatory frameworks which will govern smart infrastructures. Key issues, which will increasingly be brought to the fore, will centre on data collection and management as well as privacy.New and emerging technologies continue to advance at a faster pace than regulation. On one hand, this relative freedom has provided a supportive environment for players to innovate and develop. However, looking forward this will increasingly become a hindrance for global tech players. We expect the challenges of the lack of uniformity in regulation of key technologies - with regulation largely playing out at national level - will weigh heavily on players that are becoming increasingly internationally focused, necessitating compliance across a number of jurisdictions. Regulators will also continue to seek ways to rein-in Big Tech, as well as ensuring that the rules have global application, as evidenced by Google's efforts to limit the European Court of Justice's ruling around the deletion of illegal content to the EU only.Digital services taxation will also remain a focus in 2020 as authorities will continue to grapple with methods to ensure a fair taxation system, which includes the growing number of digital players. As global regulators move towards a more harmonious approach, they will look to expand on the G7's consensus on taxing digital companies, notwithstanding their physical presence being in another member country, to achieve the approval of the G20 and work towards developing a roadmap for taxation.In terms of digital financial services, we believe fintech players will face better opportunities to scale and innovate in markets which have prioritised the establishment of supportive regulatory environments, while markets characterised by relatively inflexible regulation will see weaker growth. We also expect <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Facebook</emphasis>'s plans to launch its cryptocurrency Libra to face heavy opposition. Key concerns will be around risks Libra poses to traditional currencies, the risk of abuse of its systems, as well as Facebook's trustworthiness following a number of highly publicised controversies. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Low-Carbon Policies</emphasis> In our survey, climate change and environmental consideration issues were linked to questions considering the 30-year outlook. For 64% of respondents in the technology and communications field, climate change is seen as having a high impact on future business model; just 7% considered the issue to have no long-term impact. Respondents from most other industry groups also considered climate change to be highly disruptive, ahead of technological innovations such as AI, automation and the IoT.The proportion of tech respondents citing climate change as their main concern was lower than in most other sectors, and we believe that these respondents were taking into account the tech sector's robust progress in climate change mitigation strategies in recent years; other industries are notably late in taking action.<table><tgroup cols=\"1\" xml:id=\"tgroup_7\"><colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col1\" colwidth=\"640\"/><tbody valign=\"bottom\"><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p> Tech Sector Taking Action On Climate Change, But Other Industries Also Forward-Looking </p></entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p>Percentage Of Respondents Identifying Low Carbon Economic Policies As Driving Competitive Landscape Changes</p></entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"file2048O3KlKPCcjw14\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"47764\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></p></entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> Source: Fitch Solutions - Megatrends Survey 2020 </emphasis></p></entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table>2019 was a watershed year with regards to industries' acceptance of their environmental impact and efforts to take remedial action. TMT companies, and those they serve, are among the biggest consumers of natural or scarce resources (power, land, human productivity/creativity) and they are very sensitive to any changes in how they are perceived and judged in this context.With growing numbers of global and regional technology companies now committing to very ambitious carbon-reduction initiatives, ranging from five to 15 years, it is clear that this is a trend that will play a key role in reshaping the competitive landscape through to 2050.Digital services are powered by vast numbers of large computers, all interlinked by a global network of cables, satellites and wireless connections and data are processed in huge computing warehouses, called data centres. All of these need and consume enormous amounts of power, a very high proportion of which comes from fossil fuels or their derivatives.Popular media, e-commerce and information platforms (such as <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Netflix</emphasis>, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Amazon</emphasis> and Google) depend on high non-renewable power consumption and few consumers, if any, are cognisant of this fact. Fewer still are prepared to stop using these platforms unless a shift to renewable power is implemented. Yet, tech companies - and the data centre operators on which they rely - are making efforts to use power in a more sustainable fashion, and numerous power supply agreements have been struck with renewable energy companies by tech giants such as <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Apple</emphasis> and Facebook.In January 2020, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Microsoft</emphasis> announced plans to become 'carbon negative' by 2030. The company already claims to have been carbon-neutral for more than a decade, but this is based through emission offsetting initiatives rather than direct reduction in its own energy-intensive activities. Perhaps recognising that offsetting could become brand-damaging in the future, Microsoft is now turning to carbon capture as well as carbon-scrubbing 'cleaning' technologies to achieve its highly ambitious goals.In the highly competitive technology space, where keeping consumers and shareholders onside is now a core business imperative, we expect many of Microsoft's peers and competitors to aim to become carbon-negative themselves, although a high proportion will likely opt to wait for a few years to assess the efficacy of the new technologies Microsoft plans to use, including some that have not yet been invented. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic/><graphic/><graphic/><graphic/><graphic/><graphic/></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BMINWS-1541401</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BMINWS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6059-N0D1-JD33-J05W-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">252475</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3474\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Business Monitor International Ltd.

Whilst most investment research is underpinned by backwards looking company valuation models, thematic methodology identifies which companies are best placed to succeed in a future filled with multiple disruptive threats. To do this, tracks the performance of the top 600 technology, media and telecom stocks against the 50 most important themes driving their earnings, generating 30,000 thematic scores. The algorithms in \"thematic engine\" help to clearly identify the winners and losers within the TMT sector. Our 600 TMT stocks are categorised into 18 sectors. Each sector scorecard has a thematic screen, a risk screen and a valuation screen. Our thematic research ecosystem has a three-tiered reporting structure: single theme, multi-theme and sector scorecard. This report is a Multi-Theme report, covering all stocks, all sectors and all themes, giving readers a strong sense of how everything fits together and how conflicting themes might interact with one another.<br/><br/>Reasons to buy<br/><br/>- Our thematic investment research product, supported by our thematic engine, is aimed at senior (C-Suite) executives in the corporate world as well as institutional investors.<br/><br/>- Corporations: Helps CEOs in all industries understand the disruptive threats to their competitive landscape<br/><br/>- Investors: Helps fund managers focus their time on the most interesting investment opportunities in global TMT.<br/><br/>- Our unique differentiator, compared to all our rival thematic research houses, is that our thematic engine has a proven track record of predicting winners and losers.<br/><br/>Table of Content: Key Points<br/><br/>1.

Our aim at Neural is to help you make sense of it all. We intend to cut through all the hyperbole and rhetoric with our breaking news and analysis to bring you AI stories that matter to everyday people. But we also want to publish the kind of articles that make you smile and remember why you started reading tech blogs to begin with - like those 'gee whiz' pieces about amazing products and research that wouldn't have been possible just a few short years ago. We understand there's a lot of noise out there in mainstream media, especially when it comes to AI reporting. That's why we're dedicated to using our platform to publish honest, unflinching pieces that explain exactly why what you're reading about matters to you and the people you care about. There's a lot going on in the field of AI. The world's on the cusp of a new regulatory era[1] that'll likely see the industry experience severe shakeups within years. And on the research front, there's incredible progress being made at the intersection of AI and quantum computing[2]. There's also some problems with the field such as a lack of diversity[3], an abundance of bias[4], and a total lack of regulation[5]. Finally, there's some really cool products[6], apps[7], and games[8] out there that take advantage of AI to do amazing things. We're here to cover all that and more. And we want your help. Whether you're a first-time TNW reader or an industry expert who's spoken at our conference[9], we want your feedback so we can make Neural the best source for AI news and analysis that it can be. Let's build this Neural network together. We'll have more exciting news to share about Neural in the coming days and weeks. In the meantime, check out our cool new Neural site here[10]. Fun facts: the Neural font was developed with the help of an artificial neural network and the color scheme was chosen because it's just awesome.

The global market value for AI technologies is now estimated to be in the trillions and there's no ceiling in sight. It's an exciting time for startups and big tech companies who are invested in the industry, but the average person struggles to understand exactly what modern AI is capable of.</p><p><br/>Our aim at Neural is to help you make sense of it all. We intend to cut through all the hyperbole and rhetoric with our breaking news and analysis to bring you AI stories that matter to everyday people.<br/>But we also want to publish the kind of articles that make you smile and remember why you started reading tech blogs to begin with - like those \"gee whiz\" pieces about amazing products and research that wouldn't have been possible just a few short years ago.<br/>We understand there's a lot of noise out there in mainstream media, especially when it comes to AI reporting. That's why we're dedicated to using our platform to publish honest, unflinching pieces that explain exactly why what you're reading about matters to you and the people you care about.<br/>There's a lot going on in the field of AI. The world's on the cusp of a new regulatory era that'll likely see the industry experience severe shakeups within years. And on the research front, there's incredible progress being made at the intersection of AI and quantum computing. There's also some problems with the field such as a lack of diversity, an abundance of bias, and a total lack of regulation. Finally, there's some really cool products, apps, and games out there that take advantage of AI to do amazing things.<br/>We're here to cover all that and more.<br/>And we want your help. Whether you're a first-time TNW reader or an industry expert who's spoken at our conference, we want your feedback so we can make Neural the best source for AI news and analysis that it can be. Let's build this Neural network together.<br/>We'll have more exciting news to share about Neural in the coming days and weeks. In the meantime, check out our cool new Neural site here.<br/>Fun facts: the Neural font was developed with the help of an artificial neural network and the color scheme was chosen because it's just awesome.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ITNEXT-M-648178</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ITNEXT2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y98-FY11-JBYT-H1J8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">410719</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"398\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 FFC Information Solution Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>IT Next</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20189\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"02\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>February 26, 2020</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000116</classCode><className>ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009REC</classCode><className>BLOGS &amp; MESSAGE BOARDS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DMWD</classCode><className>MACHINE LEARNING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>ST000DDFG</classCode><className>QUANTUM COMPUTING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000116</classCode><className>ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009REC</classCode><className>BLOGS &amp; MESSAGE BOARDS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DPKP</classCode><className>BIG TECH</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DMWD</classCode><className>MACHINE LEARNING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>ST000DDFG</classCode><className>QUANTUM COMPUTING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"59\"><classCode>GX142</classCode><className>NEW DELHI, INDIA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

The same is true in the technology world. However, as competitors originating from outside of Silicon Valley rise, so do the stakes for previously unchallenged tech firms, like Uber, Facebook and Google, to enter new markets responsibly. Companies that were once earnest startups helmed by say-anything, hoodie-wearing twenty-somethings are now big corporations with boards, stakeholders and tremendous impacts on society. </p><p>They need to start acting like it. Amid mounting government and public pressures, tech firms famous for pushing far beyond boundaries now need to play by the rules when they enter new cities and towns. They now have to embrace more humble methods of conducting business and admit defeat when younger upstarts create better, faster innovations. Freshly relocated tech companies need to respect the indigenous innovation scene in a chosen location \u2014 not simply conduct headquarter operations somewhere else. They need to bring to every new market entrepreneurial thinking, jobs and a willingness to develop strong connections with public and private sector leaders. The good news is that it\u2019s not too late for tech giants to learn to be responsible, self-aware competitors. However, a few central questions need to be answered: Will big tech companies begin to bring more to cities than they take? Will they become responsible community partners building smart technologies in a way that respects new market values \u2014 especially around diversity, privacy and respect for people\u2019s data? Or will they use their heft to out-maneuver municipal authorities, outbid local startups for engineering talent and ship intellectual property and data back to headquarters? As Uber\u2019s rebrand takes hold, for instance, CEO Dara Khosrowshahi needs to guide his organization toward working with municipal and community leaders \u2014 rather than coexisting with them at best. He and his team need to deepen their understanding of regulatory environments at the city level, play within the rules governing specific places and work to encourage homegrown tech talent in Uber\u2019s new markets to pursue career opportunities with international reach. Uber needs to back up the company\u2019s newly rolled out softer, safer image with concrete efforts to complement the innovation ecosystems already flourishing in cities outside of its hometown of San Francisco \u2014 and compete collaboratively in markets around the world. Other tech giant founders, CEOs and executive teams around the world need to follow suit \u2014 regardless of whether actual suits are involved.  Success requires a balance of fierce competitiveness and humble respect. Indeed, there\u2019s a right way for tech companies to contribute to local causes and be good corporate citizens in general. The process starts with bigger tech companies establishing information exchanges with new communities that build trust and prioritize learning. After establishing operations and understanding the needs of communities surrounding them, tech companies need to prove their genuine interest in local innovation ecosystems. One way to do this is by donating money to a relevant charity or nonprofit organization that provides useful skill development to underserved communities. Another, more humbling, option for tech giants is to invest in native startups building innovations that help them improve corporate citizenship \u2014 a technology that reduces their global carbon footprint, for example \u2014 and complement their own capabilities. I am a serial entrepreneur and optimist. That\u2019s why I believe that technology companies like Uber, Google and Facebook have a unique opportunity to deliver more than monetary investment into communities around the world. They need to assume responsibility for advancing innovation and talent upon arrival in a new city \u2014 and actively build programs that bridge location-specific digital, skill and transportation gaps. Tech giants need to work with government and community peers to connect with local competitors already building the next generation of technology platforms. Success requires a balance of fierce competitiveness and humble respect. The entry of a tech giant to a new place should inspire connectivity, understanding and competition that lifts a community\u2019s entire innovation ecosystem. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">RVMPCU-RLPMN952927620181031</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">RVMPCU2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TM8-4YR1-DXCW-D2GT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">424987</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"741\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Plus Media Solutions Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Plus Company Updates(PCU)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"45923\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"31\" month=\"10\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>October 31, 2018 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

But, what does this mean for Government control on the internet.<br/><br/>Before it was banned by India, TikTok was one of the fastest-growing social sharing apps in the world. Allowing its users to create and share 15 second videos, the platform became a teen favourite across the world. In India, the regular users of TikTok go beyond teens. We have all been regaled with grandmothers in saris dancing to classic movie numbers in the middle of the great Indian outdoors, in addition to other manifestations of talent from across the nation. However, the platform has also been used for other not so benign activities. As late as last month, there were discussions in parliament on the use of TikTok to spread fake news and 'malicious' content.</p><p><br/><br/>Even before the border clash with China that left fatalities on both sides, there had been calls to severely regulate TikTok, if not outright ban it. The main reason being, as per Chinese law, all social media platforms are bound to share data with the Chinese government, and this could have major implications not just for individual privacy, but also for national security. When India banned TikTok and 58 other apps on grounds that the activities that they indulged in were \"prejudicial to sovereignty and integrity of India, defence of India, security of state and public order\" it also accused these apps of \"stealing and surreptitiously transmitting users' data in an unauthorised manner to servers which have locations outside India. The compilation of these data, its mining and profiling by elements hostile to national security and defence of India, which ultimately impinges upon the sovereignty and integrity of India, is a matter of very deep and immediate concern which requires emergency measures.\"<br/><br/>The Trump administration in the USA, which has had a pugilistic relationship with China so far, is mulling a similar course of action. For Trump, China represents a form of capitalism aimed at beggaring the USA. He has always believed that the Chinese Government has consistently bent the rules to make Chinese products more competitive in the international market, and it is this that has had an impact on American jobs. Mr Trump, not the most rational of all leaders, has had a bee in his bonnet about China from before he became President. He has been systematically imposing sanctions on Chinese imports to the USA, and his actions and the Chinese reactions have almost led the world to a trade war. After a series of reports that suggested that American sanctions against China have hurt the Americans more than the Chinese, there was some respite to the standoff, but it seems now that Mr Trump has Chinese app economy in his crosshairs-with both TikTok and WeChat in the line of fire.<br/><br/>Last week, a Trump executive order stated that all transactions with these platforms need to cease within the next 45 days. In the order he noted that the platform's data collection allows the Chinese Communist party to access the personal and proprietary information of Americans-including government employees, posing a danger to the country. He further accused the platform of censoring content that may be against the Communist Government in Beijing. Interestingly, the American President's order also said that the ban, that will come into effect in 45 days, will be against any transactions with Byte Dance, the parent company of TikTok. And, this means that to be considered 'safe' again TikTok needs to be sold, preferably to an American corporation. Right now, a host of companies ranging from Microsoft to Twitter are all talking to Byte Dance to see if they can buy TikTok and allow it to operate.<br/><br/>There are two issues here, both equally important. The first is that of large organisations- including Governments-to have granular access to our data, and help make predictions about the way we behave or trigger us to behave in a particular way. And this is a worrying concern that many privacy activists have raised over the last few years. The second is the ability of the United States to order the stripping of the ownership of a company from one entity and ensuring its sale to another. This is the kind of behaviour that Imperial masters used to indulge in-strip assets from local powers, and hand them over to their own people. The forced sale of TikTok definitely feels like a hark back to a past where western powers would call the shots.<br/><br/>While there are grave issues of the way data can be misused by the Chinese Government, this is a problem that exists with every government or corporation, that may have control on your data. Banning TikTok, as India has done is a suitable response to that kind of a threat. However, the forced sale of a popular app from a Chinese company to an American company has grave implications not just for big tech, but all companies. National security is a term that covers a multitude of sins. Be it steel manufacturing, or telecommunications, pharmaceutical research and development, or food industries-all of them impact national security. Are companies going to be threatened with a sale, if their government does not see eye to eye with the American government?

But, what does this mean for Government control on the internet.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Before it was banned by India, TikTok was one of the fastest growing social sharing apps in the world. Allowing its users to create and share 15 second videos, the platform became a teen favourite across the world. In India, the regular users of TikTok go beyond teens. We have all been regaled with grandmothers in saris dancing to classic movie numbers in the middle of the great Indian outdoors, in addition to other manifestations of talent from across the nation. However, the platform has also been used for other not so benign activities. As late as last month, there were discussions in parliament on the use of TikTok to spread fake news and 'malicious' content.</p><p>Even before the border clash with China that left fatalities on both sides, there had been calls to severely regulate TikTok, if not outright ban it. The main reason being, as per Chinese law, all social media platforms are bound to share data with the Chinese government, and this could have major implications not just for individual privacy, but also for national security. When India banned TikTok and 58 other apps on grounds that the activities that they indulged in were \"prejudicial to sovereignty and integrity of India, defence of India, security of state and public order\" it also accused these apps of \"stealing and surreptitiously transmitting users' data in an unauthorised manner to servers which have locations outside India. The compilation of these data, its mining and profiling by elements hostile to national security and defence of India, which ultimately impinges upon the sovereignty and integrity of India, is a matter of very deep and immediate concern which requires emergency measures.\"</p><p>The Trump administration in the USA, which has had a pugilistic relationship with China so far, is mulling a similar course of action. For Trump, China represents a form of capitalism aimed at beggaring the USA. He has always believed that the Chinese Government has consistently bent the rules to make Chinese products more competitive in the international market, and it is this that has had an impact on American jobs. Mr Trump, not the most rational of all leaders, has had a bee in his bonnet about China from before he became President. He has been systematically imposing sanctions on Chinese imports to the USA, and his actions and the Chinese reactions have almost led the world to a trade war. After a series of reports that suggested that American sanctions against China have hurt the Americans more than the Chinese, there was some respite to the standoff, but it seems now that Mr Trump has Chinese app economy in his cross hairs-with both TikTok and WeChat in the line of fire.</p><p>Last week, a Trump executive order stated that all transactions with these platforms need to cease within the next 45 days. In the order he noted that the platform's data collection allows the Chinese Communist party to access the personal and proprietary information of Americans-including government employees, posing a danger to the country. He further accused the platform of censoring content that may be against the Communist Government in Beijing. Interestingly, the American President's order also said that the ban, that will come into effect in 45 days, will be against any transactions with Byte Dance, the parent company of TikTok. And, this means that to be considered 'safe' again TikTok needs to be sold, preferably to an American corporation. Right now, a host of companies ranging from Microsoft to Twitter are all talking to Byte Dance to see if they can buy TikTok and allow it to operate.</p><p>There are two issues here, both equally important. The first is that of large organisations-including Governments-to have granular access to our data, and help make predictions about the way we behave, or trigger us to behave in a particular way. And this is a worrying concern that many privacy activists have raised over the last few years. The second is the ability of the United States to order the stripping of the ownership of a company from one entity and ensuring its sale to another. This is the kind of behaviour that Imperial masters used to indulge in-strip assets from local powers, and hand them over to their own people. The forced sale of TikTok definitely feels like a hark back to a past where western powers would call the shots.</p><p>While there are grave issues of the way data can be misused by the Chinese Government, this is a problem that exists with every government, or corporation, that may have control on your data. Banning TikTok, as India has done is a suitable response to that kind of a threat. However, the forced sale of a popular app from a Chinese company to an American company has grave implications not just for big tech, but all companies. National security is a term that covers a multitude of sins. Be it steel manufacturing, or telecommunications, pharmaceutical research and development, or food industries-all of them impact national security. Are companies going to be threatened with sale, if their government does not see eye to eye with the American government? And, while the Chinese Government may have ruffled a bunch of feathers, what has happened to TikTok-could happen to any corporation. And, this does not augur well for international trade.</p><p>The writer works at the intersection of digital content, technology, and audiences.

Can I thank my honourable friend, Kettering is very much in my heart, I go through it at least twice a week on the East Midlands train service up and down to my constituency. I'm delighted to hear about the Park and that it is supported by the Heritage Lottery Fund and there are real treasures up and down the country and it is important we invest in it. </p><p>No 2. Tackling disinformation is a key Government priority and in your White Paper we seek to take a world leading approach to doing that. We also seek within that to develop a media literacy strategy to tackle it in terms of the people who are reading it as well. Thank you, civil servants have said they can't see how the day data -- data being gathered for Brexit preparations and does he not see that another mass data gathering exercise is a huge red flag for those worried about a free and fair process? I think it is important to say within this context that what the Government is doing via the Brexit web-site or any any other web-site is firstly nothing out of the ordinary and secondly serves a very useful purpose in making sure we, like businesses, know our users. Can I warmly welcome my honourable friend and his fellow ministers to their leadership roles. Can I urge him to translate the online harm's White Paper into legislation swiftly and agree with me that doing so is not just good for the United Kingdom, because it will create a regulator with the authority to enforce a proper duty of care, but will be an act of global leadership, whether other countries are acting as swiftly as us or not. I should pay tribute to the work my honourable friend did over seaing the birth of the online harm's White Paper and he is right, we should be proud that it is an open democracy such as the United Kingdom that seeks to lead the way on what is an immensely difficult area. He is right to see we should move quickly, but we should move at a pace that allows us to get this vital issue correct. Can I welcome the Secretary of State to her position and I'm looking forward her appearing at our select committee. We undertook a large inquiry into fake news which the Prime Minister's chief advisor refused to attend and is in contempt of Parliament. Would she like to bring Mr Cummings along on 16th October with her? I hesitate to speak on behalf of the Secretary of State in every aspect, but I'm confident she doesn't need to bring a man to answer questions for her. Thank you Mr Speaker. What would be a world class regime for shutting down fake news and disinformation would be if we had courts that were actually accessible in the fight against misbehaviour by big tech. The break through in the court of appeal yesterday in the case of Richard Lloyd shows just how hard it is to bring to account big tech firms like Google, who have clearly misbehaved. So when he does bring the online harm's bill to this House and he might tell us when he expects that to happen, will he look again at the proposals we tabled during committee stage to actually make it far, far easier to bring class actions against some of the biggest firms on earth? He has the chance to level the legal playing field against big tech, will he tell the House that he is determined to seize it? I thank him for that question. We are determined to tackle these vital issues, because we know that the behaviour of social media companies is not always acting in the best interests of all our constituents. Of course we will look at any proposals that are put forward by the party opposite. But I think it is also important to say that we need to get this right and that does require us to work with industry as well as against them.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBCPAR-a8de84e75bbd4918a1cebaeb450c65c6</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBCPAR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X63-56X1-DY08-346T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402041</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"657\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

And sometimes it's only useful in demonstrating how little the general public understands some issues. It would appear that a new survey done by the Knight Foundation[1] about how the internet giants should handle \"news\" content is one of the latter ones. While there's lots of discussion about what the poll results \"say,\" the only thing they really say is that the public has no clue about how the internet and news works -- and that should be the focus. </p><p>We need much greater tech and media literacy. Unfortunately, the poll seems more likely to do the opposite. There are two \"headline\" findings out of the report -- and the fact that the two are almost entirely contradictory should have maybe been a warning sign: Internet platforms shouldn't make any effort to \"customize\" the newsfeed that you see and show the same thing to everyone Internet platforms should be \"subject to the same regulations and newspapers and TV stations.\"Let's dig in a bit to the full survey. The first point is actually split into two separate parts, and the results aren't unsurprising, but (again) really seem to demonstrate media and tech illiteracy more than anything else. First, they were asked if they think it was a good or bad idea for platforms to target news based on interests, and the breakdown here really isn't that definitive in either direction. It's pretty split: <url normalizedValue=\"https://imgur.com/xbklntmThis\">https://imgur.com/xbklntmThis</url> seems perfectly reasonable because the question is kind of... dumb? I mean, it really depends on what kind of service I'm using. If I'm using Twitter, which is a feed-based system where the entire point is to have an ongoing stream of everything the people/organizations I follow tweet, then, I'd be against targeting news, because that's not what I use Twitter for. If it were something else, like Google News, where the entire point is to recommend news, then I'm a lot more open to it. So, the whole premise of this question seems silly. Really, the issue here is that people should know what kind of site they're looking at, and whether it's recommending news or giving you a firehose of news. That's all. But this question doesn't get at that, and I'm guessing that's why the responses are so mixed. But then there's a question about whether platforms should \"exclude\" certain kinds of content. And we get the following responses:      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://imgur.com/u4ye7oaAnd\">https://imgur.com/u4ye7oaAnd</url> there's a related question about how concerned people are about platforms excluding news:      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://imgur.com/UasUKN0Again\">https://imgur.com/UasUKN0Again</url>, while these results can make headlines, they all seem kind of useless. Most people feel that platforms should exclude content that is \"misinformation.\" Well, duh. But that doesn't tell us anything all that interesting, really. And then the latter results seem to conflict with that view, because it claims that the vast majority of people are concerned that platforms excluding news would give people a biased view and restrict expression and such. But... they want to exclude misinformation. Basically, it all goes back to one of the key problems that we've had with the big debate on content moderation. Tons of people are for moderation of \"bad\" content, but they worry (correctly) that moderation done badly will do bad things. And they don't trust the moderators from big tech companies. What does that really tell us? Not very much. Because all of these are conflating a bunch of different sites and different issues, such that anyone can basically cherry pick what they want out of it to try to support their own position. Want to use this study to show that internet platforms should moderate content to get rid of \"fake news\" (without ever defining fake news)? Show the results that people want platforms to intervene there. Want to use this study to show that people don't trust internet platforms to moderate at all? Show the other results. What useful points can be gleaned from this? So far, mainly just that this study is useless. So, you see stories about this study claiming that Americans think platforms should stop filtering news[2], even though only some of the study says that, and other parts say the exact opposite. And then there's another hidden tidbit that was the lead in some of the press coverage: that \"Americans favor more regulation of internet sites.\"[3] Regulation of what and how? Well, again, this study fails completely in that it never actually says. The only bit on regulation is the following:Seventy-nine percent of Americans strongly or somewhat agree that major internet companies should be subject to the same rules and regulations as newspapers and broadcast news stations are. Twenty percent strongly or somewhat disagree.That's it. Literally, that's it. There's a little bit more of a discussion about the breakdown based on age, but there is no discussion of what the fuck this even means -- because it means literally nothing. What \"regulations\" do newspapers and broadcast news face? Well, not much? But, it really kind of depends. Broadcast news may face some FCC regulations because they use the public airwaves. But newspapers don't. And internet sites don't. Because they don't use the public airwaves. Other than that, they already face the same basic \"rules and regulations.\" So it's not at all clear how -- as a bunch of people have claimed -- this study supports the idea for \"increased\" regulation of internet sites. Honestly, this feels like a kind of push poll and it's kind of shameful that the Knight Foundation and Gallup -- both of which should know better -- would do such a thing. After asking all these random amorphous meaningless questions about internet platforms, they then jump in with a question about regulating the platforms without defining or clarifying what regulations they're even talking about, in an area where the vast majority of the public will have literally no idea what those limited regulations are? What good is that other than to just get people to say \"sure, they should all be on an equal footing.\" About the only interesting tidbit I can find in the entire damn study is that those who are moderately technically savvy -- defined as \"very familiar with computer algorithms\" -- are marginally more inclined than those who are less tech savvy to say that end users should be responsible for finding accurate and unbiased news, rather than the internet platforms. But that's really about it.      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://imgur.com/QdlC3mqSo\">https://imgur.com/QdlC3mqSo</url>, what are we left with? A weird survey that feels more like a push poll, that lets anyone take the info and make any argument they want. When the only conclusions that seem to really come out if it are: (1) this is a really awful and confusing survey, and (2) most people have no idea what regulations there are around news.Permalink[4] | Comments[5] | Email This Story[6] [ 1]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.knightfoundation.org/reports/major-internet-companies-as-news-editors\">https://www.knightfoundation.org/reports/major-internet-companies-as-news-editors</url> [ 2]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cjr.org/the_media_today/americans-platforms-news-filtering.php\">https://www.cjr.org/the_media_today/americans-platforms-news-filtering.php</url> [ 3]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.baltimoresun.com/entertainment/tv/z-on-tv-blog/bs-fe-zontv-gallup-internet-poll-20180814-story.html\">http://www.baltimoresun.com/entertainment/tv/z-on-tv-blog/bs-fe-zontv-gallup-internet-poll-20180814-story.html</url> [ 4]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20180816/17555640447/today-useless-surveys-some-people-want-internet-companies-to-stop-filtering-news-some-dont.shtml\">https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20180816/17555640447/today-useless-surveys-some-people-want-internet-companies-to-stop-filtering-news-some-dont.shtml</url> [ 5]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20180816/17555640447/today-useless-surveys-some-people-want-internet-companies-to-stop-filtering-news-some-dont.shtml#comments\">https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20180816/17555640447/today-useless-surveys-some-people-want-internet-companies-to-stop-filtering-news-some-dont.shtml#comments</url> [ 6]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20180816/17555640447/today-useless-surveys-some-people-want-internet-companies-to-stop-filtering-news-some-dont.shtml?op=sharethis\">https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20180816/17555640447/today-useless-surveys-some-people-want-internet-companies-to-stop-filtering-news-some-dont.shtml?op=sharethis</url></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-DIRT1023051535137616065251762500191</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DIRT-0001</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5T3X-N731-JCMN-Y2JH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1292\"/><timeReceived>7:06 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Techdirt</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"08\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>August 24, 2018 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001347</classCode><className>POLLS &amp; SURVEYS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009RD1</classCode><className>INTERNET SOCIAL NETWORKING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000954</classCode><className>INTERNET &amp; WWW</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009RD1</classCode><className>INTERNET SOCIAL NETWORKING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>N515120CC</classCode><className>TELEVISION INDUSTRY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

After months of heightened antitrust scrutiny, the House Judiciary Committee has finally set up a blockbuster confrontation with big tech: the CEOs of Apple, Amazon, Google and Facebook will testify Wednesday before the committee on their companies' dominance as digital platforms.The hearing is part of the Antitrust Subcomittee's investigation into the companies and the 'adequacy of existing antitrust laws and enforcement[2].' While the congressional hearing itself won't break up big tech, the actual antitrust enforcers are also investigating those same companies: the Department of Justice Antitrust Division is pushing forward[3] with their investigation into Google, while the Federal Trade Commission continues its probe[4] into Google, Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Microsoft. As American Economic Liberties Project's Sarah Miller recently explained[5], this cross-political party effort to confront monopoly power was unthinkable 18 months ago, yet takes on even more importance as the pandemic further entrenches the power of the four companies which dominate e-commerce, social media, online advertising and the Apple App Store respectively. Yet these companies knew for years that a reckoning was in the works. </p><p>They've been building up their defenses, and a key component of that defense is the antitrust enforcement officials who take a trip through the revolving door to the benefit of corporate clients. At antitrust enforcement agencies like the FTC \u2014 where 52 of 81 officials[6] joined private law firms or acquisition-fueled corporations after departing the Commission \u2014 defending corporate clients after ostensibly serving public interests is increasingly the norm. This norm extends to the legislative branch as well as the executive: Hal Singer recently wrote[7] in the American Prospect on the concerning rise of congressional staffers flocking to big tech jobs, taking with them knowledge of the latest attempts to fix holes in antitrust laws and regulation. Singer expertly dissects the conflicts of interest in these professional moves, noting 'there's a strong public-interest motive to deny this free exercise of movement from government to the corporate sector if it conflicts with proper corporate regulation.' The tech giants facing the hot seat in July benefit from and feed into this culture both through direct hires, retaining BigLaw counsel that also hires former antitrust officials[8], and through the general corruption of incentives at the enforcement agencies which favors corporate interests over public. Amazon has directly hired at least four antitrust officials since the beginning of the year. The Revolving Door Project previously tracked[9] at least three FTC officials who joined Amazon in early 2020: Amy Posner and Elisa Kantor Perlman became corporate counsels, and Antara Dutta became a principal economist. Amazon's newest hire, Scott Fitzgerald, hails from the DOJ Antitrust Division, where he worked on health care industry cases in the Litigation I Section and eventually became the assistant chief of the Healthcare and Consumer Products Section. Fitzgerald joined Amazon in May as an in-house antitrust corporate counsel. With Bezos's upcoming testimony and Amazon's ongoing DOJ investigation[10], Fitzgerald will soon find himself in the position of defending Amazon against the members of Congress who just three months ago oversaw his work, as well as his colleagues at the DOJ. He joins fellow revolver Nate Sutton, the Amazon competition counsel and former DOJ Antitrust lawyer who is under investigation[11] for potentially misleading Congress on the company's data practices. Sutton testified that Amazon doesn't use 'individual seller data directly to compete' with third-party businesses, a claim the Wall Street Journal proved false earlier this year[12]. There's also Bryson Bachman, the former senior counsel to Assistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim. Amazon poached[13] Bachman amidst heightened antitrust scrutiny in 2018. And we would be remiss not to mention that antitrust expert and former DOJ Antitrust official Fiona Scott Morton has been advising[14] both Amazon and Apple. Morton has co-authored papers on the antitrust case against Google[15] and Facebook[16], and has espoused guidance on the future of antitrust enforcement, all the while getting paid by the other half of the big tech problem. Morton likely advises Amazon and Apple through her position as a senior consultant[17] with Charles River Associates, one of the economic consulting firms[18] that sell expert insight to both the antitrust agencies and corporations. In fact, Amazon needn't always hire former antitrust officials directly. Bezos is being advised by Covington &amp;#38; Burling[19], a politically-connected BigLaw firm that boasts[20] at least 13 competition lawyers that worked for either the FTC or DOJ Antitrust before joining the firm, including former FTC commissioner (and former Biden advisor) Terrell McSweeny. Amazon's named counsel from Covington is Robert K. Kelner, who specializes[21] in guiding corporations through congressional investigations. Amazon is not alone in its aggressive poaching: the rest of big tech has also hired former antitrust officials to bolster their legal teams. Back in 2018, Facebook made headlines[22] for hiring the former DOJ Antitrust chief in San Francisco, Kate Patchen, amidst increasing[23] antitrust scrutiny. Facebook is pulling a similar move this year: the company hired former FTC deputy director Barbara Blank[24] this April. Blank led the Bureau of Competion's Anticompetitive Practices division, which focuses on shaping Commission-wide policy[25] as well as enforcement efforts. Of course, big tech isn't just looking to poach former antitrust officials as part of its strategy to avoid federal attention \u2014 Facebook's recent hire of Sen. Richard Blumenthal's (D-CT) formal counsel on the Senate Judiciary Committee illustrates their appetite for congressional staffers as well. In May, Facebook poached Aparna Patrie as the company's new manager of public policy for its News Tab feature, which has attracted considerable attention given its role in shaping the information users see. In March, Apple hired former DOJ Antitrust senior counsel for intellectual property Frances Marshall as a senior standards counsel. Apple is also currently on the hunt for a new in-house competition counsel, noting in the job listing[26] that 'preference will be given to candidates with government antitrust experience.' Google, meanwhile, has antitrust revolvers like their senior competition counsel (and former DOJ Antitrust attorney) Kevin Yingling to help shepherd the tech giant through the various investigations relatively unharmed. But the revolving door might work in Google's favor more pervasively: The DOJ reportedly hired 'name brand[27]' outside counsel to spearhead potential litigation against the company, seemingly owing to conflicts of interest in the Antitrust Division's leadership. Assistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim recused himself[28] from the investigation, as he lobbied the DOJ in favor of Google's 2007 acquisition of DoubleClick while at Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck. Delrahim's deputy, Barry Nigro, also recused[29] himself from the case for unknown reasons; it could be related to his many years at BigLaw practices like Fried Frank. The recusal of the Antitrust Division's top two enforcers makes clear just how entrenched Google is at the highest levels of the antitrust world. Right now, there is a dizzying absence of trustworthy and sustained government experience on the case. As it stands, the case is led by Attorney General Bill Barr, a seemingly corrupt consigliere[30] to President Trump worthy of impeachment[31]; an outside counsel (likely from a BigLaw firm) yet to be named; and two officials who both joined the Division less than nine[32] months[33] ago. Of course, those officials, Ryan Shores and Alex Okuliar, have plenty of experience from the other side of the aisle: Before joining the Division, Shores was a partner in Shearman &amp;#38; Sterling's antitrust practice, while Okuliar came from an antitrust partnership at Orrick, Herrington &amp;#38; Sutcliffe. While their experience might qualify Okuliar and Shores to lead the case in the eyes of the Antitrust Division, their extensive corporate advocacy may hint at another BigLaw gig in the future \u2014 and further undermines the ambitions of career DOJ lawyers who hope to ascend to top posts with public service experience alone. While supporters herald the Antitrust Division's case against Google as a long-in-the-works reckoning, the case is distressingly in the hands of officials with conflicts of interest. And that is the power of the revolving door: even when those with explicit conflicts of interest have left the room, those who are left still have questionable dedication to the public interest. The hearing and investigations are an important step in confronting Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google, but nonetheless, these companies will continue to use the former government officials who get jobs defending private interests to protect and bolster their monopoly power. To truly challenge the power of big tech, Congress, a potential-future Biden administration and the antitrust enforcement agencies must dismantle the revolving door culture at the agencies and restrict the influence of 'career' antitrust officials who choose to leave public service for corporate clients.

It's as if we are experiencing a giant global economic Rubik's Cube of frustration.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Mohamed El-Erian: While the consensus baseline for the global economy points to a synchronized pick up in growth, albeit a still-muted one, it is subject not just to uncertainty but, to use former Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke's phrase, \"unusual uncertainty\" on account of four economic issues. And all this is before we consider geo-political risks and rather fluid domestic and, in the case of Europe, regional political landscapes.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The first economic uncertainty is the consistently sluggish behavior of productivity. The second is the persistence of \"lowflation,\" despite a sharp fall in unemployment and years of ultra-loose monetary policy; or what current Fed Chair Janet Yellen has called the inflation \"mystery.\" The third is weak wage dynamics, again despite significant employment gains--we recently saw an historically unusual call by European Central Bank President Mario Draghi on the German unions to step up their wage demands.</p><p>And then there's the fourth element which relates to what I call the global adding-up challenges--from virtually no country willing to live with a stronger currency to simmering protectionist threats and weak global policy coordination that no longer shares a common vision and a common objective. There is also the question of how the global economy would handle the eventuality of more than one systemically important central bank trying to normalize its monetary policy after many years of reliance on unconventional measures. It seems that one bank, the U.S. Federal Reserve, is able to deliver, borrowing a concept investor Ray Dalio used in another context, a \"beautiful normalization.\" It is not clear what happens when several try to do so.</p><p>Smick: In the past, some industrialized economy somewhere was always willing to accept a strong currency. That appears to be changing.</p><p>El-Erian: Correct. Nowadays, the currency market has what I think of as \"hot potato syndrome\"--that is, virtually no one seems willing and able to live with a sustainably stronger exchange rate. This is not only due to the rather weak growth fundamentals that persist in the advanced economies and that have aggravated the inequality trifecta--of income, of wealth, and of opportunities. In addition, technological innovation, spearheaded by the increasingly powerful combination of artificial intelligence, big data, and mobility, is changing not just what we do, but also how we do things. On top of that, we have protracted policy over-reliance on central banks as the only game in town in terms of delivering macroeconomic outcomes.</p><p>Smick: Central bankers have completely ignored the fiscal side. They have let the governments off the hook.</p><p>El-Erian: And it appears that the politicians may have gotten too comfortable letting the central banks carry too much of the policy burden. This is a challenging time for central banking, whose policy tools are stretched while several systemically important institutions are subject to greater political scrutiny. In such a world, central bankers have two choices when it comes to basic policy orientation.</p><p>The first is to become highly data-dependent, retain maximum policy optionality, and keep waiting for the high-frequency data before making decisions; all this while also seeking to continue to suppress financial volatility, boost asset prices, and minimize any market disruptions. The second choice is to decide to develop a more definitive and confident vision as to where all this is going, then try and shape more actively the journey to a better destination.</p><p>Central bankers in the advanced economies are mostly in the first camp right now because they have a strong sense that the destination is not theirs to deliver. Rather, high and inclusive growth requires the deployment of additional tools relating both to supply responsiveness and demand management that central banks simply do not possess. In the process, we end up with rather short-term policymaking and a potentially unhealthy co-dependence between central banks and financial markets.</p><p>It is important to remember that this is not the fault of central banks. Indeed, if it weren't for their bold policy actions, the world would have fallen into a multi-year economic depression in 2008-2009 and, in the case of Europe, the eurozone would have collapsed shortly thereafter. Rather, it reflects continued delays in a much-needed policy handoff--from excessive reliance on central banks to a more comprehensive policy response.</p><p>Smick: I never would have imagined we'd see the political community more hawkish than the central bankers.</p><p>El-Erian: When Chairman Bernanke in August 2010 signaled that the Fed would use unconventional measures not to normalize financial markets as the central bank did very well in 2008-2009, but to pursue much broader macroeconomic objectives, he specified the policy equation in terms of \"benefits, costs, and risks.\"</p><p>The longer unconventional monetary policy has used the asset markets and financial valuations to try to deliver better economic outcomes, the lower the benefits have been, and the higher the costs and the risks, including political ones.</p><p>No one envisaged that the U.S. Federal Reserve would remain in this policy mode for so long--over-relying, along with the ECB and the Bank of Japan, on an inherently narrow policy response. Remember, central banks cannot promote productivity-enhancing infrastructure. They cannot remove the anti-growth biases in tax systems. They don't have the means to improve the functioning of the labor market, pursue education reform, or enhance skill acquisition. And they alone cannot deliver the required level of global policy coordination.</p><p>One of the particularly unfortunate consequences of protracted over-reliance on central banks has been to benefit asset prices and asset holders to a huge extent, inadvertently amplifying concerns about not just the inequality of income and wealth, but the inequality of opportunities. This has fueled a political backlash, with some people asking, wait a minute, why don't we have quantitative easing benefiting people and not just the rich holding financial assets? They argue that if central banks are going to expand their balance sheet, they should give money to people to consume, and not just benefit holders of financial assets. The central bank would then become an explicit fiscal agency, with all the potential political consequences.</p><p>Smick: Ten years from now, will we still be talking about GDP and the wealth effect? Will wages continue to be flat or decline? With so much of the wealth that has been produced coming from equity markets and real estate appreciation, inequality has greatly increased. Will this trend continue?</p><p>El-Erian: In the beginning of 2009, working closely with my PIMCO colleagues, I came up with the concept of the \"new normal\"--that your typical V-shaped cyclical recovery would face secular and structural challenges, for several reasons. Most importantly, society had overinvested in finance as an engine of growth, and hadn't invested enough in genuine drivers of growth. In fact, with the exception of Germany ten to twelve years ago, no other industrial country has seriously invested in infrastructure or reformed its labor markets and sufficiently improved its education and skill acquisition systems. It just didn't happen. Instead, countries over-relied on finance, competing to be financial centers and falling into the trap of believing that financial engineering was not just a risk mitigator, which proved wrong, but also an engine of sustainable growth.</p><p>So it was clear to us that most advanced economies didn't have robust enough growth models, and putting a new growth model in place takes time and needs political vision and sustained implementation. As a consequence, we were entering this period of \"new normal\" where growth would be unusually low, and for an unusually long period of time.</p><p>Now, some say the new normal--later labeled by others as \"secular stagnation\" and the \"new mediocre\" per the International Monetary Fund--not only is a good historical explanation for what's happened since the global financial crisis, but can also predict the next five years. The problem is that when a sophisticated market economy runs at low speed for a long time, structural stress increases and things start to break. The social consensus is pressured. The politics of anger start dominating. We start getting improbable or unthinkable outcomes--such as Brexit and, more broadly, an anti-establishment wave that mistrusts existing institutions and expert opinion--as the social and political consequences of low growth broaden. In short, we cannot continue to run the global economy at a low growth rate forever. At some point, it tips either to higher and more inclusive growth, together with genuine financial stability, or to recession and unsettling financial volatility.</p><p>Add to that, we are close to exhausting the asset channel as the principal vehicle for promoting growth. Asset prices have been fundamentally decoupled from economic fundamentals. As such, in the next few years, the new normal is likely to yield to something else, with economic governance being a major determinant.</p><p>Rather than a pure economic policy engineering issue, how we tip is a function of your political predictions. If you believe that political disruptions--the election of Mr. Trump here, Mr. Macron in France, Brexit in the United Kingdom--can unleash better economic governance, then you take an optimistic view that comprehensive policy reforms can push growth higher, make it more inclusive, validate elevated financial asset prices, and allow central banks to normalize policy in an orderly fashion.</p><p>If, however, you think the political system will remain highly polarized and hinder a comprehensive economic policy response, then low growth would become recession, asset markets would become highly volatile, and the political situation would get a lot trickier. I think that if you run it forward, the \"new normal\" is fueling its own contradictions, its own stresses. Otherwise, you cannot fully explain all these unthinkables that have occurred, be they economic, financial, or political.</p><p>Smick: Does that explain why the VIX remains low despite a U.S. president talking about preemptive strikes against the North Koreans? How do you explain the stock market? Is it liquidity-driven at a time when the market seems psychotically driven to buy the dips? Even if Fed Chair Janet Yellen tightens further, does it matter to equity markets, particularly if every other major central bank continues pumping out liquidity like mad?</p><p>El-Erian: The problem is not just low volatility and high asset prices. It's also that traders and investors are now conditioned to buy every dip in the market regardless of the cause of the dip.</p><p>It's a strategy that pays investors repeatedly. An investor who had bought every dip regardless of cause would have made a lot money. Why? Because looking at the expected risk-return equation, an important influence is how fat the tail is.</p><p>If you believe the central banks are in the business of repressing volatility, and will therefore make the bad tail very thin, the right strategy is to buy every dip because the central banks will always respond to repress volatility and boost prices. In the process, the markets end up essentially front-running central banks, decoupling asset prices more and more from the underlyimg fundamentals. I call it the \"BFF syndrome,\" because the markets believe that the central banks are their best friends forever.</p><p>Despite North Korea and everything else, this year so far has seen the lowest daily maximum loss in the whole history of the S&amp;P stock index. The danger is that this is not a destination, this is a journey, and you can have a fun journey that ends up in a really bad destination if you are not careful. But investors are betting that the journey will be very long. And, at least so far, this has been a very profitable strategy.</p><p>Smick: The world's central bankers seem to be surprised by their inability to come to terms with disinflation and deflation. The truth is, central banks haven't had a great track record. They keep understating their inflation targets. To what extent has China's economy had a disinflationary effect on the world economy, particularly in the last five years? Should central banks be more concerned with developments in China? Where does globalization and technology fit into the equation?</p><p>El-Erian: Three important factors, some of which we don't yet sufficiently understand, have altered inflation dynamics. The first is globalization, including the role of China. The second is the impact of technology, which changes not just innovation and price determination but also the use of existing assets. The third is demographics.</p><p>These three factors together have fundamentally altered the inflation dynamic. Let me use a simple example to illustrate one of the deeper phenomena.</p><p>As of two years ago, it had taken Hilton Hotels one hundred years to offer 700,000 rooms to clients around the world. Yet it took Airbnb just six years to offer a million rooms, and they never built or managed a hotel. Indeed, they had a completely different playbook, disrupting the hotel industry from \"another world.\"</p><p>What did they use? Existing assets. Airbnb put pressure on lodging prices by better using existing assets, much as Uber has put pressure on limousine and taxi rates.</p><p>This was made possible by the very powerful combination of artificial intelligence, big data, and mobility. Suddenly, in order to understand inflation behavior, it's necessary to realize prices are now being influenced by a different deployment of existing assets. And that's just one of a set of powerful forces in play that we don't yet fully understand. And globalization works with technology in continuing to bring in new resources that impact both supply and demand.</p><p>It is also worth remembering that the chosen quantitative inflation targets were somewhat arbitrary to start with--there was really nothing magical about the 2 percent target that so many central banks adopted. Yes, when specified, the figure was consistent with the recent history of inflation and, in the case of the later adopters, consistent with what other central banks had done. But they lacked, and still lack, rigorous forward-looking analytical underpinnings.</p><p>Smick: Why are central banks so fixated on that number?</p><p>El-Erian: Because it is hard to predict the consequences of changing it, and these could well be quite broad and hard to control--from potentially undermining the anchoring of inflationary expectations to opening up central banks to political interference. Add to that, there is still no agreement as to the direction of change should the 2 percent target be put in play.</p><p>Some believe that, given how the structure of the economy has been changing, the \"right\" inflation target could well be less than 2 percent. Others favor a higher inflation target, either directly or by targeting a price level.</p><p>Smick: If you were devising a growth plan for the industrialized nations, how would you factor in the demographic headwind?</p><p>El-Erian: A question many years ago on my Cambridge University entrance exam was, \"With every mouth, God sends a pair of hands. Discuss.\" That question is very relevant to our current demographic situation.</p><p>An aging population has significant influence not only on flows, but on stocks. As age expectancy goes up, the mouth remains in play but the hands are less productive, so other hands have to work harder and give up more.</p><p>It's no surprise to me that a segment of the young electorate has been attracted to left-wing politicians such as Bernie Sanders and Jeremy Corbyn. There's a sense that they are on the receiving end of our generation having over-consumed and over-borrowed, and now they will have to carry us for even longer.</p><p>Demographic change happens slowly. Yet the underlying dynamics can become self-feeding. For example, the longer the current period of low growth, the more potential growth tends to be pulled downward. The longer the labor participation rate remains low, the more difficult it is to bring people back into the labor force. The longer it takes to modernize skill acquisition and reform the education system, the more earning potential is reduced and the greater the inequality of opportunities.</p><p>With all that in play, it is no surprise that, for the first time, people in advanced economies are starting to worry that their kids' generation will not do better than their own. We have policies that can significantly reduce that risk, if only the political system can enable their sustained implementation.</p><p>Smick: Polling shows fewer young people believe in the free enterprise capitalist system.</p><p>El-Erian: Sure. People will tolerate wealth and income inequality up to a certain point, and that point is quite high in certain countries such as the United States. There's a fundamental belief that such inequality could in fact be a good thing. Incentives matter. If you can be a Mark Zuckerberg and you create and grow Facebook, yes, you should be rewarded handsomely for that. But what really matters is the inequality trifecta: not just income and wealth, but also opportunity. For example, the difference between public and private education has widened significantly. There's anger that the playing field is no longer level.</p><p>Smick: Thirty years ago, an American from the bottom 25 percent in terms of income had a 25 percent chance of reaching the top 25 percent. Now the chance is 5 percent. To what extent are the major cleavages in the economic debate are less right and left and more big and small? Part ot the reason projected economic growth is so modest is the perception that the system, as Bernie Sanders says, is rigged. Large companies control the platforms, they control the patent system, and the complexity of the tax code is to their advantage. It's much tougher for the upstarts. Since the financial crisis, financing to sustain a business has been very difficult to come by, because community banks and regional banks have been ripped apart by the central bank fixation on large, systemically risky banks. Because of Citizens United and the vast flows of money into politics, it is difficult to get the political element to concentrate on the problems of smaller companies.</p><p>El-Erian: Do you think that has happened because there's a winner-take-all dynamic in place, or because the system has been co-opted in certain ways?</p><p>Smick: I think it has been co-opted because there's so much political money involved. I saw a recent campaign solicitation letter asking for a top contribution of $250,000. But the truth is that with super PACs included, there is no limit. The tech companies in particular have been effective at stifling competition through political muscle or outright purchase of potential competitors. The last thing a tech CEO wants is some Mark Zuckerberg wannabe sitting in his dorm room at Harvard coming up with a disruptive idea. But is this stifling of competition good for the economy in the long term?</p><p>El-Erian: There are some really interesting issues here. One is the notion that big tech, as it is now called, has become systemically important. It happened much faster than anyone was ready for, be it regulators, the public at large, or the companies themselves. These platforms throw off tremendous cash and are systemically important in the way people communicate, think, and access information. Now there's starting to be a backlash with governments looking to tax and regulate more.</p><p>Second, no matter which industry you're in, even if it's regulated like the financial services industry, you suddenly realize that you are likely to be disrupted by people who come from another world. They may not know what you know about your industry, but do know a lot about technology--particularly the combination of big data, AI, and mobility--and are willing to try to disrupt you.</p><p>Assuming they aren't in deep denial, companies have to make a really hard decision about how to respond to actual and potential disruption. First, they ask whether they can disrupt themselves in a positive way. That's really hard to do. Second, they ask whether they can buy the disrupter, bring them in house, and learn from them. Most companies who bring in disrupters struggle with the different culture and way of doing things, and risk ending up essentially crushing the disrupter. Third, companies try to meet the disrupter in the middle and get first access to the ideas through various joint venture arrangements. That's also hard because the access isn't perfect.</p><p>What is the right approach for an established company? It's yet to be determined which approach works best. I suspect it varies from industry to industry, and from company to company. And that speaks to a bigger issue.</p><p>There are more fundamental questions about how to organize a firm today. Look at the banking system. It's not clear that someone starting from scratch would organize a bank the way it's organized at present.</p><p>No wonder former Bank of England Governor Mervyn King used the phrase \"radical uncertainty,\" and former Fed Chair Ben Bernanke talked about \"unusual uncertainty.\" Whatever you call it, the operating environment is a lot more fluid today than in the past, including on account of political and economic issues. As such, the distribution of potential outcomes becomes much broader and less comforting.</p><p>In a normal distribution, we operate with a very high expectation of certain outcomes, and the tails, the possibility of a really good thing or really bad thing happening, are relatively thin. We lead the vast majority of our lives based on this distribution, real and perceived. Increasingly, however, the familiar is becoming less probable and the tails are becoming fatter.</p><p>From the work of behavioral science, including the behavioral economist Richard Thaler who was just awarded the Nobel Prize, we know a bit about how people react when you put them in this fundamentally uncomfortable world. Some are vulnerable to blind spots, which ends up by undermining timely responses. After all, part of our construct has blind spots and unconscious biases. These people will continue operating in the middle when really they should be thinking about what the tails look like.</p><p>A second group of people is going to do what married couples tend to do sometimes, which is reframe the issue to make it more comfortable. It's as if they need to leave for the airport, and I tell them today that, rather than depart at 2 pm, their flight is going to leave at either 8 am or 8 pm. These people have never been in a world in which the flight left at either 8 am or 8 pm, so they reason maybe I meant the midpoint between 8 am and 8 pm, which is 2 pm. They will operate as if the flight left at 2 pm even though they heard something completely different.</p><p>The third reaction is the most regrettable. It's called active inertia.</p><p>A person, or company, knows they need to do something different, comes up with a plan, then ends up doing more of the same thing. When an American tourist, for example, encounters someone who doesn't understand English, he will tend to repeat his question still in English, but louder. The tourist realizes that something is wrong and he needs to act differently, the active part of active inertia, but essentially reverts to what he has already been doing, or the inertia part.</p><p>Another example comes from the work of Donald Sull of the London Business School. He points out that IBM identified the PC revolution before it happened, and management and the board realized they needed to change. IBM needed to prepare for the PC world because some of their clients would migrate there and new clients would come in; and they needed to take their mainframe offering up the value-added curve.</p><p>In sum, they needed a bar-belled approach instead of staying in the belly of the curve. The right strategy was identified by management and approved by the board. But when it came to implementation, people were so uncomfortable operating there that IBM ended up concentrating too many of its resources in the wrong place.</p><p>Think of it. I would have bet on IBM on the eve of the PC revolution. They were the top technology brand. They had massive R&amp;D budgets and were very profitable. Then, if I heard they had identified the right strategy, I would absolutely have bet on them. But they had problems managing the transition. If they hadn't completely reinvented themselves in the years since, they wouldn't even exist today.</p><p>The fourth reaction to an uncomfortable world is to do the right thing, mixing resilience and agility. You need both as the chance of making a mistake is quite high because we've been taken out of our comfort zone into areas that don't speak easily to our cognitive ability. This demonstrates the importance of having cognitive diversity, an open mind, and willingness to think about multiple scenarios.</p><p>Smick: You mentioned earlier the behaviorist theory of economics. To what extent is our deeply partisan, dysfunctional political system a factor in the minds of corporate decision makers? In other words, is Washington dysfunction contributing to the new normal?</p><p>El-Erian: If you look at economic risk-taking in the form of corporate investment, you're absolutely right. Companies are sitting on massive amounts of cash. They're not investing it in new plants and equipment, instead, they're giving quite a bit of it back to their shareholders through higher dividends. One of the puzzles is why corporate investment isn't higher, given that interest rates are so low and companies have so much cash.</p><p>The level of financial risk-taking, however, is high. Part of the difference between the two is that financial risk-takers believe they can reverse their decisions quickly. They'll be the first ones out. Economic risk-takers know that once they invest in plants and equipment, it's a five- to ten-year proposition.</p><p>Smick: Every trader thinks he'll be the first to sell when complications arise. Often that doesn't happen.</p><p>El-Erian: Charles Prince, the former CEO of Citigroup, said a few weeks before he lost his job in the global financial crisis something along the lines of, \"When the music stops, in terms of liquidity, things will be complicated. But as long as the music is playing, you've got to get up and dance.\" And the music stopped abruptly, and things got very complicated.</p><p>Smick: They sure did.</p><p>TIE Founder and Editor David Smick sits down with Mohamed El-Erian.</p><p>Mohamed A.

The willingness to do so will first be tested in coming months in Silicon Valley's backyard, as a piece of legislation makes its way through California's state capitol in Sacramento. First introduced in February by assemblyman Marc Levine, the legislation seeks to establish a data protection authority that would be charged with regulating how big tech companies request and use Californians' personal data. The regulated data would include people's names, social security numbers, driver's license numbers, financial account data, medical data, and email addresses, among other information. If passed by the legislature and signed into law by governor Jerry Brown, the authority would be an important and symbolic step toward reining in the power of technology companies. It would also be a bold signal by California to Washington that if federal lawmakers won't step up to the challenge of monitoring giant technology companies, California will take matters into its own hands.\"  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Facebook</emphasis></p><p>Elon Musk joins <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/23/technology/elon-musk-deletefacebook.html\">#DeleteFacebook</url>: \"The tech luminary began by criticizing Sonos, a maker of wireless speakers, which had pulled some ads from Facebook for a week. 'Wow, a whole week. Risky ...,' Mr. Musk tweeted in response to a news article about Sonos's move. A minute later, he replied to Brian Acton, the founder of WhatsApp, which Facebook had acquired for $19 billion several years ago. Mr. Acton, who has since left Facebook, had on Wednesday called for people to '#deletefacebook.' 'What's Facebook?' Mr. Musk replied to Mr. Acton. Then Mr. Musk announced he would shut down the SpaceX and Tesla pages. He said the Tesla Facebook page 'looks lame anyway.' The posts, which sent the Twittersphere into a virtual frenzy, escalated a public feud between Mr. Musk and Mr. Zuckerberg. Mr. Musk has often urged people to be cautious of embracing technology such as artificial intelligence because of the consequences it might bring, once saying that it could become so powerful it would start wars and turn people into its 'house cats.'\"  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Human Resources</emphasis><br/><br/> A driver's suicide shows <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/06/nyregion/livery-driver-taxi-uber.html\">the dark side of the gig economy</url>: \"The economic hardship that Uber and its competitors had inflicted on conventional drivers in New York and London and other cities had become overwhelming. For decades there had been no more than 12,000 to 13,000 taxis in New York but now there were myriad new ways to avoid public transportation, in some cases with ride-hailing services like Via that charged little more than $5 to travel in Manhattan. In 2013, there were 47,000 for-hire vehicles in the city. Now there were more than 100,000, approximately two-thirds of them affiliated with Uber. While Uber has sold that 'disruption' as positive for riders, for many taxi workers, it has been devastating. Between 2013 and 2016, the gross annual bookings of full-time yellow-taxi drivers in New York, working during the day when fares are typically highest, fell from $88,000 a year to just over $69,000. Medallions, which grant the right to operate a taxi in New York City, were now depreciating assets and drivers who had borrowed money to pay for them, once a sound investment strategy, were deeply in debt.\"  </p><p>Restaurant <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/food/wp/2018/03/22/under-the-spending-bill-restaurant-owners-could-be-barred-from-taking-servers-tips/?utm_term=.e1b21f461358\">owners will not be able to keep server tips</url> after all: \"Tucked into Congress's 2,200-plus-page omnibus spending bill are a few paragraphs that will prohibit restaurant owners from sharing server tips with supervisors, managers and themselves.

At the time, he would begin his days before dawn and, once he finished hauling garbage to the dump, would shower and spend the rest of the day meeting with business owners and homeowners in an effort to win contracts. His small company merged with three Chicago-area concerns to create Waste Management in 1968. The company went public three years later and promptly embarked on a buying spree, purchasing 90 garbage truck companies within a year. Less heartier characters might have blanched at the work environment, but Mr. Huizenga found it invigorating. His eldest son, Wayne Jr., recalled that as a child he spent summers working in landfills for his father. 'It was a smell I grew to love,' the younger Mr. Huizenga said in an interview on Friday.

It's a feature. First, lose money until you've left your rivals in the dust. This is the most important rule. It is the collective glue that holds the narratives of San Francisco startup success stories together. And while companies in other places have thrived with the same practice, arguably San Franciscans do it best. It's no secret that a majority of the most valuable internet and technology companies citywide lose gobs of money or post tiny profits relative to valuations. Uber, called the world's most valuable startup, reportedly lost $4.5 billion last year. Dropbox lost more than $100 million after losing more than $200 million the year before and more than $300 million the year before that. Even Airbnb, whose model of taking a share of homestay revenues sounds like an easy recipe for returns, took nine years to post its first annual profit. Not making money can be the ultimate competitive advantage, if you can afford it. Industry stalwarts lose money, too. Salesforce, with a market cap of $88 billion, has posted losses for the vast majority of its operating history.\"  </p><p/><p>Is Facebook <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wired.com/story/facebook-dating-hinge-app\">ripping off a dating app called Hinge</url>? \"Facebook hasn't yet begun to test Dating, but the demo version touted on stage by CEO Mark Zuckerberg and chief product officer Chris Cox looks nearly identical to Hinge. This isn't the first time Facebook has ripped off a competitor; Instagram famously lifted Stories from Snapchat in 2016. And as in previous cases, Hinge probably doesn't have much recourse to stop them. Based on the demo shown at the F8 developer conference, Facebook Dating doesn't have a Tinder-like \"hot or not\" swiping feature for quickly sorting through potential matches. Instead, it works like Hinge, which has users scroll through detailed profiles. Both Hinge and Facebook Dating also allow users to post answers to questions on their profiles, like whether they prefer dogs or cats. And in the biggest similarity, singles on both services can start conversations not by merely saying hello but by commenting on a specific profile item. For example, you can click on a picture of a crush's trip to Morocco and mention that you've been there too. You can also simply \"like\" an image, video, or question response to signify your interest.\"  </p><p>The <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/05/world/europe/margrethe-vestager-silicon-valley-data-privacy.html\">regulator who scares Silicon Valley</url> is in Europe: \"Her rulings against Apple, Facebook, Google and Qualcomm have positioned the European Union, rather than Washington, as the world's de facto Big Tech regulator - and established Ms. Vestager as an international regulatory celebrity, if such a thing is not an oxymoron.

'Europe is acting to enforce antitrust laws where the U.S. is not,' said Jeremy Stoppelman, the chief executive of Yelp, who feels that American regulators dropped the ball when they decided not to pursue a case against Google in 2013 (Yelp is a longtime Google antagonist).

But the people who are working in warehouses and call centers and retail stores around the country generally have few safety nets. I have a deeper understanding now than when I founded Rent the Runway about the ways these missing safety nets contribute to unemployment and limit social mobility. When I announced our new paid family sick leave plan at our warehouse, for instance, a woman stood up to see whether she could use this policy to care for her daughter, who was scheduled to have a C-section soon. Before that, she had been planning to simply quit her job, without ever telling us why. This has to change. As a founder of a company that has grown from two employees to 1,200 over the last eight years, I implicitly understand that Rent the Runway would not exist without the dedication and loyalty of our team.

They failed to get visas for their mostly Mexican workforce, including many women who have been coming north to Maryland for crab season for as long as two decades. The Trump administration for the first time awarded them this year in a lottery, instead of on a first-come, first-served basis. 'This is going to cause the price of crabmeat to go out of sight,' said Harry Phillips, owner of Russell Hall Seafood on Hooper's Island. 'There's not going to be hardly any Maryland crabmeat. . . .

It's not what he pictured himself doing, but he simply doesn't have enough employees. Mr. Kaplow has tried everything he can think of to find workers, placing Craigslist ads, asking other franchisees for referrals, seeking to hire people from Subways that have closed. Yet there he was during a recent lunchtime rush, ringing up veggie footlongs and fountain drinks. He feared that if the line grew too long, people might get frustrated and not come back. 'Every time there's a huge line, the next day the store is nowhere near as busy,' he explained later as he straightened tables and swept up crumbs. Across the country, Keith Miller, another franchisee, is dealing with the same problem. 'What employees? We don't have them anymore,' joked Mr. Miller, who can't find enough workers for the three Subways he owns in Northern California.\"  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Retail</emphasis></p><p>Malls and retailers are <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-05-01/mall-owners-and-retailers-clash-over-avalanche-of-online-returns\">squabbling over returns</url>: \"Managing returns is a critical issue for both landlords and retailers, and e-commerce has only made it more complicated. Anybody who has bought a pair of shoes or a sweater online can attest that shoppers are far more likely to take back apparel they bought on the internet than picked out in person at a store. The rate of returns for online purchases is estimated to be as much as four times the rate for physical-store sales, according to David Sobie, CEO of Happy Returns Inc., which operates in malls and other shopping venues, taking online returns from consumers for retailers that don't have a lot of physical stores. Bad for both store and landlord, right? Not necessarily. When it comes time to seek a refund, people prefer to get it in person instead of printing up a label, making a trip to the post office and waiting weeks for the cash to show up in their bank accounts, Sobie said. That typically works in the landlord's favor, since anything that triggers a trip to the mall can drive additional purchases.\"  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Activism</emphasis></p><p>The men arrested in a Philadelphia Starbucks have arranged <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/05/03/607973546/men-arrested-in-philadelphia-starbucks-reach-settlements\">a settlement that benefits young entrepreneurs</url>: \"Robinson and Nelson agreed to a settlement with Starbucks for an undisclosed sum and an offer of free college tuition to complete bachelor's degrees through an online program with Arizona State University that was created four years ago for Starbucks employees.

Safe havens including gold, bonds and the yen all rallied, according to Bloomberg. The disappointing numbers out of the world's second-biggest economy appear to have shot down any emerging optimism on the first full day of trading in 2019. Weak manufacturing-activity surveys across Asia were followed by disappointing numbers in the euro zone, sending MSCI's index of world shares 0.4 percent lower. While Trump struck positive notes about reaching a trade deal with his counterpart Xi Jinping over the weekend, the Chinese data, and similar readings from across Asia, are a stark example to investors that the protectionist showdown is starting to have an impact on economic activity.Did you know?</p><p>The global logistics market is expected to grow from $8.1 trillion in 2015 to $15.5 trillion by 2023, or a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7.5 percent. Measured by freight volume, the CAGR from 2016 to 2024 is expected to be 6 percent.

Finally, remember that the \"driver shortage\" can never simply be an absolute number, but has to be calculated in relation to freight demand, which is always more volatile than employment levels. If we experience a macroeconomic downturn in 2019, trucking rates will plummet, driver shortage or not.

For delivery companies, the tight fit means racking up astronomical parking fines as a cost of doing business. In 2018, for example, FedEx Corporation (NYSE: FDX[1]) incurred $14.9 million in fines, according to the New York City Department of Finance; UPS Inc (NYSE: UPS[2]), a whopping $33.8 million. </p><p>The total amount of commercial parking fines incurred in New York City in 2018 was $181.5 million, meaning the two delivery giants were responsible for about one quarter of the city's commercial parking fines last year. \"UPS pays for parking tickets that result as a cost of doing business in order to support the flow of critical commerce,\" a spokesperson told the Pickup in an email. \"Dense urban centers can pose challenges where no legal parking may be available. We've told our drivers that if a loading zone or legal parking space is not available, they may double-park in order to serve the needs of our business customers.\" FedEx sent this response: \"Parking limitations in congested metropolitan areas like New York City create challenges, but we always strive to comply with local traffic regulations as we meet our daily customer service commitments. FedEx also participates in programs many cities have to more efficiently manage parking and fine payment processes.\"Quotable: \"As AI takes off, demand for information is exploding, making data a new and valuable resource. Yet vital questions remain: who controls the data? How should the profits be distributed? The only thing almost everyone can agree on is that the person deciding cannot be Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook Inc.(NASDAQ: FB[3]) scandal-swamped boss.\" -The Economist, [4]in an article about Europe cracking down on big tech Did you know?Soccer moms, take note. The kid ride-sharing space is getting more crowded and attracting more money. VanGo, a Connecticut-based startup that caters to teens and pre-teens, is the newest entrant. Z\u016bm, a ride-sharing service for kids, recently raised $40 million in its Series C round, led by BMW Ventures with participation from Spark Capital, Sequoia Capital and Volvo Cars Tech Fund.In other news: Fuel-cell company CEO a critic of fuel cells in carsBloom Energy Corp. chief executive officer K.R.

(Globest.com[6])Two GOP bills seek to redirect federal funds from California high-speed rail projectA bill introduced by House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-California), would \"repurpose\" about $3.5 billion worth of federal funds for the rail system to water infrastructure projects. (CNBC[7])Oregon lawmakers consider new bill to regulate diesel pollutionThe legislation aims to reduce diesel pollution by phasing out old diesel trucks. (OPB[8])Final thoughts:City planners have historically viewed freight and personal travel planning as two distinct areas to be managed. E-commerce is rendering that paradigm outdated, said Alison Conway, a civil engineering professor at the City College of New York. Before e-commerce, people drove to the store to purchase goods; now they have the option of purchasing online, eliminating personal travel and adding to e-commerce travel, said Conway, who is also the associate director for New Initiatives at the Region 2 University Transportation Research Center. Alternatively, shoppers might drive to the store to check out the merchandise in person, then drive home to purchase online. Either way, Conway advised, \"There's a need for more integrated transportation planning.\"Hammer down, everyone!Image sourced from Pixabay Want more content like this?

Many Balinese hold the mountain sacred and accept its occasional outbursts as moral admonishments whereas geologists consider this activity a routine part of Earth's behavior. </p><p>But scientists have found another force\u2014climate change\u2014affects the frequency of eruptions. Now a new study shows even relatively minor climate variations may have such an influence. If they are right, today's global warming could mean more and bigger volcanic eruptions in the future. Throughout its history Earth has gone through periods of massive natural climate change such as entering and leaving ice ages. Scientists have noted volcanic eruptions tended to increase as glaciers melted. In a recent study published in Geology researchers looked at smaller-scale changes in glacial coverage to see if these incremental differences had any effect. The scientists focused on eruptions in Iceland about 5,500 to 4,500 years ago. During that period Earth's climate cooled and glaciers grew, but there was no full-blown ice age. To reconstruct a timeline of volcanic activity, the researchers examined the Icelandic eruption record as well as a record of the ash that fell in Europe during those Icelandic eruptions, which ultimately settled into microscopic layers in the continent's peat bogs and lakes, study author Graeme Swindles says. He and his colleagues matched these layers to specific Icelandic volcanoes then developed a detailed timeline of increases and decreases in eruptions. When the scientists compared the volcanic record with glacial coverage, they found the number of eruptions indeed dropped significantly as the climate cooled and ice expanded. 'There's a big change in the record in the mid-Holocene [epoch], where we see no volcanic ash in Europe and very little in Iceland,' says Swindles, an associate professor of Earth system dynamics at the University of Leeds. 'This seems to overlap with a time where there's cold climate conditions, which would have favored glacial advance in Iceland.' He says his team observed an approximately 600-year lag between when glaciers advanced and volcanic activity diminished. 'That's because it takes a long time to grow ice masses,' he explains.

Aside from a strange blip in the 1950s and early 1960s, the search for extraterrestrial life has primarily taken place at society's fringes. Public figures have not historically risked their reputations advocating the search for alien life. And within the scientific community, the subject was largely (and understandably) sidelined until recent years, when telescopes that could detect new planets and instruments that found the ingredients for life on other worlds allowed serious-minded researchers to pass the laugh test. As a result, the last decade has seen a surge of interest in extraterrestrial research within the scientific community that has seized the public imagination. For example, the recent discovery of water on Mars immediately raised serious hopes from serious people we might find Martians. Every announcement that scientists have found another potentially habitable exoplanet (which includes the nearest exoplanet to Earth) causes days of clamor on the internet. But finding aliens isn't just about tracking extraterrestrials or the re-jiggering of existential thought that might entail. Discovering an alien species could bolster hopes for the long-term survival of humans off-planet. Extraterrestrial life doesn't need to present us with new technologies to help us become a multiplanetary species; presenting proof positive that life can survive in space will get the job done. If \u2014 and when \u2014 that happens, billionaires will have found the biggest untapped market in the cosmos.

Elon Musk's $35,000 car, which launched this July, brings the company's electric vehicle technology to a wider audience thanks to a lower price. Drone footage of Tesla's Fremont, California, plant shows the work in action.  Play Video[6] 'Flew over the Model 3 buffer visible from the freeway,' said Reddit user darksoldier360, who uploaded the drone footage to YouTube. 'Also flew over the Model S/X buffer at the back of the factory. Rail line is torn up/not in service [] Also there is a yard with some prototypes or training vehicles or something under wraps and out in the open in one of the shots.' Tesla has been working hard to get the Model 3 out of a stage Musk refers to as 'production hell.' While the company overall produced around 26,150 cars in the third quarter of 2017, the company has a lofty goal of ramping up to a rate of 10,000 cars per week at some point next year. However, Tesla's plan to produce 100 Model 3 vehicles in August, followed by 1,500 in September, hit a speed bump when it only produced 260 in September. In October, Musk shared a video of the production robots moving at one tenth of their maximum speed.

Basically, the computer algorithm they were using thought the warming over the past year was too rapid to be real. But it turned out to be very real\u2014and a stark example of the broader warming happening across the Arctic, where temperatures are rising at twice the global average. Through September 30, this year was the Arctic's second warmest on record (behind only 2016), according to the 2017 Arctic Report Card, released this month by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The unrelenting temperature rise and accompanying downward spiral of sea ice\u2014which in turn amplifies that warming\u2014'confirm that the Arctic shows no sign of returning' to its reliably frozen former state, Jeremy Mathis, director of NOAA's Arctic Research Program, said at a press conference.

Since the Pentagon confirmed the existence of a top-secret UFO-hunting program, internet denizens have been trying to piece together the puzzle of this cheap X-Files reboot, starring Harry Reid and Robert Bigelow, apparently. In a follow-up to the big story, the New York Times published a first-hand account of two Navy airmen who claim to have seen a rapidly accelerating, flying object they couldn't explain, one night back in 2004 while flying Navy F/A-18F fighter jets near San Diego. 'It accelerated like nothing I've ever seen,' Commander David Fravor told the Times of what he thought was a flying object in the sky. Some of what they saw has been published in a video that the Pentagon's UFO search division studied for research, or, whatever. But an astronomer tells Inverse what the airman more likely saw that night: 'Typically, the explanation is that the thing they are looking at is much closer or much farther than they thought, or is a reflection of some kind,' Jonathan McDowell, astronomer at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, tells Inverse.

Perhaps it's because they now have children of their own. For an industry that prides itself on innovation, Silicon Valley loves to conform. The herd mentality can be seen everywhere, from tech executives' collective commitment to wearing wool slippers in public to the spectacle of Facebook, Google and Twitter sheepishly echoing one another's testimony at a series of congressional hearings in October. In recent months, a new trend has emerged among the tech elite: publicly bashing the companies that made them enormously wealthy. Sean Parker and Chamath Palihapitiya, both former Facebook executives, made headlines recently with sharp critiques of their former employers' addictive qualities and damage to society. The pair joined a growing chorus of disenchanted techies, including the Facebook engineer who invented the Like button, the former Google ethicist Tristan Harris, and the designer who came up with the 'pull to refresh' mechanism used by Twitter. 'I wake up in cold sweats every so often thinking: what did we bring to the world?' said Tony Fadell, the founder of Nest and one of the key architects of the iPod, at a conference in June. 'Did we really bring a nuclear bomb with information that can - like we see with fake news - blow up people's brains and reprogram them?' The election of Donald Trump was 'a big slap in the face' for people at Facebook, said Antonio Garcia-Martinez, a former Facebook product manager. To most Facebook employees, Garcia-Martinez said, 'Trump is the incarnation of Satan. The fact that they helped Satan get elected does dog a lot of people.'

One of Australia's oldest naval mysteries has been solved after the discovery of the wreck of the country's first submarine more than 103 years after its disappearance in World War I. (Australian Department of Defense via AP) One of Australia's oldest naval mysteries has been solved after the discovery of the wreck of the country's first submarine more than 103 years after its disappearance in World War I. The AE1 vanished off the New Guinean island of New Britain on September 14, 1914, with 35 crew aboard from Australia, New Zealand and Britain. It was the first Allied submarine loss of the war and the first wartime loss for the Royal Australian Navy, yet the exact reason for its sinking remains unclear. No fewer than 12 fruitless hunts for the sub had been carried out over the past several decades, but Australian Defense Minister Marise Payne said Thursday it was located more than 300 meters (984 feet) below the surface in a search using a Dutch-owned survey vessel that started only last week. While the reasons for the submarine's sinking remain unclear, Payne said the Australian government was now trying to contact descendants of those killed on board.

Instead, author and saucer aficionado Jack Womack is interested in the people who believe that they've seen UFOs. He's so fascinated by these true believers, in fact, that he's collected nearly every single book \u2014 some of which there were only handful of copies printed \u2014 by authors who claim to have seen flying saucers. 'I can study TB without catching it, preferably, and I can be a student of the Bible without being a Christian,' Womack says, explaining his intense interest in these claims without actually believing any of them. 'I collected these books because they gave me the same kind of escapism kicks other people get from reading science fiction, or my friends get from writing it.' Over the course of several decades, he amassed a vast collection of UFO books, so many in fact, that his collection is now referred to as a library. Last month, a selection of Womack's vintage books were on display at the Milk art gallery in New York City, ahead of his new book's launch, cheekily titled Flying Saucers Are Real! Womack begins his book by chronicling the publication of Richard Shaver's story 'I Remember Lemuria!' in a March 1945 issue of Amazing Stories. Shaver's story of alien creatures dwelling in caverns below the Earth is notable because it was sent to Amazing Stories as non-fiction, and rewritten by an editor named Ray Palmer for publication. As such, a story which many UFO or alien conspiracy theorists would consider to be 'true' was the work of a desperate fiction editor retooling a letter from a madman. But if the Shaver stories were the beginning of UFOs crossing over into science fiction, when was the start of journalists writing about them?

One notable difference this time around, though, was the relative quiet of many large tech companies. In previous years, these firms had been outspoken about the issue. What changed? Netflix's net-neutrality journey is an illuminating example. In 2014, Reed Hastings, the company's CEO, issued a strongly worded warning about oppressive 'internet tolls' that could threaten the web's status as a 'platform for progress.' His company had recently tussled with Comcast (ultimately agreeing to pay the cable company to get data for its streaming videos to customers smoothly) and Hastings felt a need to take a stand in favor of net neutrality. In advance of a 2015 Federal Communications Commission vote on the issue that went as Netflix hoped, the company's representatives reportedly contacted or visited FCC officials more than a dozen times. In the time between then and last week\u2014when the FCC voted to undo its 2015 regulations\u2014something, apparently, had changed. 'We think net neutrality is incredibly important,' Hastings said at a tech conference in late May, but went on to say that it's 'not narrowly important to us because we're big enough to get the deals we want.' The 'deals' he was referring to are the ones theoretically opened up by the repeal of net neutrality\u2014they're the fees that internet-service providers (like Comcast) could ask for from, well, just about anyone (like Netflix), in exchange for speeding their data along. Netflix did submit two filings to the FCC in the run-up to last week's vote, but the commission didn't have any record of lobbying visits on the company's behalf during that time, according to Bloomberg.

Due to the snowstorm that battered the East Coast on Thursday, the scheduled meeting between Federal Reserve Chair <person><nameText>Janet Yellen[</nameText></person>2] and the Senate Banking Committee has been postponed until later this month. </p><p><br/>Five Biggest Stories in Today's Stock Market, Feb. 14, 2014:<br/><br/> DJ Industrial Ave Theoretical (m)<br/><br/> N/A: DJIA Feb 14 10:16 AM <br/> loading chart... Price: 16,039.45 | Ch: 11.86\u00a0(0.1%) <br/><br/> Who Will Merge Next: The blockbuster deal that would see Comcast Corp.(Nasdaq: CMCSA[3]) to purchase Time Warner Cable (NYSE: TWC[4]) is the talk of technology and media speculators. Many are now attempting to determine who will be partners in the next megadeal. Many on the street have begun chattering again about a possible deal between DISH Network Corp.(Nasdaq: DISH[5]) and DIRECTV (Nasdaq: DTV[6]) in the satellite business. Investors are even confident in a possible deal between Sprint Corp.(NYSE: S[7]) and T-Mobile US Inc. (NYSE: PCS[8]) in the wireless sector, even though regulators seem adamant about preventing this deal. Expect a lot of talk about the next big tech deal in the coming months. You can get the Comcast deal details here[9]. Gold Surging: Gold prices continue to rise, as metal prices have climbed for eight straight trading sessions, the longest win streak since 2011. The spot price hit a three-month high this morning. As a result, gold will likely post its best weekly gain since October as concerns about the economy and poor economic data continue to batter the global markets. And gold is now poised to see another strong weak should emerging markets and debt concerns continue to dominate international headlines. China is another big factor in higher gold prices in 2014 - get that story here[10]. China's Inflation Situation: In a positive report this week, China's inflation levels stayed steady in January. Global economists are still concerned that the nation's central bank will struggle to maintain coherent monetary policy as increasing debt overshadows slowing economic growth. The nation's consumer-price index rose 2.5% over the last year, according to the National Bureau of Statistics.<br/> The $50 Billion Storm: According to CNBC, the winter weather that has battered the country has had a significant impact on the nation's economy. According to a recent Fed Survey by the network, the crushing weather could end up costing the country as much as $50 billion in economic growth and more than 76,000 jobs. The weather has cut into employment records and retail sales since December. Our Chief Investment Strategist Keith Fitz-Gerald discussed how weather affects the economy - and how you can profit from its effects[11] - when he visited FOX Business' \"Varney Co.\" show Tuesday. A Star Wars Powerhouse: On Thursday, Netflix Inc. (Nasdaq: NFLX[12]) signed a deal with The Walt Disney Co. (NYSE: DIS[13]) to stream new episodes of Star Wars: The Clone Wars on its subscription services. Thanks to the agreement, Netflix will receive exclusive rights to stream previously unaired episodes of the show and new episodes that are currently in development. Netflix hit a new 52-week high on Thursday of $434.34.<br/><br/> Note: The Fed's 2014 taper means volatility ahead.

ByteDance denies rumours of TikTok stake sales to address US pressure - SCMP Following an earlier report, Chinese tech giant ByteDance denied that it is currently considering to sell a majority stake in TikTok as an option to deal with mounting pressure from the US over national security and privacy concerns, South China Morning Post reported[4]. A ByteDance spokesperson said there have been no discussions about any partial or full sale of TikTok, calling the rumours 'completely meritless.' The platform has been coming under increasing scrutiny from lawmakers and regulators recently. Last month, the US government launched a national security review of ByteDance's US$1 billion acquisition of US social media app Musical.ly. The US Army also banned the app from government-issued mobile devices this week. \u2014 Image Credit:bady qb[5]onUnsplash[6] The post Today's top tech news: Hong Kong's TravelFlan raises US$7M in Series A funding round[7] appeared first on e27[8].

Indonesia cancels plan to prohibit discounts for ride-hailing services - The Jakarta Post Indonesia's ministry of transportation announced that it would not prohibit ride-hailing companies, particularly those offering motorbike-based services, from giving tariff discounts, according to The Jakarta Post report[1]. On Thursday, Minister of Transportation Budi Karya Sumadi told the press that the ministry 'would discuss it' upon request from stakeholders. The statement followed an announcement that the ministry made last month on minimum and maximum tariff regulation for ride-hailing companies. The regulation itself was issued after a series of rallies by motorbike taxi drivers that demanded increased tariffs for their welfare. Weeks into the trial of the tariff regulation, ride-hailing giants Go-Jek and Grab have given customers discounts amid complaints about the rising tariffs. Grab Indonesia President Ridzki Kramadibrata said the ride-hailing company was open to discussion with the government over such a regulation.

And yes, we're here at the SuperReturn Conference in Berlin who is who and one of the big who's here with me is Todd Sisitsky.  He's managing partner at TPG Capital just came off the stage and sharing his thoughts with the audience here.  And Todd, I have to ask you, you know, we're coming in the news of hearing President Trump last night, talk about the appeal and replacement of Obamacare that's something you've been working as a healthcare expert. What is this mean for the private equity industry?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SISITSKY</emphasis>:  It is.  Well, thank you and I appreciate it.  Who's too very generous, but, you know, we has spent a lot of time in healthcare that's been my day job is really been just one of the co- heads in the healthcare investment activities of TPG.  And we spent a lot of time tracking the regulatory change.  </p><p>      The real story in healthcare though (ph) has been that the majority of the changes happened below the surface.  The incredible rate of position employment, the shift in the cost to the employee, all the things have been seismic changes in healthcare.  We're change for the last five years and probably there previous four or five decades   </p><p>      Process create a lot of opportunity.  If you can be in a weigh of volume, if you can improve the cost efficiency of health care services you can make great investment, great, great companies.  We have been invested in kind of 11 companies in last two funds, and the companies we track for years, deal over years and we've had six strategic exits to - just give the buyers over the last three or four years.  And, you know, and candidly if you can better the (inaudible), right, in a kind of dislocation and change, you can benefit as to what is around the corner, I think as we continue to change I think there's really a lack of clarity right now in terms of what will come out in Washington, but I think it will be sometimes for health care investments.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KELLY</emphasis>: That more investors to come, you think it help you?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SISITSKY</emphasis>:  More investment would come absolutely.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KELLY</emphasis>:  Absolutely.  Good.  Well, in one of the big things here is that where in the world of wash with money, you know, record levels being raise for private equity fund, I got to think it's hard to stand out in the world like this.  How do you do it?  How do you -- what's the pitch?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SISITSKY</emphasis>:  Well, I appreciate I -- that's absolutely true.  I've been hearing about two (inaudible) for at least the last 20 years of my career, but it's true.  And is actually even more true today because in some respects, you know, we're returning capital into the capital we're investing it at the pace that we've plan and retreat capital at almost three times about this.  And there's a lot of capital, and people want their allocations and private equity.  You know, we need to do and what all the LPs and a lot of the most important partnership here and I talk about is really stick to our needing and stick to our strategy.  For us, it's pretty clear.  </p><p>      We invest very heavily in our sector teams.  We spend years thinking about not friends whichever (inaudible) the themes, the investable themes with in the sectors that we can deploy resources against that we can create an ecosystem around, not only find opportunities, they're differentiated.  Oftentimes actually even this world proprietary, some in proprietary.  But then companies that we can grow once we own those companies.  So, I think of that as long term, sector-driven investors.  I think this is growth investors.  I think that we spend those years looking for the company, looking for the management team and once we own that business where to keep investors and we're going to keep growing that until we create something really special.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KELLY</emphasis>:  Do you feel you (ph) can get harder with all that money out there.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SISITSKY</emphasis>: I think it does, but I think what it really speaks to is you just have to stick to what you're good at.  So, in this world there's kind of tension (ph) between what's interesting and what's actionable.  The actionable are the investment bank companies, (inaudible) company that that goes to 10 or 12, your closest friends. You got a chaperone dinner and a couple of hours the management. We've found we're not very good at the actionable without angles or without a perspective.  We'll spend a time in interesting even if we have to put 50 long lease in the water to get two over five or 10 years that end up three into by IMS, Quintiles at SCA.  Some of the deals that, you know, that I've been involved with.  </p><p>      And for us towards that payoff and I think actually, you know, in environment like this, it's all be more important that your figure out what you're strategy is, you build your ecosystem, invest in your ecosystem and incur it in ecosystem and then you take your time find the things we have to differentiate angle and you got one frankly. The deals that we need to build out, our portfolio with the last couple of years, and then exactly consistent we dry to do, even if the world got more competitive in a lot of respects.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KELLY</emphasis>: One area where it's been especially competitive at technology, seven of the last, seven of the 10 biggest deal of last year were intact.  It's the space you've played in.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SISITSKY</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KELLY</emphasis>:  Can you continue to be competitive given all the money that's there?  You're chasing after big tech deals, you got snap going public this week, what's feel there?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SISITSKY</emphasis>: You know, I think we can be very competitive.  We have an excellent team there.  In fact, a lot of our activity we usually spend there.  So, if you think about technology, you have to go to for the sub-sector (ph).  Just thinking about for example cyber-security, the two crimes the people for the most is identity being stolen, their computers being hacked, and this is an area that obviously very important, it's becoming more top in mind.  We have been folks in that for years.  We've gone a series of small investments, tiny and - series of small investment for a growth found that have helped us understand what the landscape is.  And after of years of knocking the door, you know, we have now taken back the - in partnership with the parent company, Intel, and what was specially for a proprietary dialogue.  And we and entail, are totally convince that we can take it to the next level.  We have ecosystem forward, we have specific plan. It wasn't been (inaudible) process.  It, again, importance of really focusing ahead of time, it content media, CAA, our investment in CAA. Ultimately investment in Cirque du Soleil, these are all, again, the result of years of working and what we think of these different segments of technology where we can have a differentiated approach, differentiate angles.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KELLY</emphasis>: Todd Sisitsky, managing partner at TPG Capital, thanks for spending a few minutes with us on a very busy day.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SISITSKY</emphasis>: Thank you, Jason.    </p><p>      (BREAK)        </p><p>      ***END OF TRANSCRIPT***  </p><p>      THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100 percent ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND OTHER INACCURACIES.

The UK will still contribute to the EU budget. And it will still have to abide by EU laws - even though British members of the European Parliament will have packed their bags and lost their say in how those laws are determined.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The biggest jolt to British politics in a generation won't be felt by most until the end of an 11-month transition period. That's when everyone will see a profound change to the UK's relationship with Europe and the world. And there's still lots that needs sorting between now and then.</p><p>Here's what's on the to-do list.</p><p>UK fishing folk and citizens have been banging on for years about rapacious Irish, French and Danish fleets over-exploiting rich British waters.</p><p>Fisheries account for a tiny percent of the UK's gross domestic product and employ 24000 people. But the issue is highly emotional, stirring up nationalist fervour. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has vowed the UK will reclaim its \"spectacular maritime wealth\".</p><p>Meanwhile, Ireland Prime Minister Leo Varadkar warned on the BBC on Monday: \"You may have to make concessions in areas like fishing in order to get concessions from us in areas like financial services\" in a post-Brexit trade deal. The Cod War of 2020 is just beginning.</p><p>During the transition period, the UK will remain in the EU's custom union and single market, but after that, everything is up for grabs.</p><p>Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay has declared that the UK wants a \"zero tariff, zero quota\" trade pact with the EU by the end of the year.</p><p>But the new president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, has warned that it is almost \"impossible\" for the two sides to complete a comprehensive agreement within this \"very tight\" schedule. She suggested that Johnson will have to ask for a delay. Or accept a partial deal - and keep talking.</p><p>Johnson insists he will walk away if his deadlines are blown, with the UK (again) heading for the dreaded cliff edge of a no-deal departure.</p><p>Once the UK is officially out of the EU, it can start to negotiate with countries that don't have trade deals with the EU. At the top of that list is the US. President Donald Trump, a fan of Brexit, has promised a \"massive deal\". But there could be stumbling blocks, including over drug prices and taxes on big tech companies.</p><p>There's also the debate about \"chlorinated chicken\". This is a big thing. Bigger than cod. To have easy, free trade in agricultural goods, Europe is pressing the UK to remain aligned with EU rules on food safety and animal welfare. But that puts the UK on a collision course with the US and its relatively lax regulations on industrial farming. US food processors rinse their poultry in a chlorine bath and shoot up their beef with antibiotics - both no-nos in Europe.</p><p>Whether Johnson will bow to the US on \"chlorinated chicken\" and on allowing US pharmaceutical companies access to the UK health service market were both points of contention in last month's general election. Brits will be watching what he does.</p><p>As the UK goes its own way, it will effectively withdraw from hundreds of pacts signed between the EU and the rest of the world. Johnson's government has said most of these treaties will be quickly dispatched and new ones signed.</p><p>Britain will begin introducing new passports early this year. By mid-2020, they won't have the EU stamp on the front, which allows the 500 million citizens of the bloc to travel effortlessly across member nations.</p><p>Free movement will continue through the transition period but EU citizens living in Britain must apply for residency rights by June 2021 - or they will be in the country illegally.</p><p>Going forward, Europeans won't get automatic preference over people from other countries who want to live and work in the UK. And Brits won't as easily be able to live and work in Europe. | The Washington Post</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STARSA-116476551</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STARSA2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y3V-X8N1-F091-R2XX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">312452</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"665\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Independent Newspapers Pty (Ltd) All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Star (South Africa)</publicationName><edition>E1 Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"02\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>February 01, 2020 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N921110CC</classCode><className>HEADS OF STATE &amp;

Bezos </nameText></person>started the website Amazon to sell books, he has wrestled with how to deliver its products as quickly and cheaply as possible. Today, Amazon, now a retail giant, remains obsessed with this issue, building its own fleet of drones, buying trailers for trucks and signing up drivers for on-demand deliveries.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And nowhere is the company's push to become a logistics and delivery powerhouse more evident than in American capital. Amazon has emerged as one of the tech industry's most outspoken players in Washington, spending millions on this effort and meeting regularly with lawmakers and regulators.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Amazon has pushed officials to allow new uses for commercial drones, to extend the maximum length of trucks, to improve roads and bridges and to prop up a delivery partner, the United States Postal Service.</p><p>The efforts are mostly in the early stages, but Amazon already has detractors, particularly for its drone efforts. Some drone makers argue that Amazon is pushing too hard, too fast. And airline and pilots groups have said opening the skies to more commercial drones, which are remote-controlled flying machines, would create safety risks.</p><p>''Amazon is disrupting huge industries; retail was a start, then the enterprise market with its cloud platform, and now transportation logistics,'' said Colin Sebastian, a senior analyst at Robert W. Baird, a financial services firm. ''This is <person><nameText>Jeff Bezos's </nameText></person>playbook, and achieving it by influencing legislation would be consistent with that plan.''</p><p>The money Amazon spent on lobbying in 2015 nearly doubled, to $9.4 million, compared with the year before, which helped to pay for a bigger lobbying staff and a new office to house them. The tally, compiled from public records by the Center for Responsive Politics, includes only the spending that Amazon must legally disclose.</p><p>Amazon's figure still lags behind those of some companies that made camp in Washington long ago, like Boeing, which spent about $21 million in 2015. And it trails the leading tech lobbyist, Alphabet, Google's parent, by several million. But Amazon's spending grew at a faster pace than any other big tech company's.</p><p>When Paul Misener, Amazon's global head of policy, took over the company's Washington office 15 years ago, he had a staff of two focused on retail tax laws and other technology-related issues. Amazon now has more than 60 people listed as its lobbyists - both employees and contractors - double what it had even just two years ago, according to the data from the Center for Responsive Politics.</p><p>The lineup includes people as prominent as Trent Lott, the former Senate majority leader, who helps persuade members of Congress. In total, representatives for Amazon have met with lawmakers dozens of times in the last year. The efforts also reached NASA, the postal commission and the Department of Transportation, among others.</p><p>Amazon and Mr. Bezos, its chief executive, have other interests in Washington, too. Amazon is now a major government contractor, with a $600 million cloud computing partnership with the C.I.A. And Mr. Bezos's ownership of The Washington Post, which he bought in 2013, gives him a foothold in the political and media circles of Washington.</p><p>Amazon declined requests to comment for this article. But on a recent earnings call, Amazon's chief financial officer, Brian Olsavsky, explained why Amazon wanted to move more aggressively into delivery.</p><p>''To properly serve our customers at peak, we've needed to add more of our own logistics to supplement our existing partners,'' Mr. Olsavsky said. ''That's not meant to replace them.''</p><p>In addition, the company's shipping costs rose 19 percent, to $5 billion, in 2015. The millions of members of its Prime annual subscription service, Amazon's most frequent customers, have helped feed the surge. Those customers receive free shipping for many products.</p><p>Some analysts expect Amazon eventually to take over its entire logistics chain - in some cases, from factory to doorstep. This month, Amazon signed a deal to lease 20 Boeing cargo planes.</p><p>A few analysts got excited when Amazon referred to itself as a ''transportation service provider'' in a recent regulatory filing. The company, they suggested, could even become a competitor to UPS and FedEx.</p><p>Mr. Olsavsky insisted on the call that UPS and FedEx would continue to be important partners. FedEx's chief executive, Fred Smith, also played down the possibility of Amazon becoming a rival. In call with analysts and investors last week,  he criticized ''fantastical'' reports about Amazon's challenge to logistics companies.</p><p>''If my package doesn't get delivered to my expectations, most people don't think of FedEx or UPS,'' said Satish Jindel, founder of the SJ Consulting Group, which advises transportation and logistics firms. ''They think of the retailer, so Amazon is getting into drones and delivery to enhance the customer experience and have a bigger influence over the customer.''</p><p>Amazon has also urged Congress to adopt rules that would allow the retailer to fly drones beyond a pilot's line of sight, a crucial hurdle to Amazon's goal of operating drones from its warehouses. This effort will face an important test in the next few weeks. Last week, the Senate Transportation Committee drafted a bill that would allow experiments for drone flights beyond the line of sight.</p><p>Airline and pilot groups have resisted many of Amazon's proposed changes.</p><p>''The chances of a collision will go way up when you have more unmanned aircraft up,'' said Chris Dancy, a spokesman for the Helicopter Association International, a trade group.</p><p>Some drone makers, who spoke anonymously because of their business relationships with Amazon, have expressed concern that Amazon's bold statements about drones may be generating too much public angst, helping those who want to limit the use of drones.</p><p>Amazon is arguing for changes in many other areas, too. Already, Mr. Misener, the lead lobbyist, has called for an overhaul of an arcane system of international delivery rates that he says give foreign e-commerce rivals an unfair advantage to deliver to American homes.</p><p>He also urged the approval of legislation that aims to improve roads, bridges and railroads. The bill was passed by Congress and signed into law in December.</p><p>Amazon has backed a proposal for 33-foot twin-trailer trucks, vehicles that would extend the current legal length of trucks by several feet.</p><p>''The 33-foot trucks are going to be safer,'' Mr. Misener said last July, ''because there will be fewer of them on the road, driving fewer miles.''</p><p>The proposal has been met with resistance from Ralph Nader, a longtime consumer advocate. He said he wrote Mr. Bezos, asking Amazon to stop its support of these trucks for safety reasons. He said Mr. Bezos never responded. The proposal was rejected last year as part of a broader transportation bill.</p><p>''Drones and longer trucks, what are all these efforts for?'' Mr. Nader said in an interview. ''To get you your toothpaste faster?''</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IHT-2127658</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IHT2016</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5JBM-9541-DYR7-C0NF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8357</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1193\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2016 International Herald Tribune All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>International New York Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"03\" year=\"2016\"><dateText>March 21, 2016 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0002J2F</classCode><className>BOEING CO</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0006BO1</classCode><className>UNITED STATES POSTAL SERVICE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

She added that the new nonprofit would be \"a voice for many.\"</p><p>Scrutiny of the largest tech companies has reached a new intensity.

The latest such reminder was the recent murder of two protesters in Kenosha, the U...</p><p>It seems every few days we are reminded of how Big Tech companies have no qualms amassing profits while their products are used to incite violence and spread disinformation. The latest such reminder was the recent murder of two protesters in Kenosha, the US state of Wisconsin, by a member of a militant group active on Facebook \u2013 a group the company was aware of but refused to do anything about.    The problem is not only that Big Tech companies are converting our social lives into revenue streams, which in itself represents new forms of exploitation and appropriation. The problem is also that these dynamics perpetuate forms of discrimination, hatred, and oppression that have deep historical roots extending far beyond the recent history of online platforms, or even beyond the past two centuries of capitalism. That is why Nick Couldry and I call this phenomenon \u201c data colonialism \u201c.    It is not only Facebook, Google, Apple and Amazon who are engaged in data colonialism. China, with its comprehensive systems of digital surveillance and artificial intelligence, is the other centre of power in data colonialism.    Where does that leave us, the rest of the world? When it comes to digital technologies, is there an option that allows us to safely navigate between the profit-motivated Scylla of Silicon Valley and the control-motivated Charybdis of the Chinese Communist Party?    Perhaps we need to take a page from the Non-Aligned Movement, a consortium of nations that, during the Cold War, attempted to forge a path beyond the equally inadequate choices of capitalism and communism. While the Non-Aligned Movement was not very successful for a variety of reasons, we can still learn important lessons to attempt something more ambitious.    What we need is a Non-Aligned Technologies Movement (NATM), an alliance not necessarily of nations, but of multiple actors already working towards the same goals, coming together to declare their non-alignment with the US and China.    Activists, researchers, hackers and NGOs have been devising these kinds of alternatives for years. It is time to collect them under a movement big enough to pose a challenge to the two neocolonial superpowers. This new movement is necessary for two important reasons.    First, it has become patently clear that the development of technologies in China and the US is exempt, on purpose, from any social accountability. How has this happened? It is universally accepted (one hopes) that a scientific experiment can only go forward if the researchers can demonstrate it will not negatively affect human subjects. And yet, in the world of technological development, no such expectation exists.    If technology is the application of science, its implementation needs to be held to the same scientific standards, especially when it is evident that technology affects society in profound and long-lasting ways, well beyond the \u201cdevelopment\u201d phase.    Traditionally, capitalism has told us that this cannot happen because it would delay and interfere with innovation. NATM is the first step towards rejecting that narrative, and saying that we no longer believe there is a sharp distinction between scientific research and technological implementation.    The two have become practically indistinguishable because modern digital technologies are constantly changing, and thus their impact needs to be constantly assessed and held to stringent ethical standards.    Second, it has also become evident that most governments and world organisations are incapable or unwilling to stand up to the Big Tech axis, even if it means imposing minimal taxes or protections for users. A Non-Aligned Technologies movement would empower civil societies across the globe to act in consort to meet their shared objectives while putting pressure on their respective governments to change the way they deal with Big Tech.    Let me sketch out the main goals of NATM before briefly discussing some concrete proposals for how to launch it.    The primary goal of NATM would be to transition from technologies that are against the interest of society to technologies that are in the interest of society. To implement this, we would need to define what is in the public interest when it comes to technologies, and evaluate technologies to see if they meet these criteria. Many efforts to do this have been happening concurrently, but NATM would allow us to form a global consortium to collectively support these tasks.    Realising that this is going to take time and effort to accomplish, a secondary goal of NATM is to promote the immediate regulation and taxation of technologies that are not in the public\u2019s interest. But here we must strongly affirm social good over individual benefit, and point out that NATM goes beyond the idea of paying individuals for their data.    An intermediate goal in this regard is the nationalisation of data so that Big Tech is forced to pay nations for the value they are extracting from their citizens. To be clear, I am talking about nationalising data not in the sense of transferring ownership of a commodified property to the state, but in the sense of asserting national control over a resource currently extracted illegitimately.    The taxes resulting from nationalisation need to be invested in programmes that benefit societies, not individuals, small collectives or elites. Again, individual governments are unlikely to adopt such measures on their own accord, but NATM can make evident the benefit of acting and exercising pressure as a global consortium.    The third goal of NATM is to create change that can involve anyone, anywhere. Global civil society needs to come together to effect the change, but it needs to be able to do so by uniting dispersed efforts.    If continents will not become non-aligned, nations can. If not nations, cities. If not cities, communities (onsite and online). If not communities, then individuals can become non-aligned. The goal is to create a new social order, and even individuals and small communities should be able to contribute to that order.    What specific actions could this movement pursue?    To begin, NATM as a block could conduct an analysis and decide which open-source platforms to support as a bloc. We now have plenty of options to replicate and improve most of the functions offered by Big Tech, including social networking, file sharing, data collection and analysis, mapping, publishing, etc. NATM could pick the most advanced and scalable solution in each case and commit to its development, providing support for NATM members to implement it.    In essence, NATM would create parallel platforms to those offered by the Big Tech axis, but without the extraction and dispossession. These platforms would cease to be niche solutions explored by hacker communities, but widely used solutions that offer non-aligned members alternatives to Big Tech.    NATM could also create a global laboratory for the study of Big Tech algorithms. I have been working on a small-scale prototype of such a concept called Algorithm Observatory, which is a combination of citizen science and media literacy project. The goal is to create a platform that NATM, as a bloc, can use to dissect the extractive algorithms of Big Tech. These technologies are not likely to go away anytime soon, and we need to be able to learn more about the way they work by analysing them, and exposing their faults.    Finally, NATM could institute a protocol for individual communities to grant approval of new and existing technologies. For technologies to operate within NATM communities and avoid heavy taxation, they would need to demonstrate that they do not endanger the interests of civil society.    This initial determination and subsequent checks can be performed by a board, similar to what human subject boards do across scientific research institutions. But unlike human subject boards, NATM boards should include representatives from different segments of the population.    The boards should operate locally (each community needs to figure out if a particular technology goes against its specific interests), but NATM can provide training and facilitate discussions at a global level of how these boards should work. NATM boards can also make determinations of what portion of the data collected by technologies should rightfully be considered public domain.    It is unlikely that Big Tech companies would submit themselves to this form of review, just as it is unlikely that governments would enforce any kind of penalties when they do not comply. At least for the time being. The point of a global movement of non-alignment is to show that another world is possible, and that change based on the principles of justice and equity can gain momentum until it is impossible to ignore.

But while such calls from politicians might elicit a sense of ennui, an unexpected voice has struck a similar tone in the form of Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In his New York Times editorial,\u00a0Hughes highlights the unsettling amount of control that Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg wields over the content that surfaces on Facebook\u2019s platform. With consumers increasingly relying on social media as a source of news, Facebook is in a position to influence our very culture based on the content that is published to and disseminated across the platform.</p><p>This isn\u2019t the only piece in a string of recent PR problems for the social networking behemoth. Facebook recently banned individuals who peddle violence and hate, such as Alex Jones who has claimed that the Sandy Hook shooting was a hoax. This was met with criticism from President Trump, who asserted an anti-conservative bias, charges that had already be levied against the social media platform.</p><p>Given such criticism from politicians, it is understandable that the company may tread lightly when it comes to censoring content. Facebook is also facing mounting criticism for its insufficient responses to limiting extremist content.</p><p>In the face of these recent challenges, where do we go from here? The influence that Facebook wields isn\u2019t just a function of its acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp; it is also due to its approach to user data. Users made the decision to hand over such data in exchange for the service being provided, and there currently isn\u2019t an alternative that makes disconnecting from Facebook a viable option for many. In addition to \u201cpaying\u201d for Facebook by providing it with our data, we are also paying for its services by allowing our discourse and the information to which we are exposed to be dictated by the company\u2019s algorithms. Despite having information literally clicks away, our reliance on Facebook actually results in exposure to less content than we might otherwise come across. Such non-financial costs must be recognized by regulators in weighing whether or not Facebook needs to be broken up.</p><p>Regardless of this decision, the potential for social media platforms to spread misinformation, whether it is political or financial, warrants regulation over the companies. Even Zuckerberg agrees that additional regulation is needed.\u00a0In the U.K., regulators have proposed holding digital platforms responsible for the content posted on their platforms that cause harm, such as terrorist groups spreading propaganda and gangs inciting violence.\u00a0Such regulations are needed to limit the extent to which social media platforms are weaponized to shape public opinion through the spread of information. Guidelines must also be developed to aid in the policing of content on social media platforms. Failing to do so may inadvertently result in algorithmic bias and ad hoc decisions, as far as what types of content warrant removal from platforms.</p><p>Beyond regulating content, there also need to be safeguards enacted to protect consumer data. Such regulations must speak to the way in which it is secured and how it is used. While the delivery of content based on user interests may appeal to users, they might be leery of it being collected by third-party companies. Having amassed troves of consumer data is part of what makes Facebook such a formidable entity in the digital marketing space, and this would not be corrected by Hughes\u2019 and Senator Warren\u2019s proposals to separate Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp.</p><p>One potential solution may lie in separating the advertising (and data) assets from the communications platforms. Doing so may reduce the extent to which Facebook can influence our discourse while still enabling the communication platform to connect users around the world.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ADWEEK-1046179</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ADWEEK2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W45-VBK1-JC8H-T0MC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">7907</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"682\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Mediabistro Holdings, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>adweek.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"18987\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"05\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>May 15, 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

But I've been interested in another race - the race to see which buzzword is going to be a pivotal issue in political reporting, hot takes and the general political introspection that elections bring. In 2016 it was \"fake news\". \"Deepfake\" is shoring up as one of the leading candidates for 2020.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This week the US House of Representatives intelligence committee asked Facebook, Twitter and Google what they were planning to do to combat deepfakes in the 2020 election. And it's a fair question. With a bit of work, deepfakes could be convincing and misleading enough to make fake news look like child's play.</p><p>Deepfake, a portmanteau of \"deep learning\" and \"fake\", refers to AI software that can superimpose a digital composite face on to an existing video (and sometimes audio) of a person.</p><p>The term first rose to prominence when Motherboard reported on a Reddit user who was using AI to superimpose the faces of film stars on to existing porn videos, creating (with varying degrees of realness) porn starring Emma Watson, Gal Gadot, Scarlett Johansson and an array of other female celebrities.</p><p>However, there are also a range of political possibilities. Filmmaker Jordan Peele highlighted some of the harmful potential in an <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQ54GDm1eL0\">eerie video produced with Buzzfeed</url>, in which he literally puts his words in Barack Obama's mouth. Satisfying or not, hearing Obama call US president Trump a \"total and complete dipshit\" is concerning, given he never said it.</p><p>Reporting triggers some level of public outcry, at which suddenly tech developers realise the error of their ways</p><p>Just as concerning as the potential for deepfakes to be abused is that tech platforms are struggling to deal with them. For one thing, their content moderation issues are well documented. Most recently, a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQ54GDm1eL0\">doctored video of Nancy Pelosi</url>, slowed and pitch-edited to make her appear drunk, was tweeted by Trump. Twitter did not remove the video, YouTube did, and Facebook de-ranked it in the news feed.</p><p>For another, they have already tried, and failed, to moderate deepfakes. In a laudably fast response to the non-consensual pornographic deepfakes, Twitter, Gfycat, Pornhub and other platforms quickly acted to remove them and develop technology to help them do it.</p><p>However, once technology is released it's like herding cats. Deepfakes are a moving feast and as soon as moderators find a way of detecting them, people will find a workaround.</p><p>But while there are important questions about how to deal with deepfakes, we're making a mistake by siloing it off from broader questions and looking for exclusively technological solutions. We made the same mistake with fake news, where the prime offender was seen to be tech platforms rather than the politicians and journalists who had created an environment where lies could flourish.</p><p>The furore over deepfakes is a microcosm for the larger social discussion about the ethics of technology. It's pretty clear the software shouldn't have been developed and has led - and will continue to lead - to disproportionately more harm than good. And the lesson wasn't learned. Recently the creator of an app called \"DeepNude\", designed to give a realistic approximation of how a woman would look naked based on a clothed image, cancelled the launch fearing \"the probability that people will misuse it is too high\".</p><p>What the legitimate use for this app is, I don't know, but the response is revealing in how predictable it is. Reporting triggers some level of public outcry, at which suddenly tech developers realise the error of their ways. Theirs is the conscience of hindsight: feeling bad after the fact rather than proactively looking for ways to advance the common good, treat people fairly and minimise potential harm. By now we should know better and expect more.</p><p>Why then do we continue to let the tech sector manage its own mess? Partly it's because it is difficult, but it's also because we're still addicted to the promise of technology even as we come to criticise it. Technology is a way of seeing the world. It's a kind of promise - that we can bring the world under our control and bend it to our will. Deepfakes afford us the ability to manipulate a person's image. We can make them speak and move as we please, with a ready-made, if weak, moral defence: \"No people were harmed in the making of this deepfake.\"</p><p>But in asking for a technological fix to deepfakes, we're fuelling the same logic that brought us here. Want to solve Silicon Valley? There's an app for that! Eventually, maybe, that app will work. But we're still treating the symptoms, not the cause.</p><p>The discussion around ethics and regulation in technology needs to expand to include more existential questions. How should we respond to the promises of technology? Do we really want the world to be completely under our control? What are the moral costs of doing this? What does it mean to see every unfulfilled desire as something that can be solved with an app?</p><p>Yes, we need to think about the bad actors who are going to use technology to manipulate, harm and abuse. We need to consider the now obvious fact that if a technology exists, someone is going to use it to optimise their orgasms. But we also need to consider what it means when the only place we can turn to solve the problems of technology is itself technological.</p><p>Big tech firms have an enormous set of moral and political responsibilities and it's good they're being asked to live up to them. An industry-wide commitment to basic legal standards, significant regulation and <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQ54GDm1eL0\">technological ethics</url> will go a long way to solving the immediate harms of bad tech design. But it won't get us out of the technological paradigm we seem to be stuck in. For that we don't just need tech developers to read some moral philosophy. We need our politicians and citizens to do the same.</p><p>At the moment we're dancing around the edges of the issue, playing whack-a-mole as new technologies arise. We treat tech design and development like it's inevitable. As a result, we aim to minimise risks rather than look more deeply at the values, goals and moral commitments built into the technology. As well as asking how we stop deepfakes, we need to ask why someone thought they'd be a good idea to begin with. There's no app for that.</p><p> Matt Beard is a fellow at the Ethics Centre and the author of <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQ54GDm1eL0\">Ethical by Design: Principles for Good Technology</url>.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GUARDN-54692126</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GUARDN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WMR-M6V1-F021-62XY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">138620</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1076\"/><timeReceived>3:30 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Guardian, a division of Transcontinental Media Group Inc.

This year Sadiq Khan became the first British politician to make a speech at the conference, revealing the extent to which he had been racially abused on Twitter and criticising policymakers for a dereliction of duty.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Khan claims that politicians have failed to regulate and steer the technological revolution so that it benefits everybody. His message is all too familiar to anyone who has followed the recent \"techlash\".</p><p>These days the anti-tech rhetoric seems to come thick and fast. Recently the European Commission published its latest report on the threat of \"disinformation\", a term that encompasses everything from fake news to online manipulation.</p><p>The UK Chancellor said last week he was consulting on taxing big tech companies more \"appropriately\" and even Sir Tim Berners-Lee, one of the founders of the web, has published a letter revealing his concern that it is being \"compressed\" by the few dominant platforms. Calls for better regulation are not going to evaporate.</p><p>Meanwhile, other nations have already moved more swiftly than the UK to regulate private internet companies. Last year Germany brought in regulation to fine technology firms for not dealing with hate speech quickly enough.</p><p>Tough restrictions on freedom of speech on online platforms would sit uneasily in the UK, which has a proud history of free enterprise, technological innovation and open public forums. Yet without greater regulation, the current techlash is just the start. Before people get seriously irritated by the way machines and algorithms control their lives we need to work out just what it is we want from these technologies. Regulation to both inspire innovation and protect citizens is required.</p><p>Fortunately for the UK, this is an area in which we already excel. Our fast-growing fintech sector provides a great example of regulation that nurtures, rather than stifles.</p><p>The UK Government has been a creative and adaptive regulator of tech in the financial services sector. It has worked with industry leaders, technology evangelists and regulatory bodies to build an accessible and evolving regulatory system.</p><p>Collaboration, investigation and partnership are the way forward. Organisations like the Financial Conduct Authority run innovation programmes and have launched a \"sandbox\", where new companies can run small tests to see whether their product has potential, while staying within consumer protections.</p><p>This proactive approach has resulted in open banking standards, a genuine step along the road to improving consumer experiences. Contrast this with the US, where outmoded regulation persists and powerful industry lobbies make innovation difficult.</p><p>Fintech isn't the only sector where our regulation of new technology stands out.

The number of new businesses in the U.S. has been falling steadily for decades. In 1985, 13 percent of all businesses were less than two years old. Two decades later, that share had fallen to 8 percent.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It's commonplace to blame those zany millennials (those of us born roughly between 1982 and 1996), and their supposed lack of entrepreneurial spirit for this decline. The \"Millennials in the Mist\" genre  lazy stereotyping disguised as cultural anthropology  has accused millennials of murdering all sorts of American traditions, including marriage, dinner dates, home ownership, beer, cars, napkins, cereal, running, golf and the restaurant chain Applebee's. (In the last case, we can only hope.)</p><p> But this obscures the fact that it has become increasingly difficult to start and maintain a small business. While this may have happened by accident, it was the result of policy decisions  policies that can and should be reversed.</p><p> Take a recent Federal Trade Commission decision regarding the office supply chain Staples. It's unlikely many people dream of going into the office supply business, but it's a good racket. Even in this era of market concentration, more than 25 percent of office supplies are still sold by independent businesses, notes Stacy Mitchell of the Institute for Local Self Reliance. \"These dealers are also significant in their local economies,\" she writes. \"Many employ 100-300 people. Because they don't have storefronts  it's mostly a B2B market  you may not know they exist in your community. But they do.\"</p><p> Or at least they did. Because the FTC's decision will make these small businesses much harder to operate  let alone for an entrepreneur to enter the business.</p><p> What the FTC did, by 3-2 decision, was allow Staples to buy Essendant, one of the two dominant suppliers of office supplies. This is what's known as a vertical merger  one in which a company buys or merges with one of its suppliers. (A horizontal merger, by contrast, is when a businesses buys one of its competitors.) Think of an auto company absorbing a tire manufacturer. The FTC's decision puts independent office supply companies in a bind. They will be forced to buy supplies from their chief competitor (thereby not only enriching their competitor but giving up a bevy of sensitive business information, too), or from the other remaining supplier, which will now find it easier to raise prices knowing that its customers will be loathe to buy supplies from Staples.  Because of the inherently anti-competitive qualities of vertical mergers, regulators used to take a dim view of them. That began to change in the late 1970s after Robert Bork argued in his highly influential Antitrust Paradox that \"vertical mergers are means of creating efficiency ... may cut sales and distribution costs, facilitate the flow of information ... create economies of scale in management, and so on.\" All the better for consumers.</p><p> But Americans aren't just consumers. Many of them are entrepreneurs too, or at least they aspire to be. That's why it's alarming that, as Matt Stoller, a fellow at the Open Markets Institute notes in an interview, vertical mergers have become rife across scores of industries. Hospitals have Hoovered up doctors' offices. Insurers are buying up pharmacies. Monsanto has acquired seed suppliers. All of these make it much more difficult for the newly-minted doctor, pharmacist or farmer to strike out on his own.</p><p> Republicans, ostensibly the party of small business, have begun to wake up to this threat. Sen. Josh Hawley, newly elected from Missouri, has been particularly attuned to the issue, focusing on the near-monopolistic power of big tech companies.</p><p>Indiana Rep. Jim Banks has targeted the negative effects of hospital consolidation. During William Barr's confirmation hearing, four senators asked the likely next attorney general about antitrust issues. All four, notes Mr. Stoller, were Republicans.</p><p> Of course, there's a large distance between expressing concern and actually acting. And indeed, all three Republicans on the FTC supported the Staples acquisition of Essendant. But unless something changes, America's entrepreneurs of tomorrow may, rather than start a business, be forced to \"learn to code\" instead.</p><p> \u2022 Ethan Epstein is deputy opinion editor of The Washington Times.

It was co-hosted by Dallas\u2019 Ross Perot Jr., an avid aviator and real estate developer, in a giant barn on his Circle T Ranch in Westlake.</p><p>The list of attendees was the Who\u2019s Who of futuristic aviation, including Nikhil Goel, who has helped lead Uber\u2019s air taxi effort; Erik Lindbergh, grandson of famed flyer Charles Lindbergh; Dean Kamen, inventor of the Segway; former Federal Aviation Administration officials and leaders of major companies like Bell, Rolls Royce, Airbus and Boeing. Sigari estimated there was over $100 billion of investable capital in the room.</p><p>The summit was filled with Texas touches, such as a dinner of prime rib and roasted whole pig, a live country band, a photo-op with a longhorn and fittings of Cavender\u2019s cowboy hats. A private flight show of a F-5E Tiger II fighter jet kicked off the summit\u2019s opening night. The lineup featured former President George W. Bush, Tesla co-founder JB Straubel and record-breaking stuntman and skydiver Luke Aikins, who jumped from 25,000 feet without a parachute.</p><p>Marcus and Sigari, both 37 and from Santa Monica, Calif., met when they were 11 years old. Marcus is an Israeli Jew and Sigari is an Iranian Muslim, but they shared a fascination for aviation and became lifelong friends. They attended college together and later co-founded private jet broker, JetAviva.</p><p>About three years ago, they started the summit to gather the brain trust behind electric vertical take-off and landing aircraft, or eVTOLs. They held the first summit in a living room in Jackson Hole, Wyo., with about 30 attendees. They threw the second summit with about 100 attendees with aviation entrepreneur Steuart Walton, grandson of Walmart founder Sam Walton, in the retail giant\u2019s hometown of Bentonville, Ark.</p><p>All attendees are hand-picked by Sigari and Marcus. Many flew there on private jets. Sigari, Marcus and Perot picked up the tab \u2014 along with sponsorships by companies including Bell and Honeywell.</p><p>The summit isn\u2019t just about flying cars but also cargo-carrying drones and technology improvements, such as autonomous systems, to make them possible.</p><p>At the summit\u2019s opening dinner, Marcus said he and Sigari are inspired not just by flying\u2019s novelty but also by its impact. As kids, they volunteered for a nonprofit called Angel Flight that provides free flights to people who need medical treatment far from home. As they grew up and became flight instructors, they flew over congested Los Angeles.</p><p>\u201cWe used to look down at the highways and see these miserable people stuck in traffic and think, \u2018Why are we the only ones in the sky and why are they all down there? How can we get them up here to enjoy the sky with us?\u2019\u201d Marcus said.</p><p>He said the room of innovators and investors could change an eye-opening statistic: Only one in five people in the world have ever taken flight.</p><p>Sigari said the summit has grown, but it won\u2019t get much larger. He turned down about 400 others who wanted to attend. He said the intimacy of the summit is what allows all of the executives, entrepreneurs and investors to get to know one another and feel comfortable enough to speak candidly.</p><p>For some startups, the event has led to valuable connections. Clint Cope, co-founder of San Francisco-based Elroy Air, said he met his first investor at the Wyoming summit. His company is developing autonomous aircraft that carry heavy cargo. He said the summit is a morale boost and a way to promote momentum for all companies, even competitors.</p><p>\u201cEverybody is in a bit of a frenemy stage now,\u201d he said. \u201cYou want to help people along the way, so you have a critical mass.\u201d</p><p>One of the first big names to sign on to the UP summit was then-Wyoming Gov. Matt Mead. He attended the first summit in his home state. As governor of a predominantly rural state, Mead said he understood how smaller, electric-powered aircraft could make life easier.</p><p>In conversations with the public, he said he has found people are quick to bring up barriers. They ask about safety risks, noise and visual clutter in the skies.</p><p>While those challenges are real, he said, aviation executives and entrepreneurs must also help the public understand the societal benefits. What would the aircraft mean for the environment? How could they spur economic activity in rural communities? Could they free up funds for states to invest in education rather than highways? And what would it mean if parents could spend an extra hour a day with their children instead of commuting?</p><p>The pursuit of an air taxi industry has taken off in recent years, particularly with a push by Uber. Three years ago, the San Francisco-based company published a white paper and pledged to make a Jetsons-like vision of flying cars real. It hosted its first Uber Elevate Summit in Dallas in 2017 and announced that Dallas-Fort Worth would be one of the service\u2019s first markets.</p><p>It laid out an aggressive timetable of starting flight demonstrations next year and launching limited commercial service in 2023. At launch, Uber\u2019s air taxis will have a pilot \u2014 but the company wants them to eventually become autonomous. Uber is working with several partners, including Fort Worth-based Bell.</p><p>This summer, the company launched Uber Copter in New York City to learn how to synchronize seamless passenger trips that begin in a car on the ground, continue in the skies and end on the ground again. The one-way trip between Lower Manhattan and John F. Kennedy International Airport costs between $200 and $225 a person.</p><p>More than 200 companies from venture-backed startups to major corporations are now developing electric vertical-lift aircraft. Big tech names have put their money into the effort. For example, Google co-founder Larry Page is funding two startups, Kitty Hawk and Opener. And larger companies, such as Boeing, are snapping up smaller startups through acquisitions and building aircraft of their own.</p><p>Urban air mobility \u2014 from passenger travel to military and cargo applications \u2014 could grow into a $1.5 trillion market by 2040, according to a Morgan Stanley research estimate.</p><p>Perot, who flew the first round-the-world flight by helicopter in 1982, is among those who saw the business opportunity. For the past few years, his real estate company Hillwood has worked with Uber to help identify sites where air taxis could take off and land. One will be Frisco Station, a Hillwood development near the Dallas Cowboys headquarters.</p><p>The real estate developer is also turning AllianceTexas, his giant mixed-use residential and commercial development in Fort Worth, into a test bed for the future of mobility. It wants companies to test their drones and air taxis there. The master-planned development is larger than the island of Manhattan and home to hundreds of companies, including Facebook\u2019s data center and a regional hub for Amazon. It also has a large industrial airport, Fort Worth Alliance.</p><p>Circle T Ranch \u2014 where the summit was held \u2014 is part of AllianceTexas. Hillwood and Bell offered free helicopter tours of the property to attendees.</p><p>Perot said he keeps up with progress in the air taxi industry, but it has exceeded the pace that even he imagined. He pointed to other examples of how social norms have changed with the emergence of new kinds of mobility.</p><p>\u201cOne day, we will hop into an air vehicle and fly around without a pilot and not even think about it,\u201d he said. \u201cThe first elevators had operators because people were afraid to get in an elevator and just punch a button. Now, look how it\u2019s changed today.\u201d</p><p>Austin-based Lift Aircraft showed a prototype of its flying vehicle, Hexa. It looks like a large drone but has a cabin for a single passenger. It\u2019s light enough that FAA regulations allow it to be flown without a pilot\u2019s license. It has software to simplify flying for a layperson and safety features, including a built-in ballistic parachute.</p><p>The company will initially use it as a form of entertainment or a tourist attraction, CEO Matt Chasen said. Thousands of people have reserved a ride, which will cost $249 for a 10-15 minute ride. It will begin offering rides on a cross-country road trip later this year or in early 2020.</p><p>Eventually, Chasen said, he imagines putting the vehicles in different parts of cities and allowing people to request rides through a smartphone app.</p><p>Martine Rothblatt, founder and CEO of biotech company United Therapeutics, accepted an award for her leadership. Rothblatt, co-founder of Sirius Satellite Radio, started the biotech company after her young daughter was diagnosed with pulmonary arterial hypertension. The company went on to discover a medication for that condition. Now, it\u2019s developing new ways to repair and manufacture lungs and other organs to multiply the number of people who can receive transplants.</p><p>Rothblatt is financially backing two electric aircraft companies, Chinese manufacturer Ehang, and Vermont-based Beta Technologies. They\u2019re developing electric-powered aircraft that can transport the company\u2019s life-saving organ donations in a way that doesn\u2019t harm the environment or public health.</p><p>In a speech, Rothblatt referred to a saying by Albert Einstein that problems can\u2019t be solved at the same level of thinking. She encouraged the group to keep striving \u201cuntil we are all thriving in the vertical dimension.\u201d</p><p>Twitter: @melissa_repko</p><p>Exclusive UP summit looks to the future of aviation</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DALNWS-72143479</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DALNWS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XKB-RSM1-JBKB-W148-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11802</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1731\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 THE DALLAS MORNING NEWS</copyright><publicationName>THE DALLAS MORNING NEWS</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"15041\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>1 EDITION</edition><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"11\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>November 24, 2019 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0002J2F</classCode><className>BOEING CO</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0008Z4K</classCode><className>AIRBUS SAS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>NAICS336414 GUIDED MISSILE &amp;

A significant part of the blam...</p><p>The purported rise in the popularity of socialism among millennials members of Generation Z has generated sharp reactions on the political right , handwringing in boardrooms and characteristically overwrought media  coverage . A significant part of the blame for the diminished appeal of capitalism among the younger generations should be placed on the shoulders of politicians and business leaders. The steady drift towards crony capitalism , along with a shift away from pro-market and towards pro-business policies in recent decades, has created a sense of disillusionment and led to the rise of populist candidates on both the right and the left.    In \u201c The Great Reversal: How America Gave Up on Free Markets ,\u201d the French-born NYU economist Thomas Philippon offers a timely diagnosis of what fundamentally ails the American economy. Philippon, using solid empirical evidence and careful research, asserts that the level of competition has declined in the U.S. (as exemplified by the rise in market concentration in several industries, the extent to which sectoral leaders have become entrenched and the high level of profits attained by the dominant firms).   Furthermore, the rise in market concentration over the first two decades of the 20 th century has led to market inefficiencies . The resultant increase in barriers to entry has reduced business investment, raised consumer prices and lowered productivity growth. While technology , economies of scale and globalization have played a part, it is increasingly clear that political factors ( corporate lobbying , weak antitrust enforcement and campaign contributions ) have had a decisive influence in bringing about this new era of limited competition.    Though some are relatively sanguine about the recent dominance of big business and the associated decline in competition, there is growing concern that market concentration poses a threat to the long-term stability and health of the American economy. First, the relative decline in labor share of income observed in recent decades is to some extent driven by the rise of superstar firms. Second, changing norms , policy changes , automation , globalization and employer concentration have reduced the bargaining power of workers. Recent research suggests that the weakening of worker power may be a key factor behind the decline in labor share of income. Third, and most importantly, declining business dynamism and insufficient creative destruction pose a serious risk to the U.S., whose economy is especially dependent on innovation and technological progress to sustain future economic growth.   So, what can be done to rejuvenate American capitalism and establish a fair and free-market economy? The solution is not to install elaborate and complex regulatory regimes. If we take the example of regulating the U.S. financial industry (still dominated by megabanks), a pro-market solution would entail a simple but effective rule change \u2014 higher capital requirements (with minimal or no loopholes). In \u201c The Bankers' New Clothes: What's Wrong with Banking and What to Do About It ,\u201d Anat Admati and Martin Hellwig make a persuasive case for sharply raising bank capital requirements (which, in essence, raises the owners\u2019 skin in the game) to reduce excessive risk taking and financial instability. The overly complex Dodd-Frank Act, passed in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, has largely been defanged after a decade of effective lobbying by the banking industry. Also, by raising the cost of compliance, Dodd-Frank is likely to aid incumbents (in particular, large banks) and limit the entry of new competitors.   Brink Lindsey and Steven Teles offer a few intriguing proposals for reforming the American economy in \u201c The Captured Economy: How the Powerful Enrich Themselves, Slow Down Growth, and Increase Inequality .\u201d In particular, their call for undertaking a much needed, pro-market reform of intellectual property laws should be heeded by politicians from both sides of the aisle. Recent research suggests that patenting is concentrated in the hands of a few leading firms (who have already stockpiled a large cache of patents), and, given that there is limited knowledge diffusion between the frontier firms and the laggards, this further entrenches the dominance of market leaders.   Limiting new acquisitions by dominant tech firms is another pro-market action that can lead to greater competition. There is growing evidence that Big Tech is creating barriers that reduce innovation and restricts the growth and future success of promising new startups. The American economy would be well-served in the long run if it remains open to and supportive of entrepreneurs and a new generation of tech pioneers.   Finally, adoption by the U.S. of a Scandinavian-style economic system that dramatically smooths out the rough edges of free-market capitalism is unrealistic and likely to remain a fantasy on the political left. However, the modern-day Nordic economic model, widely misunderstood by Americans, offers intriguing lessons for creating capitalist regimes that embrace open markets and globalization but limit some of the downsides by pursuing greater risk sharing across the populace. Two policy lessons of particular import to the U.S. involve creating a broad-based tax system and reorienting government spending priorities towards public goods provision . Such reforms would especially appeal to the millennial and Gen Z cohorts.     Political reforms, such as campaign finance reforms aimed at reducing corporate lobbying, are beyond the scope of the current discussion. However, the above noted pro-market reforms should in theory find bipartisan support, and, if implemented, can reenergize capitalism in America and make it more appealing across all demographics.

The vast majority of this eye watering figure is on keeping existing systems running, with about $1.5 billion earmarked for new infrastructure. <br/><br/>The strategy - crafted by ex-management consultant, Minister Angus Taylor -- comes out of a much awaited\u00a0      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://ict-procurement.digital.gov.au/assets/documents/ICT-procurement-taskforce-report_WCAG.pdf\">PM&amp;C review</url> and picks up many of the practices of the UK Government to drive costs down -- the limiting of individual contracts to $100 million being a straight lift from the mother country playbook. <br/><br/>How this works in practice is to be seen. While 96% of fed IT spend is on contracts of less than $1 million, around a quarter of the value goes to five big players -- HP, IBM, Telstra, Lockheed Martin Australia and Optus Networks. These vendors service Canberra's big five -- Health, Human Services, Defence, ATO and Border Force -- most who have large locked in multi-year contracts. This is big system stuff involving critical data and delivery, and no tier one secretary is going to spend too much time mucking around with nice-to-have edge innovation. <br/><br/>The transformed Digital Transformation Agency is the new investment and assurance police officer on the beat. There are about 17 mega contracts it will be overseeing, in a much tighter process to try to stop the duplication and multiplication of applications and systems. It is notoriously difficult to run a ruler over large ICT projects from a distance, so how that works in practice is to be seen. It is not an original idea, but a whole of government cost envelope for ICT would introduce some much needed internal contestability and force agencies to talk to each other, before they duplicate yet another application. <br/><br/>The push to turn the notoriously clunky procurement system into a window to tap market innovators, sees the government also adopt similar practices to the private sector -- the e-procurement catalogue for commodity services, dynamic pricing that means tax payers are not locked into yesterday's higher prices and a long overdue standardisation of terms and conditions. <br/><br/>Similarly in a world where agencies are being told to start small and iterate, there are measures to enable quick proof of concepts to be stood up. The feds have broadly adopted a NSW government program that encourages agencies to test their ideas before betting the house on bigger, riskier transformations. A gov pitch option will also enable smaller providers to showcase their technology smarts. <br/><br/>Net net this is expected to increase SME involvement from around $1.8 billion or 28%, to 2.45 billion or 38 %. That is very ambitious and compares with a bench mark of say 33 per cent SME involvement the UK government has set for all procurement. The biggest winners will be Canberra's booming small vendor ICT community. They will be heavily courted by the big techs as they search for partners to meet the higher SME targets. But if the SME's are simply reselling kit from the big US techs (no Chinese tech in Canberra thanks), then this just becomes a rort. <br/><br/>The dirty little secret is there is a distinct shortage of quality channel partners in the national capital, which is one of the unspoken reasons why some traditional big vendors such as Salesforce, have barely a presence in Canberra. The software as a service model demands local providers who can professionally integrate and customise, and for large scale deployments around core infrastructure such as a CRM, there is a very real paucity of quality and tested providers who can work at the scale government's require. <br/><br/>There is also a focus on outcomes based procurement, rather than forcing agencies to prescribe up front their requirements. This acknowledges the profound shift in procurement thinking caused by the emergence of cloud based subscription services. The national government has been notoriously slow adopting SAAS services -- in part because of major delays in getting cyber security approval from Defence's zealous Australian Signals Directorate. <br/><br/>We are not talking small fry here -- think Google and other titans. Microsoft broke through this log jam recently with commitments to host locally -- but only after an protracted period getting applications approved, that had long ago been given a tick by the rigorous US FedRAMP security clearance program. Ironically this is occurring as the new chief of the Australian Cyber Security Centre, Alastair McGibbon, is pushing all agencies to move off their porous legacy infrastructure to modern cloud systems, which typically have modern security capability built in. <br/><br/>There is a push to improve procurement skills and of all the initiatives this is perhaps the most important. The more honest vendors like IBM are up front about how tech is being       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.themandarin.com.au/55960-industrial-approach-digital-government-services/\">commoditised and commodified</url>. But\u00a0the shift to subscription services can often see large blow outs in implementation costs as agencies are socked with multiple licence fees, endless integration charges and high cost maintenance and support plans for software that is sold as plug and play. <br/><br/>This requires real market savvy and for a host of reasons there is naivety and softness in Canberra's procurement community that big players like the banks, airlines and telcos long ago addressed, by appointing the meanest chief procurement officers they could find. That of course is hyperbole, but in my opinion the number of Canberra CPO's with top grade commercial experience could be counted not on one hand, but on one finger. <br/><br/>Which brings us to the elephant in the room. Taylor notes in the       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://ict-procurement.digital.gov.au/response.html\">government's formal response</url> to the report: \"The Taskforce found that a culture of risk aversion in procurement has undermined the freedom to innovate and experiment, to take risks and fail, to try again and ultimately succeed. If we are to reward the innovative and entrepreneurial spirit, a new procurement culture is necessary.\" <br/><br/>But as close observers of the federal procurement system know, the real risk is not so much a culture of risk aversion, but rather unthinkingly treading a well-worn path. Cleaning up the supply chain and procurement is very useful hygiene, but the big issue is for what purpose. To date the digitisation push has largely seen a long overdue clean up of front end web sites and some welcome automation of forms and point solutions. But in the main it is paving the cow path stuff, rather than really rethinking the process and approach. Digital is IT with <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">real world purpose</emphasis> and this takes vision and leadership at the business end of agencies. <br/><br/>What has been lacking is clear business outcomes, developed and owned by these agencies. An example is the billion dollar welfare system rebuild, called WIPT. This massive and much needed infrastructure overhaul should be underpinning what we want our welfare system to be. And while there has been some attempt to simplify the business rules that try to make sense of our highly targeted welfare system, the project is largely replicating the current spaghetti of benefits and morass of rules. This drives massive system cost, and essentially replicates the post-war analogue benefits framework. <br/><br/>Cleaning this up requires big political commitment. In a tight fiscal era where we can't any longer simply pay off the losers from any large scale simplification this means Ministers and departmental leaders have to step up to the plate to drive foundational change. Not much sign of that. <br/><br/>Nor of any strategic vision how the system is to be designed for a period of large scale cognitive applications and the big disruptor of them all, the fast coming 5G-powered Internet of Things. The previous big government tech review was a decade ago and missed the mobile and cloud revolutions. When you are spending over $6 billion a year you want to have a very solid horizon scanning process that brings together the big commercial tech providers and government to plot out an aligned strategic path way that enables government to move from being a perpetual laggard to a leader. <br/><br/>Government is essentially the same worldwide, so done well this opens up huge economic opportunity. Deploying government as a service is absolutely something that could be done as a global offering. Our passport management system for example is a service solution many offshore governments could use, and turns a cost centre into a revenue play. <br/><br/>Finally at a time where every galah in the pet shop is squawking about data and the need to apply it big time into systems, services, policy and regulatory design, there is a desperate need for some deep thinking about what the underlying operating system begins to look like. In one scenario government could rapidly become a pure data play, supporting a vibrant eco system of providers in an Uber/AirBNB type model. As we redo the plumbing for a digital era, we still seem to be relatively clueless about the difference between doing digital, and being digital. <br/><br/>Over to you       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.themandarin.com.au/77637-tom-burton-slaters-digital-challenges/\">Gavin Slater</url>. <br/><br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MANDRN-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MANDRN2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PCB-K161-JD6R-T3PR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">435685</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1542\"/><timeReceived>12:19 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 First Digital Media All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Mandarin</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"08\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>August 23, 2017 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC000275Z</classCode><className>LOCKHEED MARTIN CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>NAICS336414 GUIDED MISSILE &amp;

As we redo the plumbing for a digital era, we still seem to be still relatively clueless about the difference between doing digital, and being digital. <br/><br/>Over to you       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.themandarin.com.au/77637-tom-burton-slaters-digital-challenges/\">Gavin Slater</url>. <br/><br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MANDRN-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MANDRN2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5P9M-THG1-F0NT-H14C-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">435685</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1544\"/><timeReceived>12:19 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 First Digital Media All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Mandarin</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"08\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>August 23, 2017 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC000275Z</classCode><className>LOCKHEED MARTIN CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>NAICS336414 GUIDED MISSILE &amp;

And while each will come with all guns loaded, the more fundamental issue will be how the ACCC considers the elusive issue of competition in the digital era. </p><p><br/><br/>It is an issue of huge interest to the world's economic regulators at a time when the politics for big tech has gone nasty.<br/><br/>This is the inquiry that should have preceded the much derided media ownership changes the Australian Parliament is expected to rubber stamp, when it returns for the final session of the year. <br/><br/> Media regulation in Australia has always been a true blood sport. No one should be surprised that, yet again, all we got was a set of political deals to buy off the various industry players (including the Mandarin's publishing <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2017/09/15/what-went-on-behind-the-scenes-of-the-media-reform-process/\">company</url>). Consumers (AKA the taxpayer) got not a look in, nor anyone much else as Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation dominated the political landscape, skillfully and clinically, controlling the deal making like a five ring circus. Ministers, mandarins, media, all dutifully played along. <br/><br/> And despite a decade of journalistic decimation there was precious little offered by my profession, its industrial representatives, or academic camp followers about how to best respond to the root cause of the demise of traditional advertising supported publishing and broadcasting -- the dramatic shift in marketing budgets to the internet. <br/>Welcome to the piranha pit <br/>The ACCC enquiry -- forced on the government by the minority parties to secure the media ownership changes -- comes as the big tech industry confronts a very different political, media \u00a0and government environment. <br/><br/>In this country and around the world, deep political and policy anxieties are merging about the power and influence wielded by\u00a0the five giant tech 'platforms'\u00a0- Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft, Google and the biggest of them all Apple. <br/><br/>Known as FAMGA, these five companies are now the biggest companies in America, over a decade rapidly knocking out corporate giants, Exxon, GE, BP and Citigroup. At that time only Microsoft was in the top five. <br/><br/>With the largely unregulated internet so massively successful as a business creation platform, the big techs have long been wary about being drawn into the regulatory games of the political class, worried this is a slippery slope to endless red tape and worse still, structural regulation.  <br/><br/>For nearly two decades the west coast techs were content to play a low key lobbying game, directing their public policy efforts and funding through third party advocacy, research papers and sympathetic think tanks. This was bolstered by quiet face-to-face legislative lobbying and some sharp K Street lawyering.  <br/><br/>Blame Donald Trump, but somewhere in the zeitgeist the tide has turned and the tech lobby is being dragged front and centre into the political and media mainstream, and with it the swamp that is top tier global regulatory politics. <br/><br/>Influential Buzzfeed editor-in-chief Ben Smith recently led the media call, claiming there is       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/bensmith/theres-blood-in-the-water-in-silicon-valley?utm_term=.xjdpZ1rmr#.naxpLX474\">\"Blood in the Water in Silicon Valley\".</url>\u00a0The rising chorus against the Silicon Valley titans has also included News Corporation's flagship outlet,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmCcm2j4keQ\">Fox News</url>. <br/><br/>In Washington this tirade against the techs has become strangely bipartisan, with even former Trump adviser, Stephen Bannon, cheering the push to have the big techs declared utilities -- and regulated as such.  <br/><br/>In academic and elite opinion circles the power of FAMGA has generated some deeply visceral attacks on the motives of the big techs with former New Republic editor, Franklin Foer, leading the charge with a book titled:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N4VV7B6/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;btkr=1\">World Without Mind: The Existential Threat of Big Tech</url>.  <br/><br/>Having disrupted the world, the big techs themselves are being disrupted and around the globe, country after country are demanding sovereignty and compliance from the tech platforms, across a vast sweep of issues. <br/><br/> These are as diverse as cyber security, online bullying, data ownership, cookie management, tax collection, identity theft, child sexual abuse, fake news, media diversity, sex trafficking, pornography, terrorism and criminal support, encryption security, election manipulation, currency fraud, not to mention privacy and cyber espionage.  <br/><br/>Ironically, the protest has been led from by the US itself, where the FAMGA have become targets of voracious Administration, Congressional and State legislative attention.  <br/><br/>Facebook and Google were at the centre of how the Trump Presidency came to be, and Facebook is now part of the the Special Prosecutor's current investigation into claimed Russian meddling in the Presidential Election. The Washington Post recently asked:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/facebooks-role-in-trumps-win-is-clear-no-matter-what-mark-zuckerberg-says/2017/09/07/b5006c1c-93c7-11e7-89fa-bb822a46da5b_story.html?utm_term=.4a362d49fa70\">\"Would Donald Trump be president today if Facebook didn't exist?</url><br/><br/>In Australia the same trendlines are evident big time, but it is the avoidance of local taxes that deeply infuriates the ruling elite. There is complete consensus it is wrong. It remains a show stopper for any meaningful relationship by the big techs with Canberra.  <br/>The new (marketing) gatekeepers <br/>Google and Facebook have now found themselves in the political sweatbox in the run-up to the deliberation of the media ownership bill. The Australian media plays politics with its elbows up and it was Murdoch's The Australian -- aided and abetted by various Fairfax titles -- that was typically\u00a0      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/media/google-is-no-friend-of-journalism-news-corp/news-story/6fa983be3544e8bd799f1897566ad72e\">most shrill</url> about the       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.google.com.au/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjVuZb7jbjWAhXJXrwKHcLMAhsQFggmMAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theaustralian.com.au%2Fbusiness%2Fmedia%2Fgoogle-is-no-friend-of-journalism-news-corp%2Fnews-story%2F6fa983be3544e8bd799f1897566ad72e&amp;usg=AFQjCNFKam4x3fU3VVIEqzN0w_QjtDVznQ\">evils of faceless tech</url> profiting off news media they have not paid for. <br/><br/>The political heat paid off earlier this year when the Opposition and Senate Minority parties combined to force a shotgun Senate inquiry into the future of Australian journalism. News Corp reported at the time: <br/></p><excerpt><bodyText><p>\"Senator Xenophon warned that a failure to address the challenges facing media organisations would result in more journalists and camera operators losing their jobs. He pointed the finger of blame at Facebook and Google, saying that, between them, they raked in $3.2bn worth of advertising revenue at the same time as they were 'cannibalising the content of Australian journalists.\u00a0As a consequence we have a situation where Australian journalism is in crisis.'\"</p></bodyText></excerpt><p><br/>Xenophon was always the key to the bill succeeding. He stuck to his guns and persuaded the government to cop the ACCC inquiry. <br/><br/>Across the world the breaking point between media and tech has been the catastrophic collapse in advertising revenue for the mainstream print and broadcast media. After more than a decade of costs cuts, there is no end in sight as the media proprietors report never ending revenue write downs. <br/><br/>In Australia, for the first time,\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.adnews.com.au/news/digital-ad-spend-to-overtake-tv-in-2017-studies-find\">digital media spend is expected to pip traditional media</url> spend this year, with around 54% of the annual $16 billion Australian marketing pie predicted to go on line. This is expected to climb to 61 % by 2021, with most of that growth expected to go to Google and Facebook. <br/><br/>In just over a decade       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-06-14/adertising-share-of-gdp/8613364\">traditional advertising revenues</url> in Australia for print products has fallen to a quarter, and for television it is now half. This is consistent with US and global trends.\u00a0 <br/><br/>Most of the traditional media players have developed formidable digital products, but unlike the glory days where the media moguls could bottleneck distribution and production, the internet lets anyone be a media player. Revenues have fragmented as marketing spreads its dollars widely, chasing niche digital communities. <br/><br/>The economic power in this era of content proliferation belongs to what Stratechery's Ben Thompson calls the       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://stratechery.com/2015/aggregation-theory/\">aggregators</url>. In particular, Google through its control of search, and Facebook through its vice like grip on the social graph of its two billion strong community. <br/><br/>Google's powerful search algorithm, smart data analytics and intelligent ad buying software is simply a better way to let marketers link buyers and sellers. Similarly Facebook, more recently, worked out how to feed its users content marketing and advertising based on users digital profiles, networks and activities. <br/><br/>The phenomenon of disintermediation is a familiar tune in the digital world -- Uber owns no cars, Airbnb no homes - but this has not stopped them finding a better way for consumers to purchase transport and accommodation. Google and Facebook simply found a better way to identify would-be buyers for\u00a0prospective sellers by using the insights from their users digital behaviours. And with far better ROI, control and reporting than media. <br/><br/> In essence Google and Facebook have created superior mouse traps for marketers to convince buyers of their brands and products. Thompson posits this has switched the power from the publishers to advertisers -- and to the two dominant marketing platforms, Google and Facebook.  <br/>Consumers are not complaining <br/>Enter the ACCC. The terms of reference will determine the scope of the inquiry but at heart the ACCC will be the first major review by a top tier regulator of how best to consider the big techs and the profound role they now play across so many facets of the Australian economy and society. <br/><br/>This will be challenging and will require deep thinking what the exact competition problem is, and then what, if any, remedies can be applied. <br/><br/>A key issue will be exactly what the consumer detriment is. Facebook and Google offer broadly free platforms which billions of users flock to, day after day. The key to their success has been to attract users into their respective eco systems and to serve them marketing collateral based on insights from the data they collect from users digital behaviours. Some may find digital stalking spooky, but consumers are voting big time to accept the trade off between the utility Google and Facebook offer, and the advertising that pays for the service.  <br/><br/>This is not to suggest the techs do no evil. The Europeans recently fined Google $3.6 billion for artificially promoting its own price comparison service in searches. Google is appealing this decision. An appeal the global tech lawyer world will be focussed on. Totally <br/><br/> This is not dissimilar to when Microsoft was pinged by US anti-trust authorities in the 1990's for trying to thwart Netscape's innovative browser. The Microsoft lesson is a salutary one for the ACCC. At the time the browser was considered a critical bottleneck. It proved not to be the case, so all that anti-trust activity was arguably for nought, and indeed Microsoft went onto dominate the browser market in any case. <br/><br/>Regulators strong legalistic culture means they are fixated with current laws and typically struggle to take a forward looking approach. This problem is heightened at the Commonwealth level, where regulators are given little discretion to work up practical fit- for-purpose solutions. Regulations are typically hardwired to out-of-date tightly drafted statutes, not to be modernised any time soon. <br/><br/>This is exacerbated in fast moving technology sectors, with regulators often hopelessly unaware how the market is actually applying the technology, till there is some reported atrocity. In the case of both Facebook and Google the number of public policy issues these diverse platforms are raising is clearly beyond the competence of even the most tech savvy regulator to get across. <br/><br/>Which the ACCC is not. Indeed the ACCC's record around technology has not been a brilliant one, with its acquiescence in the flawed NBN decision perhaps being the best example where it was simply out of its depth. Ditto telco access pricing, which on one argument is what got us into the NBN mess in the first place.  <br/><br/>The ACCC will need to bolster its skill set with some temporary secondments of technically savvy advisers who have a strong understanding of the interplay between digital technologies and economics. <br/><br/>As with any anti-trust issue market definition is critical. The ACCC ( and its predecessor the Trade Practices Commission ) has a history of defining ad markets narrowly. There remains plenty of fight in the traditional advertising markets, so the question could be if Google and Facebook are impeding competition in the digital advertising market. The more realistic view is it is one giant marketing cess pit and a tussle by all the platforms, medias, technologies for the share of booz, gambling, FMCG, e-commerce, etc etc dollars that are on the campaign planning table.\u00a0 <br/><br/>In any case this will require a sharp understanding of the new marketing world, including programmatic advertising, cookie pooling, remarketing, as well as an acute feel for digital analytics and the underlying algorithms that drive the platforms. Understanding conversion is key. <br/><br/>Digital technology is a stack of functional hardware and software layers and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.themandarin.com.au/47950-tom-burton-time-radical-view-government-platform/\">governments have real choices</url> which part they want to focus on. This requires a horizontal view of the world, at a time when most regulators -- ACCC included -- are set up for vertical end-to-end sectoral regulation.\u00a0 <br/>Media and marketing a moving feast <br/>Another challenge for the ACCC is how to consider the rapidly changing media and ad tech environment. Any observations and remedies around the impact of Google and Facebook will need to be tempered by the expectation that \u00a0there are likely to be new disruptors around the corner. <br/><br/>Last week's Emmy Awards was the first time content specifically developed for the new streaming platforms dominated awards. This is a good example of media players focussing on rebuilding their product for the new era. The rapid rise of streaming promises to rock broadcast TV and is a reminder of how dynamic the media market, as the world shifts to near ubiquitous fast broadband. <br/><br/>Plug a late generation smart TV into the NBN and you open a treasure trove of program options and payment plans ranging from pay as you go, to full subscription. All from the Samsung remote. <br/><br/>And while Google and Facebook have built a superior marketing platform for now, history, instinct and common sense suggests these may well be taken over by better solutions. Search for a local plumber that you can trust to turn up on time and you know Google has a long way to go, if you want any thing that is specialised or local. <br/><br/>Facebook works if you don't care being spammed by mindless pap (or fake news). For B2C marketers, Facebook's massive reach is impressive. But with average click through rates of around one per cent, that is not great for the large B2B marketing marketplace where there are many other better marketing channels to work with (eg email). <br/><br/>Google's little search ads are fine if you are targeting specific buyers, but try running a major brand or issues campaign and see how effective that is .  <br/><br/>And in certain (lucrative) verticals there are already well established portals, such as Seek for recruitment, Domain and Realestate.com.au for property and carsales.com.au for auto. Throw in Gumtree, Ebay and the raft of specialised travel booking sites and this suggests many other competitive alternatives. And if you don't like Facebook there is always Twitter or Snapchat. Or whatever is being cooked up in a Delhi garage for Gen I -- those pesky post millennials born with a #smartfone in their hand. <br/><br/>And has any one noticed Amazon.com.au and how much better Woolies online has suddenly got? <br/><br/>Recall also that before Facebook came along, News Corporation's Myspace was a dominant social play. Before that AOL had a stranglehold on mid-America. The \"next Facebook\" could be one of the very aggressive Chinese platforms such as WeChat and Weibo. <br/><br/>Which will excite the Australian Signals Directorate, no end.  <br/>Data, privacy and competition <br/>If marketing is about connecting buyers and sellers then data, and more precisely data analytics, is the critical currency for any serious platform. Facebook collects       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KBFsiAlfmO4u9OKqLsJ9fpLFG7AI-Zw3lHER8nNwa6Q/edit#gid=0\">nearly 100 different data points</url>which enables it to offer a sophisticated segmentation to prospective marketers. Google similarly gathers enormous amounts of data about web behaviours which it uses to tailor its ad servers. <br/><br/>At the same time powerful back office marketing platforms are being used by ecommerce outlets, banks, telcos and many other to track web users, creating personalised profiles that score users, enabling sophisticated segmentation and highly tuned marketing campaigns. \u00a0 <br/><br/>Regulators in Australia have largely ignored the privacy issues associated with digital stalking by brands, and with some limited exceptions have little understanding of how invasive these systems are. <br/><br/>Unlike Europe, Australia has no formal regulations around cookies - the little piece of code that is key to Facebook and Google's success. And an existential threat to their business, if any regulator got too smart. For economic libertarians there are       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.iabaustralia.com.au/guidelines-and-best-practice/guidelines-best-practice/item/3-guidelines-and-best-practice/2072-australian-best-practice-guideline-for-online-behavioural-advertising\">sensible self- reg models</url>\u00a0for cookies as we all learn about the digital world. <br/><br/>This week federal Digital Transformation Minister, Angus Taylor, revealed the government is going to enable end users to \"own\" their data, confirming the government had accepted in principle the recommendation of the Productivity Commission of a       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.themandarin.com.au/84134-taylor-calls-citizen-data-ownership-drive-new-competition-era/\">universal data right</url>. Declaring to a Washington DC conference he is an \"economic liberal\", Taylor said the government wanted to enable consumers to move easily from provider to provider to promote competition, especially in notoriously sticky sectors like banking, energy, health insurance and telecommunications. <br/><br/>The decision to embrace a universal data right is seminal and opens a whole new front in competition policy. How this plays out in the broader economy is to be seen, but in Taylors world data sets will be standardised so users can use their own data profiles to negotiate better deals. The concept works well if, the data that shows I have been a reliable payer of my loan, enables me to negotiate a better rate with a competitor. (Query what happens when the data shows I have major health problems.) <br/><br/>Data is at the heart of Taylor's government digital transformation play. Witness this quote from his       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.menziesrc.org/publications/item/the-promise-of-digital-government-by-angus-taylor-mp\">Menzies Research Centre's essay on the Promise of Digital Government</url>: <br/></p><excerpt><bodyText><p>\"Most discussions of benefits from digitisation start and finish with customer service improvements and direct efficiencies in reduced customer service costs. Often forgotten are the bigger opportunities for compliance, risk management, payment integrity and program targeting, with savings far beyond direct efficiencies.\"</p></bodyText></excerpt><p><br/>Taylor has the re-emerging Digital Transformation Agency to drive this ambitious agenda. DTA's \u00a0strategic control over the $6.5 billion annual Federal ICT spend, means Taylor can exert a lot of leverage into the system. <br/><br/>It is a small world. Taylor is a former director of Sydney boutique strategy advisory firm, Port Jackson Partners. So is Rod Sims, chair of the ACCC and former Prime Ministerial adviser. Another Port Jackson alum is Fred Hilmer, the author of the previous national competition reforms that led to the establishment of the ACCC. Hilmer was also CEO of Fairfax when the internet began to dismantle its rivers of classified gold. <br/><br/>How Taylor's theory of economic data analytics is applied by Sims will be closely watched. <br/><br/>So too will be the FAMGA lobbying. According to its\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"http://periodicdisclosures.aec.gov.au/Returns/56/UFLW2A01.pdf\">2014-15 electoral disclosures</url>, Google Australia funded both the ALP's Chifley Research Centre and the Liberal Parties Menzies Research Centre to conduct public policy research and funded that research to the value of $66,000 each. This helped support Taylor's essay. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MANDRN-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MANDRN2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PK9-S6Y1-JD6R-T1CX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">435685</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3285\"/><timeReceived>12:05 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 First Digital Media All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Mandarin</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"09\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>September 28, 2017 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"68\"><classCode>CC000DL4T</classCode><className>NEWS CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0002275</classCode><className>CITIGROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"68\"><className>NAICS511120 PERIODICAL PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"68\"><className>NAICS511110 NEWSPAPER PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"68\"><className>SIC2721 PERIODICALS: PUBLISHING, OR PUBLISHING &amp;

In 2013, Steyer, 62, started Nextgen America, a PAC that has contributed $230 million to Democrats in the 2014, 2016 and 2018 campaign cycles. With a net worth estimated at $1.6-billion built from decades of running the hedge fund Farallon Capital, Steyer has drawn criticism for spending his money on his unlikely campaign instead of on grass-roots organizations or his prior focus, impeaching President Trump. But he says he saw a need for a 2020 contender to speak more urgently about climate change and about Trump's behavior. 'I don't see the Democratic establishment doing anything real to stop him,' he said of the president in August. Steyer has struggled to find footing in the polls, but he gained enough support to earn a spot in the fourth Democratic presidential debate in October and the fifth in November.</p><p>Steyer released an aggressive plan to address climate change. He says his proposal is 'justice-centered' and calls for a 'Civilian Climate Corps' to create jobs and provide resources to help communities adapt to a clean energy economy. He set a deadline of 2045 to achieve net-zero global warming pollution and a 100-percent clean energy economy, five years earlier than many other candidates in the 2020 race. Steyer says he would use the emergency powers of the presidency to protect the country from climate change.</p><p>Steyer, a billionaire, advocates for a wealth tax and has said he wants to 'undo every Republican tax cut for rich people and major corporations.' He supports a $15-an-hour minimum wage and an increased earned income tax credit. Steyer says monopolies need to be broken up or regulated, saying on his website that 'unchecked capitalism undermines our democracy and hurts too many people.'</p><p> Steyer says he would increase teacher pay and improve school facilities. He also expressed support for universal pre-K. 'Every American should have the right to a free, quality, public education from universal pre-kindergarten through higher education, including workforce and technical training,' his campaign website says.</p><p>Steyer would work with global allies to address climate change and continue trade agreements 'with everyone at the table,' according to his campaign website. He has condemned Trump for having an 'America first' foreign policy strategy. 'What we really should be doing is addressing these things with our traditional allies in a multilateral way,' he told CBS News in July. 'We cannot draw a wall around the United States.'</p><p>Steyer has endorsed a public option and says he wants to bolster the government-run program so that it eventually would force private insurance companies out of business. 'I'm not in favor of saying to 150-million Americans who get their health care through their employer: 'That's now illegal. You will have to do it our way,' ' he told WBUR, Boston's NPR station, in August. He has also been outspoken against the pharmaceutical industry, criticizing companies for profiting from drug sales.</p><p>Steyer is self-funding his campaign.</p><p>The former vice president has centered his third presidential run on his vow to oust President Trump. He began his campaign with a video that start with the words 'Charlottesville, Virginia,' alluding to the white supremacist violence there as a way of drawing attention to the division and violence he says has racked the country under the current president. In September, Biden's name became part of the House's impeachment inquiry of Trump, who acknowledged asking the president of Ukraine to investigate Biden and his son Hunter. Neither Biden nor his son has been accused of wrongdoing. As Biden and his family face heightened scrutiny, the former vice president has struggled to maintain a lead over Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who has steadily climbed in the polls. Biden, 77, has been a force in Democratic politics for nearly five decades, representing Delaware in the Senate for 36 years before serving two terms under President Barack Obama. His long history has forged connections with voters and prompted criticism of his past, including his positions on crime legislation, his interactions with women and his tendency to make gaffes on the national stage.</p><p>Biden is embracing the Green New Deal's framework, setting a deadline to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 and vowing to create a clean-energy economy with new jobs. Biden said that he'd rejoin the Paris climate accord on his first day in office and would pressure other countries to take steps to lower emissions. But some climate activists, including Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, a former Democratic presidential candidate, have accused Biden of having 'middle ground' climate proposal and skirting more ambitious short-term targets.</p><p>The former vice president says his policies are designed to lift up the middle class. He is in favor of a capital gains tax on assets held by the wealthiest Americans, and an increase in the minimum wage to $15 an hour. He said the government needs to strengthen its antitrust enforcement and 'take a hard look at how we can rein in some of the abuses of power from the world's biggest corporations, whether it be big tech, insurance companies, or the agriculture industry.' Biden does not believe in providing a universal basic income or jobs guarantee, as some more liberal candidates have proposed.</p><p>The former vice president has made foreign relations and Trump's behavior on the international stage a cornerstone of his campaign. 'Foreign policy is domestic policy and domestic policy is foreign policy,' he said in a July speech. He has accused Trump of currying favor with dictators and alienating allies with his 'America first' mantra. Biden was a proponent of free-trade deals under the Obama administration but has since reversed his support of the Trans-Pacific Partnership and has been forced to defend his vote for the North American Free Trade Agreement. He has criticized Trump's trade war with China, calling for new guidelines that would facilitate trade between the nations without allowing China to 'keep moving and robbing U.S. firms.'</p><p>Biden's health-care policy proposal is built on the legacy of Obama's Affordable Care Act. He has been an outspoken proponent of a public option to allow anyone to buy into Medicare. Unlike many contenders to his ideological left, Biden has not endorsed Medicare-for-all. 'I understand the appeal of Medicare-for-all, but folks supporting it should be clear that it means getting rid of Obamacare, and I'm not for that,' Biden said in a video. He has said he thinks undocumented immigrants should be covered under a government-run health plan.</p><p>$37.7 million</p><p>Raised so far by the campaign, the 5th highest fundraising total in the Democratic field. Biden ranks 10th in in the field in percent of money coming from small-dollar donations.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPOST-7cb8040a-3ee2-11ea-baca-eb7ace0a3455</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPOST2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y3N-CYX1-DXXY-3384-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8075</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1153\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Washington Post</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"12311\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Regional Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"31\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 31, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;
