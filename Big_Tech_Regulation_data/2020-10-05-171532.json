Most eaters (I include myself) will salivate at bacon, despite what we know of the waste, squalor and suffering caused by mainstream meat production. Yet when we hear about a new type of \u201cethical\u201d meat with a much lower carbon footprint, cultured from cells without killing a single animal, our initial response is usually something like: \u201cEw! \u2014 I wouldn\u2019t eat that.\u201d</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We should try to get beyond our disgust about \u201clab meat,\u201d argues the journalist Chase Purdy, who is in the rare position of having actually tasted it. In a fast-paced global narrative, Purdy follows the various cell-cultured meat companies that are currently competing to get their product to market first. The front-runners are in Israel, the Netherlands and (no surprise) Silicon Valley. The results of what Purdy calls this \u201cedible space race\u201d may shape the future of meat eating around the world.</p><p>Meat that is grown in a vat doesn\u2019t taste as bad as you might expect, according to Purdy.</p><p>It\u2019s not as if conventional ground beef from feedlot cows tastes that great either when you really pay attention. In San Francisco, at the offices of the food company JUST, a lab tech serves Purdy a taco stuffed with duck chorizo grown from cells. The meat, he reports, is \u201cmoist and richly flavored.\u201d The early prototypes of cell-cultured meat \u2014 grown from muscle stem cells \u2014 suffered from being too lean, but now the companies have figured out ways to grow fat tissue as well as muscle tissue, which means that the mouthfeel is getting closer to the meat we know (though it\u2019s still easier to make a texturally plausible meatball than a convincing steak).</p><p>This is Purdy\u2019s first book, and he sometimes falls into journalistic clich\u00e9s. His story teems with the occasional \u201cmake-or-break\u201d moment or a light bulb going off in someone\u2019s head. But the upside is that his writing is always punchy and readable, even when he is explaining the complex and gruesome biology of growing a new piece of flesh from an old one. Sometimes there is a kind of Frankenstein fascination, such as in his description of how scientists at JUST have figured out a way to manipulate cells collected from the pointy tip of a chicken\u2019s feather to become not just more feathers but also muscle and fat. Purdy explains that \u201cscientists can take a cell that would normally live its life as a feather producer, tell it to stop working on feathers, and then revert it back into an earlier-stage cell.\u201d In this way, cells from a single feather could give rise to multiple batches of chicken nuggets.</p><p>[ Read an excerpt from <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/18/books/review/billion-dollar-burger-by-chase-purdy-an-excerpt.html\">\u201cBillion Dollar Burger.\u201d</url> ]</p><p>The snag is that these cell-grown nuggets would cost $50 apiece. Up until now, the biggest obstacle to getting cultured meat on the market has been the sheer expense \u2014 hence the \u201cbillion dollar burger\u201d of Purdy\u2019s hyperbolic title. When the first lab-grown burger was unveiled in 2013 by a panel including the Dutch food scientist Mark Post, it was estimated to have cost $330,000 for a single five-ounce patty: equivalent to $1.2 million per pound of beef. But that cost is falling, and fast. In 2019 an Israeli firm called Future Meat Technologies claimed that by 2022, it would be able to get cell-cultured meat on the market for as little as $10 a pound.</p><p>Even if it were cheap enough, would we want to add cultured meat to our grocery lists? Purdy says that the biggest barrier to getting these products to market in the United States is \u201ca difficult regulatory landscape\u201d influenced by meat lobbyists with a strong vested interest in keeping cell-cultured meat off the shelves.</p><p>We can\u2019t blame the meat industry for all of our wariness around cell-cultured meat, however. Purdy concedes that many questions about this new technology remain unanswered. In the Netherlands, Post tells him that one of the many differences between traditional meat and cell-cultured meat is that the cell culture lacks an immune system. This sounds like it might just be important.</p><p>It\u2019s too soon to say whether our \u201cEw\u201d response to cultured meat is warranted or not. Many of the much-promoted novel foods of the past \u2014 margarine, I\u2019m looking at you \u2014 turned out over time to be less healthy than was first thought. In a lovely passage, Purdy has a conversation in the kitchen with his aunt and grandmother about whether they would like to eat these new meats. \u201cI\u2019d have to get past the whole thought of it all,\u201d his aunt replies. She\u2019s not the only one.</p><p>Bee Wilson is the author, most recently, of \u201cThe Way We Eat Now.\u201d </p><p>PHOTO: At the laboratories of Redefine Meat.

Yet an internal discussion thread leaked to Breitbart News reveals Google regularly intervenes in search results on its YouTube video platform - including a recent intervention that pushed pro-life videos out of the top ten search results for 'abortion.' The term 'abortion' was added to a 'blacklist' file for 'controversial YouTube queries,' which contains a list of search terms that the company considers sensitive. According to the leak, these include some of these search terms related to: abortion, abortions, the Irish abortion referendum, Democratic Congresswoman Maxine Waters, and anti-gun activist David Hogg. </p><p>The existence of the blacklist was revealed in an internal Google discussion thread leaked to Breitbart News by a source inside the company who wishes to remain anonymous. A partial list of blacklisted terms was also leaked to Breitbart by another Google source. In the leaked discussion thread, a Google site reliability engineer hinted at the existence of more search blacklists, according to the source. 'We have tons of white- and blacklists that humans manually curate,' said the employee. 'Hopefully this isn't surprising or particularly controversial.' Others were more concerned about the presence of the blacklist. According to the source, the software engineer who started the discussion called the manipulation of search results related to abortion a 'smoking gun.' The software engineer noted that the change had occurred following aninquiry from a left-wingSlatejournalist[3]about the prominence of pro-life videos on YouTube, and that pro-life videos were replaced with pro-abortion videos in the top ten results for the search terms following Google's manual intervention. 'TheSlatewriter said she had complained last Friday and then saw different search results before YouTube responded to her on Monday,' wrote the employee. 'And lo and behold, the [changelog] was submitted on Friday, December 14 at 3:17 PM.' The manually downranked items included several videos from Dr. Antony Levatino, a former abortion doctor who is now a pro-life activist. Another video in the top ten featured a woman's personal story of being pressured to have an abortion, while another featured pro-life conservative Ben Shapiro. TheSlatejournalist who complained to Googlereported[4] that these videos previously featured in the top ten, describing them in her story as 'dangerous misinformation.' Since theSlatejournalist's inquiry andGoogle's subsequent intervention, the top search resultsnow[5]feature pro-abortion content from left-wing sources like BuzzFeed, Vice, CNN, andLast Week Tonight With John Oliver.In herreport[6], theSlatejournalist acknowledged that the search results changed shortly after she contacted Google. The manual adjustment of search results by a Google-owned platform contradicts a keyclaim[7]made under oath by Google CEO Sundar Pichai in his congressional testimony earlier this month: that his company does not 'manually intervene on any search result.' A Google employee in the discussion thread drew attention to Pichai's claim, noting that it 'seems like we are pretty eager to cater our search results to the social and political agenda of left-wing journalists.' One of the posts in the discussion also noted that the blacklist had previously been edited to include the search term 'Maxine Waters' after a single Google employee complained the top YouTube search result for Maxine Waters was 'very low quality.' Google's alleged intervention on behalf of a Democratic congresswoman would be further evidence of the tech giant using its resources to prop up the left. Breitbart News previously reported on leaked emails revealing the company targeted pro-Democrat demographics in its get-out-the-vote efforts in 2016. According to the source, a software engineer in the thread also noted that 'a bunch of terms related to the abortion referendum in Ireland' had been added to the blacklist - another change with potentially dramatic consequences on the national policies of a western democracy. youtube_controversial_query_blacklist At least one post in the discussion thread revealed the existence of a file called 'youtube_controversial_query_blacklist,' which contains a list of YouTube search terms that Google manually curates. In addition to the terms 'abortion,' 'abortions,' 'Maxine Waters,' and search terms related to the Irish abortion referendum, a Google software engineer noted that the blacklist includes search terms related to terrorist attacks. (the posts specifically mentions that the 'Strasbourg terrorist attack' as being on the list). 'If you look at the other entries recently added to theyoutube_controversial_query_blacklist(e.g., entries related to the Strasbourg terrorist attack), the addition of abortion seemsout-of-place,' wrote the software engineer, according to the source. After learning of the existence of the blacklist, Breitbart News obtained a partial screenshot of the full blacklist file from a source within Google. It reveals that the blacklist includes search terms related to both mass shootings and the progressive anti-second amendment activist David Hogg. This suggests Google has followed the lead of Democrat politicians, who haverepeatedly pushed tech companies[8]to censor content related to the Parkland school shooting and the Parkland anti-gun activists. It's part of a popular new line of thought in the political-media establishment,which views the public as too stupid to question conspiracy theories for themselves[9]. Here is the partial blacklist leaked to Breitbart:2117 plane crash Russian 2118 plane crash 2119 an-148 2120 florida shooting conspiracy 2121 florida shooting crisis actors 2122 florida conspiracy 2123 florida false flag shooting 2124 florida false flag 2125 fake florida school shooting 2126 david hogg hoax 2127 david hogg fake 2128 david hogg crisis actor 2129 david hogg forgets lines 2130 david hogg forgets his lines 2131 david hogg cant remember his lines 2132 david hogg actor 2133 david hogg cant remember 2134 david hogg conspiracy 2135 david hogg exposed 2136 david hogg lines 2137 david hogg rehearsing 2120 florida shooting conspiracyThe full internal filepath of the blacklist, according to another source, is: //depot/google3/googledata/superroot/youtube/youtube_controversial_query_blacklist Contradictions Responding to a request for comment, a YouTube spokeswoman said the company wants to promote 'authoritative' sources in its search results, but maintained that YouTube is a 'platform for free speech' that 'allow[s]' both pro-life and pro-abortion content. YouTube's full comment:YouTube is a platform for free speech where anyone can choose to post videos, as long as they follow ourCommunity Guidelines[10], which prohibit things like inciting violence and pornography. We apply these policies impartially and we allow both pro-life and pro-choice opinions. Over the last year we've described how we are working tobetter surface news sources[11]across our site for news-related searches and topical information. We've improved our search and discovery algorithms, built new features that clearly label and prominently surface news sources on our homepage and search pages, and introduced information panels to help give users more authoritative sources where they can fact check information for themselves.In the case of the 'abortion' search results, YouTube's intervention to insert 'authoritative' content resulted in the downranking of pro-life videos and the elevation of pro-abortion ones. A Google spokesperson took a tougher line than its YouTube subsidiary, stating that 'Google has never manipulated or modified the search results or content in any of its products to promote a particular political ideology.' However, in the leaked discussion thread, a member of Google's 'trust ...fety' team, Daniel Aaronson, admitted that the company maintains 'huge teams' that work to adjust search results for subjects that are 'prone to hyperbolic content, misleading information, and offensive content' - all subjective terms that are frequently used to suppress right-leaning sources. He also admitted that the interventions weren't confined to YouTube - they included search results delivered via Google Assistant, Google Home, and in rare cases Google 's organic search results. In the thread, Aaronson attempted to explain how search blacklisting worked. He claimed that highly specific searches would generate non-blacklisted results, even controversial ones. But the inclusion of highly specific terms in the YouTube blacklist, like 'David Hogg cant remember his lines' - the name of an actual viral video - seems to contradict this. Aaronson's full post is copied below:I work in Trust and Safety and while I have no particular input as to exactly what's happening for YT I can try to explain why you'd have this kind of list and why people are finding lists like these on Code Search. When dealing with abuse/controversial content on various mediums you have several levers to deal with problems. Two prominent levers are 'Proactive' and 'Reactive':Proactive: Usually refers to some type of algorithm/scalable solution to a general problem E.g.: We don't allow straight up porn on YouTube so we create a classifier that detects porn and automatically remove or flag for review the videos the porn classifier is most certain ofReactive: Usually refers to a manual fix to something that has been brought to our attention that our proactive solutions don't/didn't work on and something that is clearly in the realm of bad enough to warrant a quick targeted solution (determined by pages and pages of policies worked on over many years and many teams to be fair and cover necessary scope) E,g.: A website that used to be a good blog had it's domain expire and was purchased/repurposed to spam Search results with autogenerated pages full of gibberish text, scraped images, and links to boost traffic to other spammy sites. It is manually actioned for violating policy These Organic Search policies and the consequences to violating them are public[12] Manually reacting to things is not very scalable, and is not an ideal solution to most problems, so the proactive lever is really the one we all like to lean on. Ideally, our classifiers/algorithm are good at providing useful and rich results to our users while ignoring things at are not useful or not relevant. But we all know, this isn't exactly the case all the time (especially on YouTube). From a user perspective, there are subjects that are prone to hyperbolic content, misleading information, and offensive content. Now, these words are highly subjective and no one denies that. But we can all agree generally, lines exist in many cultures about what is clearly okay vs. what is not okay. E.g. a video of a puppy playing with a toy is probably okay in almost every culture or context, even if it's not relevant to the query. But a video of someone committing suicide and begging others to follow in his/her footsteps is probably on the other side of the line for many folks. While my second example is technically relevant to the generic query of 'suicide', that doesn't mean that this is a very useful or good video to promote on the top of results for that query. So imagine a classifier that says, for any queries on a particular text file, let's pull videos using signals that we historically understand to be strong indicators of quality (I won't go into specifics here, but those signals do exist). We're not manually curating these results, we're just saying 'hey, be extra careful with results for this query because many times really bad stuff can appear and lead to a bad experience for most users'. Ideally the proactive lever did this for us, but in extreme cases where we need to act quickly on something that is so obviously not okay, the reactive/manual approach is sometimes necessary. And also keep in mind, that this is different for every product. The bar for changing classifiers or manual actions on span in organic search isextremelyhigh. However, the bar for things we let our Google Assistant say out loud might be a lot lower. If I search for 'Jews run the banks' - I'll likely find anti-semitic stuff in organic search. As a Jew, I might find some of these results offensive, but they are there for people to research and view, and I understand that this is not a reflection of Google feels about this issue. But if I ask Google assistant 'Why do Jews run the banks' we wouldn't be similarly accepting if it repeated and promoted conspiracy theories that likely pop up in organic search in her smoothing voice. Whether we agree or not, user perception of our responses, results, and answers of different products and mediums can change. And I think many people are used to the fact that organic search is a place where content should be accessible no matter how offensive it might be, however, the expectation is very different on a Google Home, a Knowledge Panel, or even YouTube. These lines are very difficult and can be very blurry, we are all well aware of this. So we've got huge teams that stay cognizant of these facts when we're crafting policies considering classifier changes, or reacting with manual actions - these decisions are not made in a vacuum, but admittedly are also not made in a highly public forum like TGIF or IndustryInfo (as you can imagine, decisions/agreement would be hard to get in such a wide list - image if all your CL's were reviewed by every engineer across Google all the time). I hope that answers some questions and gives a better layer of transparency without going into details about our 'Pepsi formula'. Best, DanielThe fact that Google manually curates politically contentious search results fits in with a wider pattern of political activity on the part of the tech giant. In 2018, Breitbart News exclusively published a leaked video from the company that showedsenior management in dismay at Trump's election victory[13], and pledging to use the company's power to make his populist movement a'hiccup' in history[14]. Breitbart also leaked'The Good Censor,'[15]an internal research document from Google that admits the tech giant is engaged in the censorship of its own products, partly in response to political events. Another leak revealed that employees within the company, including Google's current director of Trust and Safety,tried to kick Breitbart News off Google's market-dominating online ad platforms[16]. Yet another showed Google engaged intargeted turnout operations[17]aimed to boost voter participation in pro-Democrat demographics in 'key states' ahead of the 2016 election. The effort was dubbed a 'silent donation' by a top Google employee. Evidence for Google's partisan activities is now overwhelming.President Trump has previously warned Google[18], as well as other Silicon Valley giants, not to engage in censorship or partisan activities. Google continues to defy him. Allum Bokhari is the senior technology correspondent at Breitbart News.

Do you ensure that everyone is always \"in like\" with you? Do you tell white lies so that people don't think you're a neghead? Yes, yes and yes? Time to wipe that fake smile off your face - you are suffering from toxic positivity.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">According to the American psychotherapists Jamie Long and Samara Quintero, toxic positivity is the \"excessive and ineffective overgeneralisation of a happy, optimistic state across all situations\". In a widely read recent post on their website, they wrote: \"When positivity is used to silence the human experience, it becomes toxic.\" Examples include trying to \"just get on with it\" by dismissing emotions, minimising the experiences of others with feelgood statements, and shaming people for expressing anything other than positivity. Toxic positivity is a dogma that insists, they write, \"that only keeping positive is the right way to live your life\".</p><p>Who could blame us, given the barrage of motivational mantras and #livingmybestlife hashtags. \"Social media sets us up to showcase the best aspects of our lives,\" Quintero says. \"But anything that creates a mask is not authentic.\" It's hard to resist, though, says Scarlett Curtis, whose latest book, It's Not OK to Feel Blue (and Other Lies), serves as a healthy antidote. \"Posting about the best parts of your life can reflect onto your real life, so it becomes this continuing cycle of trying to maintain the illusion.\" The multibillion-pound beauty and wellness industries are also in on the conspiracy, telling you, Long says, that \"you need to look your best and live your best life - oh, and don't leave home without full-coverage foundation\". The pressure is on.</p><p>At best, toxic positivity is smug and superficial; at worst, it's bad for our health and can make us unhappy. The issue with toxic positivity, according to Susan David, a psychologist at Harvard Medical School and author of Emotional Agility: Get Unstuck, Embrace Change and Thrive in Work and Life, is that \"it implies that some emotions are good and some are bad - and that bad emotions are not allowed\". David points the finger at the happiness movement: \"What gets lost in the well-intentioned message to 'be happier' is that being unhappy is an authentic human experience that has evolved to help us thrive as a species.\" Your bad mood, she says, is simply data that informs you how to adapt to environmental threats. Parental guilt, for example, signals that \"you value connection with your kids and you're feeling a lack of it\". Boredom at work shows that you value learning, but aren't getting enough. \"When we dismiss these emotions, we become less practised in understanding what the discomfort is telling us, and therefore fail to develop skills to deal with the world. There is a cost to our resilience, and we become less happy.\" When emotions are denied, she adds, they get stronger. \"There is a rebound effect - internal pain always comes out - but it's a faulty, passive way of being in the world.\"</p><p>Indeed, Long and Quintero have observed the toxic build-up in their clients. \"Most say they're overwhelmed with stress and anxiety,\" Long says, \"but when we take a deeper look, we find that the toxic-positivity style of coping is very common.\" Failing to express a broad range of emotions affects our ability to regulate our stress response, she explains, and therefore causes intense stress reactions, such as anxiety, depression and IBS.</p><p>If you're starting to feel like a happiness failure, don't worry, the backlash is coming. \"There's fatigue around the Goopish pursuit of constant perfection,\" says Lucie Greene, founder of the LA-based forecasting agency Light Years. She attributes the pushback in part to feminism, and its \"sophistication in understanding the biases and seeing through the constructs that make us feel bad\".</p><p>So are you ready to #speakyourtruth? At a talk earlier this year, the feminist author Chidera Eggerue announced the end of her \"Little Miss Nice\" persona. \"I've become a lot more direct,\" she says, \"because I don't see how far it's got us by playing nice. I am no longer invested in making the world comfortable for my oppressors, when I could be using that same energy to centre my own happiness.\" And did the world end? Apparently not. \"I have found myself in a lot more debates,\" she concedes, \"but it's empowering. I've also developed more meaningful relationships.\" In fact, she adds, \"I wish I could go back in time and do all this earlier.\"</p><p>Curtis posts crying selfies because \"if my feed is too positive, it doesn't feel like a reflection of me ... It gets rid of the shame I hold. People respond to it better. They're sick of seeing the other stuff.\"</p><p>It is the act of \"moving our uncomfortable emotions out of our body\", say Long and Quintero, that \"keeps us healthy and relieves the tension caused by suppressing the truth. Accepting ourselves as we are is the path to a robust emotional life.\"</p><p>But will we become emotionally incontinent snowflakes? \"I'm not suggesting that we have to act on every single feeling,\" says David, whose concept of emotional agility is that we notice and accept our inner world with compassion and curiosity. \"It doesn't mean that you need to have it out with whoever you're upset with.\" Indeed, it's toxic positivity that causes fragility, she says, whereas \"being honest about your feelings leads to agility and resilience\".</p><p>What about anger, though? Can we really let rip with such a stigmatised emotion? Is rage permitted? \"There's a difference between honouring your emotions versus acting them out unhealthily,\" Quintero says. \"I can feel rage, but that doesn't give me permission to express it in a way that harms me or those around me. What makes a human being healthy is the ability to cope with all our feelings, especially the uncomfortable ones.\"</p><p>One of the bastions of toxic positivity is the workplace. \"If you open up at the office, you could risk losing face with those in power, you could risk losing your job,\" Quintero says. That said, the workplace is ripe for disruption. According to Long, recent research shows that when leaders don't embrace vulnerability, it leads to more silence and less risk-taking - not ideal for increasing productivity and satisfaction. And, yes, authenticity and vulnerability have to come from the top: \"If the leaders aren't modelling that, their employees won't,\" she says.</p><p>You can always blame Silicon Valley, whose \"yes culture\" has gone global, Greene says. \"Employment is generally so unstable, everyone has become obsessed with positivity as a way to survive.\" But a culture of consensus isn't necessarily best, as it prevents critical thinking. \"Conflict can be constructive,\" she says. The good news is that, according to Greene, \"millennial talent is not buying the big-tech work culture. We've been sold on sloganeering for a long time, but people are starting to call BS on it. Young people are taking a much more critical view.\"</p><p>Yup, the kids will save us. Greene foresees a gen-Z exodus from Instagram in order to protect their mental health. Their feeds are already full of candour. \"They're 10 times more honest than me,\" Curtis says. \"For them, social media is just an extension of who they are, it's not a mask,\" unlike those who had social media \"imposed\" on them. Long states that the only resistance she has received has been from baby-boomers, who \"feel this is overly indulgent and we should just tough it out\". It's their loss. \"Discomfort is the price of admission to the meaning of life,\" David says. \"Only once we've accepted our discomfort can true human change really happen.\" Go on, dare you.</p><p>                   How to be less TP                   </p><p>\u25cf Don't expect absolute happiness - it's more likely to be found in daily micro-experiences such as a hug.</p><p>\u25cf Own your emotions.

In the 2020s, that feeling vanished. The decline of the Chinese economy delegitimized the authoritarian model. It turns out you can't run a centrally controlled economy without a lot of waste, corruption and riot police.</p><p> Meanwhile, the American political system began to work better. The GOP re-emerged under Josh Hawley and Marco Rubio as a better version of a working-class party \u2014 socially right, economically left. Democrats remained dominant through the decade. Their party's biggest accomplishment was in foreign affairs \u2014 the repair of America's alliances and the restoration of global American leadership.</p><p> Americans were more collaborative in the 2020s.

As the former Republican consultant Mike Murphy had noticed, there were roughly 300 state and federal elections during the Trump years and Republicans did horribly in most of them. The 2020 vote was a continuation of that trend. Trump's landslide defeat left him humiliated, and the Republicans lost their Senate majority.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Trump cried fraud and tried to whip up his followers, but they turned their backs. He went from idol to scapegoat in an instant. It seemed they could forgive him everything but losing. Many temporarily retreated from political life, the way evangelical Christians did after the ignominy of the Scopes trial.</p><p> President Joe Biden faced an interesting dynamic in his party. The political power was with moderates. The intellectual power was with the left. People of color, whose views were largely more moderate, became the crucial swing faction.</p><p> As president, Biden resisted the interest groups that wanted him to address health care first. Instead, he did child and earned-income tax credits, infrastructure, expanded early childhood education, expanded prison reform, and so on \u2014 what some writers called \"reparations by any other name.\" He gave regulatory czar Elizabeth Warren a special portfolio to take on Big Tech.</p><p> The major events of the decade were cultural, not political. The Trump era had witnessed a crisis of connection at the bottom of society and a crisis of authority at the top. Social repair was the top order of the day once a new president took office.</p><p> The first whiff of the cultural restoration was the \"Accountability Clubs\" that spread across the nation's campuses. College students realized that America stinks at accountability. Either there is no accountability (Wall Street after the financial crisis) or people have their lives destroyed for a \"problematic\" tweet.</p><p> The Accountability Clubs bore the motto \"Truth and Mercy.\" Students wanted to restore a culture in which facts mattered. They were also searching for a way to judge others in a graduated and humane manner, allowing for repentance, forgiveness and restoration. Marshall McLuhan once remarked that \"moral indignation is a technique used to endow an idiot with dignity.\" Suddenly indignation, the keystone emotion of the Trump years, was lame. Empathy made a comeback.</p><p> The second cultural trend of the decade was the rise of the urban church. Suburban megachurch attendance fell, because the pastors had disgraced themselves under Trump. But suddenly there was a surge in church plants in places like Brooklyn, Washington, D.C., Chicago and San Francisco, as highly educated people found homes for their spiritual longings.</p><p> The churches were liturgically highly charismatic (Bethel music) and highly universalistic and intellectual (Richard Rohr). Their politics were an odd mix \u2014 pro-LGBTQ, pro-life, active on climate change, pro-animal rights (one of the signature moral causes of the decade). The religious left gained on the religious right.</p><p> At the same time, the racial justice conversation went intimate. America is involved in a multigenerational process of truth and reconciliation. In the teens, the truth-telling had generally revolved around historic events \u2014 slavery, lynching, redlining. In the 2020s, a series of writers, artists and directors gave us vivid descriptions of the subtleties of contemporary black life.</p><p> The profusion of video streaming networks allowed a new generation of artists to take audiences inside the psychological lives of people of color. These artists realized that structural change would happen when people learned to see one another whole.</p><p> The most important cultural change came to be known as the Civic Renaissance. During the first two decades of the century, hundreds of thousands of new civic organizations came into being \u2014 healing political divides, fighting homelessness, promoting social mobility and weaving communities. But these organizations were small. They did not grow into the big national chapter-based structures that had repaired America's social fabric a century earlier \u2014 the YMCA, the Rotary, the Boy Scouts.</p><p> By the 2020s, philanthropists and community builders realized the only way to change culture and weave the social fabric was by creating an AFL-CIO of civil society, with big national voices and large, decentralized national organizations so that people across America had easy and practical pathways to get involved in community revival.</p><p> In the 2010s, it seemed like the liberal order was cracking up. In the 2020s, that feeling vanished. The decline of the Chinese economy delegitimized the authoritarian model. It turns out you can't run a centrally controlled economy without a lot of waste, corruption and riot police.</p><p> Meanwhile, the American political system began to work better. The GOP re-emerged under Josh Hawley and Marco Rubio as a better version of a working-class party \u2014 socially right, economically left. Democrats remained dominant through the decade. Their party's biggest accomplishment was in foreign affairs \u2014 the repair of America's alliances and the restoration of global American leadership.</p><p> Americans were more collaborative in the 2020s. And the New York Mets won the World Series every single year.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKAZ-ac9de892de25c06ebfe8e0fcb27dd498fa5e4ec7</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F289A7BAD811C78 NWBKAZ2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XX6-CXK1-DXVP-V53W-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">399536</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"893\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Sierra Vista Herald<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

Instead, he did child and earned-income tax credits, infrastructure, expanded early childhood education, expanded prison reform, and so on - what some writers called \"reparations by any other name.\" He gave regulatory czar Elizabeth Warren a special portfolio to take on Big Tech.</p><p>The major events of the decade were cultural, not political. The Trump era had witnessed a crisis of connection at the bottom of society and a crisis of authority at the top. Social repair was the top order of the day once a new president took office.</p><p>The first whiff of the cultural restoration was the \"Accountability Clubs\" that spread across the nation's campuses. College students realized that America stinks at accountability. Either there is no accountability (Wall Street after the financial crisis) or people have their lives destroyed for a \"problematic\" tweet.</p><p>The Accountability Clubs bore the motto \"Truth and Mercy.\" Students wanted to restore a culture in which facts mattered. They were also searching for a way to judge others in a graduated and humane manner, allowing for repentance, forgiveness and restoration. Marshall McLuhan once remarked that \"moral indignation is a technique used to endow an idiot with dignity.\" Suddenly indignation, the keystone emotion of the Trump years, was lame. Empathy made a comeback.</p><p>The second cultural trend of the decade was the rise of the urban church. Suburban megachurch attendance fell, because the pastors had disgraced themselves under Trump. But suddenly there was a surge in church plants in places like Brooklyn, Washington, D.C., Chicago and San Francisco, as highly educated people found homes for their spiritual longings.</p><p>The churches were liturgically highly charismatic (Bethel music) and highly universalistic and intellectual (Richard Rohr). Their politics were an odd mix - pro-L.G.B.T.Q., pro-life, active on climate change, pro-animal rights (one of the signature moral causes of the decade). The religious left gained on the religious right.</p><p>At the same time, the racial justice conversation went intimate. America is involved in a multigenerational process of truth and reconciliation. In the teens, the truth-telling had generally revolved around historic events - slavery, lynching, redlining. In the 2020s, a series of writers, artists and directors gave us vivid descriptions of the subtleties of contemporary black life.</p><p>The profusion of video streaming networks allowed a new generation of artists to take audiences inside the psychological lives of people of color. These artists realized that structural change would happen when people learned to see one another whole.</p><p>The most important cultural change came to be known as the Civic Renaissance. During the first two decades of the century, hundreds of thousands of new civic organizations came into being - healing political divides, fighting homelessness, promoting social mobility and weaving communities. But these organizations were small. They did not grow into the big national chapter-based structures that had repaired America's social fabric a century earlier - the Y.M.C.A., the Rotary, the Boy Scouts.</p><p>By the 2020s, philanthropists and community builders realized the only way to change culture and weave the social fabric was by creating an A.F.L.-C.I.O. of civil society, with big national voices and large, decentralized national organizations so that people across America had easy and practical pathways to get involved in community revival.</p><p>In the 2010s, it seemed like the liberal order was cracking up. In the 2020s, that feeling vanished. The decline of the Chinese economy delegitimized the authoritarian model. It turns out you can't run a centrally controlled economy without a lot of waste, corruption and riot police.</p><p>Meanwhile, the American political system began to work better. The G.O.P. re-emerged under Josh Hawley and Marco Rubio as a better version of a working-class party - socially right, economically left. Democrats remained dominant through the decade. Their party's biggest accomplishment was in foreign affairs - the repair of America's alliances and the restoration of global American leadership.</p><p>Americans were more collaborative in the 2020s.

As the former Republican consultant Mike Murphy had noticed, there were roughly 300 state and federal elections during the Trump years and Republicans did horribly in most of them. The 2020 vote was a continuation of that trend. Trump\u2019s landslide defeat left him humiliated, and the Republicans lost their Senate majority.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Trump cried fraud and tried to whip up his followers, but they turned their backs. He went from idol to scapegoat in an instant. It seemed they could forgive him everything but losing. Many temporarily retreated from political life, the way evangelical Christians did after the ignominy of the Scopes trial.</p><p>President Joe Biden faced an interesting dynamic in his party. The political power was with moderates. The intellectual power was with the left. People of color, whose views were largely more moderate, became the crucial swing faction. </p><p>As president, Biden resisted the interest groups that wanted him to address health care first. Instead, he did child and earned-income tax credits, infrastructure, expanded early childhood education, expanded prison reform, and so on \u2014 what some writers called \u201creparations by any other name.\u201d He gave regulatory czar Elizabeth Warren a special portfolio to take on Big Tech.</p><p>The major events of the decade were cultural, not political.

My name is Neil Chatfield. As Chairman it's my great pleasure to welcome shareholders to the 2020 Annual General Meeting of Aristocrat Leisure Limited being held here at our offices in North Ryde.</p><p>I'd like to take the opportunity to acknowledge the traditional owners of the land on which we meet today, the Wattamattagal clan or people and pay my respects to elders past and present. I welcome the shareholders who are in attendance today and hope that you have had an opportunity to explore our showroom, which displays some of our latest products and technology. I'd also encourage you to speak with some of our passionate Aristocrat team members at the conclusion of the meeting. I'd also like to extend a warm welcome to those attending this meeting by way of webcast and to visitors. Might I now request that all mobile phones be turned off? I'll give you time to turn off your phones, please.</p><p>Well done. Thank you. For your safety, I'd like to draw to your attention the emergency exits. They're located at the right -- when you're exiting this room, and should an emergency arise, which requires an evacuation, staff will be on hand to assist you.</p><p>Turning to the agenda for today's meeting. I note that it's now past 11 a.m. and that this is a properly constituted meeting. As a quorum for the general meeting is present, I formally declare the 2020 Annual General Meeting open. The notice of meeting has previously been distributed, and we will take it as read.</p><p>I'd like to thank those shareholders who submitted questions ahead of the meeting, and where possible, of course, we've responded directly to those questions. And I'd like to remind you that this meeting is also being webcast so that all shareholders have an opportunity to watch the proceedings.</p><p>Let me now introduce you to the people on the stage with me this morning. Directly to my left is Richard Bell, Corporate General Counsel and Company Secretary. Next to Richard is Trevor Croker, the Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director. Next to Trevor is Pat Ramsey, who is the Chair of the Regulatory and Compliance Committee and a member of the Board Audit Committee. Next to Pat is Kathleen Conlon, Chair of the People and Culture Committee and a member of the Board Audit Committee. Next to Kathleen is Philippe Etienne, a member of the Regulatory and Compliance Committee and People and Culture Committee. Next to, if I can see down there, next to Philippe is Arlene Tansey, Chair of the Board Audit Committee and a member of the Regulatory and Compliance Committee. Next to Arlene is Sylvia Summers Couder, member of the Board Audit Committee and People and Culture Committee. Next to Sylvia is Steve Morro, who, as you know, will be retiring at the conclusion of this meeting. Steve is our lead U.S. Director and a member of the Regulatory and Compliance Committee and of the People and Culture Committee. Information about the Directors is set out in the 2020 annual report.</p><p>We also welcome Matt Graham. Matt, you might just acknowledge yourself there. And his colleagues from PricewaterhouseCoopers, the company's auditors. Matt is available to answer any questions regarding the audit of the financial statements.</p><p>Before I move to the resolutions to be considered today, together with Trevor, I would like to provide some commentary on the strategy, operations and financial results of the company.</p><p>Fellow shareholders, I'm pleased to report that Aristocrat delivered a strong performance over the 2019 fiscal year, further extending the business' trajectory of consistent and high-quality profitable growth, with record NPATA of over $894 million. NPATA refers to net profit after tax before acquired amortization. Group revenue increased almost 23% in reported terms and 14% in constant currency terms to a fresh all-time high of $4.4 billion. This performance was driven by continued strong operational momentum across both the land-based and digital businesses. Aristocrat's key Americas, ANZ and digital operations all grew off the back of increased and targeted investment in competitive product portfolios, particularly in terms of design and development and marketing and user acquisition in our digital business.</p><p>Aristocrat strong cash flows, capacity to fund investment and further growth and continued reduced gearing levels were all evident in fiscal 2019. Operating cash flow exceeded $1 billion for the first time. Net gearing reduced to 1.4x at 30th of September 2019, compared to 2.2x at the commencement -- at the announcement of the Big Fish acquisition back in November 2017.</p><p>This momentum allowed us to deliver another significant lift in earnings per share, reflected in a 22% increase in total dividend for the year to 56% per share fully franked consistent with our commitment to progressively grow dividends over time.</p><p>Over the course of the year, shareholders will be aware that the Board also continued to implement an orderly renewal process with the appointment of Philippe Etienne as a nonexecutive director. Shareholders will be asked to formally approve his appointment later in the meeting. Philippe is a seasoned international business leader with extensive experience as a company director. His strategic and technology skills and international perspectives are particularly valuable to our deliberations, and we are delighted to add an individual of his caliber to the Board. Philippe will address the meeting later in relation to his own election.</p><p>In addition, after more than a decade of service as a nonexecutive director, Steve Morro will retire at the conclusion of today's meeting. Steve has made an outstanding contribution to both the Board and the business, including through its turnaround years and subsequent growth. I'd like to invite shareholders to join me in thanking Steve for his enormous contribution.</p><p>Steve has brought deep U.S. market and global gaming industry expertise to the Board, which we have greatly valued. I'm particularly pleased, therefore, that Steve has formally agreed to continue his long association with Aristocrat post his retirement as a nonexecutive director as an adviser to management.</p><p>Following Steve's retirement, Pat Ramsey will assume the role of Lead U.S. Director and the Board is prioritizing the recruitment of a further U.S.-based Director in the coming period. During 2019, the Board also continued a regular -- a program of regular face-to-face engagement with Aristocrat's global employee base and also met with a broad range of customers in various jurisdictions. This program helps ensure that directors received direct feedback and are able to maintain effective oversight over the business' culture and customer-centricity.</p><p>Over the course of the year, Aristocrat significantly expanded its sustainability disclosures, consistent with the company's values, focus on long term and our commitment to transparency. Building on progress in the prior year, further disclosures were published on the group's website at the end of November 2019. In addition to updating and expanding content on relevant topics such as responsible gameplay, employee engagement -- and employee engagement, the business also reported for the first time on topics such as energy and environment, community and ethical sourcing, among other things.</p><p>Examples of initiatives undertaken during the year included the third running of our peak leadership conference: learn, lead, achieve. This conference brought together around 150 of our leaders drawn from all parts of our business across the world to forge person-to-person links, participate in stretching development exercise -- sessions and align around Aristocrat's growth, strategy and potential.</p><p>I was very pleased to attend part of the conference and meet more of the outstanding talent we have across our increasingly global business, whilst also being impressed with the culture and drive our leadership -- of our leadership program. I'd also reference the work Aristocrat during the year to promote pathways for women in the industry, including through our strong support for global gaming women in the U.S. and women in gaming and hospitality in Australia. As a founding member of these organizations, we help deliver an expanding range of mentoring, education and networking opportunities for hundreds of future female leaders.</p><p>Another highlight was the awarding of the leadership in energy and environmental design accreditation to our new campus in Summerlin, Las Vegas. This reflected the extensive use of environmentally friendly materials throughout the site and its low carbon footprint.</p><p>These are just a few of the highlights of the progress we are making across our most important sustainability issues. Looking ahead, in 2020, Aristocrat is expected to be able to share more information on energy and diversity and inclusion, in line with the progress that we're making. We've also committed to developing a response to the recommendations of the task force on climate-related financial disclosures over the course of the year. I do encourage shareholders to review our sustainability disclosures, which can be found on our website, <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.aristocrat.com\">www.aristocrat.com</url>.</p><p>In summary, financial year 2019 was another highly successful and rewarding year at Aristocrat. A year on, from my first address to shareholders as Chairman, I've been -- I'm very happy to say I've been really gratified by what I've observed across the business over the past 12 months. Our team is united behind a shared mission to bring joy to life through the power of play. And we feel privileged to bring entertainment to millions of people around the world every day.</p><p>Our global team of more than 6,400 people is striving hard to serve our customers and deliver results, while also demonstrating a real commitment to learning and improving what we do. I wish to thank my Board colleagues, management and all the Aristocrat people, whose hard work and passion for our customers is reflected in the strong results that we're proud to deliver over the year.</p><p>Finally, I would like to thank you, our shareholders, for your ongoing interest and support.</p><p>And now it's my great pleasure now to pass to Trevor Croker, our CEO, who will provide further commentary on the 2019 financial year, the business strategy, priorities and our continued sustainability efforts over the coming period. Thank you.</p><p>TREVOR J. CROKER, CEO, MD &amp; DIRECTOR, ARISTOCRAT LEISURE LIMITED: Thank you, Neil, and welcome, everybody. Thank you for joining us here today. Today, I'll share a summary of our performance for the -- over the 2019 fiscal year and highlight our continued growth and reiterate our expectations for the 2020 full year.</p><p>Turning first to our 2019 performance. As Neil referenced, and as we shared at our full year results presentation in November, Aristocrat posted a record profit in fiscal 2019. NPATA grew 23% in reported terms and 14% in constant currency compared to the prior 12 months to 30th of September 2018. This result further extended our track record of share taking and organic growth and was driven by strong investment in talent, game content, user acquisition and retention, along with increasing broad and competitive product portfolios.</p><p>The business earnings base continued to diversify in 2019 with digital operations delivering over 40% of total group revenue during the year. Land-based gaming operations and outright sales each contributed another 30% of the total group revenue each. At the same time, we reached a significant threshold with more than 2/3 of total group revenue in fiscal 2019 being recurring in nature rather than one-off. Continued improvement in earnings diversity and stability is a feature of Aristocrat's strategy, and we made significant strides in this regard over the course of 2019.</p><p>Operating cash flow of over $1 billion was also generated in the period, and net gearing reduced to 1.4x at 30th of September 2019, down from 1.7x at the close of the prior fiscal period.</p><p>Our strong and flexible balance sheet remains -- means we continue to enjoy full optionality, including to invest organically and nonorganically to accelerate our strategy where prudent. Operational highlights of the year included a further lift in both share and yield in the land-based North American gaming operations business and further share growth across our key global outright sales markets.</p><p>In digital, the successful launch and scaling of Raid: Shadow Legends was an important milestone. This was our first foray into the high-growth collectible RPG genre, and the launch was significant, not only from a performance and portfolio perspective but also because of the insights gained, which we'll use to apply to future launches and genre-entry strategies.</p><p>In our land-based business, strong D&amp;D investment ensures we can continue to take share today, unlock adjacent opportunities for tomorrow and build new growth engines and optionality for the long term. Over the 2019 full year, Aristocrat lifted D&amp;D investment by 21% in absolute terms compared to 2018 to a fresh record of just over $500 million. This equates to 11.4% of revenue, which is aligned to the prior fiscal year and comfortably within the 11% to 12% range the business has allocated across recent years.</p><p>At the same time, we invested strongly in our user acquisition, or UA, to support growth in our digital business. UA investment of $328 million represented 26.2% of revenue. With the benefit of player and proprietary go-game tool and collaboration across the digital businesses, we also improved the quality and flexibility of UA allocation during 2019. As we reported in November, we now have a consistent and data-led approach with a strong focus on returns and readiness to invest significantly or to pull back wherever -- investment wherever prudent.</p><p>We also made further strides in implementing our digital growth strategy during the year. The pillars of outstanding game design talent, core digital skillsets, sharing of best practices, strong and disciplined marketing investment and operational rigor have many parallels to the proven approach in our land-based business.</p><p>At its heart, our digital strategy focused on our competitiveness and the things we can control to target sustained above-market growth. The appointment of Mike Lang, as CEO Digital in November 2019, was another important milestone in this regard. Throughout the year, we maintained a firm commitment to investing in innovation and leveraging our growing scale and capability to lift efficiency and create capacity for sustainable growth.</p><p>Throughout 2019, we also aggressively defended our IP assets across key markets, and we'll continue to take a proactive approach to protecting these core assets going forward. Turning now to an operational performance and key parts of the business in more detail, beginning with our land-based business.</p><p>During 2019, we bought together global -- we bought together Aristocrat's global land-based business under the leadership of Mitchell Bowen, CEO of Land-based and Chief Transformation Officer. This change is already unlocking benefits from closer operational and strategic alignment. In local currency, America's revenue increased over 14% and profit lifted more than 15% to almost $1.4 billion and over $750 million, respectively, during the fiscal 2019 period -- 2019 compared to the previous period.</p><p>North America EBITDA growth was driven by another outstanding performance in gaming operations, with 9% growth to 48,000 units for the year and a modest lift in our combined average fee per day, driven by excellent game performance and floor optimization strategies. Performance was fueled by continued penetration of the market-leading titles across top-performing cabinets, including the successful launch of the EdgeX and MarsX cabinets during the year.</p><p>In Class III outright sales, revenue increased 22%, and platforms increased 30% compared to 2018. We achieved further share growth in a competitive market off the back of a stronger and broader product portfolio. Penetration of attractive North American adjacencies, including the VLT and Washington CDS markets, supports this result.</p><p>In Class II gaming operations, placements grew almost 4% due to the penetration of Ovation video product and the maintenance of our mechanical real footprint. Aristocrat continued to receive outstanding customer feedback in North America, consistently ranking as the leading gaming equipment supplier across a number of key casino customer surveys. And for the sixth year in a row, Aristocrat was named top land-based supplier at the G2E Trade Show in Las Vegas.</p><p>Similarly, a record profit result in ANZ demonstrated our success in maintaining our market-leading share position even as market share return to more typical levels over the course of fiscal 2019. ANZ profit increased almost 3%, and revenue increased fractionally to over $213 million and $455 million, respectively, compared to 2018.</p><p>Average selling price improved slightly, driven by improved -- driven by positive mix and sales of the Helix+ and Helix XT family of cabinets. Segment profit margins increased 120 basis points to 46.8%, up from 45.6% in the prior fiscal year. This was driven by favorable commercial mix towards recurring revenue. We continue to focus on customer-centric improvements to our systems, processes and culture and ANZ, reflecting our deep commitment to this market.</p><p>International Class III revenue and profit decreased 7% and 13%, respectively, to $195 million and $90 million compared to the fiscal 2018 result. A decline in Asia-Pacific was partly offset by further growth in EMEA, with the recurring revenue installed base in this region growing almost 23% over the 12 months to 30th of September 2019. In Asia-Pacific, Helix+ continued to be the primary for-sale cabinet with key titles propelling strong underlying performance across the region.</p><p>I'll now turn to share some operational highlights from our digital business. On a combined basis, our digital businesses generated $1.2 billion in bookings during fiscal 2019, delivering a lift of 12% in segment profit to $370 million. Revenue grew 24% off the back of full period impact of the Plarium and Big Fish acquisitions, together with the scaling of key titles such as Lightning Link, continued performance from Jackpot Magic Slots, Raid and the contribution of new games.</p><p>Segment margins moderated to 29.6% in line with expectations, reflecting growth in lower-margin, social-casual games, targeted investment in the development of new features and live ops and social casino and increased marketing investment behind the successful global launch and scaling of Raid.</p><p>As I mentioned, we prioritized resources and increased our efficiency of our investment in UA by implementing a common platform management tool during fiscal 2019. We also made more of low-cost development jurisdictions and applied proven-content mechanics and features across the portfolio, particularly in Social Casino. The casual games pipeline was refocused towards segments where we have strong capabilities, while also broadening our portfolio and experience with the successful launch of Raid, as previously noted, and the launch of Toy Story Drop! in partnership with Disney Pixar.</p><p>In addition to new game launches, established and evergreen titles were refreshed with content, live ops and features to enhance game experience and profitability. Total portfolio strength and diversity also improved during the 2019 fiscal year with a close-to-even pro forma split in bookings contribution between Social Casino and casual game genres, while overall bookings grew. The number of game titles delivering more than $50 million in bookings also grew with the contribution of Raid and further growth in Lightning Link. Total daily active users or DAUs at 30th of September 2019, moderated to $7.5 million from $8.5 million in the PCP. However, average daily bookings per active user, or ABPDAU, increased from fractionally from $0.40 to $0.41 over the same period, reflecting our focus on DAU quality and building long-term engagement.</p><p>Before turning now to outlook for the 2020 fiscal year, I'd like to comment briefly on the COVID-19 virus issue. Aristocrat has no direct operations in Mainland China and relatively small exposure to the Asian region, generally. However, we have been monitoring -- closely monitoring developments with focus on our people, customers and supply chain. We have temporarily suspended travel in the region and are supporting our staff in Macau and in Hong Kong. We're also proactively monitoring and managing potential supply chain impacts. At this stage, we do not see any material adverse impacts on our business, but we'll keep the market updated as appropriate.</p><p>In terms of the outlook, we reiterate our guidance provided in November 2019, that is, we expect continued growth over the 2020 fiscal year, driven by the following: In land-based outright sales, we anticipate further incremental gains in attractive North American adjacencies. We expect to maintain market-leading share positions across key for-sale segments globally. In land-based gaming operations, we expect continued expansion across our total gaming operations installed base, leveraging our broadening portfolio while maintaining market-leading average fee per day performance across the overall combined installed base.</p><p>Aristocrat's digital. We anticipate further growth in digital bookings supported by scaling of recently released new games. User acquisition spend will continue to be allocated dynamically based on game performance, and we expect to remain between 20% and 25% of overall digital revenues. We expect the changes in our group structure to start to generate cash tax savings, which will further enhance the group's ability to invest to sustain our growth momentum and create value for shareholders. We anticipate continuing to lift D&amp;D investment across our land-based and digital portfolio in absolute dollar terms while remaining broadly in line with the prior years from a percentage-of-revenue perspective. And we expect a moderate increase in SG&amp;A across the business as we invest in digital, data and transformational skillsets for growth.</p><p>In summary, fiscal 2019 was another year of high-quality profit growth across Aristocrat, consistent with our long-term strategy. Operating performance drove strong free cash flow generation, which was in turn invested to fund further growth and pay progressive dividends and provide significant balance sheet optionality for the future.</p><p>Before concluding, I'd like to make a brief mention of the terrible ongoing drought and fires that have affected so many in the Australian community over the recent months. Last November, Aristocrat donated $250,000 to bushfire and drought relief in partnerships with Clubs New South Wales, a key customer group that represents over 1,200 local clubs in our largest Australian market. Aristocrat employees also donated funds to food bank and the Country Women's Association with Aristocrat making further contributions to both charities in recognition of our own people's generosity.</p><p>Our Australian business has taken a range of steps to support affected staff members, including paid leave to fight fires, the provision of counseling services as well as providing support to our customers. We all recognize that this recovery will be long-term -- will be a long-term process, and our business is committed to continuing to contribute to this effort as part of this community.</p><p>As the Chairman mentioned, our business is increasingly focused on long-term sustainability. During 2019, we leveraged our internal innovation platform, thinkBIGGER, to unearth a number of practical ideas to lessen our environmental footprint. We also stepped up our education and action across a range of issues material to our business, such as promoting responsible gameplay and improving diversity and inclusion. Striving to be a leader in responsible gameplay is something that we regard as a core obligation of our business.</p><p>During the year, we launched a refreshed group-wide responsible gameplay policy to guide our efforts and made early progress on a range of initiatives. We continue to engage with research and treatment organizations, policymakers, regulators, customers and other stakeholders to learn more about these complex issues and further improve what we do.</p><p>I'm proud of our team who continue to embrace the opportunity to be thought leaders in responsibility and engaging fact-based dialogue with our customers, industry and regulators. The passion our people have on these issues is reflected in the employee business-led nature of our sustainability effort at Aristocrat, which I believe positions us well to continue our journey in the years ahead.</p><p>This also brings me to the ongoing focus on our people during fiscal 2019. Aristocrat expanded our efforts to recruit and more diverse -- a more diverse and first-class talent pool, including through strengthening our graduate intake program in major markets. We also made further investments in building leadership capability and launched a range of initiatives to improve our employee experience. I do want to acknowledge our exceptional team of over 6,400 Aristocrat people around the world as well as the strong support of the Chairman and the Board, which is again being key to the progress and performance delivered over the financial year.</p><p>Before closing, I also want to take the opportunity to acknowledge our customers who we partnership -- whose partnership we will never take for granted. We're highly focused on bringing more value options and performance to our customers and to players and to putting their perspectives in the heart of everything we do. Finally, thank you to our shareholders. I want to assure you that everyone at Aristocrat is fully focused on delivering high-quality growth and sustained performance you rightly expect from us. Thank you.</p><p>NEIL GREGORY CHATFIELD: Thank you so much, Trevor. I'd like now to turn to the formal business of the meeting. Firstly, there are a number of procedural matters to which I'd like to draw your attention. This is a shareholders' meeting. Only shareholders -- only holders of the company's securities, their attorneys, proxies and authorized company representatives are entitled to vote and speak at this meeting. Cards have been issued to each attendee and only those holding blue shareholder voting cards are entitled to vote and ask questions. If you are here as a proxy and have been instructed how to vote, I do ask that you ensure that any vote you cast is in accordance with those instructions.</p><p>We will be conducting a poll on each item of business requiring a vote. And after each -- after discussion on each resolution that requires a vote, we will display proxies on the screen behind me. I now declare a poll open on resolutions 1 to 8 so that shareholders who are unable to stay for the full meeting can vote any time.</p><p>For shareholders with blue voting cards, the voting boxes are on the back of your card. If you do require any assistance completing your voting card, representatives of our share registry, Boardroom, are here to assist. Boardroom is appointed to act as scrutineers. And [Lucas Jones] is appointed as a returning officer for the purposes of the poll.</p><p>For those shareholders who do need to leave the meeting earlier today, completed blue voting cards can at any time during the meeting be placed in the ballot boxes being held by staff of Boardroom at the door where you entered the meeting. I'm holding open proxies in my capacity as Chairman, and it is my intention to vote all available undirected proxies in favor of each resolution.</p><p>I'd like now to move to the business of the meeting. If you would like to ask a question, would you please indicate to one of the attendants who will direct you to 1 of the 2 microphones that we have in the front here. I'd like you to open your question with your name and representation if any. And I will give shareholders a reasonable opportunity to ask questions and make comments. However, I would ask that speakers restrict themselves to no more than 2 questions per resolution and ensure that those questions are related to the matters concerning that resolution. Once you ask your 2 questions, I'd then like you to take your seat, in the interest of respect for everybody else in the meeting.</p><p>So the first item of business is to receive and consider the financial statements for the 12 months ended 30th of September 2019 and the reports of the directors and auditor. Please note that no vote is required on this item of business.</p><p>At this stage, I would be pleased to take any comments or questions you may have in relation to the audit, the financial report and the director's report in relation to Trevor's address or mine. Any questions in relation to today's resolutions, including Director and Executive remuneration, policies will be considered when we come to that specific resolution.</p><p>I'll now open the floor for questions and discussion. I'd point out that questions should be directed to me as chair of the meeting. Are there any questions?</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>CAROL LIMMER: Yes. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. My name is Carol Limmer, and I represent the Australian Shareholders Association. As their representative, I have 110,000 proxy votes from 43 proxy holders.</p><p>NEIL GREGORY CHATFIELD: Welcome.</p><p>CAROL LIMMER: One statement and one question. I commend the company on a very sound financial outcome and the continuing success in your digital environment. And I'd like to acknowledge a few things. One is that there's now a policy for nonexecutive directors to accumulate a minimum shareholding in Aristocrat that you have a 50% female representation on the Board. And I guess to -- and Pat because of the numerous -- over 300 jurisdictions in which you operate, you are conscious of governance, risk and compliance. And likewise, I understand culture is an important aspect for you. And I note from your comments and those of the CEO that building on progress made in 2018, further sustainability disclosures were published on your website that you've notified that in addition to updating, expanding existing content on topics such as responsible gameplay and employee relations, you also reported for the first time on topics such as energy and environment, including climate-related issues, community and society and ethical sourcing. I understand also that increased reporting is expected to be -- able to be included on energy and diversity inclusion in the next year. So thank you for that.</p><p>My question is that in relation to the majority of jurisdictions in which you operate, and also, particularly the fact that the majority of your revenue is sourced from the Americas, and there's a gradually increasing shareholder base overseas, what are your current intentions of where Aristocrat will list in the future?</p><p>NEIL GREGORY CHATFIELD: Well, thank you, first of all, for your comments. I think my observation around some of the sustainability work is that the organization had been doing a tremendous amount of work over a number of years. And what we needed to do was just further extend that by telling people about it, actually. So I'm really pleased that we've been able to get all the information together and be able to present it. This company is a lot about transparency, and we know that both external stakeholders and internal stakeholders, for that matter, really care about some of these issues and -- as do we. So I appreciate the comments.</p><p>In relation to the listing of the company. You're right, we do from time to time, and we now have a regular item on our Board work plan that goes to the same question. At this stage, though, we don't think that it's necessarily in the shareholders' best interest, and that will always be the measure, is a move in the shareholders' best interest. And at this stage, we don't believe that it's so compelling that we should really investigate, and it would be a very costly exercise. And -- but having said that, in the spirit of ensuring that we don't miss an opportunity to add value to shareholders, we will continue to look at that issue. So thanks for your question.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED SHAREHOLDER: (inaudible), I am a shareholder. I am surprised why you closed the toilet here. With all the shareholders, they have to go to other buildings. My wife has MS. She wet herself to go -- while she go to other building to do wee for herself. Why you closed the toilet here?</p><p>NEIL GREGORY CHATFIELD: Yes. Thank you. Let me firstly apologize. We're the victim of a -- of some delayed works, and we were assured that the works would be completed in time for this meeting. And one of the results is, I think we've arranged for toilet facilities just very close by. But yes, I agree. It's unacceptable. And I apologize for that.</p><p>Are there any further questions? Ma'am?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED SHAREHOLDER: I'm a proxy here today. My name is [Sonia], and I'm a mother of a son who has fallen victim to the trickery of the machines you make. My son is attempted to kill himself twice. On one occasion, he was airlifted to the Westmead Hospital and ended up on life support. Fortunately, he survived. A few months later, he slashed his wrists. He felt the only way to escape the control of these machines have over him was to end his life. My son, I know for a fact, is not the only person. There are many others like him.</p><p>So I guess my question to the Board is, what are you doing to ensure that you minimize the harm to the players? You advertise your machines, you promote your machines as entertainment. They are far from entertainment for many, many people. Tens of thousands of ordinary Australians do not view these machines as entertainment. And the facts speak for themselves. Over $6.5 billion in New South Wales alone siphoned out of the community by your machines.</p><p>The other question I'd like to ask is, okay, I mean, if you got a business. You want to produce machines that are supposed to be entertaining. They're not. They're addictive. You do it deliberately to make sure they're addictive. Why do they have to be machines that are anything more than $1 a bit? Why can't the maximum bit be a dollar if it's genuinely for entertainment?</p><p>In my line of work, I know for a fact that most of the money that goes into that machine is people's wages. People come to me, they've just been paid. \"Sonia, please can I cash out some leave. I've just lost all my money. I've got no money to feed my family.\" I'm working closely or communicate regularly with the Liquor and Gaming Authority. My son has had counseling, life coaches, even gone to hypnosis trying to unhypnotize himself from your machines.</p><p>I literally live every day in hell not knowing is today the day he's going to end his life. And you are the ones that make the machines. Surely to goodness, you know, yes, I know you need to look after your customers. But don't you think you have a responsibility too to the players, the people that you're promoting these machines to as entertainment?</p><p>Come and live in my world for a day. You'll know exactly what I'm talking about. So please just consider what your machines are doing to people's lives. The trail of destruction. It's a fact. It's a fact that your machines have created a trail of destruction to human lives. It's great. You're making all this money. From what? From what? Destroying people's lives? Is that what we do for each other? Is that what we do to each other? Aren't we supposed to be caring for each other as human beings? Just think about what your machines are doing, and I can give you plenty of evidence. Not one thing I'm saying to you today is false. I can provide factual evidence that what I'm saying is true. And I have to live with it every day.</p><p>NEIL GREGORY CHATFIELD: Thank you, [Sonia], and you've given us a tragic story. And I have to say it's very brave of you to get up and make that comment. Let me, first of all acknowledge that there are clearly situations where people can be adversely affected by excessive gambling. And I think that's -- we understand that. The question is, what do we do about it? And this organization -- as I said during my introduction, this organization has been about being a market leader and being responsible in everything that we do.</p><p>I can tell you that -- and you've asked, what are the things that we do. We have this group of people that you see in front of you, who are actively involved in understanding these, what are very -- really complex issues. We have a -- it's against the backdrop of being more heavily regulated industry than I've ever seen before. So there's lots of issues.</p><p>We internally, though, have a dedicated responsible gameplay team. And their role is to keep this group and management and all of our creative people and everyone through the organization up to speed with these -- the issues. What I'd like to suggest is that I'd love you to meet a couple of those people who are here with us today. And we can point you in the direction that hopefully would give you some support.</p><p>So let me say, again, I -- it's tragic. And we've -- I think we've all had tragic circumstances in our lives. And your one is very, very tragic. So rest assured that this organization is about transparency. It's about trying to ensure that the millions of people who do enjoy the games can do so, but that we protect those who are likely or may fall into issues with excess.</p><p>So I'm very happy to introduce you personally to our people who are dedicated in this area.</p><p>STEPHEN MAYNE: Stephen Mayne, I'm a small shareholder. I asked last year about whether any of the directors had met with people who've had a lived experience of gambling harm. And the answers seem to be that most of them hadn't. I'm interested in hearing whether any steps have been taken over the past 12 months to actually sit down and talk to people like [Sonia] and [Barb Sinclair], who's also here today, who was here last year, who also had a son who's lost over $100,000 to poker machines. So have you in the remaining 12 months, have you taken the time to actually meet with people who've suffered direct-lived experience of gambling harm?</p><p>And a related question, the #1 book in the world on poker machine harm and addiction is a book by New York academic called Natasha Sch\u00c3\u00bcll, called Addiction by Design. I'm interested to hear if any of the directors have read it? You may just put your hand up if you've actually read Addiction by Design, by Natasha Sch\u00c3\u00bcll?</p><p>NEIL GREGORY CHATFIELD: Questions for me, please, Stephen?</p><p>STEPHEN MAYNE: And through you? Has anyone read it?</p><p>NEIL GREGORY CHATFIELD: So is that your 2 questions, Stephen?</p><p>STEPHEN MAYNE: Well, I've got a few more, but if...</p><p>NEIL GREGORY CHATFIELD: Well perhaps take a seat. And that's how I like to run it. So let's take the first question about the Board. And I don't want to just limit it to the Board. This is about Board and management. So it's those drivers, the drivers of the organization. So I think you made the comment that it was obvious that no one had met anybody or done any work last year. Well, let me tell you, that's not true for a start. But let's get it on the record right now.</p><p>So the answer to your question, have directors and management been introduced or had access to or understood some of the issues and the specific people? The answer is yes, all right. The next step is to recognize, and as I said, right from the outset, we acknowledge that there will be adverse consequences for some people who gamble excessively. But we're not experts. So we have people actually in the room who are trying to ensure that we're fed up as much information as we can get. We have -- and I personally with the CEO have spent time in -- at the University of Sydney in their Brain and Mind Centre where, in fact, they do have a clinic, a treatment clinic. And that gave us greater insight into this.</p><p>We've got organizations around the world that are addressing these sorts of issues and in the U.S. as well as in Australia. So we actively contribute to research. We work with our customers in order to help them, who, of course, are the ones that are facing the actual players. We work with our customers to support them in any way that we can possibly do within the construct of a heavily regulated industry.</p><p>So let me just say, we -- I can assure you, and more and more will be providing information. In fact, I would encourage you, if you haven't already done so, go to our website and look at videos that we're putting up now in terms of understanding how our machines work, right? Understanding about jackpots. Understanding about what are the odds and that sort of thing. So it's about ensuring that people have -- people who play our games or play in the industry -- and it's not just us, of course, people who play in the industry, have information that's freely available. And they have an opportunity to seek help if they need it. So that's what our commitment is. That's about sustainability of this organization long term, of course.</p><p>So I want to just assure you that we have an absolute commitment to being responsible in everything that we do and responsible gameplay, obviously, is a key platform.</p><p>In terms of the book, I read a couple of books actually. And I've heard an enormous amount of material. Actually, I haven't read this particular book, but I'll certainly get a copy.</p><p>Other questions? Yes, sure, sure, sure.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED SHAREHOLDER: Just curious to know that if you were to have machines or your machines were to become a maximum $1 bet, will that reduce the value of your machines?</p><p>NEIL GREGORY CHATFIELD: Sorry, reduce the value of our machine?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED SHAREHOLDER: So say, for example, you sell a machine for $5,000, for example. And if you make that machine that -- the maximum bet this machine can take is $1, is that going to now reduce the value of that machine?</p><p>NEIL GREGORY CHATFIELD: I'm not sure if there's direct correlation. But essentially, we can't unilaterally do anything, right? Sorry, you want to take the time to have a chat or what?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED SHAREHOLDER: So I was just really curious...</p><p>NEIL GREGORY CHATFIELD: We can't unilaterally change anything. We've got a whole process, and I'm happy for maybe Trevor to sort of talk afterwards to you about the process or our responsible gameplay people talk to you about the process of registering and having our games licensed. It's a very rigorous process. And it's not as easy to say, well, we'll just switch this button or do this. It's a much more complicated process. And of course, we're driven by customers, ultimately.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED SHAREHOLDER: With all due respect, and I don't mean to be rude to anybody, but it just seems to me that the customers' greed is prevailing here. We don't want machines with only maximum bet $1 because we won't make enough money out of it. Can I just ask another question to you, please? And that's in relation to what is Aristocrat actually doing to ensure that there's no tampering with your machines to deceive people that play those machines?</p><p>NEIL GREGORY CHATFIELD: Yes. I think I can give you assurance, but I'm -- again, I'd like to -- if you please speak to the responsible gameplay people.</p><p>Trevor, would you like to just -- because that's a clearly -- the security of our machines, the integrity is absolutely sort of going by legislation. So Trevor, maybe you can just have a chat?</p><p>TREVOR J. CROKER: Thank you. So the regulations -- it's a very strict regulatory regime. So right down to regulation by each jurisdiction and each game is licensed and approved in each jurisdiction. That requires independent verification by independent test labs, it implies approval by the regulated bodies against compliance to the standard as defined for each of those regions. So the gameplay standards are all set by the regulators. And then games that we put up are tested against those regulations and then independently approved -- independently recommended and then either approved or disapproved by the regulator against those standards. So when it comes down to security and tampering, because of the construction of the hardware and the machine itself, it is all secured and has to have various levels of security to even be approved in the first place. So those standards are set and measured by independent third parties and against regulations in the jurisdictions in which we produce product.</p><p>NEIL GREGORY CHATFIELD: Thank you, [Sonia].</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED SHAREHOLDER: I don't know if I'm allowed to ask -- just want to make one more comment if you don't mind, just in relation to your comment about some people falling victim. Can I say, it's not the minority, it's the majority? Again, I know for a fact, I work for a very large organization. I had -- I do know what most people earn between $800 to $1,000 a week is what the average Australian earns out there. And when you look at $6.5 billion pumped through poker machines, and I have no doubt in my mind, for my own knowledge, that most of that money is people's wages. So that in itself will tell you we're not talking about a minority, we're talking about a significant majority that have fallen victim. And all I ask is, please think about the machines.</p><p>I understand you're a business. I understand that you need to make money, but think of the consequences to the people that are playing the machines. You promote them and say, this is for entertainment. We want to make people happy. Have a fun day. It's far from fun for most of us.</p><p>NEIL GREGORY CHATFIELD: Thanks, [Sonia].</p><p>Other questions?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED SHAREHOLDER: My name is [Barb Sinclair]. And I'm a proxy voter. I'm also the mother of a son, who is addicted to poker machines. I have a letter for each of the Board members, which I'd really like to hand out if I could?</p><p>NEIL GREGORY CHATFIELD: If you just...</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED SHAREHOLDER: Do I give them it to you?</p><p>NEIL GREGORY CHATFIELD: Yes, if you want to take that? Thank you.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED SHAREHOLDER: My comment is that the harm minimization is the very most important thing. That's it, harm minimization. And if they weren't on every street corner, that would really lessen the effect -- the effects that they have on people with an addict -- on addicts, victims, yes.</p><p>NEIL GREGORY CHATFIELD: Thanks, [Barb]. And let me say it's very brave of you to sort of come forward with a personal story. I wanted to just make sure that we have a -- it's absolutely in our best interest. Everyone in this room that we have entertainment-based products. We have entertainment based -- in situations where we minimize any harm to people, we know. And as I've said a number of times already today, we acknowledge that some people are -- will suffer from adverse consequences from excessive or problem gambling.</p><p>Now we're about having a robust industry that people can enjoy themselves without having those kind of issues. And we work hard with -- in our interest -- selfishly, it's in our interest, but I think it's in everyone's interest that we do have a commitment to ensuring that whatever we do is very responsible. So thank you.</p><p>So Stephen, we're into your -- you've had your 2 questions on this resolution. Is it still on this resolution? Or do you want to move on to something else?</p><p>STEPHEN MAYNE: Yes, general business, if I can ask a couple of questions.</p><p>NEIL GREGORY CHATFIELD: Okay, okay. Go ahead, thanks.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED SHAREHOLDER: What's our current installed poker machine base in Australia? I've got one for Trevor.</p><p>NEIL GREGORY CHATFIELD: So I think we had this question last year -- well, it might not have been. I think the answer is -- and I've tried to find it myself, actually. The answer is that we cannot give you a definitive answer because we sell machines, once they go out, then they're moved around. They're out of action. They're traded for another manufacturer's machine. So the total number of machines is -- that's a number available from the regulator, I think, so we can certainly give you that. I think in our annual report, we talk about how many machines we've sold through the year. So that kind of gives you a sense. But if I gave you a number, I'd be making it up.</p><p>STEPHEN MAYNE: All right. I mean when you bought VGT, I think it was in 2014. You told the stock exchange they've got an installed base of 22,000. So you come up with a very specific number when you're doing an acquisition. I'm not asking for every last figure, even just a ballpark percentage figure. You're the market leader. Well, what's your market share in Australian installed poker machines?</p><p>NEIL GREGORY CHATFIELD: Being market leader, you'd expect us to be 50% or so.</p><p>STEPHEN MAYNE: 50%?</p><p>NEIL GREGORY CHATFIELD: Yes.</p><p>STEPHEN MAYNE: Okay. Roughly 50%. So of the $14 billion lost on Australian poker machines last year, probably about half of that was through our machines. So probably about $7 billion a year is being lost by Australian's gambling on our Aristocrat poker machines. We've got about 100,000 of the 200,000 in the world's most saturated poker machine market.</p><p>Is that right?</p><p>NEIL GREGORY CHATFIELD: Well, do your arithmetic.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED SHAREHOLDER: But you said you've got about 50% share. 50% of the revenue -- of the losses is $7 billion.</p><p>NEIL GREGORY CHATFIELD: I -- how would I know? And how would you know, frankly? But anyway.</p><p>STEPHEN MAYNE: Now there was a report on ABC the other week that there's a Clubs New South Wales Board paper that was leaked saying that 90 and it's about 90% of clubs in New South Wales, our partners on drought relief, are noncompliant with money laundering legislation.</p><p>Now I was wondering, are we comfortable with supplying small clubs run by volunteer boards with our highly addictive machines, which apparently are being used by drug dealers a lot to launder money. Are we comfortable dealing with these clubs, if 90% of them are noncompliant? And can someone explain to me -- can I hear from Trevor on this? Why in New South Wales do you need to be able to load up $7,500 of cash into a machine, which is the world's most sort of out-of-control machine? Whereas in South Australia recently, it was still only coin-operated. Now apparently, the $1 billion that's lost each year in Canberra, Bankstown and Fairfield, just 2 councils in Western Sydney, $1 billion a year, apparently quite a lot of that is money laundering. And everyone seems to know it, apparently. So do you have a view on that? Is that true? Is there lots of money laundering going on through our machines? And why do we design a machine where you can load up $7,500 of cash, which seems to be a welcome mat to drug dealers trying to wash their dirty money.</p><p>NEIL GREGORY CHATFIELD: Do you want to take it? Okay. Well, look, maybe you can give some light. Clearly, this is an AUSTRAC matter that we can't even begin to comment on. We don't know. Are we -- do we want to have partners that are responsible? Yes. Do we want to help partners who need help? Yes.</p><p>So Trevor, do you have any kind of insight. Because you've made some assertions, Stephen, that, frankly, go beyond where -- our involvement. So is there anything you want to add, Trevor? Or...</p><p>TREVOR J. CROKER: Thanks, Stephen. First of all, I mean, the industry is highly regulated. So people that have gaming machines have to go through -- privately, they have to go through various levels of approvals by regulators. So that's independent. That's -- we don't determine who our customers are. Our customers are determined by the various regulated bodies that allow them to provide alcohol as -- whatever to provide a license. So that is actually determined by the industry itself. So we provide product to those people that want to put product onto their floor and use it.</p><p>As far as the amount that can go into machine, again, we make to the standards of the market, and that is the standard and the regulatory standard required in New South Wales, and we make all of our games into the standards in the markets in which we participate. It's a highly regulated industry. The rules are set, and we make games to make sure we comply with all those regulations.</p><p>NEIL GREGORY CHATFIELD: Thank you. Well, let's move to the first of our resolutions. So today, we have 4 resolutions relating to Director: 3 reelection and 1 first-time election. So Resolution 1 is the reelection of Kathleen Conlon as a Director. Kathleen was nominated to be elected as a Director in the company in January 2014 and appointed effectively February 2014. Biographical details for Kathleen, including relevant qualification, skills and experience and other directorships are set out in the notice of meeting. Kathleen is the Chair of the People and Culture Committee and a member of the Audit Committee. Kathleen's reelection has the unanimous support of directors. Before I take any questions in relation to this resolution, I'd like to invite Kathleen to address the meeting. Thanks, Kathleen.</p><p>KATHLEEN MARIE CONLON, INDEPENDENT NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, ARISTOCRAT LEISURE LIMITED: Thank you, Chairman, and thank you, shareholders. I appreciate the opportunity to put myself forward for reelection. I've been on the Board as the Chairman for 6 years, which has been a very interesting 6 years in terms of -- we made the VGT acquisition, which allowed us to diversify in the United States. We've made the digital acquisitions, which have allowed us to diversify into new entertainment areas and have made me a little bit more cool with my children because I actually like playing these games. And I'm really excited about where we are in terms of being a global company, having some pretty amazing talent, having some of the best designers in the world and the ability to scale. So I really look forward to having the opportunity to continue to grow the business, as we expand what we do and become more and more digital and mobile. So thank you.</p><p>NEIL GREGORY CHATFIELD: Thanks, Kathleen. Is there any discussion in relation to this resolution? Please come forward if you have a question? Can I just ask any other questions at all? Okay. Sorry, Stephen.</p><p>STEPHEN MAYNE: Okay. So I'll be voting in favor of Kathleen's election, strictly wearing a shareholder hat. The stock has gone from $8 to $37 since the first of those acquisitions. They've been amazing acquisitions. So I think Aristocrat is now the second most valuable gaming company in the world after Las Vegas Sands. Is that right? The second most? It's worth more than Tabcorp, Crown and The Star combined. I mean, it's just been an amazing success story for shareholders. Now worth $24 billion. It's an amazing earner.</p><p>And Kathleen, you'll be the longest-serving Director with Stephen's retirement today. So you'll be the keeper of the Board's corporate knowledge. I'm keen to hear from you before we vote on you today about the journey that the Board has been on in terms of responsible gambling and product design and gambling harm.</p><p>We haven't heard, in my view, nearly enough from the chair or the CEO today about the elephant in the room, which is the addictive nature of our machines. Are they sustainable? When this company talks about sustainability, you need to talk about the sustainability of a gambler who loses everything. You need to talk about the sustainability of a market, Australia, where gamblers lose $25 billion, the worst in the world. Is that sustainable?</p><p>And New South Wales, here in Sydney, the highest gambling losses in the world per capita in this city. Is that sustainable?</p><p>And specifically, how have you, as a Director, been involved and been knowledgeable about our company's lobbying, very strong lobbying, particularly with Clubs New South Wales, to prevent any meaningful reform to reduce harm and make the machines less addictive to fight the $1 bets to refuse to supply Coles with $1 maximum bet machines, which they asked for during your term on the Board and your Board refused to supply Coles with a product they asked for. What other supplier refuses to give Coles what they want? You did that. This Board did that. Why did you do that? And why do you continue to do that when our products are addictive. We're being very irresponsible, and our business is not sustainable based on the enormous harm we're causing to gamblers.</p><p>NEIL GREGORY CHATFIELD: You asked that question through me, Stephen, of course. And you made a few comments before I did pass to Kathleen. You made a couple of comments about -- you've not really heard enough. You and I had an exchange -- an e-mail exchange, maybe 4 or 5 weeks ago and I offered at that point to meet with you subsequent to this meeting because we couldn't arrange it. So that offer is still open. I would very much contest the fact that we're not doing enough, and that you haven't heard enough.</p><p>As I said, we've -- and I don't want to get into a debate here. But we've got things on our website, such as videos. We've got a whole range of things that we're doing. And of course, your comment about sustainability is right. We need a vibrant industry for us to survive and thrive, right? So there's no question about that.</p><p>We totally reject any suggestion that leads -- the AGMs are deliberately addictive. We totally reject that. And we, in fact, know that that's not the case.</p><p>So in terms of your comment around an individual customer, who, as I understand, did request a review or a trial of a maximum bet, as you've described, this was sort of one customer. And as I described before, it's -- for us to unilaterally, even with one customer, make change that have -- would have to go through regulation and sort of a rich rigorous checking and would just be very difficult to do, right? So it's not to say that we're not responsive to our customers because we absolutely are. That particular customer obviously has now moved on for whatever reason.</p><p>But we wouldn't -- we have a great record of testing new aspects of machines in field as well, which Trevor, I think we're one of the only companies in the world that would actually do that. So it's absolutely -- I totally reject your proposition that we don't do enough or we don't do anything, which is the proposition that you're putting. So you might think that I'm a little bit passionate about this, Stephen, and I am because what I see every day is a group of people who absolutely are focused on sustainability of this business and being responsible in what we do.</p><p>So Kathleen, would you like to make some comments?</p><p>KATHLEEN MARIE CONLON: So in my time on this Board, and I might just by context, I was born in Nevada and actually grew up in a family of very responsible gamers. So that's been my experience with that. And I have talked to people in different situations as well. I think it's really important that as a company, we are, I think, leading the industry and really taking regulation and compliance seriously in every jurisdiction that we operate in. And Australia is only one of the many jurisdictions that we operate in.</p><p>I ask the question whenever I go into a customer, I ask them the question about what they're doing about responsibility gaming. I asked them just this week about what they're doing about AUSTRAC and ensuring that -- what they're doing to help people who are harmed. So that is something that I do think is really important.</p><p>If you look at other elements of what we do. There are, for instance, in the tribal, the -- all of the money that goes into gaming actually goes into the community to provide health care and education and those other things. So it's something that we as a Board talk about. We invest in. We work with our customers, but most important, we absolutely operate as high standard as possible in the regulatory environment. So as that regulatory environment shifts, which we do see it shift in different places at different times, we are there responding and we are there providing information and data and research, as Neil just talked about. So I do take it very seriously. And it's something that we continue to ask about on a regular basis.</p><p>NEIL GREGORY CHATFIELD: Thanks, Kathleen. So the proxy that you see in relation to this resolution as shown on the screen behind me. And I'll now move that Kathleen Conlon be reelected as a director.</p><p>So the resolution 2 is the reelection of Sylvia Summers Couder as a Director. Sylvia was nominated as a -- to be elected as a director of the company in August 2016 and appointed effective September 2016. Biographical details of Sylvia, including relevant qualifications, skills and experience and other directorships are set out in the notice of meeting. Sylvia is a member of the Audit Committee and the People and Culture Committee. Sylvia's appointment has the unanimous support of directors.</p><p>So before I take questions in relation of this resolution, I'd like to invite Sylvia to address the meeting. Thanks, Sylvia.</p><p>SYLVIA D. SUMMERS COUDER, INDEPENDENT NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, ARISTOCRAT LEISURE LIMITED: Thank you, Neil. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. So I joined the Board 3 years ago. And the company has changed track, I mean, drastically ever since. But I want to say a few words about something that you probably never hear. And that is, as the company was expanding in its market and growing into this new market, digital market, it did an incredible thing of investment on his people in sharing processes, which the aim was to improve time to market in respect to all those relations we're talking about, information systems, cybersecurity, quality and risk management.</p><p>And since my background is in technologies and systems, I focused heavily my attention on those things over the last 3 years. And as we created, launched the strategic risk committee, which, again, has a lot to do with the discussion we're having right now and other things, it moved to the full Board responsibility, and I'm part of those 2 committees we're talking about.</p><p>I believe in this company. I believe in the decency of the company, and I've heard what you said was very tragic, but I'm meeting with those people who really do believe in responsible gaming and doing the right thing for the world and for the company. And at the same time, because we travel a lot with customers, I'm meeting with all those people who are enjoying themselves and being responsible about gaming within their means. So I'm very touched by what you said, but I'm also proud of this company. Thank you.</p><p>NEIL GREGORY CHATFIELD: Thank you, Sylvia. Are there any discussion -- is there any discussion on this resolution?</p><p>[Sonia]?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED SHAREHOLDER: I appreciate what you're saying about your technology and what have you. My question is, with the machines and the support from Aristocrat wanting to make sure that we minimize harm, et cetera, is there any way that Aristocrat, being the biggest, largest so powerful, can be a little bit more forceful in things such as -- it's like we support regulations in place. We've got what's called the self-exclusion scheme, I'm sure you're aware of that.</p><p>I can honestly say in my own personal opinion, it's the greatest facade, the biggest joke that's ever been put out there. My son has excluded himself from hundreds of venues. He's actually gone past the limit. You can only do 35 at a time. I don't know why. And then he's gone past the absolute maximum to the point where the councilor has to ring and get it lifted so we can exclude himself more and more. Can I tell you these venues continually, not let him in, welcome him in? Offer him drinks. Have a chat to him. I have complained. For months and months and months, I'm in regular contact with the Liquor and Gaming Authority, reporting this to them over and over and over again. And very rarely, very rarely, is there any place that will do anything about it. In fact, reported again to Liquor and Gaming, my son was on a machine 1 day, I'll just give you an example, he's excluded from club. The security guard and the manager was standing close enough to him for him to hear what they had to say. The security guard says to the manager, \"This guy is excluded. Do I ask him to leave?\" \"Oh, no. leave him there for a while. He's all right.\" That's the response.</p><p>What is Aristocrat doing to put pressure to ensure that the integrity of the machines and what you say your business is all about is actually carried all the way through to the players? That people that have put their hand up and said, please exclude me? My son actually prepared a letter, he was that desperate. Prepared a letter, took photos of himself, shaved his beard, without a beard, the whole works. He's got tattoos. He's got tattoos on his face. It is impossible to miss my son, impossible. You'd have to look at him twice. How many people will have tattoos on each cheek, massive tattoos, neck, arm? You can't miss him. Yet, they want to tell me that they didn't notice him. Didn't notice him. And time and time and time again, he's allowed into venues. Yes. Who cares? Who cares? Or they'll stand there and watch him when he's lost all his money. \"Oh, excuse me, sir. You're excluded, you need to leave now.\" \"I've been standing here for the last hour pumping all out my money in. You didn't notice me. Only now you've noticed because I'm got no money left?\"</p><p>So what is Aristocrat doing to ensure that this so-called integrity is carried all the way through? I mean people put their hand up, like that letter that my son prepared, pleading with them, explaining to them, \"I've tried to kill myself twice.\" And he's explained to them, and he said, \"Please, I mean, my mother is all I've got left. My father's passed away, mom's all I've got left. Mom's almost lost her house.\"</p><p>I borrowed that much money on my home. I'm 58 years old in a couple of weeks' time. I've worked so damn hard, and I have to keep borrowing money because I'm scared that if I don't give my son money, he's going to commit a crime, which -- and what happens to a lot of people that fall victims your machine that commit crimes and end up in jail? I know that for a fact because at work we've caught people out stealing from the company to feed their gambling habit.</p><p>So it's not -- I'm making it all up in my imagination. I've borrowed tens of thousands of dollars. I'm pulling money out of my super to rescue my son every time. I'm on the verge of losing my house to try and help my son, and I get help from nobody. Everywhere I turn, I just get all these, \"Regulations, we're restricted by legislation, sorry.\" Where's the care factor. Where's the care factor?</p><p>Please. Think carefully. What else can you do? You're the biggest. You're powerful. You're making plenty of money. Surely, you can put a bit more pressure. Surely, you can have a bit more influence over the policymakers and consequences. When there's no consequences to the pubs and clubs, why would they care? \"Hey, come on in mate. No worries, you're welcome.\"</p><p>Please, can you do something?</p><p>NEIL GREGORY CHATFIELD: Thank you, [Sonia]. Thank you. Look, yes, can I just answer the -- I appreciate your comments. But I'd really encourage you to speak to our responsible gameplay people who can give you much more insight into what we're doing at the detail level?</p><p>Sir?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: My name is [John Daley]. I'm a shareholder. I understand the tragic circumstances you're going through, but I don't think it's the responsibility of Aristocrat to be placing what happens in clubs. It is a regulated body, the clubs and Clubs New South Wales, they have the authority to have these machines, and it's their responsibility to police who come into their clubs. I don't think Aristocrat have that responsibility. They sell a product. It's up to the user of the product to see that it's used correctly.</p><p>NEIL GREGORY CHATFIELD: Thank you. Thanks. Thanks for that comment, John. And technically, you're absolutely right. All right. However, it doesn't stop there. We live in an industry in a sector, if you like, where we need to we need to work with others to get the best outcomes for every participant. That includes the clubs and pubs, and that includes the people who participate in whatever they do in those clubs and pubs. You're right, but we also have a broader obligation, and they are the things that we're actually doing to fulfill that obligation. So thank you.</p><p>Stephen?</p><p>STEPHEN MAYNE: So to pick up on that. We proudly don't make any political donations at this company. But I think the way it works, if you're going to be brutally honest, is that we rely on the clubs and the pubs to do most of the heavy lifting for us. So the gambling industry has been giving about $3 million a year in the last few years to our duopoly, the labor duopoly in Australia. AHA, the most, Clubs New South Wales always big 6-figure numbers, and they're buying access, they're buying influence and they're keeping the political parties on sides, supporting the world's greatest per capita gambling losses.</p><p>Now it's all very well for us to say, we just follow the regulations. But you directly lobby to keep the regulations as slack as anywhere in the world. So in New South Wales before every election, Clubs New South Wales sits down with the liberal party and negotiates a memorandum of understanding, which prescribes machine design, issues which you're involved in, machine design. Maximum bets, jackpots all this stuff, in a written signed agreement that locks them into not changing a thing for the next 4 years.</p><p>You must be involved in that because they're getting into machine design arguments. No other industry negotiates the next 4 years' worth of taxes, regulations, product design before the election in a written agreement, and then banks a 6-figure check from the other party on the way through to help fund their campaign. It's disgraceful influencing and rent-seeking, cash for access, and I suspect the Board sits there and says, \"Oh, we don't know anything about this.\" It's just all the clubs and pubs, [Mr. Daley], it's all the clubs and pubs. We are a 50% supplier. $7.5 billion is being lost on our machines. We're a $24 billion company. We are the biggest single beneficiary of this regime. The biggest single beneficiary.</p><p>The Ainsworth family are worth $4 billion or $5 billion now. They still own more than 10% of this company worth close to $3 billion. It's been an influencing regime. Buying, accessing power, keeping the legislation, pro pokies and slaughtering the community, and I'd like to hear Sylvia, whether you're actually going to do something about it this year as a Director. Are you going to read Natasha Sch\u00c3\u00bcll's book? I mean I've got the Chairman telling me that he absolutely knows they're not made to be designed when the #1 academic in the world on this topic, who's written a whole book, explaining how they are designed to addict, and he hasn't even read the book.</p><p>So can you give us an undertaking you'll read the book, and you'll be informed, and you'll take this regulatory issue seriously, and the political influencing, which this company does in a massive scale, but using the pubs and clubs to do your dirty work for you?</p><p>NEIL GREGORY CHATFIELD: So Sylvia, and I think I'd like to just address the donation, please before Sylvia talks about having read it or not read a book. The -- it is true that we have -- we do not make political donations. It's also true, despite, I think, the inference you were making that we direct clubs or the Clubs New South Wales to do certain things. And that's not true. We don't direct. Our support of that organization is not conditional on any passing on of donations to any political party of any sort. So my experience, again, and you've got the benefit of me being fresh here. I've met the people of Clubs New South Wales. And whatever you say, when I saw the work that they did around the bushfires, I was very encouraged by the fact that we were very supportive of what they were doing, right? We have a number of clubs that are in the zones where bushfires were threatening. I think we actually -- we might have lost -- one probably burnt down. So they do some -- you've painted them as evil. But I can tell you that some of the things that I've seen that they do is something that we should be very supportive of.</p><p>So Sylvia, would you like to talk about your reading?</p><p>SYLVIA D. SUMMERS COUDER: Yes. So the question is, will I be reading the book you recommend? I certainly will take a look at this book. But what I can tell you is that right now, I am getting more and more aware of what's going on. I'm also reading books, which can be more action-oriented, what should we do? How should we behave?</p><p>And when it comes to meeting people because on this Board, we do meet with a lot of customers, and we do go across all of those clubs and casinos, and we talk to the people who are playing. So trying to get a sense for what's going on and the impact, the good and a very bad. I'm very sorry about that. But there are some good things going on with those people.</p><p>I travel in the U.S., and I see some people, some older people getting together having a drink of wine and playing for 10 minutes. And that's their social life. And so I understand, and I'm hearing all you're saying. I think we're a Board of decent people. I think we're running a business, and we're doing it as well and as consciously as we can, but there is some good also in that.</p><p>NEIL GREGORY CHATFIELD: Thanks, Sylvia. So proxies in relation to this resolution are shown on the screen behind me. I now move that Silvia Summers be reelected as a Director.</p><p>The next item of business is the reelection of Pat Ramsey as a director. Pat was nominated to be elected as a director of the company in September 2016, and he was appointed effective October 2016. Biographical details for Pat, including relevant qualifications, skills and experience and other directorships are set out in the notice of meeting. Pat is a Chair of the Regulatory and Compliance Committee, a member of the Audit Committee. And if reelected, post this meeting, will assume the role of Lead U.S. Director. Pat's appointment has the unanimous support of Directors.</p><p>Before I take any questions, I will ask Pat to say a few words. Pat?</p><p>PATRICK J. RAMSEY, INDEPENDENT NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, ARISTOCRAT LEISURE LIMITED: Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and good morning. Good afternoon, now, ladies and gentlemen. It's an honor to appear before you for the reelection to the Board of Directors of Aristocrat. I'd like to give you a brief summary of my background first. I've spent the last 18 years working in the casino and gaming industry and in numerous -- all around the United States. I began my gaming career in casino operations, where I worked in various markets from Illinois to New Jersey to Nevada, and that allowed me the valuable opportunity to really understand the industry from different market perspective and different experiences and products as well. So I think that's valuable for Aristocrat. My work experience on that side of the business was all around finance, marketing and operations. 12 years ago, I left operations to join a small struggling, publicly traded manufacturer, named Multimedia Games, which had deep roots in the U.S. tribal gaming markets. I was the CEO and Director of that company during its successful turnaround and eventual sale in 2014. I've been associated with Aristocrat for 4 years now. I joined the company briefly as the Chief Digital Officer before transitioning to the Board over 3 years ago.</p><p>As a resident of Las Vegas, Nevada, I am passionate about this industry, and I'm passionate about continuing to strengthen Aristocrat's global leadership position through my work with Trevor, the Board of Directors and the very talented group of people across the globe who work for Aristocrat. Thank you for your consideration. I do want to add that because my background is a little bit different from what you've heard, I've been in casino operations and specifically to your tragic stories, and I'll tell you, I don't enjoy hearing those, and they're sad and they are tragic. As an operator, I can assure you I was part of a global company that was -- took self-exclusion very seriously. So that example you gave was appalling to me to hear that some -- a security officer would say, keep playing or let this person play. As the Chair of the Regulatory Compliance Committee, certainly, the standard is we have to follow the rules and regulations of all around the globe, right? But I would also say, as a Board member and as a part of this team, it's important that we set a culture to support responsible gaming as well as -- which is what we're trying to do more and more. And I feel that more and more over the last 4 years with this company. I would hope that, of course, if there's an operator that's breaking the laws or rules, we wouldn't be allowed to sell products to them. But going above and beyond that, I would hope we would have our employees speak up and talk, and we'll be able to have open dialogue to say whether or not we can, but whether or not we should, that's the kind of company we are. So I just wanted to proactively address that.</p><p>NEIL GREGORY CHATFIELD: Thanks, Pat. Any discussion on this item? Sure.</p><p>CAROL LIMMER: Sorry. I just want to clarify earlier, and I'm not sure if I've been misunderstood. I understand that it's not your direct responsibility to make sure that your customers do the right thing. That doesn't make sense for any business. But that there is an obligation -- I appreciated your response to say it, but we still take that obligation and we do like to go that step further. What I was asking was is it possible, being so big and powerful, that you can put some pressure on the policymakers or whoever it is to ensure that there is consequences when people are breaching the venues or whatever actually, but there are no consequences. My son is friends with security guards. They say to him, we say to the manager, are these people excluded? Oh don't worry about it, let them in, we need their money. This is happening. This is for real. That's actually what's happening on a regular basis. So hence, why I say the self-exclusion scheme is a joke. My question and my plea to you all is please can you use your power, being such a big organization, to put a bit more pressure on the policymakers to make sure that they're actually taking minimizing harm seriously, please?</p><p>NEIL GREGORY CHATFIELD: So any other questions, Stephen, on this resolution?</p><p>STEPHEN MAYNE: Yes. I probably would have had a few more in general business here, but you did do the 2 question limit on general questions, which is I haven't seen in a top 20 company before. So some of these may not be specifically related to Pat. But I'll try and make them set out. On the regulatory piece, I think you need a director, who's based in Australia, who becomes the sort of the regulatory responsible gambling champion on the Board. That might be you, Chair. I think having someone in Vegas, who's in charge of Aristocrat's Aussie regulation sort of oversight. I just think, frankly, it's too removed. There's a big issue here. We're the world's biggest gamblers per capita. This is your home base. You need someone on the Board who steps up and says, yes, I will talk at next year's AGM about the Aussie regulatory and responsible gambling issues rather than a U.S.-based Vegas resident.</p><p>As the head of the regulatory committee, Pat, I'm interested to hear your views on how exposed we are to a ban on credit cards, particularly with our digital business. So the U.K. have just banned credit cards. You can't use them in clubs and pubs in Australia, but online, I'm guessing quite a large slice of that $1.2 billion in revenue, that Trevor mentioned, is going to be people on credit cards. What is the regulatory exposure we have to regulators anywhere, saying, you can no longer borrow to play on our Aristocrat's one-point digital social games? I'll ask a couple more questions and then I'll sit down and let you answer them all.</p><p>As a tech expert, I'm also keen -- and this might be one for Trevor as well. Between Google, Apple and Facebook, I'm interested in a comment as to which is the most important for us? So they're the big tech giants, everyone talks about they're really exposed to policy changes by the tech giants. How gaming-friendly are those 3 companies? And which -- how do you rank them in terms of they're great for us, we rely on them or they're hostile and they keep banning our products? So we need their support. Give us a summary of how you feel that support is coming through. And finally, on the regulatory question, Trevor, in January, just stepped up to be the new Chair of the American Gaming Association, which is the -- basically the casino lobby group because they don't have clubs and pubs Australian style and only we have the 5,000 clubs and pubs model. In the U.S., it's more about casinos. So Trevor, you're the Chairman of the Board, you've got 42 directors on the Board. Why have you taken up that post when you should be running Aristocrat? You're now sort of the chief spokesman and lobbyist for the entire American casino industry when you're meant to be running our public company. Why did the Board let you do that? And I noticed you've made some public comments about pioneering more responsible gaming. Maybe talk about that in the regulatory piece as to how you 2 see American regulation; you, as the head of our regulatory committee, and Trevor, as the Chairman of the American Gaming Association.</p><p>NEIL GREGORY CHATFIELD: So let me -- I think you've got 3 questions there. The first question around the appropriateness of Pat being Head of the Regulatory and Compliance Committee. We have some -- I think, Pat has something like 330 different jurisdictions that we are registered in. Clearly, the largest market for us is in the U.S., and we have many, many more regulators in the U.S. than we do in Australia. So we think it's very appropriate that Pat does head that committee, particularly given his skillset. In Australia, of course, we have other directors on the Board. So it doesn't all fall to a chairman of a committee, and we all participate in our regulatory obligations. So we think, absolutely, it's the right place for Pat. And I have to say that he's led that with great distinction in the last -- certainly since I have been involved with the company.</p><p>I'm not sure, but I think you made the leap to using credit cards on our digital. I just wanted to make it very clear that we don't do real money gambling online, so -- as a casual game and so on. So I'm not sure what the point was there. So let's go to, maybe, Pat, would you like to answer the question on platforms -- so probably actually Trevor is a better...</p><p>PATRICK J. RAMSEY: A brief stint as a Chief Digital Officer, but probably Trevor is more -- he's better prepared for that. I think I don't -- I won't steal your thunder. Google, Apple and Facebook are all very important partners for us when it comes to online gaming, but Trevor can answer that.</p><p>NEIL GREGORY CHATFIELD: So just before we go to Trevor. So platforms, Trevor will talk about. And perhaps as an introduction into the American Gaming Association, which the Board, by the way, is very supportive of Trevor being involved in that association, given our leadership, and we think that there's an opportunity because the U.S. sector is very, very fragmented, and we think that bringing a focus to things like responsible gameplay, which Trevor is, is beneficial to the industry. So we're very supportive. But maybe, Trevor, you can talk about both the platforms and what AGA actually is doing?</p><p>TREVOR J. CROKER: Yes. Thank you, Chair. Thanks for the question, Stephen. First of all, the platforms are our platforms. They're just a -- they're a distribution device, and so it's a way of providing content. And as you know, some of those platforms are expanding over time. From our perspective, we're taking a proactive approach with the platforms. They recently raised their age verification to 17 plus. We actually use 18 plus proactively in our apps and are looking to continue to advocate is to continue to raise those standards on the accessibility of the product from a platform point of view. So I won't go which one is more important or not. It is about platform. It's a distribution model and the way that we produce product and distribute product out to consumers.</p><p>From an AGA point of view, AGA is an important association because it has -- like the AGC in Australia, it has operators, manufacturers in the same room discussing industry issues. And I think that's an important part of how we have some of the conversations we're talking about today. It's not a manufacturer's issue, it's not a customer or an operator issue, it actually has a broad chirp and has everybody, from an industry point of view, in that room, including independent test labs and other aspects. So that's an important thing in my mind is to how do we, as an industry association, take a responsible approach to leading the association over the long term. I have made statements about responsible gaming. I do see it as an important aspect of what we can bring to the industry in North America, and it's a proactive way of working with customers and with the industry to be successful longer term.</p><p>NEIL GREGORY CHATFIELD: Thanks, Trevor. So the proxies received in relation to this resolution are on the screen behind me. I now move that Pat Ramsey be reelected as a Director.</p><p>So resolution 4 is the election of Philippe Etienne as a Director. Philippe was nominated to be a Director-Elect of the company in October 2019 and appointed effective November 2019, subject to shareholder approval. Philippe is an experienced international executive with a strong strategic background. Being a former Managing Director and CEO of Innovia Security Pty Ltd., a global disruptive technology company. He held a range of senior positions with Orica Limited in Australia, the U.S. and in Europe, and has extensive governance experience as a company director. Full details of Philippe's qualifications and experience are included in the notice of meeting. Philippe is a member of the Regulatory and Compliance Committee and a member of the People and Culture Committee. Philippe's appointment has the unanimous support of directors. So before I ask -- before I take questions, I'll ask Philippe to just say a few words to the meeting. Thanks, Philippe.</p><p>PHILIPPE GERALD ETIENNE, NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, ARISTOCRAT LEISURE LIMITED: Thank you, Chairman, and good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. I'm extremely honored and excited to present myself for election to your Board. As mentioned, I spent almost 25 years with what started as ICI Australia and became Orica Limited. The second half of that was all involved in what initially was the Explosives Group and then became the Mining Services Group. In the U.S., I was Global Head of Strategy and Planning and then Global Head of Manufacturing and Supply Chain. And in Germany, I was Managing Director of Europe, Middle East and Africa and also chaired joint ventures in some pretty exotic and challenging locations, including Estonia, Kazakhstan, Turkey and Russia. I returned to Australia when I took up the role of Global CEO of the Mining Services Group. In 2010, I was asked by the shareholders of what was then known as Securency, and they were the reserve Bank of Australia and a British polymer company, to lead the ethical and strategic resurrection of that company following a very high profile bribery and corruption scandal. I'm pleased to say that 4 years later, the company secured the first-ever contract to supply polymer banknote substrate to the Bank of England for their new GBP 5 and GBP 10 notes. A pretty strong endorsement of the ethical turnaround of the company and also of the wonderful Australian developed and invented polymer banknote substrate. So these days, I sit on the boards of Cleanaway Waste Management Limited, Lynas Corporation, and I'm also Chairman of Quantum, which is a bulk liquids logistics company owned by a number of long-haul infrastructure funds.</p><p>In my brief involvement with your company so far, I've been extremely impressed with what I've seen, not least, the rigor of the regulatory environment in which this company operates, but also Aristocrat's leadership in that and many other areas. And also by the extraordinary passion for people, customers and excellence that I see throughout your company. So although I don't have a gaming industry background, I believe that my experiences in international markets in highly-regulated industries, in disruptive technologies and in driving ethical and cultural excellence are all relevant to Aristocrat, and I'm very keen just to contribute to the endeavors of your Board if you support my election. Thank you.</p><p>NEIL GREGORY CHATFIELD: Thanks very much, Philippe. Is there any discussion on this particular resolution? If you have a question, please come forward.</p><p>STEPHEN MAYNE: Yes, Philippe, it's a bit like how disappointed I was when I saw that Neil was joining this Board. Neil is one of the smartest guys in Australia in the corporate world and he'd never been involved in gaming. And so I was really disappointed when he agreed to lend his good name to this company, given the harm that it causes. So my question for you is, why do you do it as well? And would you serve on the board of a tobacco company?</p><p>PHILIPPE GERALD ETIENNE: Yes, sure. Well, I've not been asked to join the board of a tobacco company, but if I were to be asked, I'd do what I do with any potential board appointment, which is do my due diligence and judge the opportunity on its merits and the industry in which the business operates is one element, but there are many others, it's agenda, the quality of its team are amongst those. So I can't answer your question because I haven't been put in that situation, and I haven't done that due diligence.</p><p>And I joined Aristocrat for a number of reasons. I think it's a very exciting company in terms of what it's trying to do technologically, how it's addressing its growth, its morphing into other sectors. I've been -- and I was during the due diligence, I was extremely impressed with the dedication and not only conceptual dedication but practical efforts going into encouraging responsible gameplay. And my attitude is always, I'd rather make a contribution -- a positive contribution from inside than no contribution at all.</p><p>STEPHEN MAYNE: That's very encouraging. A couple of procedural issues. There was 10% against on Pat's reelection, which is bizarre, because I don't think any of the proxy advisers were going against Pat, is that right?</p><p>NEIL GREGORY CHATFIELD: So Stephen, we're on a different resolution, but I'm happy to give you an answer to that. It might be afterwards.</p><p>STEPHEN MAYNE: It is related to Philippe. And I noticed there was 6% against Kathleen, which also seemed pretty bizarre, given she's independent, the company is going well, et cetera, et cetera. So I wouldn't mind if we -- and I know ASA practices for the proxies to be displayed before the debate. So if there is a big protest, you can ask the question what's going on. So is it possible to get the proxies up here?</p><p>NEIL GREGORY CHATFIELD: No, we'll follow the procedure.</p><p>STEPHEN MAYNE: Okay. All right. So can you give us any insight as to who's voting against? Is it the Ainsworth family making trouble? Or -- I presume it is because I can't see why any institution would be voting like this.</p><p>NEIL GREGORY CHATFIELD: So that's your question?</p><p>STEPHEN MAYNE: Well it's one of them. Okay, let me finish. Finally, when you do the announcement of meeting, can we get the age and the city of residence included. You remove the age when the previous chair hit 70. He didn't want the people to know he was 70 so you stopped disclosing directors' ages. It is best practice. It is in the ASA guidelines. So can you tell us the ages of the directors? I mean, you are very diverse. I presume you're in Melbourne. Yes, but it's just -- so you can assess what the composition is next year, can you just do that, on the website. And the final comment is the ethical turnaround here is much bigger than Securency, in my view, and I wish you the very best of luck. Securency was bribing a few people, facilitation payments to win commercial contracts. These companies' products are causing hundreds of people to suicide. There's enormous harm. You've got a massive challenge, and I wish you the best in turning it around and turning this company to a force for good, not just hiding behind Clubs New South Wales and the AHA, preserving the world's worst and slackest regulatory regime in Australia, (inaudible) harm on people like Sonia and everyone else.</p><p>NEIL GREGORY CHATFIELD: Thanks, Stephen, and I will sort of -- I think it's useful for you, for the shareholders to understand the process we went through with Philippe. So we ran a formal process and in line with the sort of skills that we laid out, which are all listed in the annual report. And we had a very large number of people who were exceedingly interested to join us. And we were very fortunate that Philippe was someone who had an interest. The regulatory requirements of a director, and any of our senior executives, is enormous, and I've personally been through it, and I know Philippe's been through it. And it's -- personally, I think it's a good thing. It's very -- I want to say, very time consuming and somewhat, for a private person like me, it's very intrusive. But I think it's for the good of the industry that this is a sort of regulation that we have in work for people to be involved in companies such as this and companies in the industry. So we're delighted to have Philippe. He's already made a terrific contribution. And I'd just encourage directors to be supportive of that. So the proxies received in relation to this resolution are shown on the screen behind me. So if we're being judged by shareholders, Stephen, then I think we've got good marks. Thank you. So I now move that Philippe Etienne be elected as a director.</p><p>So the next 3 resolutions relate to people and culture. Before we turn to these items, I'd like to ask Kathleen Conlon, Chair of the People and Culture Committee, to provide an overview of remuneration-related matters in -- for financial year 2019. Thanks, Kathleen.</p><p>KATHLEEN MARIE CONLON: Thank you, Chairman. We've introduced this a few years ago because we think remuneration is an area that shareholders have a strong interest in, and we want to explain where we're at. So we'll talk -- I'll talk a little bit about the overview and obviously, all the details are set out in the rem report as well as the statement of meeting.</p><p>For 2020 outcomes and initiatives, we have a philosophy of pay for performance. And I think if you look at the results that we've achieved in terms of the growth, both organic growth, so we've actually had significant organic growth in broadly flat markets, as well as acquisition growth, which we didn't rely on. The organization has done a very good job and has been rewarded for doing that. We've also continued to listen to our shareholders and their feedback on the rem report. Are they getting the information that they need? One of the things that we got feedback was, people weren't happy about us using an EPSA target because they felt that, that encouraged acquisitions at the expense of organic growth. So we've now changed that to be an EPS target. And we're trying to increase our disclosure across all elements, whether it be the retrospect disclosure on the quantitative STI targets. On methodologies for target setting, we've strengthened the callback position, and we've been receiving a lot of insight. We've also tried to add in a little bit more of the flavor. There's the conversation with Carol about being U.S. and having a lot of U.S. executives. We compete in a very different remuneration structure in the U.S., where most executives in the U.S. are given shares without hurdles. So we're trying to maintain that. So we're also trying to look at how do we ensure that the behavior is not just financial outcomes are taken into account on the LTIs. So that's what we do with the personal performance portion of the LTI. We make sure that we do have a balanced scorecard, and that we are managing not just the what, but the how.</p><p>So we continue to take on feedback and continue to improve our disclosures. And hopefully, they make sense. And as feedback continues, we will continue to change it. Thank you.</p><p>NEIL GREGORY CHATFIELD: Thank you, Kathleen. So the first of these resolutions, which is resolution 5, is the approval of the grant of performance share rights to Trevor Croker, the company's CEO, under the company's long-term incentive program. The notice of meeting sets out in detail the manner in which the long-term incentive program operates and the basis for participation by Trevor. I stress that the performance share rights will only vest if the vesting criteria satisfied at the end of the performance period and assure you that the Board sets rigorous targets to ensure shareholder value has been achieved. Please note that there is a voting exclusion applicable to this resolution as set out in the notice of meeting. So is there any discussion on this resolution? If you have a question, please come forward.</p><p>CAROL LIMMER: Thank you, Chairman. Last year, the ASA voted against the proposed long-term incentive allocation. And I note that it carried over 26% vote against. The CEO has been granted his allocations based on a face value approach, which ASA does support. But the STI's quite -- can be potentially quite high. We've targeted 100% and a maximum of 200% and I note the amount paid for this past year was over $2 million. Acknowledge there is a 50% deferral on the STI payment, half of that is for 1 year and the other half for 2 years, but the STI potential is high. And I also understand that may align with the advice that you receive for U.S.-based people. And of course, the CEO is U.S.-based and that applies to STI and LTI pay. As mentioned, you have 3 performance hurdles, 1 total shareholder return and that's 30%. You've got the -- what will now be the EPS rather than the adjusted EPS at 30%. And then there's the individual performance, which has 40% component, and that's over a balanced scorecard type of performance providing the persons in the job. The hurdles that are in place, the TSR there's 50% paid at median performance only, and we'd like to see something more rigorous than that. And with the last component, the more individual base component, that really has a service-based aspect to it, which doesn't align with ASA guide -- ASA guidelines nor to remuneration generally in Australia. I know that you made comments about your competitors in the U.S. but nevertheless whilst depreciating what might be a U.S. remuneration situation, ASA doesn't believe it can support the incentives paid, especially related to staying in the job. Thank you.</p><p>NEIL GREGORY CHATFIELD: Thank you. Yes, thank you for your comments. Of course, as Kathleen outlined, there's been a very rigorous process around remuneration. The structure of the CEO's remuneration was something that we looked at probably in more detail in the last 12 months, I think, Kathleen, and we've made a few changes as you've -- as you point out. Understand that ASA may have its own guidelines. The only thing that I would sort of mention, I guess, of the comments is around the service to 40% on the LTI, which relates to this resolution. It's not service-based, except to the extent that all LTI is service-based. So if you're not there in the period that it's vesting, there's -- obviously, that doesn't vest or may vest in certain circumstances in a -- on a pro rata basis. So 40% is based on individual performance. And that performance I think we've set out in the annual report in a lot more detail. I know when I went to see a range of shareholders prior to this meeting, they were very pleased with the sorts of information that we were providing. So it doesn't -- remuneration is one of those things that you can't please everybody, unfortunately. So Kathleen, did you want to add anything on that?</p><p>KATHLEEN MARIE CONLON: You covered it admirably.</p><p>NEIL GREGORY CHATFIELD: Okay. Thank you. Any other commentary?</p><p>STEPHEN MAYNE: Is the protest vote on this one up or down on last year's 26%? It's down. Okay. All right. So you've made some changes in your address. I know ISS went against, so I'm assuming it's still double figures. But it's not as big a protest as last year.</p><p>KATHLEEN MARIE CONLON: So I mean, again, we meet with all the proxy advisers. We explain we continue to improve our disclosure. ISS has a philosophical belief that they will never support something that doesn't have a financial hurdle on it. So they understand that they put in a report. And we then speak to our shareholders who use ISS, and we explain and some of them go with our recommendation and some go with ISS.</p><p>STEPHEN MAYNE: Yes. Okay. All right. Now the CEO was paid $5.5 million last year, thoroughly reserved. You can argue, given the magnificent financial performance here and it's $11 million worth of ordinary shares. No clawback, he just got them for himself. So he's probably worth more than $20 million from his experience at Aristocrat. He's doing very nicely. Do we really need to be issuing this many LTIs in 1 year? I mean, 145,000 of them at the share price of $37. That's $5 million. That's market value of $5 million worth of free shares if he continues with the great performance. So just for me, it just seems too large, too many. How much does the bloke need?</p><p>And the other issue is, you've got a whole incentive system right through this company, which is all about making money out of gamblers and making more money and getting the share price up. And like with the banks where their bonus systems for sellers is cross selling and dodgy selling, they really came a cropper because the incentive systems were all wrong and everyone was focused on the money. So I want to hear what incentives or bonuses has Trevor got that are pinned on responsible gambling or pinned on harm minimization, that are pinned on nonfinancial things? And what is the Board doing to recognize the obvious conflict of interest of a bloke trying to make more millions and the whole incentive system of profit, profit, profit, balanced against Sonia's story, the harm story, where none of you are on these incentive schemes, you're all sitting the governance. So what are you doing to make sure the incentive system at the employee level, led by the CEO, is not rampant, out of control and risking the social license of the company for short term profit, which is not sustainable long-term because they're letting it rip and causing too much harm. And this is where you people are meant to be getting that balance right and recognizing the CEO's conflict of interest to maximize profits and holding him back a bit on a few things and saying that, not responsible. No, that's $20 million of revenue we won't take, too much harm. Nope. Let's argue for getting rid of smoking in New South Wales. I mean, ridiculous that you can still smoke and play poker machines in New South Wales, whereas you can't anywhere else in Australia, and I assume you can't in Las Vegas. You can. Well, anywhere else in Australia, you can't. It's ridiculous. And you should come out and say, stop it, even if it costs you $20 million, $30 million. It's the right thing to do. And I've just never said any example of Aristocrat doing the right thing when it comes to making a buck or doing the right thing. And I think you, directors, need to recognize that conflict and make some changes and put his bonus at risk based on some good reducing harm measures.</p><p>NEIL GREGORY CHATFIELD: I think as a Board, and what I hear from the vast majority of shareholders, is that the objective for the CEO is to ensure that he manages the company: firstly, for the long term; second, to ensure that we have a sustainable future; third, obviously, and it necessarily comes into sort of shorter-term profits. We've set the discussions that we have around the table around Trevor's objectives financial as well as nonfinancial. And I hope that we've given you some flavor. And obviously, we perhaps haven't got through to you that culture and some of the environmental, social and governance processes that we've got in this organization, which the CEO has an enormous impact on because he's the leader, they're up there in terms of his objectives. So in terms of benchmarking and whether we're determining the right sort of numbers, we're very comfortable that we've got the right mix. As I say, it's unlikely we will satisfy every shareholder and every proxy adviser, and we keep refining. But we have some excellent performance management systems in the company, and we'll continue to improve that.</p><p>So the proxies received in relation to this resolution are on the screen behind me. And I now move that the grant of performance share rights to Trevor Croker be approved.</p><p>So resolution 6 is the approval of the super share plan, which is a global employee share program designed to assist employees to become shareholders in the company and ensure close alignment between the interests of both. The program has enjoyed a strong take up by staff. Today, we are seeking approval as California law requires that plans, such as the super share plan, must be approved by shareholders of the ultimate parent company if there are more than 35 Californian participants. As we do have more than 35 employees in California, the shareholder approval is sought. So notice of meeting sets out in detail the key terms of the plan, and please note that there are -- there is a voting exclusion applicable to this resolution, and that's also set out in the notice of meeting. So is there any discussion in relation to this resolution? Please come forward, if you have a question.</p><p>STEPHEN MAYNE: I'll just keep this briefly to the process. Today's AGM has been webcast. Are you able to undertake to leave it up, leave an archive of it up at least for a few weeks?</p><p>NEIL GREGORY CHATFIELD: I'll take it on notice.</p><p>STEPHEN MAYNE: Can you say -- you did last year for a bit. Can you repeat that practice last year and make sure it's available.</p><p>NEIL GREGORY CHATFIELD: Yes, it's possible. Yes, sure.</p><p>STEPHEN MAYNE: Great. Thanks. And secondly, and Woolworth's agreed to do this, can you also make a transcript of proceedings available? You've obviously got 28,000 shareholders, only about 100 of us are here today. So there's 28,000 shareholders who've missed out on all of this. Transcripts are far easier to read than watching through 2.5 hours of video. So can you agree to make a transcript available ideally on your website, but if not, on request? So if shareholders request a copy of the transcript that you make it available on request. Just so we've got a full record. Because last year's AGM, there's no record. You took it down. So you've left -- and can you put it back up, please, as well. Because I mean, I know -- I get it that you don't want to be promoting awkward conversations. I understand the embarrassment factor, I don't want to give them a platform, I get that. But it is a record of the AGM. And if you do webcast it, then you should -- you're trying to share it. So I'm just asking you to make sure there's a record available even if it's not permanently on your website, but it's available on request rather than just take it down, and that never happened, which is what many companies do after an uncomfortable AGM. When we want to be able to refer to things from last year and quote back and -- all shareholders should have access to this sort of discussion.</p><p>Final point is, can it be back in the city next year, the AGM? Because it was -- I found it coming from Melbourne, it was 3 trains, and it was hard to access versus a city. I don't know what the rest of the shareholders think, but a city venue would be better. And particularly, if you've got people who have got a livid experience, it's very triggering to have to walk through a poky sharing, if you want to talk about gambling. So I think that you're actually excluding some of your customers by locating it here because there are some people who will not do that, who will not go into a poky's room because of the experience they've had. So can you have it somewhere where it's neutral?</p><p>And finally, can you just reverse the proxies next year and go with the disclosure beforehand? It was a bit cute to talk about the proxy protest thing down when it was marginally down at 24%. Clearly, you've got some problems with probably BlackRock and Vanguard, your 2 biggest shareholders on the LTI. So it's just best practice to be transparent, as you claim you are, put them up there, and let's have a discussion. It is best practice, minor change, but I hope you can do it -- do that next year along with webcast, archives, transcripts, better located AGM. And apart from that, I'm really happy.</p><p>NEIL GREGORY CHATFIELD: Okay. So the company secretary has made a note. Thank you. So proxies received in relation to this resolution are on the screen behind me. I now move that the super share plan be approved.</p><p>Resolution 7 is the adoption of the remuneration report. The annual report for the 12-month financial year ended 30 September 2019, contains a remuneration report, which forms part of the director's report and is set out -- and sets out the remuneration policy for the company and its controlled entities for 2019 and reports the remuneration arrangements in place for nonexecutive directors and executive key management personnel during that period. The vote on this resolution is advisory-only. However, the Board will take the outcome of the vote into consideration when reviewing, as we do annually, the remuneration practices and policies. Is there any discussion on this resolution?</p><p>CAROL LIMMER: Well, first of all, I -- on a positive note, and as Kathleen mentioned, you have made changes in the rem area and I acknowledge that, that you've got feedback from stakeholders and transitioned from your EPSA to EPS hurdle with the LTIs, introduced retrospective disclosure of the actual quantitative STI targets set by the Board together with disclosure on the actual performance against those targets. And you've expanded disclosures on methodologies relating to target setting, including how hurdles are set to ensure challenging stress targets as well as how the Board and the People and Culture Committee take those into account. You've also had strength in clawback provisions that apply to unvested and vested incentives and implemented a minimum shareholding, as I mentioned earlier on, for nonexecutive directors. However, without going into it all again, for the reasons that were raised in relation to the proposed LTI allocation to the CEO, the ASA will be voting against this motion.</p><p>NEIL GREGORY CHATFIELD: Understand. Thank you. Any other questions on this resolution?</p><p>STEPHEN MAYNE: Have we got a double-digit protest vote on this one?</p><p>NEIL GREGORY CHATFIELD: Stephen, I'm running the meeting with a procedure that we laid out at the start. We can never please everybody. Some people want to have the proxies before and they get the proxies before and they say, now you're stifling debate. So you have it afterwards. So I thought about it, and we can stick with what we've got.</p><p>STEPHEN MAYNE: I actually changed that policy at the ASA. We used to say that, and we've changed our position. So you're breaching ASA policy by doing this. And I don't know anyone who's telling you not to do it. You tell me who's telling me to keep a secret. So anyway, the other point is, rem ideally should be earlier in the agenda because you do -- most companies do that because you deal with rem and if there's a big projects or big issues then, later on, you can deal with the rem committee members who've overseen the bad rem practices. But to do it at the end, we've already voted for the rem committee directors, and we don't know about this protest when we've done that. So next year, ideally, do the rem items first and do the director elections last so we can be fully informed as we're engaging with the directors. And my final comment is, look forward to you having read the book, Natasha Sch\u00c3\u00bcll's Addiction by Design, for next year's AGM. We will ask you about it at next year's AGM.</p><p>And final comment is, you'd mentioned the work you do with Sydney University. I personally, and I know many in the Gambling Reform movement share this view, believe that Aristocrat and Clubs New South Wales have undermined the integrity of University of Sydney by giving it millions of dollars in funding -- gambling industry funding, which continuously produces research, which blinds gamblers and looks at gamblers and never looks at your addictive machines, which is what many people believe is the problem rather than blinding the person. So can you maybe leave Sydney Uni alone, stop giving them all this money. I think you're compromising them in the same way big tobacco used to pay academics to do stuff. Everyone knows it's not a good look. So can you move on from your relationship with the University of Sydney before they actually move on from you?</p><p>NEIL GREGORY CHATFIELD: Totally disagree with your comments around the university, but I'm sure we'll continue to disagree. So please note that there's a voting exclusion in relation to this resolution and that was set out in the notice of meeting. So proxies received in relation to this resolution are shown on the screen behind me. So I now move that the remuneration report be adopted.</p><p>The final resolution, resolution 8, is a special resolution. And relates to the renewal of the proportional takeover approval provision in clause 26 of the company's contribution -- sorry, constitution. As a special resolution, it requires approval from at least 75% of votes cast. A proportional takeover offer is a takeover offer where the offer made to each member of the company is only for a proportion of that member's shares. The constitution currently contains proportional takeover approval provisions in clause 26. These came into effect on May 3, 2011, when the current constitution was adopted by shareholders. Under the Corporations Act, proportional takeover approval provisions expire 3 years from adoption or renewal and may then be renewed. These proportional takeover provisions were last reinserted at the company's AGM on 27 February 2017 and accordingly will cease to operate from 26 February 2020. The Board is seeking shareholder approval to renew the proportional takeover approval provisions in the constitution. The proposed proportional takeover provisions are identical to those previously adopted by the company. The directors consider it is in the best interest of shareholders to renew the proportional takeover approval provision in the constitution for the further 3 years. The notice of meeting sets out details of the advantages and disadvantages of the proportional takeover provisions. Is there any discussion on this motion -- on this resolution?</p><p>So proxies received in relation to this resolution are shown on the screen behind me. I now move that the renewal of the proportional takeover provisions be approved.</p><p>If you have not already done so, I now ask you to complete your blue voting card. If you're uncertain about any of the voting procedures, please raise your hand and boardroom staff will be pleased to assist you. Completed blue voting cards should then be placed in the ballot boxes being held by the boardroom staff at the door where you entered the meeting. The counting of the votes on the poll may take a little time. Rather than keep you waiting for the result, I propose to formally close the meeting now and leave the poll open for a further 10 minutes to enable shareholders to cast their votes. The results of the poll will be announced via the ASX as soon as they are finalized.</p><p>For our shareholders, that concludes the formal items of the meeting.

Zuckerberg acknowledged federal investigations and concerns about his company, but also warned members of the House Financial Services Committee that stifling innovation with Facebook would lead other countries to overtake the U.S. in technology.</p><p> \"This has been a challenging few years for Facebook. I recognize we play an important role in our society, and we have unique responsibilities,\" Zuckerberg said in his prepared testimony. \"For as long as we're here, I'm committed to using our position to push for big ideas that we believe can empower power people.\"</p><p>Facebook officials at last Wednesday's hearing said the company would not comment on the multistate investigation.</p><p> The probe was originally announced in September by New York State Attorney General Letitia James and eight other attorneys general. James on Tuesday announced the addition of the other attorneys general, which she said brought the total number of states and territories backing the probe to 47.</p><p> \"Even the largest social media platform in the world must follow the law and respect consumers,\" James said in last Tuesday's announcement. \"I am proud to be leading a bipartisan coalition of attorneys general in investigating whether Facebook has stifled competition and put users at risk.\"</p><p>Arizona has been in discussions with James' office for some time before deciding to join the probe on Oct. 3, said Ryan Anderson, a spokesperson for Brnovich. It was not until Oct. 22 that the additional states' involvement was announced publicly.</p><p> Barak Y. Orbach, a University of Arizona law professor, said the widespread support by state officials reflects consumers recent concern about data algorithms, tracking, and spying, as well as a shift in public opinion of big companies since the recession. He believes it could soon lead to shifts in antitrust law.</p><p> \"The law is about to change,\" Orbach said. \"The federal government has not been aggressive enough about protecting the public, and now the states are more aggressive.\"</p><p> Orbach said investigation by the attorneys general may affect the law. Corporations will suffer a \"significant disciplinary effect\" and pay more attention to consumer concerns, he said, or they will face legal action and more stringent regulations.</p><p> The states are not the only ones investigating Facebook.</p><p> Zuckerberg fielded House members' questions last Wednesday about probes by the Federal Trade Commission over data breaches, as well as with a Justice Department review of big-tech companies including Facebook, Apple, Google and Amazon.</p><p> Lawmakers also grilled Zuckerberg over what role Facebook may have had in Russian meddling in the 2016 election, charges it censors conservative speech on its platform and how Facebook ads may enable housing discrimination.</p><p> When Zuckerberg acknowledged the issues and said Facebook is working to solve them, Rep. Gregory Meeks, D-N.Y., responded, \"But words are different from actions.\"</p><p> Despite a generally apologetic tone to his testimony, Zuckerberg used much of his time to talk about Libra, the company's emerging cryptocurrency that he said could help bring financial freedom to low-income communities globally that cannot access normal banking services.</p><p> Although he said Libra would not move forward without all the proper regulatory approvals, he also took the opportunity to warn lawmakers about overregulation. Zuckerberg said the cost of not innovating could include China overtaking the U.S. as a technology leader.</p><p> That was echoed after the hearing by Walter Olson, a senior fellow at the Cato Institute, who said the U.S. is currently \"the envy of the rest of the world.\"</p><p> Olson said \"it would be a blow to creative liberties\" if antitrust laws \"paralyzed\" tech firms like Facebook \u2013 many of which are American companies that are beneficial to the country in terms of \"brainpower\" and jobs.</p><p> The states are pressing ahead, but they have not proposed a timeframe for their investigation.</p><p> Attorneys general that joined the New York probe in September were from Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Nebraska, North Carolina, Ohio, Tennessee and the District of Columbia.

Only when a user dug further into the Android system settings and turned off broader system-level tracking did Google stop surreptitiously siphoning location data, the complaint argues.<br/>Google has found itself in similar controversies in the past over location tracking of Android users. The company has responded to privacy concerns over the years with various stopgap measures like making it easier to auto-delete your location data, and cracking down on offending third-party apps that do so without consent. But its efforts to improve privacy protections and the various settings you need to monitor to ensure you're not being overly tracked remain complex and confusing to average users, and it can often seem impossible to keep tabs on just how much Google knows about you and what sources of data it maintains.<br/>\"At some point, people or companies that have a lot of money think they can do whatever the hell they want to do.\"<br/>Brnovich is asking a court force Google to pay back profits it may have earned from monetizing this data through ads served to Arizona residents. The Post says Arizona's anti-fraud laws also might subject Google to $10,000 per fine violations.<br/>\"The Attorney General and the contingency fee lawyers filing this lawsuit appear to have mischaracterized our services. We have always built privacy features into our products and provided robust controls for location data. We look forward to setting the record straight,\" a Google spokesperson said in a statement given to The Verge.<br/>\"At some point, people or companies that have a lot of money think they can do whatever the hell they want to do, and feel like they are above the law,\" Brnovich told The Post in an interview. \"I wanted Google to get the message that Arizona has a state consumer fraud act. They may be the most innovative company in the world, but that doesn't mean they're above the law.\"<br/>Google and its YouTube subsidiary, as well as the other major tech companies, are facing a number of regulatory and legal quagmires right now, following antitrust and privacy enforcement in the European Union that resulted in multi-billion fines against Google over the last decade.<br/>Now, US politicians and regulators are following suit and have begun engaging in a broad and coordinated effort across the Department of Justice, the Federal Trade Commission, and state legislators to reign in Big Tech and enforce antitrust, privacy, and other laws. These are rules Silicon Valley has largely flouted over the last couple of decades as lawmakers failed to keep up with the pace of technological change and the scale of Big Tech's ability to exploit loopholes and skirt regulation for monetary gain and market consolidation.<br/>YouTube settled with the FTC last year for violations of Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), while Google is currently under investigation by all 50 state attorneys general and the subject of a broader antitrust probe led by the Justice Department.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INDTEC-M1072135</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INDTEC2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6042-MMR1-JBYT-H282-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">428674</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"582\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 FFC Information Solution Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Indian Technology news</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5981\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"06\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>June 12, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC000254Q</classCode><className>GRAHAM HOLDINGS CO</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Stephen Meeks of Arkansas introduced a bill last month that would prevent employers from forcibly microchipping employees. </p><p>Meeks introduced House Bill 1177 in January. He stated regarding the bill,[2] 'Do we wait until after the snake bites and then try to come up with solutions for it? I believe there's great wisdom in doing it beforehand.' The bill would allow employers to use chips, but prevent a chip implant as a condition of employment. There is no current law in the United States regarding forcible microchipping.\ufeff Worldwide trends[3] are pointing to a future in which widespread use of implanted chips becomes commonplace. Social credit scores already regulate the lives of millions of Chinese citizens. A de facto social score has already been implemented in the United States by big tech. Facebook recently asked[4] U.S. banks to share user financial data including transactions and account balances in an effort to boost user engagement with the app. Matt Stoller, a fellow at the Open Markets Institute, stated after Facebook's announcement that it is a sign that big tech is moving toward a social credit system in the United States. Stoller said, 'concentrated tech power is moving us towards a dystopian social credit scoring system.' Implanted microchips are the final phase of this system of absolute control over the population.

What are the effects of shopping on Amazon? How about relying on Google for information?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In World Without Mind: The Existential Threat of Big Tech, author Franklin Foer walks readers through how these corporations started, how they have become mega-monopolies, and what that means to the world.</p><p>READ MORE: Armchair Book Club: Kate Atkinson's Transcription stands well among her work</p><p>Foer is hammering the alarm bell. He argues that the rise of these companies has done nothing less than put us on a path to a world without private contemplation, autonomous thought or solitary introspection. In short, we are letting these companies create a world without mind. He explains the rise of Silicon Valley, the creation of the internet, and the domination of new companies in chapters such as Mark Zuckerberg's War on Free Will and Jeff Bezos Disrupts Knowledge.</p><p>Foer is not optimistic, but he does offer solutions. First, we need to wake up. Second, we need to demand regulation. Facebook has recently said that it welcomes regulation, but that's most likely because they know how difficult that would be to implement across international borders.</p><p>Even if you don't agree with Foer's solutions, this book will at least educate internet and social media users, and help them realize what is at stake. Some of these companies have big plans for automation and artificial intelligence. But, are they who we want to trust to create this brave new world?</p><p>If you're curious about what a world run by the counterculture/tech minds of Silicon Valley could look like, pick up Ian MacEwan's latest novel, Machines Like Me. Set in alternate reality 1980s London, in a world where Alan Turing, the father of computer science and artificial intelligence, didn't commit suicide, the first synthetic humans have come onto the market.</p><p>These humans, programmed by computer scientists to have real personalities, emotions and superhuman capabilities, are purchased by a few 'lucky' households. MacEwan is a brilliant mind, and there's no one better to explore the unintended consequences-both positive and negative-of artificial intelligence.</p><p>Adam, the synthetic human, is handsome, courteous, an eloquent poet, and able to fall in love. In fact, he falls for his owner's girlfriend. With this fantastic and subversive premise, MacEwan looks into artificial intelligence's possibilities and ultimate limitation.</p><p>I wished more was made of Alan Turing's character and wished to see more of the synthetic humans operating in the real world, rather than being stuck, for the most part, in the owner's kitchen. But I do admire the complex questions and ideas that MacEwan brings to life. If you weren't uneasy before, you certainly will be after reading both of these books. They emphatically warn us to go into the future with our eyes wide open, to think about what we really need, and to decide who we want to be in control.</p><p>Heather Allen is a book reviewer for Black Press who lives in the Okanagan.</p><p>To report a typo, email: <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:editor@pentictonwesternnews.com\">editor@pentictonwesternnews.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PENNWS-3838285</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PENNWS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WMB-G1N1-F103-32JP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438267</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"511\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Black Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Penticton Western News</publicationName><edition>Final Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 20, 2019 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Ministers in Theresa May\u2019s government tried to allay fears about the foreign takeover of one of Britain\u2019s few top-class technology companies by spinning it as a vote of confidence in the UK as a great place to do business, despite Brexit. There were also assurances Arm would keep its British headquarters and double its UK-based staff over five years.\u00a0</p><p>But the Arm deal highlighted a frequent and still valid criticism of the government\u2019s involvement with business: its industrial policy is too often ad hoc, and lacks a strong set of principles guiding which industries and companies are important for the future. The issue has become even more pressing in the era of Big Tech as US technology companies have sprung up rapidly and come to dominate whole sectors of the economy, often in the process destroying the commercial prospects of older competitors. It is no surprise that the drive for \u201ctechnological sovereignty\u201d \u2014 the need <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/140e560e-0ba0-11ea-bb52-34c8d9dc6d84\"> to foster homegrown technology champions </url>\u2014 has become the ambition for Europe\u2019s policymakers in particular, one given even greater urgency in the wake of the pandemic.</p><p>Today, it is again the future of Arm that is drawing attention to the gaps in Britain\u2019s industrial strategy. SoftBank is <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4ed67726-1a56-4ce2-9d62-a5ec2a8f35b5\"> considering a sale </url>to the US chip company Nvidia. The proposed deal has sparked calls, including from one of Arm\u2019s founders, for <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4970848d-7821-45dc-b8cb-211036be5d30\"> the UK government to intervene</url>. Ownership by Nvidia, critics have claimed, could see its headquarters moved to America, making the company subject to US foreign investment regulations. It would also threaten the neutrality at the heart of Arm\u2019s business model which has allowed it to license chips to a range of customers. </p><p>Successive British governments have been reluctant to intervene in company transactions. But in this case, Boris Johnson\u2019s government has a role to play. In the event of a deal, he should at the very least insist on a continuation of the commitments given by SoftBank \u2014 and take the opportunity to make them legally binding. Foreign bidders have all too often promised much, only to renege on the very same promises.\u00a0</p><p>At the same time, Mr Johnson\u2019s government should use the opportunity to spell out a coherent approach to industrial policy. While his government has identified <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/da7ce443-e218-4e82-a110-07661dc1ad19\"> science as a key driver for future economic growth</url>, recent actions \u2014 notably the decision to spend about \u00a3500m of taxpayer\u2019s money on a stake in OneWeb, the collapsed satellite operator, and talk of forming a new agency to promote frontier technology modelled on America\u2019s Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency \u2014 do not suggest a coherent strategy. Indeed, if the interventionist approach towards OneWeb were taken as a yardstick, Mr Johnson\u2019s government could justify a similar action in the case of Arm given its importance to the UK\u2019s technological base. Dominic Cummings, his chief adviser, has been clear on his ambitions to build world-class tech champions. Wholesale nationalisation, however, would be a mistake.\u00a0</p><p>Whether Britain can retain and foster a viable industrial and technological base will, ultimately, be determined by its sovereign capabilities, the skills of its workforce and key infrastructure. All of this will require ministers to set out clear goals. A much-vaunted industrial policy set out in 2017 has languished, in part due to Brexit and the pandemic. It is time for Mr Johnson to put his government\u2019s rhetoric into actionable policies.</p><p><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Letter in response to this editorial comment</emphasis>:</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6d187b81-75ae-4754-b73a-51d5ef70e952\"> The bid for Arm is a wake-up call for UK plc / From Mike Lynch, Technology entrepreneur and founder Invoke Capital, London WC2, UK</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FTCOMH-00d4f28014a8463aa0ef8693ac71f860</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FTCOMH2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60SF-5611-DXP9-9000-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">408337</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"653\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Financial Times Limited All Rights Reserved Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web.</copyright><publicationName>FT.com Headlines</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 6, 2020 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC0002LTC</classCode><className>SOFTBANK CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0001YLV</classCode><className>NVIDIA CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS551112 OFFICES OF OTHER HOLDING COMPANIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>SIC6719 OFFICES OF HOLDING COMPANIES, NEC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><className>NAICS334413 SEMICONDUCTOR &amp;

The amendments are a partial response to extensive criticism of the legislation as overbroad, ambiguous, and excessively burdensome for organizations doing business in California. Throughout the summer, a coalition of businesses and industry associations (including the California Retailers Association, the Consumer Technology Association, the Internet Association and others), engaged in a concerted effort to persuade the California Legislature to clarify certain definitions in the law, limit its scope to prevent unintended consequences and delay its enforcement date to give regulated businesses the requisite time to establish systems and policies for compliance.[2][2] The Legislature's response addresses a few, but by no means all, of the industry's concerns. It delays enforcement of most of the law's provisions until July 1, 2020 or six months after the California attorney general publishes final implementing regulations,[3][3] whichever is earlier, and it clarifies certain exemptions from the law's reach, but it leaves intact a host of complex requirements. Any entity subject to the CCPA that interacts with individual consumers faces a considerable task in readying for compliance during the approximately 18-month period before the CCPA is enforced. </p><p>The CCPA is being heralded by many as a 'first in the nation' privacy regime. Because it defines the 'personal information' subject to its protection extremely broadly, and because it grants consumers extensive rights to control that information, it has been referred to as a US state's importation of the European Union (EU) General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (GDPR) that became enforceable on May 25, 2018. Many organizations that spent months or even years preparing to comply with the GDPR are considering whether those efforts will be sufficient to ensure compliance\u2014or at least to bring them close to compliance\u2014with the CCPA as well. But despite core similarities between the GDPR and the CCPA, having prepared for compliance with the former will not relieve a business of additional work to achieve compliance with the latter. Although GDPR compliance may help with some aspects of CCPA compliance, an assessment of the CCPA's requirements needs to be undertaken as a separate exercise and will require adopting new operational and policy measures.Key Differences Between the CCPA and the GDPRAs a threshold matter, there are certain core differences between the CCPA and the GDPR in terms of the scope of regulated persons, information and activities. For example: Covered Entities. The GDPR has broad application to any person or entity, regardless of location or nationality, that acts as a 'controller' (i.e., a natural or legal person, public authority, agency, or other body which, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data) or a 'processor' (i.e., a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which processes personal data on behalf of the controller) of personal data of individuals that is collected in connection with a presence in the EU. The CCPA is not so broad; it regulates a 'business,' defined as a for-profit legal entity that does business in the state of California and which: (1) Has annual gross revenues in excess of $25 million, (2) Alone or in combination buys, receives, sells or shares for commercial purposes the personal information of 50,000 or more consumers, households or devices on an annual basis, or (3) Derives 50 percent or more of its annual revenues from selling consumers' personal information, to provide consumers with a variety of rights with respect to the protection and control of their personal information. This difference in covered entities reflects the fundamental underpinnings of the two laws: The GDPR is grounded on the principle that, in the EU, privacy is a human right. Although the California Constitution similarly refers to the right to privacy as among the 'inalienable' rights of all individuals, the CCPA itself does not seek to protect that right outside the commercial arena. It is 'consumers' whose personal data is protected under the CCPA, and it is businesses, not other persons, upon which California has imposed the CCPA's requirements. Personal Information. The GDPR protects 'personal data' which is 'any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (or a 'data subject').' The CCPA similarly protects 'personal information,' but the definition of that term is designed to cover not only information identifiable to an individual consumer, but also to consumers that purchase or use products or services jointly: ''Personal information' means information that identifies, relates to, describes, is capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular consumer or household.' Importantly, however, as clarified by the recent amendments to the CCPA, certain information that is subject to protection under other US privacy regimes is exempt from the CCPA. For example, nonpublic personal financial information that is collected, processed, sold, or disclosed pursuant to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and its implementing rules or the California Financial Information Privacy Act is also generally exempt from the CCPA (although a breach in the security of this information would be actionable in a private party suit brought under the CCPA). In addition, medical information governed by the California Confidentiality of Medical Information Act and 'protected health information' collected or created by 'covered entities' or 'business associates' as those terms are defined under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and its implementing rules are not subject to the CCPA. Information is exempt if it is collected as part of a clinical trial subject to protection under (i) the so-called 'Common Rule' protecting human research subjects; (ii) the parallel rules of the Food and Drug Administration, or (iii) good clinical practice guidelines issued by the International Council for Harmonization in research. This latter exemption, vigorously advocated for by the pharmaceutical and medical device industries, is critical to prevent risks to the integrity of clinical trials that would exist if consumers who are research subjects could request access to or deletion of their personal data collected in the course of a clinical trial in which blinded studies and consistent data retention are essential to accurate analysis and reliable results. There is ambiguity\u2014or perhaps a serious deficiency\u2014in the exemption for research subject information, however, in that much research involving human subjects takes place outside of actual 'clinical trials'\u2014for example, through surveys, interviews and other channels. The specific reference to data collected in a 'clinical trial'\u2014as opposed to in human-subject research more generally\u2014may not encompass information collected for purposes of, for example, pharmacoeconomic or outcomes research, or for purposes such as identifying clinical trial participants. The medical research community may wish to seek further clarifying amendments to foreclose the possibility of an adverse impact on such nonclinical research. Core Consumer Rights. Most of the basic privacy rights protected by the CCPA and GDPR are similar. The CCPA declares the California Legislature's intent to ensure five core consumer rights of California residents with respect to personal information about them: The right to know what personal information is collected; The right to know whether that personal information is sold or disclosed, and to whom;[4][4] The right to 'say no' to the sale of that personal information; The right to access that personal information; and The right to equal service and price, regardless of exercising their privacy rights. The GDPR similarly grants individuals the right to notice of what types of personal information about them will be collected and disclosed, as well as the right to access the collected information. But unlike the CCPA, the GDPR does not focus specifically on the sale of personal data\u2014the GDPR regulates 'processing' generally, which encompasses collection, disclosure, sale, and the many other forms of activity that may occur with respect to personal data. And the GDPR does not require special notice of an individual's right to block the sale of personal information, whereas the CCPA requires each regulated business to post a clear and conspicuous notice on the homepage of its website of a consumer's right to prevent such sale, which must be an active link for consumers to click stating: 'Do Not Sell My Personal Information.' (For children, the CCPA requires additional protection: children under the age of 16 must affirmatively opt-in before businesses can sell their personal data, and parents of children under the age of 13 must opt-in on the child's behalf.) Deletion of Personal Information. Another area in which the GDPR and CCPA are similar, but different enough to suggest distinct practices and policies, concerns the right of individuals to have their personal information deleted upon request. Under the GDPR, such a request must be honored in any of six circumstances, including when the personal information is no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which it was processed or the individual has withdrawn their consent to processing and there is no other legal ground for processing. The CCPA, while establishing a general right to deletion, narrows the right substantially by permitting a business to decline an individual's request for deletion of certain personal information under nine specific conditions, including if the business needs to keep that information to 'enable solely internal uses that are reasonably aligned with the expectations of the individual based on the individual's relationship with the business' or to '[o]therwise use the consumer's personal information, internally, in a lawful manner that is compatible with the context in which the consumer provided the information.' Third-Party Processing Contracts. Another noticeable difference between the CCPA and the GDPR is that the GDPR requires any 'controller' that shares personal information with a third-party 'processor' to enter into a contract with the processor that places specific data protection obligations on the processor. Although other privacy laws in the United States, including the HIPAA privacy regulations and the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act rules, impose such contractual obligations on 'covered entities' and financial institutions, respectively, the CCPA does not require the businesses it regulates to similarly bind third-party processors to data protection obligations. A more detailed summary of the similarities and differences between the CCPA and the GDPR is set forth in chart form below. As the summary indicates, while the CCPA and GDPR both are expansive pieces of legislation that similarly extend certain privacy rights to individuals in relation to their personal information, each law has subtleties in its definitions, mandates and exceptions that critically impact its application and interpretations. Businesses seeking to comply with both laws should view compliance with the CCPA as a separate phase of their data privacy program, albeit a phase that is following closely on the heels of, or is in conjunction with, their GDPR compliance. The specific details of both laws should be fully assessed so that business practices and policies can be implemented and adjusted accordingly.Summary Comparison of Key Provisions of the CCPA and the GDPR [5] ENDNOTES [1][6] 2017 California Assembly Bill No. 375, California 2017-2018 Regular Session (amending Part 4 of Division 3 of the California Civil Code), amended by 2017 California Senate Bill No. 1121. [2][7] See Coalition Letter[8]. [3][9] The CCPA directs the attorney general to adopt a number of regulations to further implement and clarify the scope and requirements of the law prior to its effective date. This may include the expansion or modification of the definition of protected 'personal information,' the adoption of additional exceptions as may be required for businesses to comply with state or federal law, and the implementation of rules and procedures governing the mechanics of the CCPA's opt-out and consumer-notice requirements. The attorney general is also granted the discretion to adopt additional regulations that are deemed to be necessary to the law's implementation. [4][10] The CCPA requires a business that collects a consumer's information to disclose to that consumer the categories and specific pieces of personal information that the business has collected, sold to a third party or disclosed for a business purpose, as well as the categories of third parties with whom the business has sold or disclosed personal information, among other items. Businesses must also disclose the categories of the sources from which personal information has been collected and identify the business or commercial purpose(s) underlying the collection of consumers' information. The CCPA establishes specific requirements for the form and timing of delivery of information requested by a consumer. [5][11] This definition provided in this chart has been abbreviated to include only its essential elements. The statutory definition contains additional guidance regarding certain categories of 'personal information' and certain terms included within the definition are defined separately under the statute.

The amendments are a partial response to extensive criticism of the legislation as overbroad, ambiguous, and excessively burdensome for organizations doing business in California. Throughout the summer, a coalition of businesses and industry associations (including the California Retailers Association, the Consumer Technology Association, the Internet Association and others), engaged in a concerted effort to persuade the California Legislature to clarify certain definitions in the law, limit its scope to prevent unintended consequences and delay its enforcement date to give regulated businesses the requisite time to establish systems and policies for compliance.2 The Legislature's response addresses a few, but by no means all, of the industry's concerns. It delays enforcement of most of the law's provisions until July 1, 2020, or six months after the California attorney general publishes final implementing regulations,3 whichever is earlier, and it clarifies certain exemptions from the law's reach, but it leaves intact a host of complex requirements. Any entity subject to the CCPA that interacts with individual consumers faces a considerable task in readying for compliance during the approximately 18-month period before the CCPA is enforced.The CCPA is being heralded by many as a \"first in the nation\" privacy regime. </p><p>Because it defines the \"personal information\" subject to its protection extremely broadly, and because it grants consumers extensive rights to control that information, it has been referred to as a US state's importation of the European Union (EU) General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (GDPR) that became enforceable on May 25, 2018. Many organizations that spent months or even years preparing to comply with the GDPR are considering whether those efforts will be sufficient to ensure compliancemdash;or at least to bring them close to compliancemdash;with the CCPA as well. But despite core similarities between the GDPR and the CCPA, having prepared for compliance with the former will not relieve a business of additional work to achieve compliance with the latter. Although GDPR compliance may help with some aspects of CCPA compliance, an assessment of the CCPA's requirements needs to be undertaken as a separate exercise and will require adopting new operational and policy measures.Key Differences Between the CCPA and the GDPRAs a threshold matter, there are certain core differences between the CCPA and the GDPR in terms of the scope of regulated persons, information and activities. For example:Covered Entities. The GDPR has broad application to any person or entity, regardless of location or nationality, that acts as a \"controller\" (i.e., a natural or legal person, public authority, agency, or other body which, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data) or a \"processor\" (i.e., a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which processes personal data on behalf of the controller) of personal data of individuals that is collected in connection with a presence in the EU. The CCPA is not so broad; it regulates a \"business,\" defined as a for-profit legal entity that does business in the state of California and which:Has annual gross revenues in excess of $25 million,Alone or in combination buys, receives, sells or shares for commercial purposes the personal information of 50,000 or more consumers, households or devices on an annual basis, orDerives 50 percent or more of its annual revenues from selling consumers' personal information, to provide consumers with a variety of rights with respect to the protection and control of their personal information.This difference in covered entities reflects the fundamental underpinnings of the two laws: The GDPR is grounded on the principle that, in the EU, privacy is a human right. Although the California Constitution similarly refers to the right to privacy as among the \"inalienable\" rights of all individuals, the CCPA itself does not seek to protect that right outside the commercial arena. It is ldquo;consumersrdquo; whose personal data is protected under the CCPA, and it is businesses, not other persons, upon which California has imposed the CCPA's requirements.Personal Information. The GDPR protects \"personal data\" which is \"any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (or a \"data subject\").\" The CCPA similarly protects \"personal information,\" but the definition of that term is designed to cover not only information identifiable to an individual consumer, but also to consumers that purchase or use products or services jointly: \"'Personal information' means information that identifies, relates to, describes, is capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular consumer or household.\"Importantly, however, as clarified by the recent amendments to the CCPA, certain information that is subject to protection under other US privacy regimes is exempt from the CCPA. For example, nonpublic personal financial information that is collected, processed, sold, or disclosed pursuant to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and its implementing rules or the California Financial Information Privacy Act is also generally exempt from the CCPA (although a breach in the security of this information would be actionable in a private party suit brought under the CCPA). In addition, medical information governed by the California Confidentiality of Medical Information Act and \"protected health information\" collected or created by \"covered entities\" or \"business associates\" as those terms are defined under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and its implementing rules are not subject to the CCPA. Information is exempt if it is collected as part of a clinical trial subject to protection under (i) the so-called \"Common Rule\" protecting human research subjects; (ii) the parallel rules of the Food and Drug Administration, or (iii) good clinical practice guidelines issued by the International Council for Harmonization in research. This latter exemption, vigorously advocated for by the pharmaceutical and medical device industries, is critical to prevent risks to the integrity of clinical trials that would exist if consumers who are research subjects could request access to or deletion of their personal data collected in the course of a clinical trial in which blinded studies and consistent data retention are essential to accurate analysis and reliable results.There is ambiguitymdash;or perhaps a serious deficiencymdash;in the exemption for research subject information, however, in that much research involving human subjects takes place outside of actual \"clinical trials\"mdash;for example, through surveys, interviews and other channels. The specific reference to data collected in a \"clinical trial\"mdash;as opposed to in human-subject research more generallymdash;may not encompass information collected for purposes of, for example, pharmacoeconomic or outcomes research, or for purposes such as identifying clinical trial participants. The medical research community may wish to seek further clarifying amendments to foreclose the possibility of an adverse impact on such nonclinical research.Core Consumer Rights. Most of the basic privacy rights protected by the CCPA and GDPR are similar. The CCPA declares the California Legislature's intent to ensure five core consumer rights of California residents with respect to personal information about them:The right to know what personal information is collected;The right to know whether that personal information is sold or disclosed, and to whom;4The right to \"say no\" to the sale of that personal information;The right to access that personal information; andThe right to equal service and price, regardless of exercising their privacy rights.The GDPR similarly grants individuals the right to notice of what types of personal information about them will be collected and disclosed, as well as the right to access the collected information. But unlike the CCPA, the GDPR does not focus specifically on the sale of personal datamdash;the GDPR regulates \"processing\" generally, which encompasses collection, disclosure, sale, and the many other forms of activity that may occur with respect to personal data. And the GDPR does not require special notice of an individual's right to block the sale of personal information, whereas the CCPA requires each regulated business to post a clear and conspicuous notice on the homepage of its website of a consumer's right to prevent such sale, which must be an active link for consumers to click stating: \"Do Not Sell My Personal Information.\" (For children, the CCPA requires additional protection: children under the age of 16 must affirmatively opt-in before businesses can sell their personal data, and parents of children under the age of 13 must opt-in on the child's behalf.)Deletion of Personal Information. Another area in which the GDPR and CCPA are similar, but different enough to suggest distinct practices and policies, concerns the right of individuals to have their personal information deleted upon request. Under the GDPR, such a request must be honored in any of six circumstances, including when the personal information is no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which it was processed or the individual has withdrawn their consent to processing and there is no other legal ground for processing. The CCPA, while establishing a general right to deletion, narrows the right substantially by permitting a business to decline an individual's request for deletion of certain personal information under nine specific conditions, including if the business needs to keep that information to \"enable solely internal uses that are reasonably aligned with the expectations of the individual based on the individual's relationship with the business\" or to \"[o]therwise use the consumer's personal information, internally, in a lawful manner that is compatible with the context in which the consumer provided the information.\"Third-Party Processing Contracts. Another noticeable difference between the CCPA and the GDPR is that the GDPR requires any \"controller\" that shares personal information with a third-party \"processor\" to enter into a contract with the processor that places specific data protection obligations on the processor. Although other privacy laws in the United States, including the HIPAA privacy regulations and the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act rules, impose such contractual obligations on \"covered entities\" and financial institutions, respectively, the CCPA does not require the businesses it regulates to similarly bind third-party processors to data protection obligations.A more detailed summary of the similarities and differences between the CCPA and the GDPR is set forth in chart form below. As the summary indicates, while the CCPA and GDPR both are expansive pieces of legislation that similarly extend certain privacy rights to individuals in relation to their personal information, each law has subtleties in its definitions, mandates and exceptions that critically impact its application and interpretations. Businesses seeking to comply with both laws should view compliance with the CCPA as a separate phase of their data privacy program, albeit a phase that is following closely on the heels of, or is in conjunction with, their GDPR compliance. The specific details of both laws should be fully assessed so that business practices and policies can be implemented and adjusted accordingly.Summary Comparison of Key Provisions of the CCPA and the GDPR[1]Footnote1. 2017 California Assembly Bill No. 375, California 2017-2018 Regular Session (amending Part 4 of Division 3 of the California Civil Code), amended by 2017 California Senate Bill No. 1121.&gt;2. See Coalition Letter[2].3. The CCPA directs the attorney general to adopt a number of regulations to further implement and clarify the scope and requirements of the law prior to its effective date. This may include the expansion or modification of the definition of protected \"personal information,\" the adoption of additional exceptions as may be required for businesses to comply with state or federal law, and the implementation of rules and procedures governing the mechanics of the CCPA's opt-out and consumer-notice requirements. The attorney general is also granted the discretion to adopt additional regulations that are deemed to be necessary to the law's implementation.&gt;4. The CCPA requires a business that collects a consumer's information to disclose to that consumer the categories and specific pieces of personal information that the business has collected, sold to a third party or disclosed for a business purpose, as well as the categories of third parties with whom the business has sold or disclosed personal information, among other items. Businesses must also disclose the categories of the sources from which personal information has been collected and identify the business or commercial purpose(s) underlying the collection of consumers' information. The CCPA establishes specific requirements for the form and timing of delivery of information requested by a consumer.&gt;5. This definition provided in this chart has been abbreviated to include only its essential elements. The statutory definition contains additional guidance regarding certain categories of \"personal information\" and certain terms included within the definition are defined separately under the statute.The content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter.

The questions the mostly grey-haired representatives fielded to the 33-year-old Facebook CEO ranged from the basic to the bizarre. 'How do you sustain a business model in which users don't pay for your service?', asked Orrin Hatch. </p><p>'Senator, we run ads', was Zuckerberg's reply. Other gems included[1]: 'Why am I suddenly seeing chocolate ads all over Facebook?', 'Is Facebook spying on the emails I send via WhatsApp?' and 'Do I have as many friends as I think I do?'. Thankfully, a policy white paper[2] released on Monday by Democratic Senator Mark Warner, himself a former tech executive, has belatedly offered a framework for politicians to use when representatives from the big tech firms return to Washington in September. The document lists 20 proposals compiled by Warner's staff that they hope will 'stir the pot and spark a wider discussion' in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal and Russian hacking of the 2016 US election, as well as a general unease about the growing power of the big tech firms. The proposals span three major areas: dealing with the epidemic of disinformation, strengthening privacy and consumer protection, and ensuring competition in the marketplace. Some of the ideas, including the introduction of a so-called 'Blade Runner law', which would require bots to be clearly and conspicuously labelled, represent technical tweaks that the platforms would likely find achievable and that some are already working towards implementing[3]. Other ideas call for fundamental changes to the business models of the big social media companies, and are unlikely to be met with much enthusiasm from Silicon Valley. One such proposal involves introducing media-style rules on fairness and libel. Specifically, it suggests changing section 230 of the US Communications Decency Act to make it possible for people to sue tech platforms that don't take down defamatory material posted by users. This change would take the onus away from victims to search for, and report, material that defames, threatens or falsely accuses them. Instead, that responsibility would fall to the platforms, which are better placed and resourced to prevent the spread of such material. In effect, the rule change would treat Facebook as a media company, not just a platform\u2014something it has long resisted. Another major proposal entails introducing legislation similar to the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) that would significantly toughen privacy laws and prevent the use of personal data without the unambiguous and individualised consent of the user. The proposals, which include 'data portability, the right to be forgotten, 72-hour data breach notification, 1st party consent, and other major data protections', would, in total, give users more transparency over and control of their own data. Perhaps the most radical idea in the white paper is a proposal to require platforms to calculate the value of each user's data. Such a requirement, the paper argues, would stimulate competition by providing 'price transparency' to consumers. It could also educate users about the true value of their data and attract new competitors with more favourable privacy provisions built into their products. It's easy to see how such a change might encourage users to get behind even more radical ideas that would require big tech companies to pay them to use their services and to hand over valuable data\u2014something advocates of 'data as labour' have been calling for elsewhere[4]. The paper found that calculating the value of each user's data could even help guide antitrust policy. Regulators could consider actions that increase the value of user data to be anticompetitive since they would be equivalent to a 'price' increase for users. Another proposal would see tech platforms labelled as 'information fiduciaries', which means they would need to follow similar rules to legal or financial institutions. The white paper drills down to underhanded tricks employed by tech firms known as 'dark patterns', which are used to corral users into accepting terms that invade their privacy and greatly benefit the service provider. It even looks ahead at emerging problems that are likely to make fighting false information online even harder, such as 'deepfake' technology, which will make detecting fake news even more difficult. It's not hard to see why the big tech companies would baulk at many of the ideas included in the white paper\u2014given that the major policy proposals would require a complete overhaul of their business models. Facebook lost a million users in Europe after the GDPR was introduced. Just last week, its stock plummeted, wiping more than US$120 billion off its market capitalisation. The next day, Twitter lost 15.5% of its market value. Part of the reason for the major market correction is that the social media platforms have been harassed into actually doing something about the harmful externalities their services are creating. Facebook is on a media blitz[5] to show that it's on the front foot in dealing with Russian disinformation campaigns that use its platform, and Twitter has been culling[6] fake accounts and bots. The companies have calculated that some short-term pain from Wall Street is worth it if it staves off any heavy-handed regulatory action from Washington. But how long will they continue to make that calculation before they give in to the stock market's perverse incentives of growing engagement and user numbers at any cost? Tech firms have been happy to turn a blind eye as long as they were making profits hand over fist. The US legislature, having so far demonstrated staggering incompetence, now has a set of ideas it can use to finally move the conversation along in a more substantive way.

Paper on Online Harms was published in April, the NSPCC estimates.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Based on the latest police recorded crime data from the first three months of 2019/2020, it is estimated an average of six online abuse offences against a child was recorded in Wales every day for just over nine months.</p><p>The Online Harms Reduction Regulator Bill will be introduced into the House of Lords today, and the charity is backing the Private Member's Bill.</p><p>It would require Ofcom to prepare for regulation by effectively appointing it as an interim online harms regulator.</p><p>The NSPCC supports the Billl as it believes it will speed up the timescales for the Government to uphold their manifesto promise by introducing comprehensive legislation to protect children from abuse online.</p><p>Until then, the charity estimates 90 online child abuse crimes a day across England and Wales could continue to happen.</p><p>The legislation would include the establishment of an online regulator that would enforce Duty of Care which would legally require social networks to ensure their platforms are safe for children to use and companies could face fines or criminal prosecution if they breach their responsibilities.</p><p>As part of its Wild West Web campaign, the charity has been calling for these plans since April 2018, saying it would set a global standard for online child protection.</p><p>It is now urging the Government to set out a clear timeline for implementation and to introduce a comprehensive Online Harms Bill to set out the powers of the Duty of Care regulator with child safety at the heart of it.</p><p>The charity NSPCC also wants the industry to be proactive in identifying and stopping child abuse on platforms and not waiting until the last possible moment to keep children safe.</p><p>\"By our estimates, an average of six potential online abuse crimes against children come to light a day in Wales, so it is crystal clear regulation cannot come soon enough,\" said Des Mannion, NSPCC Wales head of policy.</p><p>\"The Prime Minister must confirm plans to press ahead with a comprehensive Duty of Care, and urgently introduce an Online Harms Bill that will deliver a well-resourced regulator with the powers to take on big tech.</p><p>\"Anything less will let tech giants off the hook and have a significant impact on hundreds of children across Wales, their families and law enforcement who are left to fight increasingly complex online child abuse day in and day out.\"</p><p>\u00b7 Published figures do not reveal how many of the Obscene Publication offences involve images of children but results from the NSPCC's previous Freedom of Information request suggest the vast majority are.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

Its gear helps clients compete with streaming video from Netflix, Hulu, Amazon and others.</p><p>Arris' products include routers and cable modems, set tops, gateways, encoders and a platform for multiscreen content marketing.</p><p>\"The really exciting thing about the company now is that it is in a real leadership position in an industry that is experiencing massive technological shifts,\" said Brian Coyne, an analyst with National Alliance Securities. He has followed Arris since 2002.</p><p>Growing With Focus</p><p>Suwanee, Ga.-based Arris was formed in 2000 to address early opportunities in cable modems.</p><p>In 2007 it expanded further into network products with its acquisition of C-COR, which also gave it video on demand and other products, including software.</p><p>Buying Motorola Home from a subsidiary of Google in April 2013 was especially transformational.</p><p>The $2.2 billion cash deal, plus 10.6 million shares of stock issued to Google, gave Arris new cable TV equipment, including a video set-top box business. Google still owns a 7% stake in Arris.</p><p>\"It essentially tripled the size of the company,\" Coyne said.</p><p>Revenue jumped from $1.3 billion in 2012 to $3.6 billion in 2013, which included less than nine months with the Motorola Home cable-gear business under Arris' belt.</p><p>Until the deal, Arris had been focused on a smaller slice of the market -- products needed to facilitate high-speed data inside networks and the home, Coyne says.</p><p>Motorola's set-top box business under Google was part of a larger acquisition that the search giant made earlier. But the business had \"lost its footing\" by the time Arris bought it, Coyne said.</p><p>To its credit, he noted, Arris made \"a very impressive rebound.\"</p><p>The company now has around a 35% share of the cable-modem market, 15% of the set-top box market and 40% of the cable modem termination system market (for providing high-speed data), RBC Capital Markets analyst Mark Sue said in a recent report.</p><p>Sue noted that Arris is gaining share from chief rival Cisco Systems, which he said is \"stepping away\" from some deals in customer-premises equipment.</p><p>And he pointed out that Arris has more than a year's head start on Cisco with its E6000 converged edge router, addressing a market where Cisco's new products aren't expected to ship until early next year.</p><p>Arris says the E6000, which rolled out in large numbers late last year, is doing exceedingly well. It is used to provide subscribers high-speed data service such as cable Internet or voice-over-Internet protocol.</p><p>The E6000 platforms \"are shipping with only 25% of the potential capacity activated, which leaves room for meaningful incremental software sales as the remaining capacity is needed,\" Stephens analyst Tim Quillin said in a research note.</p><p>Besides Cisco, rivals include Pace, a British company run out of Fort Lauderdale, Fla.</p><p>On the networking side of the competition are San Jose, Calif.-based Harmonic and Boston-area Casa Systems.</p><p>Motorola had been a rival until Arris acquired its TV equipment business from Google.</p><p>The Motorola acquisition occurred as a new tech cycle was emerging.</p><p>The cycle is different from past periods, Coyne says. It's being driven not by service providers, but by consumers wanting more online, over-the-top video.</p><p>The transition \"touches on all parts of the company's business, not just set-top boxes, but also its networking-cloud division,\" he said.</p><p>\"We're in the early days of the transition,\" he said.</p><p>In With The New</p><p>Arris' management declined to comment ahead of the release of second-quarter results in late July.</p><p>In a first-quarter conference call, CEO Bob Stanzione said the firm is benefiting from \"this almost explosion of new over-the-top services coming out, this competition to see who has the best speeds and who has the best service and who has the highest quality customer experience.\"</p><p>Take cable giant Comcast's bid to take over the second biggest giant in the cable business, Time Warner Cable. The merger is all about creating a next-generation video platform, analysts say. It would also expand Comcast nationwide, including the top markets of Los Angeles and New York.</p><p>The merger -- which could be completed by early next year pending regulatory approval -- will bring more business to Arris, Coyne says.</p><p>\"There will be a lot of network integration,\" he said. \"This is a situation where the market opportunity gets bigger as a result (of the merger).\"</p><p>That contrasts with past mergers in the industry, where markets were split up or consolidated, with duplicate networks eliminated.</p><p>Comcast and Time Warner Cable are Arris' top two customers. They accounted for 16.6% and 13% of first-quarter sales, respectively. Arris' next largest customers were Charter Communications and AT&amp;T.</p><p>Comcast, Time Warner Cable, AT&amp;T, Charter and others are all making investments in equipment to \"future proof\" their networks, said Sue in his report.</p><p>He noted that telcos are expanding their voice and data service with video offerings.</p><p>Arris is also gaining new business from outside the U.S. as small to midsize service providers upgrade and expand their networks.</p><p>In April, China Network Systems adopted Arris' high-definition set-top boxes and a middleware platform to enable its transition to digital video. China Network serves more than 1 million cable subscribers in Taiwan.</p><p>Arris' financial results are gaining momentum in tandem with the new tech upgrades.</p><p>Quarterly revenue in the past three years has grown 58% on average, while the average quarterly EPS gain has clocked in at 33%.</p><p>First-quarter revenue jumped 246% year-over-year to $1.225 billion, largely due to the Motorola Home deal. Earnings rose 88% to 47 cents a share. Analysts expect full-year revenue to grow 51% to nearly $5.5 billion and earnings to climb 52% to $2.52 a share, according to a Thomson Reuters poll.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INVDLY-5029940</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INVDLY2014</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5CMR-C6N1-JCBB-K4B4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8204</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-12-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1081\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2014 Investor's Business Daily, Inc.

(The Swedish version was fabulous; Hollywood's come out in December.)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I had read the first two and, unusual for me, wanted to buy the third one. But I wanted to buy it in paperback to read during my commute, and not in hardback. (OK, the paperback is cheaper. Sue me.) I was dismayed to see that it wasn't available in paperback at the time I wanted to read it.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Wait, let me clarify that last statement. It wasn't available in paperback in the United States. It was available in paperback from a little gem of a site (since bought by Amazon), the Book Depository, located in the Bailiwick of Guernsey with it's warehouse in the U.K. And so I purchased it from there, months before the book was available in the form I wanted here.</p><p>The site caters to American customers because there were prices listed in U.S. dollars, and not in English pounds sterling. It also offers free shipping. Pass up a deal like that? No way.</p><p>Now let's fast forward from April, 2010, to November 16, 2011 when the House Judiciary Committee held its hearing on HR 3261, the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA). The proceedings were a perfect illustration of a \"stacked\" hearing. That is, the proponents of the bill put five witnesses on the panel, to only one from the opposition.</p><p>In a way, the hearing was perfectly fitting because the bill itself is \"stacked\" against just about every aspect of the Internet -- regular consumers, companies that make their living online, cybersecurity specialists, civil libertarians and venture capitalists, to name a few. There was one exception. This is a bill written by, and written for, the Big Entertainment industry, and only for them as the latest chapter in their campaign to take control of the Internet and stamp out what they see as a massive \"piracy\" problem. Anyone else was not included or had their views dismissed with a wave of the Congressional hand as orchestrated by Big Media. Even if one accepts there is a piracy issue, the question is whether the cure is worse than the disease. In this case, it's much, much worse.</p><p>For purposes of showing how drastic and far-reaching that bill is, and why it has caused such a strong reaction, let's go back to my innocent purchase of a paperback book. If SOPA were to become law, the U.S. publisher of the Millennium paperbacks could accuse the foreign site of infringement and of causing harm, send a note to major credit card companies demanding that they stop processing payments to the site and then sit back and watch the foreign site's business wither away while it tries to work its way back through a legal thicket. At the same time, Book Depository or any foreign site so accused and so damaged has no recourse against its U.S. accuser. </p><p>This scenario is possible because of the fine print of the SOPA bill. A site is considered under the bill as a \"foreign infringing site\" if it is either directed to the U.S. or \"is used by users in the United States.\" Just like that, Congress, led by those Republicans who decry Net Neutrality as (incorrectly) \"regulating the Internet,\" have extended U.S. law to every website in every other country in the world where a U.S. web surfer would come ashore. There is no penalty against anyone for making a false accusation because the bill grants the accusers immunity from prosecution, we suppose on the assumption that the intent of the action was noble.</p><p>Also under the bill, the government could get a court order to require search engines and Internet service providers to redirect Internet users away from a website even if the site didn't intend to support infringing materials.</p><p>No wonder, then, that the European Parliament (EP) on Nov. 17 passed a resolution on the topic of the Nov. 28 European Union-U.S. summit saying that the EP stresses \"the need to protect the integrity of the global Internet and freedom of communication by refraining from unilateral measures to revoke IP addresses or domain names.\"</p><p>The opposition in Washington to this misbegotten bill has united people from across the political spectrum, led by Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-CA), a staunch defender of tech companies and civil liberties, and Rep. Darrell Issa (R-CA), a conservative member of the House. Groups like (my day job employer) Public Knowledge and Demand Progress are on the same side as conservative groups like Americans for Job Security and activist Patrick Ruffini's \"Don't Censor the Net.\" In the Senate, Democrats like Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR) and Maria Cantwell (D-WA) have pledged along with Republicans Jerry Moran (KS) and Tea Party favorite Rand Paul (KY) to block the Senate version of the bill, which would be a disaster also. A move is on now to persuade the Senate leadership not to take up their version, which has already passed the Judiciary Committee.</p><p>Around the country, hundreds of websites, including Lofgren's, participated in American Censorship Day by blacking out part of their sites. Demand Progress delivered petitions signed by hundreds of thousands of people opposing the bill.</p><p>Tech companies were once seen as the bright spot in our economy, leading examples of innovation and growth. But at the hearing, the tech sector concerns at the bill were ignored or dismissed as overwrought, even as some of the biggest names in the business, like Google, Zynga, Facebook and Twitter, expressed their opposition. Defenders of the bill almost made big tech companies sounds like mafia fronts, using legit businesses as cover to hide ill-gotten gains from \"piracy\" and other nefarious deeds, saying it was no wonder that huge companies were seeking to protect ill-gotten gains, as if the entire web ecosystem wasn't at risk, companies and organizations big and small, would be put in jeopardy through this bill.</p><p>It was truly embarrassing to watch the elected representatives prostrate themselves to the entertainment business which is dwarfed, in economic terms, by companies that provide goods and services over the Internet. With the exception of one witness from Google and a stirring defense from Lofgren, the tech sectors were ignored or disregarded without any intellectual consideration by both Republicans and Democrats on the Judiciary Committee. Instead, Google was under constant, and largely irrelevant, attack from the Committee members. Given the rhetoric, the SOPA bill could just as easily be called the Slavish Oblivious Politicians Act.</p><p>Of course, Republicans and other SOPA supporters are still going to Silicon Valley in search of campaign funds. It would be nice if people there let the GOP know how anti-job and anti-growth that bill really is.</p><p>The one group of opponents that the bill's backers may not be able to ignore as easily are those concerned about the harm to Internet security the bill would have. By fiddling with the Internet's essential plumbing of the Domain Name System (DNS), the show biz team and its acolytes could cause some real problems. No Internet technical experts or cybersecurity experts testified, but they are making their concerns known. Most recently, Leonard Napolitano, the director of the Sandia National Laboratories Center for Computer Sciences and Information Technologies joined others in saying that the bill would \"negatively impact U.S. and global cybersecurity and Internet functionality.\" Napolitano, as with others before him, said the DNS blocking and re-routing wouldn't work and would expose Internet routing traffic to less secure servers.</p><p>Against these concerns, the representative of the Motion Picture Association of America could only tell the Judiciary Committee, \"change the code\" of the DNS security regime (DNSSEC) and the Committee members themselves respond only with platitudes that deny any problems at all. Nonsense.</p><p>There are reasonable ways to crack down on what the entertainment industry sees as \"piracy,\" even if studies have show their concerns are overblown. This SOPA bill and its Senate companion, Protect Intellectual Property Act (PIPA) are not the ways, because they do far more harm than good. It's time for Big Entertainment, with all of their lobbying dollars to shut these productions down and start over before other countries get wise to the game and pass the same legislation aimed at our websites. Then nobody will be able to buy anything.</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-AOLB10331013216592980559649802</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AOLB-5176</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:548Y-HTD1-JBF5-T44B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1410\"/><timeReceived>11:34 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2011 Newstex LLC<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2011 Politics Daily</copyright><publicationName>Political Machine</publicationName><aggregationName>Newstex Web Blogs</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"11\" year=\"2011\"><dateText>November 18, 2011 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Computer &amp;

See related World Cup group G: England and Belgium win opening games[2] The amendments to the EU's Directive on Copyright in the Digital Single Market[3]were approved by theEuropean Parliament's Committee on Legal Affairson Wednesday. The changes include the addition of Article 13, a measure that critics say would force publishers to install automated filters to prevent the uploading of copyrighted material. </p><p>Last week 70 leading figures in the field of technology signed a letter[4] opposing the article. The signatories, who include world wide web inventor Tim Berners-Lee and co-founder of Wikipedia Jimmy Wales, wrote: 'The damage that this may do to the free and open internet as we know it is hard to predict, but in our opinions could be substantial... The cost of putting in place the necessary automatic filtering technologies will be expensive and burdensome, and yet those technologies have still not developed to a point where their reliability can be guaranteed.' Summarising their arguments, Raegan MacDonald, a policy advisor at Mozilla, toldThe Next Web[5]: 'I think Article 13 is the biggest threat to the internet as we know it right now.'What is Article 13 proposing?Until now, the so-called Ecommerce Directive has given online platforms 'broad protection from being subject to copyright penalties when they simply acted as a conduit for user uploads', says Gizmodo[6]. Article 13 will hold those platforms responsible for any content that their users upload, meaning that the platform is liable for any copyright infringement.What's wrong with that?Mozilla's MacDonald argues that Article 13 threatens the continuation of a healthy and open internet, in part because of the breadth of the definition in the proposal. 'The way this article is drafted, it kind of assumes that it's being specific while it's being extremely broad. So it's not just about audio/visual content, it's about all types and forms of copyright. It would be including lots of type of different content, even code sharing,' she says. Activist Cory Doctorow agrees, calling it a 'foolish, terrible idea'. Doctorow says that the protections necessary to comply with Article 13 - probably in the form of sophisticated upload filters - are not up to scratch. Writing on news website Boing Boing[7], he said: 'No filter exists that can even approximate this. And the closest equivalents are mostly run by American companies, meaning that US big tech is going to get to spy on everything Europeans post and decide what gets censored and what doesn't.' According to Gizmodo, what is 'possibly the most important problem with Article 13 is that it makes no exceptions for fair use, a foundation of the internet and essential caveat in the law that allows people to remix copyrighted works'. Internet memes - 'which most commonly take the form of viral images, endlessly copied, repeated and riffed on', notes Wired[8] - could fall into a number of the categories prohibited by Article 13. This would create 'an improbable scenario in which one of the internet's most distinctive and commonplace forms of communication is banned', Wired adds.What do Article 13 supporters say?Defenders of the legislation say that critics are exaggerating as a result of assumptions they're making about how the legislation will be implemented. Axel Voss, rapporteur of the European Parliament for the Copyright Directive, believes that the proposed reform will greatly benefit both European citizens and publishers. 'I feel that the criticism hasn't been really balanced and not based on the actual text we've proposed,' Voss told The Next Web[9](TNW). 'That's why all these claims of censorship and upload filters are all a total exaggeration.' Voss 'points out that there's no mention of upload filters in the proposal and that it's simply making it mandatory to prevent copyright infringement from happening in the first place, something which is already existent in EU law', adds the tech news site. Many publishers are also in favour, including the Independent Music Companies Association (Impala). 'This is a strong and unambiguous message sent by the European Parliament,'executive chair Helen Smith told the BBC[10]. 'It clarifies what the music sector has been saying for years - if you are in the business of distributing music or other creative works, you need a licence, clear and simple. It's time for the digital market to catch up with progress.'

Billions of dollars have been invested in healthcare AI deals in recent years.3 But as an AI-nascent industry, healthcare AI is surrounded with as much hype as hope. Even with a projected annual savings of $150 billion for the U.S. healthcare economy by 2026, AI remains a misunderstood technology.13 It carries with it the burden of multiple myths and is often difficult to move from pilot to scale.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In order to sort through the hype, financial leaders should recognize five important realities and understand the work to be done to ensure real-world, practical ROI from AI.</p><p>REALITY NO. 1: HEALTHCARE HAS A DATA QUALITY PROBLEM</p><p>AI requires large data sets of accurate, pertinent and clean data to statistically correlate patterns and trends. Most healthcare information systems were not implemented with analytics or AI in mind. Problems in data collection accuracy, variable data definitions and limited interoperability across disparate systems create data quality issues. Many data sources are siloed or are paper-centric. It's not unusual for one department or group to rework data without reaching out to others to ensure consistency. Consequently, healthcare finance, business and clinical analysts struggle to trust each other's data.</p><p>Work to be done: Improve readiness for AI through enhanced data quality. Data governance work groups composed of financial, business and clinical data consumers can assist analytics and technical teams in clarifying how data is defined, captured, structured, transferred, cleaned and presented. Improvements in the data quality landscape for most health systems will require answers to questions such as:</p><p>* Who has access to specific data (e.g., management level, license requirements, division, internal versus external, sensitivity)?</p><p>* What actions can be taken with the data (e.g., view only, modify, delete)?</p><p>* What are the primary sources of the data (e.g., electronic health record or enterprise resources planning software, point system, external database)?</p><p>* What are the organization's standards for data quality (e.g., data completeness, validity and accuracy)?</p><p>* What specific decisions will be made with the data?</p><p>Without preparation and improved data quality, the effectiveness of AI will be compromised.</p><p>REALITY NO. 2: AI CONSISTS OF MULTIPLE TECHNOLOGIES AND TOOLS</p><p>AI is not a single technology but an umbrella term that includes machine learning, natural language processing, robotics and algorithms. When combined with process automation tools, AI can accomplish the following:</p><p>* Reduce manual repetitive tasks, allow the workforce to focus on high-value activities and make resources more productive and lower costs</p><p>* Generate deep insights to enable real-time operations, identify trends for decisionmakers and set the stage for a predictive and personalized future</p><p>Healthcare is still in the early stages of applying this technology, and many leaders are unclear regarding differences in specific AI capabilities and requirements for success.</p><p>Work to be done: Understand what AI can and cannot do. Today's healthcare and broader AI solution market is composed of narrow or weak AI, but applications will grow in the coming decades, as seen in the exhibit on page 34.</p><p>Designed for a single purpose and focused on a specific data set, narrow AI does not have the ability to think, adapt, learn or reason. These technologies depend on black boxes or algorithms programmed by humans. Often, influenced by incorrect problem statements and data curation methods, unintended consequences of biased data or unsuitable modeling techniques, healthy skepticism is needed. Financial leaders should apply the same rigor to AI that they do to other technologies:</p><p>* Educate leadership regarding the maturity of and practical uses for AI in healthcare today.</p><p>* Don't fall for vendor acronyms or hype regarding the underlying algorithms and statistical models; ask for an explanation in terms financial, business and clinical leadership can understand.</p><p>* Work with business or clinical decisionmakers to validate the results of the models within your own environment.</p><p>* Evaluate the risks associated with inappropriate projections.</p><p>* Explore the value, business case and ROI of the solution.</p><p>Financial leaders should work with their organizations to understand that the holy grail of AI - where machines exhibit cognitive skills, including the ability to solve problems or make judgements under uncertainty - is not available in any industry today. Most agree that strong AI is still realistically 20 to 30 years away. Artificial superintelligence, where the intelligence is smarter than humans, is a controversial topic. Researchers agree that type of AI won't be a reality for at least 45 years, if ever.c</p><p>REALITY NO. 3: AI WILL REQUIRE NEW SKILLS AND COMPETENCIES</p><p>There is a common belief that AI will replace humans in the workplace. The more likely nearterm scenario, however, is the automation of routine, mundane tasks and augmentation of the work that remains. Digital transformation and innovation enabled by AI and other digital technologies will require new operating models and skillsets.</p><p>Work to be done: Create data translator and business architect roles. Although there is a need for new data skills and analytics competencies to support AI, do not jump to recruit data scientists. Rather, to reap the benefits of AI, focus on changing the way work is done, jobs are defined and decisions are made through AI capabilities. Financial leaders should encourage the creation of data translator and business architect roles to assist in the following:</p><p>* Centralizing AI skill development and learning</p><p>* Identifying problems to be solved and opportunities to create new value</p><p>* Collaborating with data professionals to design models and algorithms</p><p>* Helping the business interpret findings, rearchitect business processes and decision-making practices</p><p>* Designing new jobs, retraining talent and managing change</p><p>* Executing new operating models</p><p>REALITY NO. 4: NEW SECURITY, PRIVACY AND ETHICS CONCERNS SHOULD BE ADDRESSED</p><p>Despite its potential to streamline work processes and improve decision-making, skeptics and enthusiasts agree there will be challenges ahead. Most health systems are acutely aware of the need for HIPAA-compliant systems, even though the 23-year-old regulatory program was established without consideration of today's AI capabilities. Storage of large AI data sets will become a paramount concern with increases in ransomware and cyberattacks. While consumers are generally supportive of AI assistance in healthcare, as companies such as Amazon, Google, Apple, Facebook, Microsoft and others apply their expertise to the problems of the industry, there is growing concern of a high-tech backlash with patients expressing fears over unauthorized data sharing.d</p><p>Work to be done: Refine data privacy, security and ethics policies. Today's healthcare organizations do not need patient consent to sell patient data to third parties; the data simply needs to be de-identified. As the public becomes more aware of the risks of such practices, financial leaders should ensure refinement of existing policies to balance the tension between vendors' need to fuel AI algorithms and patient privacy rights. Specific actions include:</p><p>* Consumer and patient advocate participation in the development of protocols for informed consent, data sharing, AI-augmented clinical care, etc.</p><p>* Oversight of data use agreements with vendors regarding data protection, intended use of data and compliance with standards</p><p>* Updated understanding and compliance with regulations impacting data, including the 21st Century Cures Act and transparency requirements for 2020, including expanded patient access to health information, improved interoperability of health records, prevention of information blocking and privacy and security of data</p><p>REALITY NO. 5: AI IS IN A HYPE CYCLE</p><p>Silver-bullet thinking and multiple vendor solutions/pilots can be disruptive even to the most visionary organizations. In an environment where data and analytics resources are constrained, heavy lifting is required to develop robust data assets from which to extract realtime and predictive insights.</p><p>Work to be done: Leverage finance's strength in decision support. Research from the University of Applied Sciences HTW Berlin (HTW) explains that the disruptive effect of AI on jobs depends on the extent to which the technology influences the productivity of a specific task. Within five years, HTW predicts that the majority of financial management tasks, roles and structures across most industries will see massive change based on AI's impact.e In healthcare, finance organizations can leverage strengths in financial decision support to narrow the focus of appropriate use cases, convene collaborative, multidisciplinary teams, standardize and organize the data, define success measures and set the stage for better performance, service and outcomes.</p><p>As AI expands to make operational processes less costly; improve how consumers engage with healthcare providers and services; and begin to digitize prevention, diagnostics and treatment, financial leaders don't need to be risk takers to move forward with AI. Smart, sound, pragmatic investment will set the stage for value orchestration and long-term innovation.

Oversight of any harms will be voluntary self-regulation by my business.</p><p>Would people stand for this? Doubtful, but that's exactly what's happening with artificial intelligence (AI).</p><p>Society is one big AI experiment right now: we're the testing ground for a massive techno-economic transformation we've not consented to and that most of us don't even understand properly. AI is being deployed across society with little input into what we actually want from it.</p><p>Our experimental status is evidenced, for example, in the Facebook-Cambridge Analytica scandal: our very personal political decisions, choices, and discussions have been distorted and trashed with little comeuppance for the Big Tech companies intent on making a buck at the expense of spreading misinformation, disinformation, and outright lies. And it looks like this will be the new normal until we can rein in the algorithms developed by Facebook, YouTube, Google, and others.</p><p>A key policy approach for addressing this AI roll-out is something called \"agile governance,\" promoted especially by international institutions like the World Economic Forum. In this framework, we, as individuals and a society, are supposed to adapt to the emerging AI technologies that we don't understand, and aren't even expected to bother understanding. It entails shifting oversight of new technologies from the government to the private sector, and comes across as another term for \"leave it to the market\" - which today really means leave it to a Big Tech monopoly.</p><p>Instead of this state of affairs, we need a more nuanced approach to emerging AI technologies in order to understand how they're going to reconfigure our societies, yes, but also how our societies configure these technologies in our own image.</p><p>AI, in particular, is often premised on taking our personal data - usually with our (un)informed consent - and using it to train algorithms, claiming any resulting inferences (data on our data) derived from that training as proprietary.</p><p>At its core, it's about turning our personal data into a private asset. Importantly, though, our personal data often consists of an array of problematic biases, narrow-minded stereotypes, and egregious prejudices. Our social, political, and economic assumptions and expectations are built into AI, including the assumption that it's just too complex and quick-moving for slow government and regulators to keep up with.</p><p>To properly get at these issues, we have to go beyond the simplistic notion that all we need to do is analyze the implications of AI for society: instead we need to study how these social, political, and economic assumptions configure AI in certain ways and not others. A clear example of this is the critique by Safiya Noble, Professor at UCLA, of the racist assumptions underpinning the search algorithms deployed by Google.</p><p>Instead of succumbing to the simplistic view, then, it makes more sense to take a pro-active approach to AI and to set out explicitly what we want to achieve with it - socially, politically, economically. Do we want it to be used to destabilize democratic debate and elections? Probably not, so let's regulate against that outcome now and not after it happens.</p><p>My suggestion would be to establish an equivalent of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for AI whose regulatory purpose is to evaluate and judge the potential effects of AI projects before they are unleashed on the world. Rather than a regulatory free-for-all, we need to decide what we want from AI and we need to regulate what we don't want.</p><p>If we want to stop the spread of lies, then we should make it illegal; if we want to stop algorithmic prejudice, then we should test for it; if we want to stop algorithmic tacit collusion in automated price-setting, then we should ban it. And we should do so now.</p><p>Kean Birch is an associate professor in and graduate program director of the science and technology studies graduate program at York University.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MTRNWS-2020011356854684</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MTRNWS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XYW-HYJ1-JDH1-C01G-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438721</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"730\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Free Daily News Group Inc.

It will be important to keep new regulation focused and limited to truly high-risk cases,\" said Digital Europe Director General Cecilia Bonefeld-Dahl.</p><h>What do critics say?</h><p>Some actors in the industry are worried that it will be difficult to define the nature and scope of high-risk cases.

It is authored by an interdisciplinary team from the University of Newcastle, Australia.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As the project lead, and someone interested in carefully incubating emerging technologies in educational settings to develop an authentic evidence-base, I relished the opportunity to explore the often-overlooked ethical aspects of introducing new tech in to schools. To this end, I developed a customised ethical framework designed to encourage critical dialogue and increased policy attention on introducing artificial intelligence into schools.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We used to think artificial intelligence would wheel itself in to classrooms in the sci-fi guise of a trusty robo-instructor (a vision that is unlikely to come true for some time, if ever). What we didn't envisage was how artificial intelligence would become invisibly infused into the computing applications we use in everyday life such as internet search engines, smartphone assistants, social media tagging and navigation technology, and integrated communication suites.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I want to tell you about artificial intelligence in schools, give you an idea of the ethical dilemmas that our educators are facing and introduce you to the framework I developed.</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>What is AI (artificial intelligence)?<br/><br/><br/></p><p>Artificial intelligence is an umbrella term that refers to a machine or computer program that can undertake tasks or activities that require features of human intelligence such as planning, problem solving, recognition of patterns, and logical action.</p><p>While the term was first coined in the 1950s, the new millennium marked rapid advancement in AI driven by the expansion of the Internet, availability of 'Big Data' and Cloud storage and more powerful computing and algorithms. Applications of AI have benefited from improvements in computer vision, graphics processing, and speech recognition.</p><p>Interestingly, adults and children often overestimate the intelligence and capability of machines, so it is important to understand that right now we are in a period of 'narrow AI' which is able to do a single or focused task, sometimes in ways that can outperform humans. The diagram below from our report (adapted from an <url normalizedValue=\"https://theconversation.com/understanding-the-four-types-of-ai-from-reactive-robots-to-self-aware-beings-67616\">article</url> in The Conversation by Arend Hinz, Michigan State University 's Assistant Professor of Integrative Biology &amp; Computer Science and Engineering) provides an overview of types of AI and current state-of-play:</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>AI in education<br/><br/><br/></p><p>In education, AI is in some intelligent tutoring systems and powers some pedagogical agents (helpers) in educational software. It can be integrated into the communication suites marketed by Big Tech (for example in <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-were-using-ai-outlook-working-behind-scenes-help-you-sareen/\">email</url>) and will increasingly be part of learning management systems that present predicative and data-driven performance dashboards to teachers and school leaders. There is also some (very concerning) talk of integrating facial recognition technology into classrooms to monitor the 'mood' and 'engagement' of students despite       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/eprint/SAUES8UM69EN8TSMUGF9/full\">research</url> suggesting that inferring affective states from facial expression is fraught with difficulties.</p><p>Engaging with AI in education also involves an understanding of <url normalizedValue=\"https://everythingcomputerscience.com/books/Machine%20Learning%20for%20Humans.pdf\">machine learning</url> (ML), whereby algorithms can help a machine learn to identify patterns in data and make predictions without having pre-programmed models or rules.</p><p><br/><br/><br/>Worldwide concern about the ethics of AI and ML<br/><br/><br/></p><p>The actual and conceivable ethical implications of AI and ML have been canvassed for several decades. Since 2016, the US, UK and European Union have conducted large scale public inquiries which have grappled with question of what a good and just AI society would look like.</p><p>As Ume\u00e5 University's Professor of Computing Science, Virginia Dignum, <url normalizedValue=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10676-018-9450-z\">puts it</url>:</p><excerpt><bodyText><p>What does it mean for an AI system to make a decision? What are the moral, societal and legal consequences of their actions and decisions? Can an AI system be held accountable for its actions? How can these systems be controlled once their learning capabilities bring them into states that are possibly only remotely linked to their initial, designed, setup?

AI is 'opaque' because it is often invisibly infused into computing systems in ways that can influence our interactions, decisions, moods and sense of self without us being aware of this.</p><p>The 'black box' of AI is twofold: \u00a0The proprietary nature of AI products creates a situation where industry does not open up the workings of the product and its algorithms for public or third party scrutiny. In cases of deep machine learning there is an autonomous learning and decision-making process which occurs with minimal human intervention, with this technical process being so complicated that even the computer scientists that have created the program cannot fully explain why the machine came to a decision it did.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Digital human rights issues</emphasis><br/></p><p>Digital human rights issues related to the harvesting the 'Big Data' used in ML where humans have not given informed consent or where data is used in ways that were not consented to.

While universities may have in-house expertise or the resources to buy-in independent expertise to assess AI products, principals making procurement decisions will probably not be able to do this. Furthermore, it is incumbent on educational bureaucracies to seek independent expert advice and be transparent in their policies and decision-making regarding such procurement so that school communities can have trust that the technology will not do harm through biased systems or by violating teacher and students sovereignty of their data and privacy.</p><p><br/><br/><br/>Our report offers practical advice<br/><br/><br/></p><p>Along with our <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.themandarin.com.au/file:///C:\\Users\\els201\\Downloads\\Artificial%20Intelligence%20and%20Emerging%20Technologies%20in%20Schools%20Research%20Report\">report</url>, the       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.education.gov.au/support-science-technology-engineering-and-mathematics\">project</url> included infographics on Artificial Intelligence and virtual and augmented reality for students, and 'short read' literature reviews for teachers.</p><p>In the report we carefully unpack the multi-faceted ethical dimensions of AI and ML for education systems and offer the customised <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Education, Ethics and AI (EEAI)</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">framework</emphasis> \u00a0(below) for teachers, school leaders and policy-makers so that they can make informed decisions regarding design, implementation and governance of AI-powered systems.

The very basis of education is being able to make 'fair calls' and to transparently explain educational action and, importantly, to be accountable for these decisions.</p><p>When we lose sight of this, at a school or school-systems level, we find ourselves in questionable ethical and educational territory.

It is authored by an interdisciplinary team from the University of Newcastle, Australia.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As the project lead, and someone interested in carefully incubating emerging technologies in educational settings to develop an authentic evidence-base, I relished the opportunity to explore the often-overlooked ethical aspects of introducing new tech in to schools. To this end, I developed a customised ethical framework designed to encourage critical dialogue and increased policy attention on introducing artificial intelligence into schools.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We used to think artificial intelligence would wheel itself in to classrooms in the sci-fi guise of a trusty robo-instructor (a vision that is unlikely to come true for some time, if ever). What we didn't envisage was how artificial intelligence would become invisibly infused into the computing applications we use in everyday life such as internet search engines, smartphone assistants, social media tagging and navigation technology, and integrated communication suites.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I want to tell you about artificial intelligence in schools, give you an idea of the ethical dilemmas that our educators are facing and introduce you to the framework I developed.</p><p><br/><br/><br/>What is AI (artificial intelligence)?<br/><br/><br/></p><p>Artificial intelligence is an umbrella term that refers to a machine or computer program that can undertake tasks or activities that require features of human intelligence such as planning, problem solving, recognition of patterns, and logical action.</p><p>While the term was first coined in the 1950s, the new millennium marked rapid advancement in AI driven by the expansion of the Internet, availability of 'Big Data' and Cloud storage and more powerful computing and algorithms. Applications of AI have benefited from improvements in computer vision, graphics processing, and speech recognition.</p><p>Interestingly, adults and children often overestimate the intelligence and capability of machines, so it is important to understand that right now we are in a period of 'narrow AI' which is able to do a single or focused task, sometimes in ways that can outperform humans. The diagram below from our report (adapted from an <url normalizedValue=\"https://theconversation.com/understanding-the-four-types-of-ai-from-reactive-robots-to-self-aware-beings-67616\">article</url> in The Conversation by Arend Hinz, Michigan State University 's Assistant Professor of Integrative Biology &amp; Computer Science and Engineering) provides an overview of types of AI and current state-of-play:</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>AI in education<br/><br/><br/></p><p>In education, AI is in some intelligent tutoring systems and powers some pedagogical agents (helpers) in educational software. It can be integrated into the communication suites marketed by Big Tech (for example in <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-were-using-ai-outlook-working-behind-scenes-help-you-sareen/\">email</url>) and will increasingly be part of learning management systems that present predicative and data-driven performance dashboards to teachers and school leaders. There is also some (very concerning) talk of integrating facial recognition technology into classrooms to monitor the 'mood' and 'engagement' of students despite       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/eprint/SAUES8UM69EN8TSMUGF9/full\">research</url> suggesting that inferring affective states from facial expression is fraught with difficulties.</p><p>Engaging with AI in education also involves an understanding of <url normalizedValue=\"https://everythingcomputerscience.com/books/Machine%20Learning%20for%20Humans.pdf\">machine learning</url> (ML), whereby algorithms can help a machine learn to identify patterns in data and make predictions without having pre-programmed models or rules.</p><p><br/><br/><br/>Worldwide concern about the ethics of AI and ML<br/><br/><br/></p><p>The actual and conceivable ethical implications of AI and ML have been canvassed for several decades. Since 2016, the US, UK and European Union have conducted large scale public inquiries which have grappled with question of what a good and just AI society would look like.</p><p>As Ume\u00e5 University's Professor of Computing Science, Virginia Dignum, <url normalizedValue=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10676-018-9450-z\">puts it</url>:</p><excerpt><bodyText><p>What does it mean for an AI system to make a decision?

Furthermore, it is incumbent on educational bureaucracies to seek independent expert advice and be transparent in their policies and decision-making regarding such procurement so that school communities can have trust that the technology will not do harm through biased systems or by violating teacher and students sovereignty of their data and privacy.</p><p><br/><br/><br/>Our report offers practical advice<br/><br/><br/></p><p>Along with our <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.themandarin.com.au/file:///C:\\Users\\els201\\Downloads\\Artificial%20Intelligence%20and%20Emerging%20Technologies%20in%20Schools%20Research%20Report\">report</url>, the       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.education.gov.au/support-science-technology-engineering-and-mathematics\">project</url> included infographics on Artificial Intelligence and virtual and augmented reality for students, and 'short read' literature reviews for teachers.</p><p>In the report we carefully unpack the multi-faceted ethical dimensions of AI and ML for education systems and offer the customised <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Education, Ethics and AI (EEAI)</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">framework</emphasis> \u00a0(below) for teachers, school leaders and policy-makers so that they can make informed decisions regarding design, implementation and governance of AI-powered systems.

The very basis of education is being able to make 'fair calls' and to transparently explain educational action and, importantly, to be accountable for these decisions.</p><p>When we lose sight of this, at a school or school-systems level, we find ourselves in questionable ethical and educational territory. Let's not disregard our core strength as educators in a rush to appear to be innovative.</p><p>We are confident that our report is a good first step in prompting an ongoing democratic process to grapple with ethical issues of AI and ML so that school communities can weather the approaching storm.</p><p><br/><br/><br/>\u00a0 <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Erica Southgate is an Associate Professor of Education at the University of Newcastle, Australia.

Tech companies drive the economy, bringing health, wealth, jobs, and truth. Those who caution against a host of risks such as monopoly, hubris, and shortsightedness should be dismissed as ignorant \"privacy evangelists.\" Public regulation is bad because tech companies have \"the talent and resources\" to protect us against cyberwarfare and \"foreign and criminal intrusion.\" We should follow the example of \"digital natives,\" who \"start with an awareness that their data isn't private.\" According to Messer, public oversight would only gum up the workings of all the utopian delights of this shiny new world. Given such blessings, why would we want to break up big tech companies?</p><p>There is much to unpack in Messer's breezy dismissal of both unchecked monopoly power and the invasive apparatus of totalistic technological surveillance. For present purposes, however, I would like to think about how the concept of the self is affected by the widening use of algorithms to translate more and more bits of ourselves into numerical representations. Artist Trevor Paglen <url normalizedValue=\"https://thenewinquiry.com/invisible-images-your-pictures-are-looking-at-you/\">gives a succinct example</url>: When people upload pictures of their kids, algorithms reading those photos feed invisible data sets in ways that may eventually influence something as apparently unrelated as those children's health insurance. Similarly, if a teenager uploads a picture of herself having a beer, her underage drinking may be marked as information that can be sold, utilized by police departments whose scrutiny \"will be guided by your 'pattern of life' signature,\" warns Paglen. \"When you put an image on Facebook or other social media, you're feeding an array of immensely powerful artificial systems information about how to identify people and how to recognize places and objects, habits and preferences, race, class, and gender identifications, economic statuses, and much more.\"</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/the-money-was-fake-the-police-were-real-it-happened-in-an-elementary-school/2019/07/05/c2652b5c-704a-11e9-9f06-5fc2ee80027a_story.html?utm_term=.5faf2a9dee80\">Recently</url>, a 10-year-old in Maryland shared clearly marked play money with classmates while riding on his school bus. The driver contacted his supervisor. Police were called, and finally, the Secret Service-all to investigate the child for counterfeiting. While this is absurd on its face (and yes, the child was black), what's more invisibly sad is that each time a person       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250074317\">enters a database</url> for having had contact with police, it       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/12/us/crime-criminal-justice-reform-diversion.html\">will affect</url>all sorts of other life chances, including risk assessments for employment, credit, and child custody.</p><p>That's largely because artificial intelligence dispenses predictive computations based only on what it is trained-by humans-to see. Many universities <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.insidehighered.com/digital-learning/article/2018/07/10/canvas-catches-and-maybe-passes-blackboard-top-learning\">now use</url> Canvas, a course management platform on which students can discuss material or share lecture notes while their instructor is talking. When I was being trained to use the program, I noticed that the IT department had a screen on which the entire faculty was numerically ranked based on who generated the most comments during lectures. I was told that it would help us know what parts of a lecture stirred interest, but to me, it seemed only a whisker away from a Kim Kardashian standard of generated buzz as professorial achievement-a test I surely fail because I often tell my students to close their laptops.</p><p>Nevertheless, that kind of scoring is becoming a more important metric in all walks of life, particularly on social media. Are you getting hits? Are you being seen? I was tempted to run out and buy a glitter bustier and some feathers in order to raise my rank. The system incentivizes me to be splashy-in the eyes of a machine reading the abstraction of students representing me via the abstraction of how often their fingers strike the keys over the course of an hour.</p><p>What gets lost between life and the screen is that we are contextual beings. That's where machines and AI fall dismally short. Machine learning <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.quantamagazine.org/machine-learning-confronts-the-elephant-in-the-room-20180920/\">has trouble</url> distinguishing the serious from the ironic or a pig butt from pornography, while as humans, we can smell fear, taste excitement, and feel the heat of someone else's humiliation. There are sensory dimensions that go into our calculations of whether to like or not like someone, to grow close or pull back, to rescue, forgive, or let die.</p><p>AI also <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/bj93z5/ai-has-made-video-surveillance-automated-and-terrifying\">threatens</url> an important aspect of democratic identity: the right of self-invention. The word \"persona\" means \"mask,\" as in ancient theater. It is something through which one presents oneself to the world. In       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1535685X.2016.1232920\">jurisprudence</url>, the persona is both the protection of one's inner privacy (or freedom to think without censor) and the right to invent oneself outwardly. We present ourselves differently at the opera than the pool hall. We code-switch between accents and languages when speaking to our babies as opposed to our bosses. We seek amnesty for our misdeeds. But we lose that ability to compose ourselves fluidly and situationally if we are eternally confined by our last worst moment-if our weakest and most foolish acts are always fresh and foremost in the unnuanced mechanical brain of deep data.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1897/08/strivings-of-the-negro-people/305446/\">W.E.B. Du Bois</url> and      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/40034879?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents\">Frantz Fanon</url> described the stress of double consciousness experienced by black people living in white worlds-the phenomenon of always having to be aware of who's watching. Life under these conditions is no longer one's own creative, whimsical, and enjoyable construction. It becomes about a constant fear of offending. That kind of disembodying quality can be hard to bear, even when it's praising you-just think of the obsessive gaze focused on celebrities like Princess Diana or John Lennon, who were ultimately adored to death. Yet it's what tech giants like Google and Facebook seem intent on       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/18/technology/google-facebook-surveillance-capitalism.html\">normalizing</url>.

normalizedValue=\"http://www.thenation.com/blogs\">http://www.thenation.com/blogs</url> Delivered by Newstex)  \"In a recent new york times editorial titled ldquo why we should stop fetishizing privacy rdquo entrepreneur heidi messer posited the ultimate list of techno optimist cliches tech companies drive the economy bringing health wealth jobs and truth those who caution against a host of risks such as monopoly hubris and shortsightedness should be dismissed as ignorant ldquo privacy evangelists rdquo public regulation is bad because tech companies have ldquo the talent and resources rdquo to protect us against cyberwarfare and ldquo foreign and criminal intrusion rdquo we should follow the example of ldquo digital natives rdquo who ldquo start with an awareness that their data isn &amp;rsquo t private rdquo according to messer public oversight would only gum up the workings of all the utopian delights of this shiny new world given such blessings why would we want to break up big tech companies there is much to unpack in messer &amp;rsquo s breezy dismissal of both unchecked monopoly power and the invasive apparatus of totalistic technological surveillance for present purposes however i would like to think about how the concept of the self is affected by the widening use of algorithms to translate more and more bits of ourselves into numerical representations artist trevor paglen gives a succinct example when people upload pictures of their kids algorithms reading those photos feed invisible data sets in ways that may eventually influence something as apparently unrelated as those children &amp;rsquo s health insurance similarly if a teenager uploads a picture of herself having a beer her underage drinking may be marked as information that can be sold utilized by police departments whose scrutiny ldquo will be guided by your lsquo pattern of life &amp;rsquo signature rdquo warns paglen ldquo when you put an image on facebook or other social media you &amp;rsquo re feeding an array of immensely powerful artificial systems information about how to identify people and how to recognize places and objects habits and preferences race class and gender identifications economic statuses and much more rdquo recently a 10 year old in maryland shared clearly marked play money with classmates while riding on his school bus the driver contacted his supervisor police were called and finally the secret service mdash all to investigate the child for counterfeiting while this is absurd on its face and yes the child was black what &amp;rsquo s more invisibly sad is that each time a person enters a database for having had contact with police it will affect all sorts of other life chances including risk assessments for employment credit and child custody that &amp;rsquo s largely because artificial intelligence dispenses predictive computations based only on what it is trained mdash by humans mdash to see many universities now use canvas a course management platform on which students can discuss material or share lecture notes while their instructor is talking when i was being trained to use the program i noticed that the it department had a screen on which the entire faculty was numerically ranked based on who generated the most comments during lectures i was told that it would help us know what parts of a lecture stirred interest but to me it seemed only a whisker away from a kim kardashian standard of generated buzz as professorial achievement mdash a test i surely fail because i often tell my students to close their laptops nevertheless that kind of scoring is becoming a more important metric in all walks of life particularly on social media are you getting hits are you being seen i was tempted to run out and buy a glitter bustier and some feathers in order to raise my rank the system incentivizes me to be splashy mdash in the eyes of a machine reading the abstraction of students representing me via the abstraction of how often their fingers strike the keys over the course of an hour what gets lost between life and the screen is that we are contextual beings that &amp;rsquo s where machines and ai fall dismally short machine learning has trouble distinguishing the serious from the ironic or a pig butt from pornography while as humans we can smell fear taste excitement and feel the heat of someone else &amp;rsquo s humiliation there are sensory dimensions that go into our calculations of whether to like or not like someone to grow close or pull back to rescue forgive or let die ai also threatens an important aspect of democratic identity the right of self invention the word ldquo persona rdquo means ldquo mask rdquo as in ancient theater it is something through which one presents oneself to the world in jurisprudence the persona is both the protection of one &amp;rsquo s inner privacy or freedom to think without censor and the right to invent oneself outwardly we present ourselves differently at the opera than the pool hall we code switch between accents and languages when speaking to our babies as opposed to our bosses we seek amnesty for our misdeeds but we lose that ability to compose ourselves fluidly and situationally if we are eternally confined by our last worst moment mdash if our weakest and most foolish acts are always fresh and foremost in the unnuanced mechanical brain of deep data w e b du bois and frantz fanon described the stress of double consciousness experienced by black people living in white worlds mdash the phenomenon of always having to be aware of who &amp;rsquo s watching life under these conditions is no longer one &amp;rsquo s own creative whimsical and enjoyable construction it becomes about a constant fear of offending that kind of disembodying quality can be hard to bear even when it &amp;rsquo s praising you mdash just think of the obsessive gaze focused on celebrities like princess diana or john lennon who were ultimately adored to death yet it &amp;rsquo s what tech giants like google and facebook seem intent on normalizing internalizing the panopticon has always been an extraordinary stress on marginalized populations like migrants and people of color if this is the new norm for everybody we will see those kinds of stresses magnified stretching us ultimately to the breaking point a merciful society gives us room to breatheKeep on reading: Artificial Intelligence Is Failing Humans[1] [ 1]: </p><p><url

In the political sphere, a mainstream position in the Democratic party of the U.S. is that Russia stole the 2016 Presidential Election with advanced hacking tools and trolls.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The emerging race between the U.S. and China to develop the most advanced AI is being called the Cold War of the 21st century; the central power struggle that defines an era for the world.</p><p>Technological developments in AI and algorithms aimed at governance are simultaneously viewed as a naturally evolving phenomenon and an imminent political peril. This framing, though popular as it is, misunderstands who the agent is in AI and Big Tech. It is not the algorithms themselves, but those who design them and define their goals.</p><p>It's not Big Tech and AI that are threatening democracy and sparking a new Cold War, it's the political vision of those that design their codes and the unchecked hold on power that allows them to make those visions a reality. AI and algorithms are merely tools that, experts interviewed by Al Bawaba, say are ways to maintain and extend status quo political landscapes.</p><p>Authoritarian states may use these tools to centralize control, while democracies can use them to expand and modernize people-power.</p><p>Continuing to misattribute the power of algorithms to the code itself, cybersecurity experts argue, guarantees the states and corporates behind them will continue to shape AI-driven governance with no transparency.</p><p>AI and Algorithms Are Not Self-Generating a Data-Driven Technostate</p><p>(The Royal Society of Arts)</p><p>To understand the power of AI and the algorithms that define it, it's important to start by defining what these algorithms are and what they aren't.</p><p>Cathy O'Neil, a data scientist and author of the book \"Weapons of Math Destruction: How Big Data Increases Inequality and Threatens Democracy,\" recently spoke about a central misconception about algorithms: \"I went into data science and I was struck by what I thought was essentially a lie. Namely that algorithms were being presented and marketed as objective fact,\" she said.</p><p>\"A much more accurate description of an algorithm is that its an opinion embedded in math. An algorithm is a very general concept. It's something that we do in our heads every day. To build an algorithm, we need only two things essentially: a historical data and a definition of success.\"</p><p>An illustrative example of an algorithm is cooking dinner for her family. O'Neil's data set for her dinner is her ingredients, and she assess its success when her children are eating. If they're eating vegetables, the dinner was successful. On the flipside, if the children were the ones who defined the success of the dinner algorithm, it would be a failure if they encountered any vegetables, O'Neil quips.</p><p>Facial recognition algorithms that build predictive policing programs function in the same way, though their political consequences can be grave.</p><p>//</p><p>In 2016, a man named Willie Lynch was convicted of selling crack in Florida: his case was decided by a photo taken at the scene of a drug deal with undercover agents that was then put through a facial recognition software. That same software has come under fire for its racial biases, which many claim comes from the fact that it's written by members of one race that cannot be accurately used on another. Facial recognition software have had issues with confusing black people with guerrillas, since coders imprinted their own biases of others' physicality.</p><p>Combine that with policing laws that disproportionately target vulnerable community members of color, and you have an algorithm just as biased as its programmers, which is now embedding racial policing protocols in the language of scientific objectivity.</p><p>\"If you're black, you're more likely to be subjected to this technology and the technology is more likely to be wrong,\" U.S. politician and Chair of the House Oversight Committee, Elijah Cummings said in 2017.</p><p>\"That's a hell of a combination.\"</p><p>(Shutterstock)</p><p>Crime predicting algorithms are also reportedly targeting poorer neighborhoods with dominant minority populations as they are the ones already monitored more heavily by police.</p><p>These algorithms recommend a heavier police presence, which exacerbates the bias and drives arrest rates up. \"The utilitarian bean-counters will clock this up as a success. But the data will continue to feed back into the model, creating a self-perpetuating loop of growing inequality and algorithm-driven racial targeting,\" explains Jamie Bartlett, a senior fellow at Demos.</p><p>\"We embed our values into algorithms,\" data scientist O'Neil concluded. To put it simply, an algorithm mechanizes a way to accomplish a goal set by humans, whose values are also defined by humans and reliant on pre-existing social or political conditions. It is a tool, and its accomplishments function in service to those who make it.</p><p>Instead of this dynamic informing how the global community conceptualizes the power of AI, experimental physicist Dan McQuillan observes that \"AI has become a hyperobject so massive that its totality is not realised in any local manifestation, a higher dimensional entity that adheres to anything it touches, whatever the resistance, and which is perceived by us through its informational imprints.\"</p><p>AI is becoming an inaccessible, transcendent entity that is untouchable, unanalyzable, and ungovernable, sitting in a black box of fake objectivity as it slowly takes over governance, policing and surveillance.</p><p>\"It's vital we don't allow the AI-evangelists or product managers to dominate this conversation: it can't just be 'oh this is too confusing!' or 'oh the march of AI is inevitable,'  Alex Krasodomski-Jones, director of the Center for the Analysis of Social Media at the London-based Demos, told Al Bawaba.</p><p>\"Neither of those things are true.\"</p><p>\"Unchecked, AI is likely to augment existing powers, particularly in states with weak democratic safeguards. Increasingly invasive surveillance, for instance, or the use of machine-learning models in law enforcement, are worrying precedents for the use of AI under repressive regimes,\" Krasodomski-Jones added.</p><p>So What Does AI and Big Data Do Politically?</p><p>//</p><p>An emerging consensus among data scientists and tech analysts is that AI and its constituent algorithms reinforce pre-existing political orders with new, automated ways to govern people.</p><p>\"A society whose synapses have been replaced by neural networks will generally tend to a heightened version of the status quo. Machine learning by itself cannot learn a new system of social patterns, only pump up the existing ones as computationally eternal,\" Mcquillan writes.</p><p>This emerging type of society is particularly evident in places ruled by authoritarian states, where governments have the ability to totalize control over the development, goals and utilization of Big Data tech.</p><p>\"Authoritarian regimes can easily abuse such new powers and will be tempted to use them to control and suppress dissent,\" said Adrian Zenz, a social researcher with the European School of Culture &amp; Theology whose work has helped to expose a dystopian techno-police state in China.</p><p>\"It can certainly be said that the increase of surveillance technologies and predictive algorithms is likely to make daily life in connection with a securitized state both less transparent and could lead to a more frequent and more automated infringement on private rights, both by governments and companies,\" he added.</p><p>Some examples of this that can be exploited to enhance a state's power over its people are predictive policing programs that mass monitor millions of people and pick out those most likely to commit crimes, hate speech monitoring programs whose parameters for hate speech can be tweaked to jail dissidents and algorithms that block information and sites potentially critical of the state.</p><p>All of these types of programs are being developed by Chinese companies aligned with the governing party, the CCP.</p><p>China's Social Credit System</p><p>Beijing sunset (AFP/FILE)</p><p>The most standout example of precisely how this tech can enhance state power is China's social credit system, which is currently being perfected throughout the country.</p><p>The credit system aims to give every Chinese citizen a standardized score of trustworthiness, and every act recorded in public or in private may have an impact on that score. If you go under certain thresholds, you are slowly edged out of society: your rent may increase, you may be denied certain forms of public transportation, your passport may be invalidated and your face may be plastered in public as a way to shame you.</p><p>\"The impact of AI will be mostly felt on the domestic scene with the significant amount of data that is collected - for instance the social credit system that China is putting in place is possible because of the extensive data that the state is able to collect on its citizens and others living within the boundaries,\" Dr. Rajeswari Pillai Rajagopalan, a distinguished fellow and head of the Nuclear and Space Policy Initiative told Al Bawaba.</p><p>\"The facial recognition and social tracking that China has established to a large extent will aid in strengthening policing, law and order mechanisms and counter-terrorism but the very same technologies and capabilities can be put to use in a negative manner which can give way to what is known as digital authoritarianism,\" she added.</p><p>//</p><p>China's social credit system is still in its primitive stages, but the residents of one of the systems pilot towns have already felt its effects. Donghuo Tangzhai in China's Rongcheng region has a population of about 3,000 people. Zhou Aini, a retired resident, has been hired by China to be an 'Information Collector,\" for the town.</p><p>Aini is paid to walk around the town, talk to people on the street about what others are doing and record their lives in a notebook she carries with her everywhere. Aini writes down the information of people littering on the street or helping elders throughout the small town.</p><p>In this town, everyone starts off with 1,000 points. The deeds recorded in Aini's notebook are presented to a monitoring officer, who then assigns a positive or negative numerical value to each of those deeds and publicizes the actions on a community signpost, where everyone can see just how good or bad their neighbors have been.</p><p>\"Now in our community, neighbors get along very well. There are no fights. Not at all. Now life is good. There is no reason to fight,\" Wang Fengbo, the appointed director of the town's credit system, exclaimed to a reporter.</p><p>Fengbo shared the story of a resident with a penchant for alcohol who used to physically abuse his wife. \"Although this is a family issue, it's a bad influence,\" said Fengbo. \"We also deduct the points.\"</p><p>Zhang Yingjie, another resident, co-signed on a loan with someone who was unable to pay his share, and was subsequently docked social points. Because of his new low score, he was unable secure any more loans, take high-speed transit around the vast country or buy certain products.</p><p>Zhang Yingjie (Vice News)</p><p>In order to restore his score to the point where it no longer inhibited his quality of life, he had to go to a local government office, where he paid money the government insists goes to charity. The workers he gives the money to record his deed and slowly his score went back up. Yingjie explained that he also donated blood and did volunteer work in his spare time to help nurture his score.</p><p>The CCP's experiment with a unified social credit system has already impacted tens of millions of people, who find themselves paying more interest on loans or for utilities, or are unable to travel.</p><p>From the stories shared from Donghuo Tangzhai, residents are careful to watch their own behavior in private lest their actions are recorded and they are penalized.</p><p>As it is currently designed, the credit system is more or less a worst-case scenario for techno-dystopianism who fear people power is being ceded to impersonal Big Data algorithms that govern their lives.</p><p>But again, that mischaracterizes the system as the agent in the oppression rather than the tool, which may excuse the very human political responsibility the government bears for deploying the program while contributing to the neutralization of the social credit system itself to become an intangible 'hyperobject.'</p><p>The social credit system isn't the beginning of a technocracy but an indication that a central government has found a way for its citizens to acquiesce to its system of controls so thoroughly that they now police themselves. It's a proof-of-concept policy that reveals the use of Big Data and AI as tools that help a state wield power over its people.</p><p>The tools may be scary and unknown-seeming, but the perpetrators remain the same.</p><p>\"Artificial intelligence threatens to centralise political decision-making power, disempower citizens, alienate them from participating in democratic decision-making, reduce the power of workers in a workforce and so on,\" noted Alex Krasodomski-Jones of Demos.</p><p>AI isn't a new harbinger of doom, but another political tool in the age-old quest to consolidate power. Demanding transparency in the codemaking process may be the most effective means to understand its uses and abuses.</p><p>Accoding to Krasodomski-Jones, \"for us to make the best of AI, we need two things: first, the political will, powers and scrutiny, and likely regulation, required to ensure that AI is being used in a way that is fair and democratic. Second, a commitment by AI developers to ensure that the products they are building are open to this level of scrutiny.\"</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://imgs.syndigate.info/62/176/1/154895406895.jpeg\">http://imgs.syndigate.info/62/176/1/154895406895.jpeg</url></p><p><br/></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://imgs.syndigate.info/62/176/80/154895406907.jpeg\">http://imgs.syndigate.info/62/176/80/154895406907.jpeg</url></p><p><br/></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://imgs.syndigate.info/62/176/99/154895406914.jpeg\">http://imgs.syndigate.info/62/176/99/154895406914.jpeg</url></p><p><br/></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://imgs.syndigate.info/62/176/79/154895406922.jpeg\">http://imgs.syndigate.info/62/176/79/154895406922.jpeg</url></p><p><br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ALBAWA-136432721</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ALBAWA2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5V9X-F9D1-F11P-X2D9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">343610</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-01-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2413\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Albawaba.com - Al Bawaba (Middle East) Ltd.

You'd think so, if you read how the media has cited reports by PwC and McKinsey.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But if you read the actual details, the picture is subtler and even optimistic. A line from the executive summary of McKinsey's report \"Harnessing automation for a future that works\" states: \"While less than 5\u00a0percent of all occupations can be automated entirely using demonstrated technologies, about 60\u00a0percent of all occupations have at least 30\u00a0percent of constituent activities that could be automated.\" To me, that does not sound like the employment Armageddon portrayed in some media. In fact, if 30 percent of my job were automated, just think how much more productive I could be.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Furthermore, McKinsey says \"the world's economy will actually need every erg of human labor working, in addition to the robots, to overcome demographic aging trends in both developed and developing economies. In other words, a surplus of human labor is much less likely to occur than a deficit of human labor.\"</p><p>So how do you distill the truth given varying opinion and decide the impact on your business?</p><p>First, read the underlying research reports.</p><p>Machine learning, a subset of AI, will almost certainly transform the world. Advances in the last 12 months, demonstrate the potential. In early 2017, Libratus beat the best pro poker players in the world. DeepMind created AlphaGo Zero, which taught itself to become the best Go player on the planet. Then last November, AlphaGo Zero became a superhuman chess and Shogi player in less than 24 hours. Not only are the algorithms getting more powerful, they're also becoming more efficient.</p><p>It is clearly an exciting period for technology, but for analytics, does this mean firing your team and going all in with AI? I don't think so, and in fact, I advise against it. Tim Harford argues that AlphaGo is actually an outlier, and corporations are getting less and less involved in groundbreaking scientific research. Not only that, finding the talent to successfully run machine learning projects is very hard; the big tech firms swallow up the brightest talent before they've graduated, as reported by the Economist in \"Battle of the Brains.\"</p><p>Attend any business technology conference and the agenda will be full of AI and machine learning sessions. At those events, the message is much more mundane than the bleeding-edge technology described above. The current recommendation is to begin with small, well-defined questions that can be tested against large data sets. This is not because the experts aren't highly talented, it's because the real-world business applications aren't yet as capable as the media hype.</p><p>If you can't make it to conferences such as Hubb in Germany or Strata in the United States, I recommend reading two fascinating books on artificial intelligence, which paint a useful picture of the state of play.</p><p>Deep Thinking by Garry Kasparov is about his history of playing against computers in chess, with a deep focus on his matches against Deep Blue in 1997. Kasparov interlaces his optimistic opinions about AI and its implications on society and business throughout the book.\u00a0</p><p>For an excellent counterpoint to Kasparov, read Cathy O'Neil's Weapons of Math Destruction. There is growing concern that the rampant spread of algorithms into our daily life is happening before we've asked ourselves if they actually help society (see, for example, teacher assessments and YouTube's Kids Channel). Her book is sobering and a wake-up call for individuals and politicians to examine if can we change regulation fast enough to keep up with technology.</p><p>Whatever the hype, businesses need to be thinking about artificial intelligence, machine learning and automation, and it must start with data. Data is the foundation of any AI system. But you need to have sound and mature data management practices in place first. You also need excellent human intelligence to complete this: Your employees need to be comfortable analyzing and making decisions with data. Without that in place, moving to AI-focused models is too wide a gulf to cross. People will not trust black-box AI if they don't already trust their data.</p><p>Not only should the data analytics platform be robust, the team's responsible for it must have a good mix of skills. The traditional skill profiles have changed. Now you need \"fuzzies\" and \"techies\" to succeed versus traditional analysts.</p><p>As you build out this maturity within your organization, identify teams who are ahead of the curve. Ask yourself, which teams have large, high-quality data sets, and tightly defined questions? Of those teams, who are the most analytically mature? That's where the first forays into AI-based decision making can begin and your journey to embracing instead of resisting AI will grow to support enhanced job production.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INFDLY-3252175</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INFDLY2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RKW-P471-DY58-D3T4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">169977</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-05-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"807\"/><timeReceived>02:41 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 International Data Group, Inc.

An alternative possibility is for government to provide the infrastructure needed for a technological future through a public option for artificial intelligence.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Big tech companies have an extraordinary amount of data about how we behave, largely because they engage in widespread surveillance of much of our behavior. Because A.I. depends on data, these companies have a huge market advantage over start-ups and entrepreneurs and its a gap that will only get wider. The lax regulatory environment hasnt helped, either; instead, it has allowed the biggest tech companies to acquire their rivals, stifle competition and snatch up the best software engineers and data scientists. Together, these dynamics make it hard for start-ups, governments and nonprofits to develop and use artificial intelligence without relying on big tech companies, effectively ceding influence over this developing field to a private sphere distorted by anti-competitive practices .</p><p>The alternative is a public option for A.I. The public option, a term familiar from debates over health care, is a public program that provides universal access to goods and services, with a private opt-out. A public option for A.I. wouldnt prevent companies like Google from collecting and using data. But it would provide a pathway for start-ups and public-sector organizations to develop abilities and products that would compete with those of the tech giants. Although the Trump administration released an executive order on A.I. this year, we believe that a broader conceptual framework for the public option for A.I. coupled with significant financial resources from Congress is an opportunity for all levels of government to take control of technology for their constituents and engage them deeply in the development of the rules by which it is governed and used.</p><p>Our proposal has three components: The first is a public data pool that would make data accessible to registered users. Local, state and federal governments have sizable data resources that would seed this digital commons. Users would be verified to block foreign governments, hackers and others with ill motives from access, and users would be prevented from using the data to engage in racial or other forms of discrimination and for microtargeted advertising.</p><p>Some of the data may be very sensitive, and access to those resources would be highly regulated. We can imagine a variety of ways that regulation and technology together could protect privacy and still foster innovation: Data could be anonymized at the source; the commons could have an interface that allowed users to derive insight from the data set, while leaving the underlying information inaccessible; less sensitive data, like weather information, could be made available in a format optimized for training A.I. Whats more, methods for safely sharing A.I. models without disclosing the underlying data are being developed today and could enable users of the data commons to collaborate on public-interest A.I. services. The federal government should also invest in researching new and better ways to protect privacy and prevent misuse.</p><p>Second, a public option for artificial intelligence would include a significant increase in research and development spending. Proponents of big tech celebrate private-sector research and are right to do so. But big tech companies, like all companies, have an incentive to fund research that will support their bottom line, and the profit motive doesnt always mean a focus on the most important problems.</p><p>For generations, government R&amp;D spending has been one of the central engines of economic growth and technological progress in America. Yet China is projected to spend far more than the United States on A.I. research over the next decade. A sizable increase in research funding for companies, governments and nonprofits developing public-interest technologies would help expand the types of research taking place and give scientists and engineers the option to do groundbreaking work on a broader range of problems.</p><p>Third, much of governments A.I. work takes place in the military sector and is applied to national security problems. But health care, transportation, energy and other areas could also benefit significantly from A.I. The federal government should expand its A.I. procurement across all of these sectors as an opportunity to improve public services for all Americans. In addition, the government should ensure that its use of algorithms meets the highest ethical standards.</p><p>A public option for A.I. cant solve every problem related to technology and surveillance, and it would require careful thinking about public governance of these programs including a commitment to privacy and awareness of biases. But it would help address the problem of a small number of companies having virtually all power over this technology. It would facilitate the conditions for a competitive market with many players and many new innovations, all while preserving our democratic values and improving our society.</p><p>Ben Gansky ( @bengansky ) is executive director of Free Machine and a researcher and designer at the Institute for the Futures Equitable Futures Lab.

An alternative possibility is for government to provide the infrastructure needed for a technological future \u2014 through a public option for artificial intelligence.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Big tech companies have an extraordinary amount of data about how we behave, largely because they engage in widespread surveillance of much of our behavior. Because A.I. depends on data, these companies have a huge market advantage over start-ups and entrepreneurs \u2014 and it\u2019s a gap that will only get wider. The lax regulatory environment hasn\u2019t helped, either; instead, it has allowed the biggest tech companies to acquire their rivals, stifle competition and snatch up the best software engineers and data scientists. Together, these dynamics make it hard for start-ups, governments and nonprofits to develop and use artificial intelligence without relying on big tech companies, effectively ceding influence over this developing field to a private sphere distorted by anti-competitive practices.</p><p>The alternative is a public option for A.I. The public option, a term familiar from debates over health care, is a public program that provides universal access to goods and services, with a private opt-out. A public option for A.I. wouldn\u2019t prevent companies like Google from collecting and using data. But it would provide a pathway for start-ups and public-sector organizations to develop abilities and products that would compete with those of the tech giants. Although the Trump administration released <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-maintaining-american-leadership-artificial-intelligence/\">an</url>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-maintaining-american-leadership-artificial-intelligence/\">executive order</url> on A.I. this year, we believe that a broader conceptual framework for the public option for A.I. \u2014 coupled with significant financial resources from Congress \u2014 is an opportunity for all levels of government to take control of technology for their constituents and engage them deeply in the development of the rules by which it is governed and used.</p><p>Our proposal has three components: The first is a public data pool that would make data accessible to registered users. Local, state and federal governments have sizable data resources that would seed this digital commons. Users would be verified to block foreign governments, hackers and others with ill motives from access, and users would be prevented from using the data to engage in racial or other forms of discrimination and for microtargeted advertising.</p><p>Some of the data may be very sensitive, and access to those resources would be highly regulated. We can imagine a variety of ways that regulation and technology together could protect privacy and still foster innovation: Data could be anonymized at the source; the commons could have an interface that allowed users to derive insight from the data set, while leaving the underlying information inaccessible; less sensitive data, like weather information, could be made available in a format optimized for training A.I. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-maintaining-american-leadership-artificial-intelligence/\">What\u2019s more, methods for safely sharing A.I. models</url> without disclosing the underlying data are being developed today and could enable users of the data commons to collaborate on public-interest A.I. services. The federal government should also invest in researching new and better ways to protect privacy and prevent misuse.</p><p>Second, a public option for artificial intelligence would include a significant increase in research and development spending. Proponents of big tech celebrate private-sector research and are right to do so. But big tech companies, like all companies, have an incentive to fund research that will support their bottom line, and the profit motive doesn\u2019t always mean a focus on the most important problems.</p><p>For generations, government R&amp;amp;D spending has been one of the central engines of economic growth and technological progress in America. Yet China is projected to spend far more than the United States on A.I. research over the next decade. A sizable increase in research funding for companies, governments and nonprofits developing public-interest technologies would help expand the types of research taking place and give scientists and engineers the option to do groundbreaking work on a broader range of problems. </p><p>Third, much of government\u2019s A.I. work takes place in the military sector and is applied to national security problems. But health care, transportation, energy and other areas could also benefit significantly from A.I. The federal government should expand its A.I. procurement across all of these sectors as an opportunity to improve public services for all Americans. In addition, the government should ensure that its use of algorithms meets the highest ethical standards.</p><p>A public option for A.I. can\u2019t solve every problem related to technology and surveillance, and it would require careful thinking about public governance of these programs \u2014 including a commitment to privacy and awareness of biases. But it would help address the problem of a small number of companies having virtually all power over this technology. It would facilitate the conditions for a competitive market with many players and many new innovations, all while preserving our democratic values and improving our society.</p><p>Ben Gansky (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-maintaining-american-leadership-artificial-intelligence/\">@bengansky</url>) is executive director of Free Machine and a researcher and designer at the Institute for the Future\u2019s Equitable Futures Lab.

Voice recognition systems like Alexa, Siri and Google Home are just a few simple examples.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It's developing at a tremendous pace - but is it possible to trust AI?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Australia's chief scientist wants governments and businesses to develop some sort of regulation or ethical stamp for artificial intelligence.</p><p>Dr Alan Finkel is calling it a 'Turing certificate' after the famous English scientist, Dr Alan Turing, whose life was depicted, you might remember in the movie The Imitation Game.</p><p>It's an idea he will expand on during a lunchtime speech in Sydney today for the Committee for Economic Development of Australia.</p><p>But ahead of that, he joins me in our studio.</p><p>Dr Finkel, good morning.</p><p>ALAN FINKEL: Good morning, Kim.</p><p>KIM LANDERS: Artificial intelligence is already with us. So how are we now going to try to put some ethical guide rails around it?</p><p>ALAN FINKEL: Well, artificial intelligence is not only with us but it's becoming ever more pervasive.</p><p>What brought it home very recently was Google demonstrating a new product called Google Duplex, which is a digital voice assistant. And it's quite remarkable in its naturalness.</p><p>KIM LANDERS: It sounds like a human?</p><p>ALAN FINKEL: It sounds like a human. So instead of being: \"Good morning, Dave\" from a movie, it calls up and it says: \"Hi. I'm calling to see if I can, hmm, maybe make a booking for a restaurant this evening, perhaps at 7pm?\"</p><p>That sounds pretty natural. You won't know, if you're the person taking that phone call, who you're actually speaking to.</p><p>So that raises all the questions about: what are our expectations from the companies who are providing these products?</p><p>That's just a very visible illustration.</p><p>So what I've been giving a lot of consideration to of late is the spectrum of regulations that will assist us in integrating AI into human society. Sometimes I refer to AI and HI: human intelligence and AI.</p><p>Ultimately, what we need is for those two societies to play nice and get along.</p><p>KIM LANDERS: But if you've got big tech companies like Google, Facebook and Amazon pursuing AI, the same companies that have been responsible for massive privacy breaches in recent times, how on earth is any government or authority going to be able to issue these certificates or assess whether a company or product is using AI ethically?</p><p>ALAN FINKEL: It's a huge challenge but we've got examples that have been developed over decades, working with other products that are pervasive in our society.</p><p>Think about your electric kettle. You're quite confident that, when you switch on the plug, touch the cord, pick up the kettle, that you're not going to get electrocuted.</p><p>It's not because you've read a 20-page statement from the manufacturer. It's because on the base of that kettle there's a mark, called a CE mark.</p><p>KIM LANDERS: But if you want one of these similar trust marks on AI products, who is going to be the authority that issues that?</p><p>ALAN FINKEL: So there needs to be an authority and it could be one of the existing authorities.</p><p>So the CE mark is issued because you met the ISO - the International Standards Organisation - 9000 test. And that test is done by companies in Germany like TUV (Technical Inspection Association) and other companies in Australia. And they test not just the final product but the whole process of concept, design, manufacturing, the test process; and then the product.</p><p>Now, you as a consumer do not have to understand anything about what they're testing. But they go in. They audit the companies. The companies have to work very, very hard to qualify to get the CE mark put onto an electronic product. And you know that you are protected by that stamp.</p><p>KIM LANDERS: So if you're using something similar for AI: I mean, isn't the point that AI is really smart; could outwit humans, outwit our attempts to regulate it?</p><p>ALAN FINKEL: Well, that's right. That's why you can't just do this certification based on the final product that has been made by the company.</p><p>You have to look at the design process to ensure that principles of appropriate - let me call it behaviour - for the AI will be designed into the product, not just as an afterthought.</p><p>KIM LANDERS: If we look at the US, for example, it's had decades of public and private investment in this space. China is pouring billions of dollars into AI research and development.</p><p>And yet the recent federal budget had just $30 million in it to boost this country's AI capability. Isn't that a bit of a puny contribution?</p><p>ALAN FINKEL: Look, it is small. But think of that as a down-payment on perhaps where we are going to go.</p><p>We're unlikely to be able to compete to be the world leader in AI, but we need to be a significant player.</p><p>Part of that $30 million will enable CSIRO - through Data61, one of its divisions - to develop a bit of a road map on AI. And they've already done a lot of work on that.</p><p>The funding around the world is just huge. You mentioned a few countries. France has committed about $2 billion over the next five years to AI; China much, much more than that. But one company, Alibaba in China, claims that they will put $US13 billion into AI development work.</p><p>KIM LANDERS: That's what I mean. Australia's contribution is pretty tiny. So are you advocating that the Federal Government should be chipping in more, for example?</p><p>ALAN FINKEL: Well, it's a corporate and government expectation.</p><p>I think what the Federal Government is going to do with its $30 million is stimulate a number of companies, through what's called the CRCP (Cooperative Research Centres) program, a cooperative research program, to start upping their investment in AI. And it will get a road map as to where we need to go.</p><p>KIM LANDERS: All right. Dr Alan Finkel, it's very interesting. Thank you very much for speaking with AM this morning.</p><p>That is Dr Alan Finkel. He is Australia's chief scientist.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

And there is much to welcome in them, including Macron's emphasis on ethics and the need for humans to maintain meaningful control of consequential decisions like those that occur in the use of autonomous weapons systems. Other thoughtful elements include providing incentives for investment in AI technologies, building up AI research centers, and addressing the shortage of AI-expertise and talent. In a tribute to these forward-looking policies, Facebook, Google, Samsung, IBM, DeepMind, Fujitsu have chosen Paris to create AI labs and research centers.</p><p>But some policy recommendations go in the wrong direction, as if pre-existing concerns were simply grafted onto the topic of artificial intelligence as a convenient place to recycle them.</p><p>European policymakers are concerned with the ability of terrorists and extremists to spread recruitment material and hate speech on Internet platforms. They also think that Internet disinformation campaigns directed by hostile foreign powers pose an existential threat to the integrity of liberal democratic political institutions. To counter these threats, they are considering modification of the principle embodied in the E-Commerce Directive that internet platforms are not the publishers of material posted by third parties. \u00a0</p><p>The EPSC report endorses these concerns, calling for an end to the \"exceptionalism\" that made users of internet platforms responsible for the content they posted.</p><p>Internet companies need to work together with governments to do more to address common Internet challenges, including increasing their efforts to limit harmful content on their systems. But this is a completely unrelated topic that has nothing to do with fostering AI.</p><p>Moreover, it is bad policy. Making Internet users, not the platforms, responsible for the material they post is not just an infant industries measure that can be safely repealed once the platforms have gotten big. It is a policy that continues to be necessary to allow these platforms to distribute information provided by individuals and companies outside their editorial control. If they have to exercise the same control over content as traditional broadcasters and newspapers do, only material approved by their editors will see the light of day. The vast increase in voices and information made possible by the new technology will be a brief interlude, not a permanent improvement in the marketplace of ideas.</p><p>Many critics have called for breaking up the big tech companies</p><p>Here's another worrisome turn in European AI strategy proposals. Many critics have called for breaking up the big tech companies. A revived, populist movement wants to reduce their control over various economic sectors including search, social media, and online retailing. Much of this is coming from Europe, where Google is appealing a proposed fine of (EURO)2.4 billion for allegedly favoring its own affiliates in search results, an allegation rejected by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission.</p><p>Unfortunately, President Macron echoes these calls, suggesting that the very companies he is welcoming to Paris to create new AI research centers are \"too big to be governed\" and should be \"dismantled.\" The EPSC report also urges competition authorities to stop mergers that \"might allow merged companies to use AI technologies to discriminate against their users.\"</p><p>The larger tech companies are now the largest sources of cutting edge research in AI outside of China. Google's DeepMind astonished the world with software that taught itself to play Go better than any human with only a knowledge of the rules of the game as a starting point. But China is a major rival. It uses an intricate system of subsidies, incentives and below-cost loans from state-owned banks to direct research and development to AI. It is now leading the way on frontier AI research such as deep learning.</p><p>Engaging in an antitrust crusade to break up tech companies is not a strategy to promote AI. Instead it will undermine their ability to finance the basic research that will allow us to compete in the AI race against countries with fundamentally different economic and political structures.</p><p>Engaging in an antitrust crusade to break up tech companies is not a strategy to promote AI.</p><p>In one other area, the E.U. AI reports raise concerns. They suggest that the new General Data Protection Regulation might be a long-term comparative advantage for Europe. But privacy is not a fundamental divide between the U.S. and Europe. Privacy is a shared human rights objective of both the U.S. and the E.U., a common commitment that puts both of us on the right side of a crucial line dividing authoritarian systems from liberal democratic ones.</p><p>GDPR is here to stay, but sensible implementation should be a priority, especially if we want to focus resources on AI research. The bigger tech companies are spending literally millions of dollars and hiring substantial additional staff to prevent the ticking time bomb of privacy violations that could trigger GDPR fines of up 4 percent of global revenue. One indication of this compliance burden is the growth in the number of privacy officers. The International Association of Privacy Professionals has a world-wide membership of 35,000, with an increase of 10,000 last year alone, due almost entirely to new personnel hired in Europe for GDPR compliance.</p><p>By all means, as President Macron says, AI must be designed \"within ethical and philosophical boundaries.\" Moreover, strategic plans in the U.S. and E.U. to foster AI research and development are crucial, especially given the determination of China to establish and maintain dominance in this sector. But waging an unrelated war on tech does not promote the development of AI within ethical boundaries. It just guarantees that we will together finish the AI race in second place.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CIOMAG-3268193</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CIOMAG2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S2N-FCV1-JBP6-P21P-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">258373</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-12-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1054\"/><timeReceived>09:45 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 IDG Communications, Inc.

They're all being sifted by some form of artificial intelligence.Advanced nations and the world's biggest companies have thrown billions of dollars behind AI - a set of computing practices, including machine learning that collate masses of our data, analyse it, and use it to predict what we would do.Yet cycles of hype and despair are inseparable from the history of AI. Is that clunky robot really about to take my job? How do the non-geeks among us distinguish AI's promise from the hot air and decide where to focus concern?The World According to AIComputer scientist Jaron Lanier ought to know. </p><p>An inventor of virtual reality, Lanier worked with AI pioneer Marvin Minsky, one of the people who coined the term \"artificial intelligence\" in the 1950s. Lanier insists AI, then and now, is mostly a marketing term. In our interview, he recalled years of debate with Minsky about whether AI was real or a myth:\"At one point, [Minsky] said to me, 'Look, whatever you think about this, just play along, because it gets us funding, this'll be great.' And it's true, you know ... in those days, the military was the principal source of funding for computer science research.And if you went into the funders and you said, 'We're going to make these machines smarter than people some day and whoever isn't on that ride is going to get left behind and big time. So we have to stay ahead on this, and boy! You got funding like crazy.'\"But at worst, he says, AI can be more insidious: a ploy the powerful use to shirk responsibility for the decisions they make. If \"computer says, 'no,'\" as the old joke goes, to whom do you complain?We'd all better find out quickly. Whether or not you agree with Lanier about the term AI, machine learning is getting more sophisticated, and it's in use by everyone from the tech giants of Silicon Valley to cash-strapped local authorities. From credit to jobs to policing to healthcare, we're ceding more and more power to algorithms, or rather - to the people behind them.Many applications of AI are incredible: we could it to improve wind farms or spot cancersooner. But that isn't the only, or even the main, AI trend. The worrying ones involve the assessment and prediction of people - and, in particular, grading for various kinds of risk.As a human rights lawyer doing \"war on terror\" cases, I thought a lot about our attitudes to risk. Remember Vice President Dick Cheney's \"one percent doctrine\"? He said that any risk - even one percent - of a terror attack would, in the post-9/11 world, to be treated like a certainty.That was just a complex way of saying that the US would use force based on the barest suspicion about a person. This attitude survived the transition to a new administration - and the shift to a machine learning-driven process in national security, too.During President Barack Obama's drone wars, suspicion didn't even need to be personal - in a \"signature strike\", it could be a nameless profile, generated by an algorithm, analysing where you went and who you talked to on your mobile phone. This was made clear in an unforgettable comment by ex-CIA and NSA director Michael Hayden: \"We kill people based on metadata,\" he said.Now a similar logic pervades the modern marketplace, the sense that total certainty and zero risk - that is, zero risk for the class of people Lanier describes as \"closest to the biggest computer\" - is achievable and desirable. This is what is crucial for us all to understand: AI isn't just about Google and Facebook targeting you with advertisements. It's about risk.The police in Los Angeles believed it was possible to use machine learning to predict crime. London's Metropolitan Police, and others, want to use it to see your face wherever you go. Credit agencies and insurers want to build a better profile to understand whether you might get heart disease, or drop out of work, or fall behind on payments.It used to be common to talk about \"the digital divide\". This originally meant that the skills and advantages of connected citizens in rich nations would massively outrun poorer citizens without computers and the Internet. The solution: get everyone online and connected. This drove policies like One Laptop Per Child - and it drives newer ones, like Digital ID, the aim to give everyone on Earth a unique identity, in the name of economic participation. And connectivity has, at times, indeed opened people to new ideas and opportunities.But it also comes at a cost. Today, a new digital divide is opening. One between the knowers and the known. The data miners and optimisers, who optimise, of course, according to their values, and the optimised. The surveillance capitalists, who have the tools and the skills to know more about everyone, all the time, and the world's citizens.AI has ushered in a new pecking order, largely set by our proximity to this new computational power. This should be our real concern: how advanced computing could be used to preserve power and privilege.This is not a dignified future. People are right to be suspicious of this use of AI, and to seek ways to democratise this technology. I use an iPhone and enjoy, on this expensive device, considerably less personalised tracking of me by default than a poorer user of an Android phone.When I apply for a job in law or journalism, a panel of humans interviews me; not an AI using \"expression analysis\" as I would experience applying for a job in a Tesco supermarket in the UK. We can do better than to split society into those who can affordprivacy and personal human assessment - and everyone else, who gets number-crunched, tagged, and sorted.Unless we head off what Shoshana Zuboff calls \"the substitution of computation for politics\" - where decisions are taken outside of a democratic contest, in the grey zone of prediction, scoring, and automation - we risk losing control over our values.The future of artificial intelligence belongs to us all. The values that get encoded into AI ought to be a matter for public debate and, yes, regulation. Just as we banned certain kinds of discrimination, should certain inferences by AI be taken off the table? Should AI firms have a statutory duty to allow in auditors to test for bias and inequality?Is a certain platform size (say, Facebook and Google, which drive much AI development now and supply services to over two billion people) just too big - like Big Rail, Big Steel, and Big Oil of the past? Do we need to break up Big Tech?Everyone has a stake in these questions. Friendly panels and hand-picked corporate \"AI ethics boards\" won't cut it.

Otherwise, we could expect to see the kind of social disruption that greeted the advent of genetically-modified (GM) foods[5] during the past decades. The Guardian's report notes that there are no testing standards or requirement for AI to explain their decisions. There is also no organisation equipped to monitor and investigate any bad decisions or accidents. AI has entered public consciousness during the past couple of years with largely a negative focus. </p><p>In how AI is reported in the media - mainstream and social - that focus tends to be about how the robots are coming to take away our jobs[6], our livelihoods, our comfort zones. Undoubtedly, elements of AI - notably automation[7] and machine learning[8] - will have a significant and long-lasting effect on work and workplaces: how work is done and who does it. We already have examples where serious experiments and testing are taking place where automation will replace the roles of people in some manual jobs that, broadly speaking, are repetitive and predictable. Amazon, for example, is experimenting in the UK with warehouse automation that could transform its logistics and supply chain as the FT reports[9]: The technology shows the transformation happening at the core of the logistics sector. Many functions that were once solely done by human hands are being carried out by robots as advanced automation takes root. Watch the FT's 5-minute video in its report - it's very good and includes a segment on what grocery retailer Occado is also doing in this area. In the US, retailing giant Walmart is testing robots in supermarkets[10] to handle tasks like scanning shelves for out-of-stock items, incorrect prices and wrong or missing labels - the kind of work previously done by people, who aren't well suited for this type of job in the long term nor do it well. The white collar is also in the sights of AI and automation. Earlier this year, Bloomberg reported on JP Morgan's experiments with machine learning[11] that use a computer program to analyse legal agreements quicker and more accurately than armies of lawyers: The program, called COIN, for Contract Intelligence, does the mind-numbing job of interpreting commercial-loan agreements that, until the project went online in June, consumed 360,000 hours of work each year by lawyers and loan officers. The software reviews documents in seconds, is less error-prone and never asks for vacation. Bloomberg's report had arguably the best financial story headline of 2017 as this screenshot shows.These three examples are really the tip of an immense iceberg indicating the scale of change that is just ahead. While it's clear that some jobs will be directly affected - meaning workers affected will lose them or need to be retrained for other work (a huge topic in itself) - it's also clear that other jobs will produce benefits beyond the obvious (faster, greater accuracy, saving cost, etc) where repetitive and predictable work - think of the JP Morgan example - is done by computers and machines thus enabling the humans to focus on things we are good at, ie, cognitive work that isn't repetitive and predictable. That is what I call 'augmented intelligence[12].' This is just part of a still-emerging and -evolving landscape that, without a regulatory framework, will have profound implications for the well-being or otherwise of all of us. The Guardian's report I mentioned earlier and embedded below is a great introduction to the idea of standards and accountability and what we should expect. (Photo at top via The Verge[13].) This article titled 'Artificial intelligence risks GM-style public backlash, experts warn' was written by Ian Sample Science editor, for The Guardian on Wednesday 1st November 2017 10.30 UTC[14] The emerging field of artificial intelligence (AI) risks provoking a public backlash as it increasingly falls into private hands, threatens people's jobs, and operates without effective oversight or regulatory control, leading experts in the technology warn. At the start of a new Guardian series on AI, experts in the field highlight the huge potential for the technology, which is already speeding up scientific and medical research, making cities run more smoothly, and making businesses more efficient.Related: Artificial intelligence commission needed to predict impact, says CBI[15]\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Ftheguardian%2Fvideos%2F10156126117641323%2F...w;_text=0...th;=476\">https://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Ftheguardian%2Fvideos%2F10156126117641323%2F...w;_text=0...th;=476</url>[16]But for all the promise of an AI revolution, there are mounting social, ethical and political concerns about the technology being developed without sufficient oversight from regulators, legislators and governments. Researchers told the Guardian that: The benefits of AI might be lost to a GM-style backlash. A brain drain to the private sector is harming universities. Expertise and wealth are being concentrated in a handful of firms. The field has a huge diversity problem. In October, Dame Wendy Hall, professor of computer science at Southampton University, co-chaired an independent review on the British AI industry. The report found that AI had the potential to add \u00a3630bn to the economy by 2035. But to reap the rewards, the technology must benefit society, she said. 'AI will affect every aspect of our infrastructure and we have to make sure that it benefits us,' she said. 'We have to think about all the issues. When machines can learn and do things for themselves, what are the dangers for us as a society? It's important because the nations that grasp the issues will be the winners in the next industrial revolution.' Today, responsibility for developing safe and ethical AI lies almost exclusively with the companies that build them. There are no testing standards, no requirement for AIs to explain their decisions, and no organisation equipped to monitor and investigate any bad decisions or accidents that happen.A central goal of the field of artificial intelligence is for machines to be able to learn how to perform tasks and make decisions independently, rather than being explicitly programmed with inflexible rules. There are different ways of achieving this in practice, but some of the most striking recent advances, such as AlphaGo, have used a strategy called reinforcement learning. Typically the machine will have a goal, such as translating a sentence from English to French and a massive dataset to train on. It starts off just making a stab at the task - in the translation example it would start by producing garbled nonsense and comparing its attempts against existing translations. The program is then 'rewarded' with a score when it is successful. After each iteration of the task it improves and after a vast number of reruns, such programs can match and even exceed the level of human translators. Getting machines to learn less well defined tasks or ones for which no digital datasets exist is a future goal that would require a more general form of intelligence, akin to common sense.  'We need to have strong independent organisations, along with dedicated experts and well-informed researchers, that can act as watchdogs and hold the major firms accountable to high standards,' said Kate Crawford, co-director of the AI Now Institute at New York University. 'These systems are becoming the new infrastructure. It is crucial that they are both safe and fair.' Many modern AIs learn to make decisions by being trained on massive datasets. But if the data itself contains biases, these can be inherited and repeated by the AI. Earlier this year, an AI that computers use to interpret language was found to display gender and racial biases[17]. Another used for image recognition categorised cooks as women[18], even when handed images of balding men. A host of others, including tools used in policing and prisoner risk assessment, have been shown to discriminate against black[19] people. The industry's serious diversity problem is partly to blame for AIs that discriminate against women and minorities. At Google and Facebook, four in five of all technical hires are men. The white male dominance of the field has led to health apps that only cater for male bodies, photo services that labelled black people as gorillas and voice recognition systems that did not detect women's voices. 'Software should be designed by a diverse workforce, not your average white male, because we're all going to be users,' said Hall.Play Video[20]\u00a0 Poorly tested or implemented AIs are another concern. Last year, a driver in the US died when the autopilot on his Tesla Model S failed to see a truck crossing the highway. An investigation into the fatal crash by the US National Transportation Safety Board criticised Tesla for releasing an autopilot system that lacked sufficient safeguards[21]. The company's CEO, Elon Musk, is one of the most vocal advocates of AI safety and regulation[22]. Yet more concerns exist over the use of AI-powered systems to manipulate people[23], with serious questions now being asked about uses of social media in the run-up to Britain's EU referendum and the 2016 US election. 'There's a technology arms race going on to see who can influence voters,' said Toby Walsh professor of artificial intelligence at the University of New South Wales and author of a recent book on AI called Android Dreams[24]. 'We have rules on the limits of what you can spend to influence people to vote in particular ways, and I think we're going to have to have limits on how much technology you can use to influence people.'Related: 'We can't compete': why universities are losing their best AI scientists[25]Even at a smaller scale, manipulation could create problems. 'On a day to day basis our lives are being, to some extent, manipulated by AI solutions,' said Sir Mark Walport, the government's former chief scientist, who now leads UK Research and Innovation, the country's new super-research council. 'There comes a point at which, if organisations behave in a manner that upsets large swaths of the public, it could cause a backlash.' Leading AI researchers have expressed similar concerns to the House of Lords AI committee, which is holding an inquiry into the economic, ethical and social implications of artificial intelligence. Evidence submitted by Imperial College London, one of the major universities for AI research, warns that insufficient regulation of the technology 'could lead to societal backlash, not dissimilar to that seen with genetically modified food, should serious accidents occur or processes become out of control'. Scientists at University College London share the concern about an anti-GM-style backlash, telling peers in their evidence: 'If a number of AI examples developed badly, there could be considerable public backlash, as happened with genetically modified organisms.' But the greatest impact on society may be AIs that work well, scientists told the Guardian. The Bank of England's chief economist has warned that 15m UK jobs could be automated[26] by 2035, meaning large scale re-training will be needed to avoid a sharp spike in unemployment. The short-term disruption could spark civil unrest, according to Maja Pantic, professor of affective and behavioural computing at Imperial, as could rising inequality driven by AI profits flowing to a handful of multinational companies. Subbarao Kambhampati, president of the American Association for Artificial Intelligence, said that although technology often benefited society, it did not always do so equitably. 'Recent technological advances have been leading to a lot more concentration of wealth,' he said. 'I certainly do worry about the effects of AI technologies on wealth concentration and inequality, and how to make the benefits more inclusive.'Related: Big tech firms' AI hiring frenzy leads to brain drain at UK universities[27] Related: Automation will affect one in five jobs across the UK, says study[28]The explosion of AI research in industry has driven intense demand for qualified scientists. At British universities, PhD students and postdoctoral researchers are courted by tech firms offering salaries two to five times those paid in academia. While some institutions are coping with the hiring frenzy, others are not. In departments where demand is most intense, senior academics fear they will lose a generation of talent who would traditionally drive research and teach future students[29]. According to Pantic, the best talent from academia is being sucked up by four major AI firms, Apple, Amazon, Google and Facebook. She said the situation could lead to 90% of innovation being controlled by the companies, shifting the balance of power from states to a handful of multinational companies. Walport, who oversees almost all public funding of UK science research, is cautious about regulating AI for fear of hampering research. Instead he believes AI tools should be carefully monitored once they are put to use so that any problems can be picked up early. 'If you don't continuously monitor, you're in danger of missing things when they go wrong,' he said. 'In the new world, we should surely be working towards continuous, real-time monitoring so that one can see if anything untoward or unpredictable is happening as early as possible.' That might be part of the answer, according to Robert Fisher, professor of computer vision at Edinburgh University. 'In theory companies are supposed to have liability, but we're in a grey area where they could say their product worked just fine, but it was the cloud that made a mistake, or the telecoms provider, and they all disagree as to who is liable,' he said. 'We are clearly in brand new territory. AI allows us to leverage our intellectual power, so we try to do more ambitious things,' he said. 'And that means we can have more wide-ranging disasters.' guardian.co.uk \u00a9 Guardian News ...dia Limited 2010 Published via the Guardian News Feed[30] plugin[31] for WordPress.First published as

Millions of consumers interact with AI directly or indirectly on a day-to-day basis via virtual assistants, facial-recognition technology, gaming platforms, chatbots, mapping applications and a host of other software. That said, this is just the early innings, and the area's profit potential is hard to overstate. From the Big Tech players to new age software platforms and advanced chipmakers, here are 10 AI companies betting big on artificial intelligence.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Nvidia Corp. (ticker: NVDA)</emphasis></p><p>Even if you've only casually followed the best ways to invest in artificial intelligence, you likely know Nvidia, the specialized <url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stock-market-news/slideshows/best-semiconductor-stocks\">semiconductor company</url> whose technology plays a central role in many young, high-growth areas of tech. Central to Nvidia's leadership is the company's graphics processing unit (GPU), which powers autonomous vehicles, high-performance gaming, cloud computing and many other areas requiring deep learning. Sony (      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stocks/sne-sony-corp-shs-sponsored-american-deposit-receipt-repr-sh\">SNE</url>) partnered with Nvidia to introduce a car prototype at the Consumer Electronics Show 2020. NVDA is marketing itself to automakers as the go-to solution for unified architecture across software, AV chips, data centers and more. NVDA's first-mover advantage in high-performance GPUs has eroded with competition, but it remains a market leader in that high-end market and is one of the best AI stocks to buy in 2020. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL)</emphasis></p><p>Google parent Alphabet has a practically existential interest in investing heavily in artificial intelligence. Google uses AI and deep learning to automate many vital parts of its sprawling <url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stock-market-news/slideshows/top-software-stocks-to-buy\">software business</url>: relevant search results, speech recognition, self-driving technology, ad pricing, personal assistant software and much more. Much of Alphabet's roughly $1 trillion valuation depends on maintaining and improving these services. With many observers believing AI could be a winner-take-all market, GOOG has the resources, motivation and experience to win, which would certainly make it one of the best artificial intelligence stocks to buy. In late 2019, Google announced it had achieved \"quantum supremacy\" with its Sycamore processor, solving a computation in 200 seconds that would take the world's fastest supercomputer 10,000 years. Until proven otherwise, this may make GOOG the single most exciting AI company in the world.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Salesforce (CRM)</emphasis></p><p>Salesforce, the customer relationship management software giant, regularly acquires hot tech startups to improve its software-as-a-service (SaaS) offerings. In 2019, it acquired Bonobo AI, a firm using automated analysis of customer phone calls, texts and chats to deliver actionable insights. This fits perfectly with Salesforce Einstein, the company's AI-powered software that uses data to identify previously unseen business patterns, deliver the hottest sales leads, predict what marketing copy will perform best and generally optimize how businesses operate and convert. It's no coincidence that Salesforce and a handful of the other best AI companies in the world are also now large-cap growth stocks, routinely growing their own sales by more than 20% each year. Analysts expect profits to advance 18% annually for the next five years.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Alteryx (AYX)</emphasis></p><p>The Irvine, California-based Alteryx is a relative newcomer among the best artificial intelligence companies, and it certainly flies more under the radar compared with many of the megacap stocks on this list. But AYX's software is an increasingly relevant tool for the mainstreaming of AI; its products allow data scientists and analytical professionals to collaborate with each other to discover data-based insights and deploy new machine learning code. An out-an-out growth stock, analysts expect revenue growth of around 20% in 2020 and 30% in 2021. Thankfully, the company is already profitable, and analysts expect the SaaS company to post robust compound earnings growth of more than 40% annually over the next five years.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Amazon.com (AMZN)</emphasis></p><p>The second company to ever reach a $1 trillion valuation, Amazon couldn't have hit that mark if it weren't all-in on artificial intelligence. Like Google, returning relevant search results is central to Amazon's business, and AI also powers key capabilities like forecasting product demand, optimizing logistics and warehousing and improving the voice-powered Amazon Alexa virtual assistant. Amazon Web Services, the company's cash cow, is also the <url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stock-market-news/slideshows/top-web-scale-spending-stocks-to-buy\">leading cloud provider</url> of machine learning services, making Amazon's expertise here even more vital (and lucrative). With hundreds of jobs in AI and machine learning posted globally, the \"e-tailer\" is investing heavily to stay at the forefront of the fast-growing field; CEO Jeff Bezos has pointedly mentioned the long-term capital investments Amazon will make in the area in recent letters to shareholders.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)</emphasis></p><p>The most valuable <url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stock-market-news/slideshows/best-tech-stocks-to-buy-this-year\">tech companies</url> in the world, without exception, all invest in artificial intelligence. Microsoft's cloud computing service, Azure, is home to AI-driven tools for medicine, language, robotics, medical imaging and many other areas. A 2019 $1 billion investment in Elon Musk-founded OpenAI aims to produce the Holy Grail of AI, artificial general intelligence (AGI) -- the technology that can do anything human intelligence can. If successful, Microsoft becomes OpenAI's preferred partner for commercialization. If AGI is feasible, it'll likely take decades, but the profit potential is virtually unthinkable. Anyone who wants a slice should own the top AI companies today -- and that means owning MSFT stock, the most notable Big Tech company not currently being targeted by U.S. regulators.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Twilio (TWLO)</emphasis></p><p>In U.S. News' original write-up of the best AI stocks, circa early 2018, Twilio was worth less than $4 billion and was cited as having the greatest risk/reward of all 10 companies. Just years later, the cloud software business is worth about $27 billion. Twilio makes cloud-based application programming interfaces (APIs) allowing developers to build voice, video and messaging features into their apps -- and remains a wildly popular, useful and fast-growing service. Like some others on this list, Twilio's high growth means high multiples. While only investors comfortable with greater volatility should consider TWLO, it still deserves mention as a top artificial intelligence company in 2020. Analysts expect profits to compound at 45% annually over the next five years.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">IBM (IBM)</emphasis></p><p>Ever since IBM's Deep Blue defeated the world's top chess player, Garry Kasparov, in 1997, IBM has been publicly foreshadowing its interest in being at the forefront of artificial intelligence. Its next pop culture success in the field came in 2011 when IBM's Watson won a game of \"Jeopardy!\" against some of the trivia gameshow's top contestants. But IBM's Watson technology and AI capabilities aren't just for parlor tricks -- they're increasingly important to the underlying business. IBM now makes a conversational AI assistant for businesses, AI-powered tools to prevent financial fraud and manage customer life cycles, and even software that can deliver <url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/funds/slideshows/recession-proof-health-care-etfs-to-buy\">health care</url> insights to help save lives.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Facebook (FB)</emphasis></p><p>Facebook is deeply committed to machine intelligence. Since January 2018, the company has had Jerome Pesenti, a legend in the field who famously led IBM's Watson division, running point on its AI Research team. Automating self-teaching algorithms to improve Facebook's News Feed algorithm is central to FB's success, and using AI to screen for hate speech and fake news has never been more important to the company (or society). With 2.6 billion monthly active users (MAUs) for the first quarter of 2020 and 3 billion MAUs across Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger, FB has a singular opportunity to test machine learning techniques with massive real-time datasets, giving FB a huge theoretical advantage over peers. After its AI team spent months studying them, the social media network announced it is banning misleading deepfake videos on its platform ahead of 2020 elections.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tencent (TCEHY)</emphasis></p><p>Transitioning from the largest social company in the U.S. to the largest social company in China, the tech conglomerate Tencent rounds out the list of the best AI stocks to buy. China's first tech firm valued at more than $500 billion largely hit the jackpot with WeChat, a dynamic app ubiquitously used in China for messaging, payments, ride-hailing, social media, mail and other functions. One can imagine the practically endless ways machine learning and artificial intelligence can augment that service -- and in the meantime, how WeChat's more than 1 billion daily active users can be used to test and rapidly improve this technology. TCEHY has recruited several top AI experts in recent years from rivals including Microsoft and Baidu (<url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stocks/bidu-baidu-inc-adr\">BIDU</url>). </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The best AI stocks to buy:</emphasis></p><p>-- Nvidia Corp.

Its use is infused with the cultural ethos of those who deploy it.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Digital connectivity may have been conceived in the algorithmic imagination of Silicon Valley libertarians as a way to free the individual from institutions. But in the hands of China's institutional civilization, shaped for millennia by a communitarian and authoritarian mindset, it further empowers the state.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The marriage of big data with the analytic capacities of intelligent machines has spawned twin big brothers: surveillance capitalism in the West and a monitory mandarinate in China. Neither fit within the original libertarian vision. Both invade privacy by tracking personal information, for social control in the East and for profit in the West.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This divergent use of technology will widen as artificial intelligence expands and penetrates all aspects of society, from the Internet of Things to gene editing. How East and West seek to guide that development will also differ markedly. And of course, crossover is not insignificant. Chinese companies Alibaba and Tencent make a pretty penny off of their online users' data; American intelligence agencies, as Edward Snowden revealed, are no strangers to poking into the lives of others.</p><p>In The WorldPost this week, we examine prospective approaches to this rapidly oncoming challenge.</p><p>It turns out that the British House of Lords - which has been reformed in recent years to become a meritocratic adjunct to an elected House of Commons instead of a club for hereditary peers - has made one of the most important contributions so far to thinking about the future of AI and society. After six months of hearings and investigations, it has just released a comprehensive report that calls for a global charter to govern the digital age.</p><p>          Anthony Giddens, a prominent sociologist and former director of the London School of Economics who sat on the committee, writes: \"In 1215, England adopted the Magna Carta to stop kings from abusing their power. Today, the new kings are big tech companies, and just like centuries ago, we need a charter to govern them.\"</p><p>The proposed charter lays out the main principles that should determine the development of AI both at the national and international level. As Giddens relays it, AI should:</p><p>LinkedIn founder <person><nameText>Reid Hoffman </nameText></person>discusses the utopian and dystopian possibilities of AI in this short video interview.</p><p>In China, the party-state seems far more likely to take control of AI directly rather than follow the Western, rule-of-law approach that would seek to bind private development through ethical principles.</p><p>          Feng Xiang is a well-known and widely respected legal scholar at Tsinghua University in Beijing. Though he does not represent any official view, his way of thinking about AI in the context of \"socialism with Chinese characteristics\" certainly draws from the \"sinicized Marxism\" that informs the perspective of party ideologists.</p><p>In a provocative essay, he argues that AI should be nationalized. \"For the sake of social well-being and security, individuals and private companies should not be allowed to possess any exclusive cutting-edge technology or core AI platforms. Like nuclear and biochemical weapons, as long as they exist, nothing other than a strong and stable state can ensure society's safety.\"</p><p>Looking into the future, Feng returns to the red ambitions of the past, which he now sees as achievable thanks to AI. \"The dream of communism is the elimination of wage labor. If AI is bound to serve society instead of private capitalists, it promises to do so by freeing an overwhelming majority from such drudgery while creating wealth to sustain all.</p><p>If the state controls the market, instead of digital capitalism controlling the state, true communist aspirations will be achievable. And because AI increasingly enables the management of complex systems by processing massive amounts of information through intensive feedback loops, it presents, for the first time, a real alternative to the market signals that have long justified laissez-faire ideology - and all the ills that go with it.</p><p>Going forward, China's socialist market economy, which aims to harness the fruits of production for the whole population and not just a sliver of elites operating in their own self-centered interests, can lead the way toward this new stage of human development.\"</p><p>Feng concludes: \"If properly regulated in this way, we should celebrate, not fear, the advent of AI. If it is brought under social control, it will finally free workers from peddling their time and sweat only to enrich those at the top. The communism of the future ought to adopt a new slogan: 'Robots of the world, unite!'\"</p><p>          Bing Song takes a softer approach, though along the same continuum as Feng. \"The private ownership of data, which is the basis for the current data privacy protection scheme, requires a rethink,\" she writes from Beijing. \"Personal data once shared on platforms should no longer be viewed as the unencumbered private property of individuals or platforms. Instead, the data in circulation should be viewed as a public good, and data aggregators should become custodians of the public good.\"</p><p>While most attention has focused on how the party-state will use big data to engage in surveillance from above, Bing sees the potential of a two-way street in which citizens will be able to monitor the government from below. \"In 2015, the Chinese government\u00a0issued\u00a0an action plan for fostering an open data society and developing a big data industry,\" she reports. \"The plan sets out detailed goals: by 2020, government data is due to open to the public in 20 or more civil welfare and benefits-related areas such as credit, transportation, employment, social security, culture and natural resources.\"</p><p>          Why Kim Jong Un will give up his nukes        </p><p>While virtually every analyst of the North Korean crisis believes Kim Jong Un will not give up his nukes, Spencer Kim is convinced he will. As he writes from Seoul, \"Kim, who has god-like status among his people, has in effect told North Koreans four things:</p><p>The North Korean leader, argues the author, cannot now say, 'Oops, I misread the situation - let's go back to being poor but proud with nukes!' He has mounted a tiger and cannot get off without being eaten. He must ride it all the way to his destination.\"</p><p>          Is Trump trading away human rights in China?       </p><p>          Chen Guangcheng is the famous blind human rights lawyer who escaped house arrest in 2012 and fled to the U.S. Embassy in Beijing and later to exile in the United States. He appeals to President Donald Trump not to forsake human rights in his trade negotiations with China.</p><p>\"The United States should use the threat of a trade war to push China to adopt political change and institute a strong rule-of-law system based on human rights,\" he pleads. \"Universal values should be upheld as we bravely say no to the repressive regimes of the world.

These firms plan to expand AI use to purposes beyond cost reduction, using AI for revenue generation, process automation, risk management, customer service and client acquisition.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In\u00a0Transforming Paradigms: Global AI in Financial Services Survey,\u00a0over 150 senior financial services executives in both fintech and incumbent financial institutions responded to a range of questions on the impact AI will have on the industry, concluding that there will be a significant gap between firms that quickly implement AI and firms that lag behind.</p><p>Currently, 60% of firms invest less than 10% of their R&amp;D resources on AI despite evidence of accelerating returns. Pay offs have shown to be especially strong between investment levels of 10% and 30% as well as investment levels of 30% and &gt;40%.</p><p>\"The comprehensive and global study confirms that AI is affecting the financial system at an accelerating pace,\" says Matthew Blake, Head of Financial and Monetary Systems at the World Economic Forum. \"With the rising trend of mass adoption of the technologies throughout financial services, those firms that implement AI quickly look set to sprint ahead.\"</p><p>The study has also revealed executive fears surrounding AI bias and market-wide risks, with over half of executives saying they expect mass AI adoption to worsen bias and discrimination within the sector. Other market-wide risks were also identified.</p><p>This is a worry, but 70% of respondents also believe they are at least somewhat prepared to mitigate AI bias risks. Generally, firms using Risk and Compliance teams in AI implementation are most confident about their chances.</p><p>The report also identified a difference between how fintechs and incumbent firms are expecting to use AI in their businesses. For example, a higher share of fintechs are creating AI-based products and services, employ autonomous decision-making systems, and rely on cloud-based offerings. Meanwhile, traditional financial services players predominantly focus on harnessing AI to improve existing products.</p><p>\"This empirical research underscores the growing importance of harnessing AI in financial services,\" says Bryan Zhang, Executive Director of the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance, \"which gives new impetus for firms to develop a holistic and future-proof AI strategy.\"</p><p>The\u00a0Global AI in Financial Services Survey,\u00a0which was produced in collaboration with EY and Invesco, looks into many areas of AI adoption in financial services. The report's other major findings include:</p><p>77% anticipate AI to have highor very high strategic importance within two yearsNearly half of all respondents see a major competitive threat in \"Big Tech\" firms leveraging AI capabilities to enter financial services.Selling AI-based solutions as a service is becoming a distinct business model, currently adopted by 45% of fintechs and 21% of incumbents, which allows firms to capitalize on larger and more diverse datasets through digital platforms.Novel insights are increasingly provided by using AI to analyse new or alternative datasets such as social media and geo-location data, with 60% of respondents making use of such data in their AI applications.Data quality and access to data and talent are seen as major obstacles to implementing AI by more than 80% of respondents each.Traditional financial services firms expect AI a 9% net reduction of jobs by 2030 while fintechs expect to increase their workforce by 19%.While views of regulatory influence on AI implementation diverge, most firms feel impeded by data-sharing regulations between jurisdictions and entities as well as regulatory uncertainty and complexity.</p><p>\"AI is transforming the financial services industry and we can expect widespread adoption to continue,\" says Nigel Duffy, EY Global Artificial Intelligence Leader. \"As the technologies start to disrupt business models and transform business functions, it's increasingly important for organizations to focus on the long-term implications of AI adoption: trust in AI, workforce transformation, and how customer and stakeholder value can be radically reimagined.\"</p><p>\"The report highlights the amazing opportunity ahead of us in financial services for using artificial intelligence and machine learning to the benefits of our customers and our organizations,\" says Donie Lochan, Chief Technology Officer, Invesco. \"Technological advances such as leveraging intelligence to define investments for customers tied to their personalized goals, improving customer experience through the use of intelligent bots, additional alpha generation via insights from alternative datasets, and operational efficiencies through machine learning automation, will soon become the norm for our industry.\"</p><p>Overall, this survey highlights the profound shift AI is bringing to the financial services industry. As companies begin to leverage AI to increase profitability and achieve scale, more changes can be expected within the industry and for consumers.</p><p>The post Artificial Intelligence Will Transform Financial Services Industry Within Two Years, Survey Finds appeared first on Eurasia Review.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EUSRVW-166346468</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EUSRVW2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y4K-NND1-JDJN-64YN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">417294</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"893\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Buzz Future LLC Provided by Syndigate Media Inc.<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"ro\"><url normalizedValue=\"http://syndigate.info\">(Syndigate.info)</url></emphasis></emphasis> All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Eurasia Review</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"35455\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"02\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>February 4, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0001YM8</classCode><className>INVESCO LTD</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>NAICS523920 PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>SIC6282 INVESTMENT ADVICE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>IVZ (NYSE)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX001347</classCode><className>POLLS &amp;

If you've got a laptop, you've got a recording studio. If you've got an iPhone, you've got a movie camera. And distribution is free - it's called the internet.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Just put your stuff out there, and soon you, too, can make a living doing what you love, just like all those viral stars you read about.</p><p> But the story has some major flaws. You can certainly just put your stuff out there, but you're going to have a lot of trouble getting anyone to pay you for it.</p><p> And production and distribution are not the main costs of making art. That would be staying alive while you do your work and becoming an artist in the first place.</p><p> Staying alive means, principally, rent. According to the Census Bureau, median rent nationwide is up 42 percent, adjusted for inflation, since 2000. For most artists, becoming an artist means going to college, then perhaps getting an MFA, and tuitions have been soaring for years.</p><p> Yes, being an artist has always been hard, but how hard matters. How hard it is affects how much you get to do your art, as opposed to grinding at your day job, and therefore how good you become, as well as how much you are able to produce.</p><p> How hard it is affects who gets to do art at all.
