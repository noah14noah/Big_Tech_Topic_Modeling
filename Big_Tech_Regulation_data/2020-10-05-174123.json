KEY FACTS     The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.4%, over 100 points, on Wednesday, while the S&amp;P 500 rose 0.9% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite gained 1.1%.      The Federal Reserve, which concludes its two-day policy meeting on Wednesday, is expected to keep interest rates unchanged at near zero to continue to support the economy through the coronavirus pandemic.       The CEOs of Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google-parent Alphabet are set to testify before the House Antitrust Subcommittee later on Wednesday, which may give investors insight into how Big Tech companies are handling challenges from regulators.       While Big Tech companies are among the best-performing stocks so far this year, there are rising concerns on Wall Street that heavy market concentration in these handful of big names could pose downside risks.      The busiest week of the second quarter earnings season continued, with shares of General Electric, Advanced Micro Devices, General Motors and Shopify all rising after the companies reported better-than-expected results.      Boeing and Starbucks, meanwhile, posted wider-than-expected losses last quarter, but both stocks traded higher heading into the market open.     Key background   Investors also continued to assess the latest coronavirus relief bill unveiled by Senate Republicans late on Monday, titled the Heath, Economic Assistance, Liability Protection and Schools (HEALS) Act. The GOP proposal for the next round of federal coronavirus aid includes a second round of $1,200 stimulus checks and more funds for small business loans in the Paycheck Protection Program. The bill would also eliminate the $600-per-week federal unemployment supplement, which states stopped paying out this week, to be replaced with a 70% wage-replacement program.    What to watch for   The Federal Reserve will wrap up its two-day policy meeting on Wednesday: The last time Fed officials met in June, they decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0% to 0.25%. On Tuesday, the central bank announced that it would extend loan programs through the end of 2020 as it continues to support the U.S. economy amid the pandemic.

THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">WILLOW BAY, CNN ANCHOR: Tonight on MONEYLINE, Wall Street closes the week with a bang, lifting the Nasdaq back above 4,000 as investors take heart that the Fed will refrain from another rate hike.  Setting the stage for today's rally, a big drop in new jobs created.  But is the real story a shortage of workers?  And after a few earnings blowups, we look ahead to next week's profit picture.  How will Yahoo!, Motorola and Gateway perform?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Plus we're hours away from learning whether the new \"Harry Potter\" book was worth the build-up, but is stock in the publisher -- Scholastic -- worth a read?  We check out \"The Bottom Line\" at Scholastic,</p><p>ANNOUNCER: This is MONEYLINE.  Reporting tonight from New York, Willow Bay.</p><p>BAY: Good evening, everyone.  Stuart is off tonight.</p><p>Surprising weakness on Main Street today was applauded on Wall Street, the Dow industrials posting their best showing since the end of May.  Stocks took off in a broad rally sparked by the June employment report.  It showed job growth slowing down, and that could keep the Fed from raising interest rates again next month.</p><p>After a week filled with disappointing profit warnings, investors were looking for some good news, and today, they found some.</p><p>Allan Chernoff has more on the Friday firepower.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ALLAN CHERNOFF, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): It's Wall Street logic: The economy turns down and investors celebrate, toasting the idea that the Federal Reserve may no longer need to raise interest rates.</p><p>LARRY RICE, JOSEPHTHAL &amp; COMPANY: Investors are coming back with more confidence that perhaps the Fed is gone for the rest of the year and there won't be any surprises.</p><p>CHERNOFF: That thought is a tonic for bank stocks, whose profits depend on interest rates. FRED PRICE, SANDLER O'NEILL: Financials have been beaten up so bad people for the last two years that people are finally, the value investors are finally taking a hard look and then saying, this really is a cheap sector, you can see that nibbling going on.</p><p>CHERNOFF: Financials led the Dow to 154-point gain.  For the week, up nearly 2 percent.</p><p>The Nasdaq composite leaped over 4,000 for the first time in two weeks, delivering a 1 1/2 percent gain on the week.</p><p>Investors continued scrambling back into semiconductor stocks, especially capital equipment names, as the list of brokerage firms supporting the sector grew.  Semiconductors had a roller-coaster week, tumbling on Wednesday when SalomonSmith Barney downgraded the stocks.</p><p>TIMOTHY GHRISKEY, DREYFUS CORPORATION: The demand for technology products remains extremely strong.  This is an economy being driven by the demand for technology.</p><p>CHERNOFF: But tech troubles remain.  Yahoo! fell on a downgrade, pointing to slowing revenue and profit growth.  And Compuware became the latest software company to disappoint, warning earnings for the quarter could be only half of what \"The Street\" was expecting.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CHERNOFF: But wait a minute.  There's a potential hole in Wall Street's logic.  If the economy is definitely slowing, won't that be bad for corporate profits?  Earnings for the second quarter should look good, but more soft economic data could very quickly end Wall Street's celebration -- Willow.</p><p>BAY: And then the logic would change again.</p><p>CHERNOFF: And the attitude on Wall Street.  It can shift back and forth very rapidly.</p><p>BAY: Now today, folks are in a good mood, a good Friday rally, a decent week for all the indexes.  Any sense of optimism now heading into the second half of the year, the third and fourth quarters?</p><p>CHERNOFF: Well, certainly going into earning season, because we're now just about finished with the preannouncement season.  That's usually when bad news comes out.  Second-quarter earnings should be very good, setting a positive tone for the Street.  We'll have to see, though, how much the economy slows down.  That's the key question going forward.</p><p>BAY: In the meantime, we'll take the goods news on a Friday.</p><p>Thanks, Allan.</p><p>Checking some of the other big winners on Wall Street today, the Dow industrials powered ahead, led by strong gains in Hewlett-Packard, up nearly 6 1/2.  Two retailers, Home Depot and Wal-Mart, jumped more than four.  IBM, up nearly three after a recent slump.  And Intel gained more than 2 1/2.</p><p>Over on the Nasdaq, Sycamore Networks rocketed 16 3/4.  Redback gained more than nine.</p><p>Other big tech movers: Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Veritas Software and Sun Microsystems.</p><p>That tamer-than-expected employment report showed a significant slowdown in job growth last month.  Businesses created fewer jobs in June than at any time during the last four years.  Nonfarm payrolls increased by just 11,000, down significantly from the revised 171,000 jobs created in May.</p><p>Bob Beard has more from Washington.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BOB BEARD, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): June's overall nonfarm job growth, way below market predictions -- the smallest since a nasty blizzard battered the East Coast in January 1996.</p><p>While corporate America added 206,000 jobs in June, that was offset by government layoffs, including the loss of 190,000 temporary census jobs.  Most experts agree the economy is showing signs of a second-quarter retreat.</p><p>WILLIAM DICKENS, BROOKING INSTITUTION: It's one more piece of evidence that there's been a slowdown in what had been a very rapid rate of growth in the economy in the last quarter of last year and the first quarter of this year.</p><p>BEARD: Services added the most jobs in June, 148,000.  Retail added 49,000 jobs.  Manufacturing, 19,000.  Job losses, though, came in a key sector for economic growth, real estate.  But 4 percent unemployment was enough to keep the administration crowing.</p><p>ALEXIS HERMAN, U.S. SECRETARY OF LABOR: This report is actually very reassuring.  I think it tells us that this economy continues to perform at a very solid and steady pace, and I think it further indicates that this economy probably did take a breather last month.</p><p>BEARD: U.S. workers enjoyed a little more in their paychecks, too.  Average hourly earnings grew a nickel to $13.71 last month.  And so far, wage inflation remains fairly tame, up 3.6 percent from a year ago.</p><p>DICKENS: Wage growth is moderate, but not so hot that it has to be inflationary is again good news for most people.</p><p>BEARD: But the available pool of workers, a favorite indicator of Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan, fell 3 1/2 percent.</p><p>(on camera): That shrinking pool of workers means employers are having a tough time filling open positions, forcing many to boost wages.</p><p>Bob Beard, CNN Financial News, Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BAY: And that very issue -- the tight labor market -- is something Fed policy-makers will be watching closely.</p><p>Ceci Rodgers picks up the story from Chicago.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CECI RODGERS, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Job growth is slowing, and the labor market is easing up?  Try telling that to small-business owners like Bill D'Ambrosio.  He has three job openings, and his starting pay is about $2 over minimum wage.</p><p>BILL D'AMBROSIO, MAIL BOXES ETC.: We normally get a lot of referrals, but they've been hard to come by lately.  Everybody seems to be looking.</p><p>RODGERS: Looking for qualified workers.  Still, the numbers show that private-sector job growth has slowed.  Average monthly payroll gains in the private sector were a blistering 244,000 in the first quarter.  In the second quarter, those gains were nearly cut in half.</p><p>Economists say there may be more than one reason for dwindling job growth.</p><p>ANTHONY CHAN, BANK ONE INVESTMENT ADVISORS: One way to interpret this is that there is some slowing coming on.  Another way of interpreting is maybe there are not a lot of potential employees, so therefore employers don't bother.</p><p>RODGERS: One indication that it could be the latter: the shrinking pool of available workers and its potential for pushing wages higher.  Economists say the Fed will remain on the alert for signs of creeping wage inflation.  The question is, will inflation continue to be a threat as the economy slows?</p><p>LYLE GRAMLEY, MORTGAGE BANKERS ASSOCIATION: I don't think anyone knows the answer to that question.  I don't, and I don't think the Fed does either.  So there's -- because inflation is creeping, not more than that, there's no reason for the Fed to continue to tighten until the answer to that question becomes clearer.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>RODGERS: Gramley says there's now less than a 50-50 chance the Fed will raise interest rates at its next policy meeting in late August.  Still, with labor markets remaining tight, it may be many months before the Fed signals an all-clear on its credit-tightening campaign -- Willow.</p><p>BAY: Thanks, Ceci.</p><p>Both stock and bond investors today were betting that the jobs report will help convince the Fed to keep interest rates right where they are.  Economists say the possibility of a rate increase at the next policy meeting in August is now below 50 percent.</p><p>Checking the Treasury action today, the 10-year bond up 7/32. The 30-year gained more than a half point, pushing the yield down to 5.87 percent.</p><p>Our next guest says it may be too early to tell what the Fed will do.  Joining us now from Boston: Allen Sinai, the chief global economist at Primark Decision Economics.</p><p>Allen, welcome back.</p><p>ALLEN SINAI, PRIMARK DECISION ECONOMICS: How are you?</p><p>BAY: Good.  Give us your take on today's labor numbers: a slowdown in demand, a slowdown in supply, a shortage of workers.</p><p>SINAI: It's going to make it very tough for the Federal Reserve, and the hawks and doves factions on the Federal Reserve to decide what to do on August 22nd, pending on the data between now and then.  Job growth definitely is slowing down in the private sector.  There's lots of weakness in demand in the second quarter that says that's why job growth slowed down.  At the same time, we have a very tight labor market, indicated by the 4 percent unemployment rate and declines in labor force growth and the available supply of workers.</p><p>At the Fed, the hawks are going to say low unemployment rate, inflation risk ahead, let's buy insurance with a quarter-point hike. The doves, perhaps led by Chairman Greenspan, will say let's wait and see.</p><p>BAY: Now, this statistic, the available pool of labor, is an indicator that apparently Alan Greenspan watches very carefully.  Is it a better indicator of the labor market and potential inflationary pressures?</p><p>SINAI: It's an interesting indicator.  I don't think I would say it's a better indicator.  The sequence of events normally is the economy slows down and responds to higher interest rates, and in this case, higher oil and energy inflation.  Then the demand for workers eases off.  That appears to be happening.  And regardless of the supply side, in the aftermath of that with the lag, the unemployment rate goes up and the inflation prospect improves.  And I would go with that scenario, and I think you see the bond market and the expectations in the fixed-income market going with that scenario as well.</p><p>BAY: Now, one of the concerns on the horizon is this notion of a rebound, that we'll see an uptick in the economic indicators.  How common is this in the process of a slowdown?</p><p>SINAI: In the last five years it's been quite common to have one or two weak quarters in a sea of strength.  But conditions are different now.  Interest rates are almost two percentage points higher in the front end of the yield curve.  The stock market's gone nowhere for years, so the wealth effect isn't happening.  And we do have a bite out of purchasing power coming from higher oil and energy costs. So I think we really do have a slowdown that's going to be permanent.  But remember slowdown is not such a big thing anymore, because we're slowing down from big numbers and our potential rate of growth is 3 1/2 percent a year.</p><p>BAY: Allen, briefly, is the Fed going to pull off, pull this off?  Are we headed for the perfect soft landing?</p><p>SINAI: Well, over the next quarter or two, things are looking very good for that.  I think next year we're going to be softer -- (UNINTELLIGIBLE) harder than a soft landing.  And after a summer rally in the stock market, which started today, I think the stock market will correct further, but after we get that summer rally.  The stock market looks good right now.</p><p>BAY: Allen Sinai, thanks for joining us tonight on MONEYLINE.</p><p>SINAI: Thank you.</p><p>BAY: Still to come, another blow to Qualcomm.  South Korea's biggest wireless carriers snub the telecom pioneer and turn to its rivals.  A similar disappointment for Broadvision sent investors running for cover.  The software company gets the losing end in a bid for a high-profile contract.  And its sure to be a blockbuster hit at your local bookstore, but can Harry Potter help Scholastic become a bestseller on Wall Street?  \"The Bottom Line\" still to come tonight on MONEYLINE.\"</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BAY: Checking tonight's \"MONEYLINE Movers,\" Orchid Biosciences jumped 9 1/2, hitting a new 52-week high.  The biotech company said today that Celera Genomics will use its patented gene-analysis techniques in its research.  Peoplesoft gained 2 1/2 after Lehman Brothers upgraded it to an outperform rating.  Lehman said that meetings with the software company's management indicated that business is improving.  And Starbucks gained 3 3/4 after reporting a 9 percent increase in same-store sales late yesterday.  The coffee retailer said that sales have jumped 32 percent so far this year, which has helped boost the stock.  It's up 72 percent year-to-date.</p><p>Broadvision plummeted today after American Airlines chose rival Internet software provider Art Technology Group as its Web site provider.  Both companies make software that personalize what viewers see on Internet sites.  American selected Art Technology's \"Dynamo\" software package to develop its new \"aa.com\" Web site.  American had been a longtime Brodvision client.</p><p>While AMR -- parent of American Airlines -- fell fractionally today, Broadvision plunged more than 13 1/2, or 25 percent, the most active stock on the Nasdaq.  Art Technology Group gained 17.  The stock is up nearly 2,000 percent from its 52-week low that it hit last August.  Meanwhile, Broadvision is down more than 54 percent from its 52-week high.</p><p>Another big Nasdaq loser today: Qualcomm.  The stock plunged after it appeared that South Korea will not choose to use Qualcomm technology.  An official decision won't come until next week, but investors weren't willing to wait.  Qualcomm stock tumbling more than 5 to 56 5/8.</p><p>For the details we're joined by Casey Wian in our Los Angeles bureau -- Casey.</p><p>CASEY WIAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Willow, Qualcomm's stock was hammered by another blow to its future business prospects in Asia. Three large South Korean mobile phone companies have decided they prefer a technology designed by Ericsson and Nokia for their next generation wireless phone service.  Right now, Qualcomm's technology dominates the lucrative Korean mobile-phone market.  But it appears that may not be the case when so-called third generation chips allowing wireless Internet access become available there in 2002.</p><p>This is the latest in a series of setbacks for Qualcomm.  Its chip business has already been hurt by the Korean government's decision to stop subsidizing cell phone sales, and two weeks ago, the company announced layoffs.</p><p>Last year Qualcomm's stock soared.  This year it has fallen almost as fast, losing more than 70 percent of its value.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>EDWARD SNYDER, CHASE H&amp;Q: I mean, the good news for Qualcomm is that the core business is intact.  They're in no danger of insolvency or problems with the basic business.  The bad news, of course, is all the announcements in the last quarter or so have basically dampened any prospects of rapid growth.  And I think the run-up last year was based on the assumption that the company's technology would spread throughout the world, and they would get revenues, whether royalties or equipment sales, from that technology.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WIAN: Qualcomm says the Korean government has still not made a final decision, and it believes both standards will be used.  Qualcomm also claims it will collect royalties no matter which system is adopted, because the competing standard is based on Qualcomm-patented technology.</p><p>And separately, Qualcomm is fighting another battle, this one against computer hackers.  According to a published report, the FBI is investigating a former University of Wisconsin graduate student for penetrating Qualcomm's electronic defenses and compromising proprietary information -- Willow.</p><p>WIAN: Casey Wian from Los Angeles, thanks.</p><p>Coming up on MONEYLINE, the Pentagon prepares its latest test of a disputed missile defense system.  Will tonight's outcome determine whether the program lives or dies?  We'll have that story and more just ahead in our \"News Digest.\"</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BAY: As you might imagine, several stocks hit a 52-week high today, including Brocade Communications, Cigna, Genzyme, Marriott International, and MedImmune.</p><p>Saudi Arabia's promise to increase oil supply by 500,000 barrels a day is -- quote -- \"coming very soon\": that according to a Persian Gulf oil official who also said today that intense discussions are ongoing.  No details yet as to which other countries will cooperate or just how much extra oil supply will hit the market.  But the official did say that non-OPEC member Mexico also plans to boost output.</p><p>Since Saudi Arabia's surprise announcement on Monday, oil prices have fallen more than $2, but today, light sweet crude closed up 29 cents at 30.28.</p><p>Turning now to the day's top stories outside the world of business, Joie Chen in Atlanta has that in the \"MONEYLINE News Digest\" -- Joie.</p><p>JOIE CHEN, CNN ANCHOR: Willow, thanks.</p><p>The White House taking action tonight regarding the first planned execution under federal law in 40 years.  President Clinton will postpone the execution of Juan Raul Garza, scheduled for next month. Garza was convicted of ordering the murders of three men.  The White House spokesman says the president wants Garza to have a full opportunity to apply for clemency under new Justice Department guidelines, which are coming out soon.</p><p>Mr. Clinton supports the death penalty but says he wants it carried out fairly.</p><p>Just hours from now the launch window opens for the third test of a controversial anti-missile program.  The president is expected to decide within months whether to deploy the national missile defense system.  It has already flunked one test.</p><p>The White House says the program's future doesn't hinge on tonight's outcome.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>P.J. CROWLEY, NSC SPOKESMAN: I would say a hit doesn't automatically suggest success nor does a failure automatically come with a miss tonight.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHEN: Also today, Florida police say they have identified a body found in a car at the bottom of a pond as Cory Erving, the son of basketball star Julius Erving.  Cory was missing for over a month. Foul play is not suspected in this case.</p><p>Stock car driver Kenny Irwin died today in a crash while practicing for Sunday's New England 300 race.

According to the Washington Service Research Firm, insider selling surged 68 percent to a record, $36 1/2 billion in the first half of the year.  Leading the way, Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen.  He shed $4 billion worth of Microsoft shares.  Bill Gates sold $153 million worth of Microsoft stock.  Together the two made up 12 percent of all insider selling in the first half.</p><p>Other big sellers included Michael Dell, who sold $755 million worth of Dell stock; Gateway founder Ted Waitt' John Chambers of Cisco Systems; and Jeff Bezos of Amazon.com.</p><p>Coming up in our next half hour, full coverage of today's market action.

Here again, Willow Bay.</p><p>BAY: In tonight's headlines, a surprising slowdown in the number of jobs added to the U.S. economy: Will it be enough to stop the Fed from pulling the trigger on another rate hike?</p><p>And we'll take a look at profits coming down the pike: Will next week's batch of tech earnings live up to billing after a few big-time disappointments in recent days?</p><p>Plus, while millions can't wait to get their hands on Harry Potter's new adventures, we check out whether you might want to get a piece of the publisher: \"The Bottom Line\" on Scholastic.</p><p>But first, more on tonight's top story, a Friday rally on Wall Street that carried all the major markets into positive territory for the week.  Blue chip stocks posted their strongest showing since May 30th, as the Dow bolted higher from the opening bell, closing up 154 to 10635, up nearly 2 percent for the week. Tech and retail shares drove the move.  Hewlett Packard jumped nearly 6 1/2, Home Depot surged 4, Wal-Mart rose nearly 4 3/4, IBM and Intel up more than 2 1/2.  Those Intel gains also helped power the Nasdaq back above 4000 for the first time in two weeks.  The index gained 62, to 4023, up nearly 1.5 percent for the week.</p><p>Checking some other Nasdaq movers, Applied Materials and Sun Microsystems rose more than 2 1/2.  Dell Computers surged nearly 3. Gateway up nearly 5 1/2 and Apple Computer gained more than 2 1/2.</p><p>Planting the seeds for today's rally, another sign the economy may be cooling off, as U.S. businesses added only 11,000 jobs in June, far less than expected and a huge drop from previous months.  The Treasury market welcomed the news on hopes the Fed would hold pat on interest rates at its next meeting.  The 10-year issue gaining nearly one-quarter, its yield dropping 6 percent while the 30-year jumped more than half a point.</p><p>But the equity markets were the scene of most of the Friday fireworks.  For more on the day, we go to Fred Katayama at the New York Stock Exchange -- Fred.</p><p>FRED KATAYAMA, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, Willow, investors couldn't seem to get enough out of that surprisingly weak job creation number.  With the triple-digit gains today, stock strategists say they now expect to see a summer rally in the third quarter.  They argue the prospects for corporate profits are bright.  Earnings tracker IBES predicts overall gains of 18 to 19 percent in the third quarter.</p><p>This could spark enough momentum for stocks to break out of the current trading range and into a summer rally, but a mild one at best. And traders and strategists warn that any rally may not last long.</p><p>Bill Meehan of Cantor Fitzgerald says he's advising his clients to use any rallies at the end of earnings season to sell and raise cash.  He just doesn't see any catalysts for pushing stocks higher once the upcoming earnings season nears an end.</p><p>And some strategists say there's still room for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates in August.  They note that the average hourly earnings figure in today's report still hints that a tight labor market is applying upward pressure on wages.  And that figure, they say, is one stat Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan likes to monitor.</p><p>And one of his other favorites, the Economic Cycle Research Institute's future inflation gauge, is close to an 11-year high -- Willow.</p><p>BAY: Fred, still a nice way to end the week.  Fred Katayama at the New York Stock Exchange.</p><p>One loser today in an otherwise up market: Yahoo!.  It took a hit on a grim prognosis from Deutsche Banc Alex Brown.  The brokerage house cut its rating for Yahoo!, this based on concerns of slower- than-expected growth in revenues, as well as worries over the stock's valuation. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ANDREA WILLIAMS RICE, DEUTSCHE BANC ALEX BROWN: So it gets to be much more difficult to generate the revenue and EPS growth that investors have come to expect from Yahoo!.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAY: The stock dropped today, down nearly six ahead of next Tuesday's earnings report.</p><p>Compuware prepared investors for its own profit report, and the stock got hammered today.  The software maker warned that first quarter earnings will be well below Wall Street estimates due to weak revenues.  Compuware expects to post a profit of seven to nine cents a share.  Analysts expected 15 cents.  Today its stock lost 11 percent, down more than a point to a 52-week low.</p><p>Compuware is only the latest in a list of tech firms to alert investors to disappointing results.  But Bruce Francis reports warnings may be up, but surprisingly, so are projections for the tech sector.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BRUCE FRANCIS, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Compuware, Computer Associates, Unisys, all recently warned of worse-than- expected results, part of a rising tide of negative preannouncements. In fact, according to First Call, negative preannouncements as a percentage of the total are at 59 percent, significantly higher than last quarter and ahead of the same period last year as well as the historical average.</p><p>But tech investors are hoping that the worst is over.</p><p>DENNIS MCKECHNIE, PIMCO: This week was the week of confessions, preannouncements.  Companies had finished their three-month quarters just so they know what they're going to print, they feel confident about their numbers.  Once they didn't have confidence, had to let that out to the public.  And so right now we go from bad to good.</p><p>FRANCIS: Despite the wave of negative preannouncements, expectations for tech earnings overall have been rising, not falling. A month ago, analysts expected tech earnings on average to rise a healthy 29 percent.  But now the overall expectation has soared to an average gain of 37 percent, partly due to Intel's preannouncement of a big investment gain.</p><p>Intel's preannouncements supercharged an already strong outlook for semiconducters, on top of the very strong gain last year.  Profits for software makers are expected to grow 22 percent, slightly off last year's levels.  Despite concerns about mainframes, computer company earnings are expected to edge out '99's results, but dragged down by laggards like 3Com and Cabletron.</p><p>Communications technology companies are expected to post just 8 percent growth, way behind last year's results.</p><p>CHUCK HILL, FIRST CALL: Technology in the aggregate is going to have a terrific quarter in terms of earnings growth.  It's just this one area over here and part of the software area that's having a little bit of a problem.</p><p>FRANCIS: The data storm starts with a trickle next week, as Yahoo!, Motorola and Gateway report results.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>FRANCIS: The question for investors: Will strong tech results be enough to lift tech stocks?  Last quarter's mostly stellar results failed to stop the Nasdaq correction, as investors reconsidered those high valuations.  Right now, the Nasdaq is just about where it stood at the beginning of the first quarter reporting period.</p><p>So, Willow, investors get to decide.</p><p>BAY: So when you look at the sectors, Bruce, the barn burner here?</p><p>FRANCIS: Semiconductors, far and away.  Yes\u2026</p><p>BAY: Despite the debate we saw this week, the verdict is in.</p><p>FRANCIS: The debate this week is more really about the future. This quarter, I think, there's very, very little discussion of whether this should be great.  They've got pricing pressure, everybody is constrained.  Let's see, though, how that affects other people, like the computer systems makers.  Maybe they won't get all the parts they need, and you could see hits to revenue there.</p><p>BAY: Bruce Francis, thanks.</p><p>Coming up, should we expect tech stocks to turn it around for the third quarter?  We'll put the question to David Alger, one of the top tech-fund managers over the past decade.</p><p>That's next on MONEYLINE.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BAY: Tonight's \"MONEYLINE Movers,\" Hotjobs.com jumped more than 3, or 24 percent.  Deutsche Banc raised it to a strong buy based on considerable momentum and attractive valuation.</p><p>Brio Technology plunged nearly 11 1/2, or 57 percent, hitting a new low.  The software maker reported a first-quarter loss of 16 cents a share.  Analysts were looking for it to earn eight cents.</p><p>And Millennium Pharmaceuticals gained nearly six.  Several brokerages making comments following the biotech firm's $53 million purchase of Cambridge Discovery Chemistry.  Since falling dramatically earlier in the year, the stock has rebounded, up 114 percent year to date. Just a few months ago, our next guest was named one of three top fund managers.  At the time, his Spectra Fund, with nearly 70 percent of holdings in tech stocks, had the best returns over 10 years.  So far this year, Spectra is Down more than 9 percent compared to the S&amp;P 500's slight gain.  Still, over the last decade, Spectra boasts an annualized return of nearly 27 percent against the S&amp;P 500's near 18 percent return.</p><p>Overall, he manages 20 different funds.  Four of his top five holdings are tech stocks, including Microsoft and Cisco.  The exception: Home Depot.</p><p>Joining us now for tonight's \"MONEYLINE Focus\" is David Alger of Alger Funds.</p><p>David, welcome.</p><p>DAVID ALGER, ALGER FUNDS: Wonderful to be here.</p><p>BAY: Given what you saw today, decent week, good Friday rally, a sign of that strong second half that you expect?</p><p>ALGER: I think so.  I mean, I think what's happening is exactly predictable.  The economy is slowing.  You've had about 15 different signals that that's happening.  The National Association of Purchasing Managers' numbers, housing numbers, are down.  Car sales are down, retail sales are lousy, and now, of course, we've got the second employment data, which is lower.  And so, consequently, I think it's very, very clear that the economy is slowing, and I think the Fed should logically get off our back.</p><p>BAY: Well take the good news today, because the market has been rattled quite a bit this week by some warnings.  Today, an analyst commented on Yahoo!.  I'd like your take on that.  Do you think we're going to see slowing revenues for Yahoo!?</p><p>ALGER: I don't think we're going to see slowing revenues for Yahoo!.  I mean, I think there may be some constraint on the dot.com advertising front, but I think Yahoo!'s going to grow very, very rapidly over the next five years.</p><p>BAY: But some constraint on the dot.com advertising revenue is potentially a big deal for Yahoo! and for the Internet sector in general.</p><p>ALGER: Well, I think over time there's going to be a lot of advertising on Yahoo!, I mean, which is not necessarily going to be dot.com in nature.  I think conventional advertisers, or conventional retailers are going to advertise as well.  So\u2026</p><p>BAY: You think they're learning the value of that highly targeted market?</p><p>ALGER: Exactly so.  That's exactly right.  And I think the comments that were made today, I mean, you know, you can play with those numbers any which way.  I mean, one of the, I think, errors that was made is the terminal valuation of 30 times earnings.  And if you put a terminal valuation on 30 times earnings, of course you're not going to get 30 percent stock gain for five years.  I mean, that's, of course, preposterous.</p><p>BAY: One of the concerns today also was valuations.  At 116, was Yahoo! expensive in this market?</p><p>ALGER: No, I don't think it is.  I think because once you get a strong market in general in the second half with technology stocks doing very well, which I think they will, I think Yahoo!'s growing extremely fast.  It's certainly one of the two or three leaders in the Internet sector, and I think it will do well this year.  How it does five years from now I think is anyone's conjecture.  And I think this is just a call, a dramatic call, perhaps, but based on numbers, which anyone can cast in any which was five years out.</p><p>BAY: Now one of your funds, your midcap fund, is up more than 17 percent.  We've been hearing a lot of talk about the midcaps lately. Are they going to keep up the growth throughout the year?</p><p>ALGER: I think they will.  I think midcap is a wonderful sector because the companies are large enough to withstand any kind of downturn in the economy, and yet they're small enough to grow really rapidly.  And I think that's why we've always liked midcap, and that's why we're doing well there this year.</p><p>BAY: David Alger, as always, thanks.</p><p>ALGER: Wonderful to be here.</p><p>BAY: Still to come, the world's largest brokerage trims the fat to boost its bottom line.  The story, when MONEYLINE continues.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BAY: Another dot.com delay: Divine Interventures was expected to go public this week between $13 and $15 per share, but sources close to the deal say the IPO will now price lower than anticipated. And now it's scheduled to start trading Tuesday.  The reason: concern from the Securities and Exchange Commission over pre-offering publicity by the company, an issue that forced the postponement of Webvan's IPO last year.</p><p>Merrill Lynch is doing something it hasn't done in two years. It's trying to cut costs by cutting its payroll.  The last time it slimmed down, the cutbacks were due to big bond market losses.  This time, the move is a pre-emptive strike to protect profits.</p><p>The stock plunged early in the session</p><p>Allan Dodds Frank has more.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ALLAN DODDS FRANK, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Merrill Lynch has started to trim operations, determined to cut costs even while business is strong.</p><p>MARK CONSTANT, LEHMAN BROTHERS: Some of the revenue elements are out of their control.  This is what they can control.  Stan O'Neal, who's now running the private client group at Merrill Lynch, you know, this is his opportunity to really make his mark, put his stamp on the franchise and achieve a very visible target.  And I think he's going at it pretty aggressively.</p><p>FRANK: Last month, Merrill Lynch reduced its regional office structure to 19 districts from 26.  And over the next three years, the firm is expected to lay off several thousand back-office workers, as well as executives, but none of its 14,600 brokers.</p><p>Merrill Lynch had no comment, but insiders tell MONEYLINE the 28,000 workers in marketing, technology and strategic planning will bear the brunt of the cuts.</p><p>Analysts say Stanley O'Neal, the new boss of Merrill's brokerage force, telegraphed his intentions two months ago.  He told institutional investors:</p><p>\"We're focused on rationalizing the use of our resources, which will produce even greater efficiencies.  We believe we can increase the pre-tax profit margin in this business from 16 percent currently to 20 percent over the next three to four years.\"</p><p>AMY BUTTE, BEAR STEARNS: Merrill's in the process of changing its strategy.  It's becoming more technology-oriented, going from normal commissions or traditional commissions to $29.95 a trade.  And in order to do that and be profitable for shareholders, you have to be lean and you have to be mean.  And that's what we're seeing.</p><p>FRANK: And to stay on track, Merrill vows to reduce the 52 percent of net revenue it spends on pay and benefits.  That's a higher ratio than that of any of its rivals.</p><p>(on camera): The rest of Wall Street is sure to note Merrill's moves, and some analysts predict other firms may consider cutbacks, too.</p><p>Allan Dodds Frank, CNN Financial News, New York.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BAY: Shares of Merrill Lynch have been on a tear over the past year.  They're up 58 percent, trading just under their 52-week high, reached yesterday.</p><p>Microsoft has bowed to European regulators and agreed to scale back its plan to take joint control in British cable operator Telewest Communications.  The software giant has agreed to break all structural links with its partner, Liberty Media, and it will now only buy a 23.7 percent stake in Telewest.</p><p>The European Commission had feared that Microsoft would dominate the market for digital television software.  Shares of Microsoft rose more than a point today to close at 82.</p><p>In other corporate news, Cisco on a tear.  The company continued its buying spree today, snapping up the 80 percent of Netiverse it doesn't already own for $210 million in stock.  Privately held Netiverse develops hardware and software technology for speeding delivery of Web content.  It is Cisco's 13th acquisition this year.</p><p>Just ahead, the wait for Harry Potter's \"Goblet of Fire\" is nearly over.  But does the frenzy over a teenage wizard mean you should rush out to buy the publisher's stock?  The story, when MONEYLINE returns.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BAY: Now for our regular Friday feature, \"The Bottom Line,\" an in-depth look at a company making news.  This week, Scholastic, the publishing house that's riding a tidal wave of publicity over the fourth book in the \"Harry Potter\" series.  Unless you live in a place with no television, no newspapers, no bookstores and no Internet access, you've probably heard a lot, maybe more than you wanted to hear, about the new book.  But when a single product commands that much attention, should you buy the stock behind it?</p><p>Peter Viles goes behind the hype and gives us \"The Bottom Line,\" on Scholastic.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PETER VILES, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Each of those beeps represents another copy of the new Harry Potter book sold and labeled for delivery tomorrow.  The book's American publisher, Scholastic, has shipped 3.8 million copies, a British publisher another million and a half, making it the biggest first-run printing of a book in history.</p><p>Today, Amazon was selling a copy every three seconds, and investors are taking note.  Shares of Scholastic have rallied more than 40 percent since early May.</p><p>(on camera): Scholastic has already succeeded in creating a huge marketing event that combines secrecy and hype.  In all likelihood, tomorrow this will be the best-selling book in America.  But tonight, it's a mystery.  Millions of copies are locked up in back rooms like this one\u2026</p><p>(voice-over): \u2026 with strict instructions: do not touch until July 8th.  The question for investors is, what happens to Scholastic stock after the latest round of Harry hype dies down?</p><p>Analyst Rudy Hokanson believes the spotlight will reveal a well- run company trading at an attractive price.</p><p>RUDOLF HOKANSON, CIBC WORLD MARKETS: We think Scholastic stock is undervalued as it is.  So if you believe that value is eventually recognized, which I'm a big believer in, whatever it takes, you know, and who knows why, as attention is drawn to a company, if other investors see the value, the stock can get the bounce. VILES: But to understand Wall Street's relationship with Scholastic, you need to know about \"Goosebumps\" and the \"Goosebumps\" nightmare of 1997.  \"Goosebumps\" was a huge hit, a best-selling monthly paperback series.  But Scholastic printed too many copies and was forced to take a huge charge to cover returns.  The stock fell 40 percent in one day in 1997, and, as you can see, has never fully recovered.  So what if the same thing happens to Harry Potter?</p><p>RICHARD ROBINSON, CEO, SCHOLASTIC: \"Goosebumps\" and Harry Potter are really apples and oranges.  \"Goosebumps\" was a paperback series with one book published every month.  Here, we're talking about only four books, and longer, hardback, literary classics, really, that are going to be around for 100, 150 years.</p><p>VILES: Still, anyone who buys this stock for the Harry factor needs to consider the Harry risks: This fourth book might not sell as well as the first three.  The author, J.K. Rowling, might take books five, six and seven to another American publisher.  Scholastic does not own the lucrative movie and licensing rights -- those went to Warner Brothers, which, like CNN, is owned by Time Warner.  And there's the risk the Harry bounce is already priced into the stock.</p><p>But the ultimate caution is this: Harry may be magic, but he's not the be-all, end-all for Scholastic.</p><p>ED HATCH, S.G. COWEN: The Harry Potter books might be 5 percent of sales or 5 percent of profits.  It's certainly become a big franchise, but not necessarily the reason to go out and buy Scholastic stock.</p><p>VILES: If you do your homework on Scholastic, you'll find it is a family business that makes its money helping kids do their homework. It has been a leader in educational publishing since the 1920s, when Richard Robinson's father started the company.</p><p>HOFKANSON: If you want to think children and you want to think reading, we think Scholastic is the brand name.</p><p>VILES: Its highest-margin businesses are book fairs and book clubs.  It recently published reference publisher Grolier and has posted solid earnings gains.  First Call consensus is for $3.18 in fiscal 2000, more than double earnings from 1998.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>VILES: One last note on Harry Potter.  Analysts do not believe this was a fluke or a lucky find for Scholastic.  The company has a long history of coming up with children's best sellers.  In fact, its series called \"Clifford the Big Red Dog,\" has sold more than twice as many copies as the Harry Potter series -- Willow.</p><p>BAY: Pete, what are the chances, what are the odds, they printed a few copies too many here?</p><p>VILES: It's possible, but with the Internet giving them a read on early demand, unlikely. BAY: Peter Viles, thanks.</p><p>Up next, \"Ahead of the Curve,\" some of what you need to know tonight before the markets open again on Monday.</p><p>You are watching MONEYLINE.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BAY: The markets liked what the June employment report showed them today.  Next week will bring another round of economic news, including an important inflation report: the Producer Price Index for June.  That's due out on Friday.</p><p>Also due out, industrial production, retail sales and international trade.</p><p>The earnings floodgates open again next week.  Leading the way, Motorola, Yahoo! and Dow components J.P. Morgan, ALCOA and International Paper.</p><p>And we'll talk to Michael Bonsignore, chairman and CEO of Honeywell International on Monday, the day the company hold its annual shareholder meeting, which could get interesting considering the company's recent profit warning.</p><p>And to stay a step ahead of the markets tune into \"AHEAD OF THE CURVE\" every day at 5 a.m. Eastern on CNN.</p><p>That is MONEYLINE for this Friday.  I'm Willow Bay.</p><p>Good night from New York.</p><p>\"CROSSFIRE\" is next.</p><p>TO ORDER A VIDEO OF THIS TRANSCRIPT, PLEASE CALL 800-CNN-NEWS OR USE OUR SECURE ONLINE ORDER FORM LOCATED AT <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.fdch.com\">www.fdch.com</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNN2000</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:40NP-FRY0-009B-G3RR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">271063</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7165\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>CNN</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 2000 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"07\" year=\"2000\"><dateText>July 7, 2000;

The U.S. stock market is coming off its first quarter of negative returns since 2015.</p><p>Many of the same headwinds that have weighed on stocks in recent weeks dragged down prices again on the first trading day of April. Stocks are coming under pressure from worries over an escalating tariff fight with China and the persistent declines in the tech sector, which has been a key performance leader in the bull market and is widely owned by both big and small investors. Investors fear social media companies and other tech companies will come under increased regulation due to lapses in data privacy at Facebook.</p><p>The key pillars of the bull market - free trade, tech stock leadership and record-low borrowing costs - are being called into question.</p><p>\"The market is repricing stocks accordingly,\" says Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial.</p><p>Wall Street will be watching if investors come in and buy stocks at lower prices, as they have throughout the 9-year-old bull market, says Axel Merk, chief investment officer of Merk Investments.</p><p>\"Will the buy-the-dip crowd come back or have we seen a change in investor attitude?\" Merk said.</p><p>A steep sell-off in shares of big tech stocks, whose size is a key price driver of the broad, market-cap weighted S&amp;P 500 index, was a major drag:</p><p>Facebook, still under pressure due to its data privacy scandal, fell nearly 3% and is down nearly 20% from its Feb. 1 peak.</p><p>Amazon, under fire again from President Trump via Twitter due to its big size and negative impact on mom-and-pop retailers, fell 5.2%.</p><p>And Tesla, the electric-car marker on the defensive following a deadly accident involving its autonomous driving system, was down more than 5%.</p><p>\"It's a continuation of recent trends,\" says Bill Hornbarger, chief investment officer at Moneta Group in Clayton, Mo.</p><p>Stocks, which had rallied sharply on President Trump's moves to cut taxes and reduce corporate red tape, are now coming under pressure by policy moves from the White House that are less market-friendly, such as imposing restrictions on trade.</p><p>The Dow, which is now 11.2% below its Jan. 26 all-time high, fell deeper into correction territory.</p><p>The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index, which joined the Dow back in correction territory, fell 2.2%, and the tech-packed Nasdaq declined 2.7%, pushing it negative for the year.</p><p>The weakness in U.S. stocks comes on the eve of the corporate profit reporting season, which is expected to be strong. Companies in the S&amp;P 500 are forecast to grow earnings at a nearly 19% clip, up from estimates of 12.2%  on Jan. 1, according to earnings tracker Thomson Reuters.</p><p>Investors were also rattled by China announcing Monday that it is raising import tariffs on U.S. pork, apples and other products.</p><p>\"Today's action may be another 'tariff tantrum,'\" says Doug Ramsey, chief investment officer of The Leuthold Group. He also said  there is less money sloshing around the world to invest in stocks, which is weighing on prices.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">JNLCOU-laf-1946438413</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">JNLCOU2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S1G-8Y71-DYJJ-P14S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">256482</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-04-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"568\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Journal and Courier All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Journal and Courier (Lafayette, Indiana)</publicationName><edition>1 Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"04\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>April 3, 2018 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0001NX8</classCode><className>PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>PRU (NYSE)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DIJW</classCode><className>PRICES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001631</classCode><className>STOCK INDEXES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>ST000D1BY</classCode><className>EXECUTIVES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>STX001686</classCode><className>TAX RELIEF</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>STX001759</classCode><className>TRENDS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>STX001581</classCode><className>SMALL BUSINESS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"67\"><classCode>ST000D0VJ</classCode><className>SOCIAL MEDIA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>STX000565</classCode><className>ELECTRIC VEHICLES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>STX000008</classCode><className>ACCIDENTAL FATALITIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>N523110GM</classCode><className>SECURITIES TRADING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N523210MM</classCode><className>STOCK EXCHANGES</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6M0ZDMDg5MEQ3OTlGNEJCMkI0M0EyM0MwN0E1Njk1MEQ7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDBGREFBMDgyNTQ0NERFRUI3MEUwNDBFOTM5NDExREI</classCode><className>Stock Exchanges</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001631</classCode><className>STOCK INDEXES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST0008XSL</classCode><className>RETAILERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"67\"><classCode>ST000D0VJ</classCode><className>SOCIAL MEDIA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"67\"><classCode>ST000D7DY</classCode><className>INFORMATION SECURITY &amp;

The Dow drops by 800 points before making a partial comeback. Investors fearing the credit crisis will reach all the way around the world.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And what about the Wall Street bailout? Will that $700 billion boost do anything for Americans on Main Street? I'll ask Billionaire Donald Trump. He's here in THE SITUATION ROOM.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And Sarah Palin tries to tie Barack Obama to terrorism. She's leading the charge, as the McCain campaign goes into attack mode. But could that backfire with voters? </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in THE SITUATION ROOM.</p><p>Shock waves from the U.S. financial crisis are reverberating around the world and coming back full circle today in a massive Wall Street sell-off that sent the Dow Jones Industrial Average spiraling down to a five year low. The Dow dropped below the 10,000 mark for the first time -- for the first time since October, 2003.</p><p>No doubt a bad day. But at one point it was looking disastrous. With the Dow down a record 800 points, recovery did set in during the final hour of trading, and that helped cut losses. But the Dow still closed down almost 370 points.</p><p>All this despite Washington's $700 billion Wall Street bailout. And there is bad news at the NASDAQ, as well.</p><p>Poppy Harlow of CNNMoney.com is there -- Poppy, what's going on at the NASDAQ?</p><p>POPPY HARLOW, CNNMONEY.COM:  Well, the time that the Nasdaq is the worst hit of all these averages, today down 4.3 percent. It was down as much as 8 percent this afternoon. It's down more than 30 percent this year. That's because you have a mix of big tech stocks like Oracle and Cisco and Microsoft that have been hit hard. Some analysts say you can't short the financials right now because of that SEC ban. So people are shorting tech companies that rely on those financial institutions for a lot of their business.</p><p>Also, a lot of regional banks are traded here, names like Citizens, Republic Bancorp and Zion Bank that were hit very hard today and all this week.</p><p>So what you have, Wolf, is a sell-off across the board. And this index hit even harder than the Dow industrials -- Wolf.</p><p>BLITZER:  The volatility that's enormous -- and it causes heartburn for so many folks who are looking at these numbers. Give us some perspective, Poppy, how this -- what this really means to investors who are watching us right now.</p><p>HARLOW:  Yes, you might not have heard of this thing before, but it's called the VIC. There's an actual index that tracks the volatility of the market. And that index went nuts today, right?</p><p>We saw the Dow go from 800 points to close down 370. We saw the NASDAQ with big swings like that. And this shows the highest reading today since 1989. Why do you care out there?</p><p>Because it's showing you that fear and emotion is driving this market. It is no longer based on fundamentals. We haven't seen the volatility index this high in 19 years. You're seeing a reading of over 50 points. Just less than a month ago, in the middle of September, the reading was at 20 points.</p><p>So people are betting on the fact that the market is going to go up and down and up and down, but they're betting more so, Wolf, that the market is going to go down. That's what's going on right now -- Wolf.</p><p>BLITZER:  Poppy is over at the NASDAQ. Stand by.</p><p>Even as the financial meltdown continues, Congress has convened its first hearing on the subject. The House Oversight and Government Reform Committee began with the largest bankruptcy in American history, Lehman Brothers, and its top executive.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RICHARD FULD, CHAIRMAN &amp; CEO, LEHMAN BROTHERS:  Like many other financial institutions, Lehman Brothers got caught in this financial tsunami.</p><p>But I want to be very clear. I take full responsibility for the decisions that I made and for the actions that I took. Based on the information that we had at the time, I believed that these decisions and actions were both prudent and appropriate.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BLITZER:  Our Special Investigations Unit correspondent, Abbie Boudreau, just got back from the hearing -- Abbie, you've been doing some digging into this CEO. hat do we know? What are we learning?</p><p>ABBIE BOUDREAU, CNN INVESTIGATIVE CORRESPONDENT:  Well, Wolf, Richard Fuld is known as \"The Gorilla\" at Lehman Brothers, where he says he started as an intern 42 years ago. Now, as CEO since 1993, he's overseen more than 28,000 employees in over 28 countries.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)      BOUDREAU (voice-over):  The 62-year-old Wall Street tycoon rakes in nearly a half billion dollars between 2000 and 2007 according to the Oversight Committee -- in one year alone, earning more than $106 million.</p><p>Along with all that money came immense homes -- this estate in Greenwich, Connecticut complete with tennis courts and swimming pool and a $21 million apartment on Park Avenue in New York City and a vacation spread in Juniper Island, Florida, with a postcard perfect view -- not to mention a lavish art collection reportedly worth millions.</p><p>Outside the hearing room, I tried to ask him about all of this.</p><p>(on camera):  Do you think it's fair that you made so much money when your company is actually (INAUDIBLE)?</p><p>FULD:  I'm sorry. I'm on my way to a...</p><p>BOUDREAU:  Some of your critics have said that you have had a chance to save your company and you haven't.</p><p>Is it greed?</p><p>I mean do you have anything to say to the people that are -- that are watching this right now, that are wondering, you know, why this happened?</p><p>You have nothing to say?</p><p>FULD:  Are you going to be in the testimony?</p><p>BOUDREAU:  Absolutely.</p><p>FULD:  Good.</p><p>BOUDREAU (voice-over):  I also asked him about all of his real estate holdings.</p><p>(on camera):  How do you rationalize that when the rest of the country is in turmoil?</p><p>(voice-over):  At the hearing, Congressman Henry Waxman asked Fuld if he deserved all the money he's made at Lehman.</p><p>REP. HENRY WAXMAN (D), CALIFORNIA:  Do you think it's fair and do you have any recommendations on fundamental reforms that would bring a new approach to executive compensation?</p><p>FULD:  Mr. Chairman, we had a compensation committee that spent a tremendous amount of time making sure that the interests of the executives and the employees were aligned with shareholders.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BOUDREAU:  Now, he chose not to the answer that very direct question. Congressman Waxman twice asked him that again, but never got a clear answer -- Wolf.</p><p>BLITZER:  Abbie, thanks for that. Abbie Boudreau working the story.</p><p>The McCain campaign has seemingly moved on from the economy and gone into attack mode. Leading the offensive, the running mate, Sarah Palin.</p><p>Let's go to Ed Henry. He's in Florida working this story for us. Governor Palin's trying to tie, since Saturday morning, Barack Obama to terrorism. Explain what she's suggesting.</p><p>ED HENRY, CNN CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  That's right, Wolf.</p><p>The McCain camp insists they can do both -- they can talk about the economy and also raise questions about Barack Obama's fitness for office. What's really interesting is Sarah Palin is in the middle of this. Last week, we saw her trying to show her down to earth style in the debate. This week, a much more traditional role of a vice presidential candidate -- Palin as pit bull.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HENRY (voice-over):  Say it isn't so Sarah -- after admonishing Democrats to stop looking backwards about the Bush years during last week's vice presidential debate...</p><p>GOV. SARAH PALIN (R-AK), VICE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  Say it ain't so, Joe. There you go again, pointing backwards again.</p><p>HENRY:  Sarah Palin is now using a story from four decades ago to attack Barack Obama.</p><p>PALIN:  This is about the truthfulness and the judgment needed in our next. President John McCain has it. Barack Obama doesn't have it.</p><p>HENRY:  For the third straight day, Palin targeted Obama over his ties to Bill Ayers -- a radical who led nonfatal bombings at the Pentagon and Capitol Hill to protest the Vietnam War in the 1960s. Ayers held a 1995 coffee introducing Obama to Chicago's political establishment. Though chief adviser, David Axelrod, now tells CNN the candidate did not know Ayers' background at the time.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROBERT GIBBS, OBAMA COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR:  Look, if that's what David said, that is true. Look, again, this is a relationship that Barack Obama has -- has condemned the actions of Bill Ayers.</p><p>HENRY:  On the stump in the key state of Florida, Palin pounced.</p><p>PALIN:  Today they're saying for the first time that Barack Obama didn't know back then about Ayers' radical background.</p><p>(BOOS)      PALIN:  Wait a minute. He didn't know a few months ago that he had launched his political career in the living room of a domestic terrorist?</p><p>HENRY:  Obama aides insist this is just a diversion, because the financial crisis is sinking John McCain in battleground states.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GIBBS:  What this is, is a classic smear campaign to distract the voters away from talking about the economy, just as they previewed in this weekend's papers. They were going to turn the page on the economy and get to character assassination.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HENRY:  But there could be a down side for the Republican ticket from these attacks.</p><p>Take a look at the latest CNN/Opinion Research Corporation poll and how Sarah Palin is viewed by the public. Fifty-two percent view her favorably. But look at the unfavorable numbers. They've been climbing ever since the Convention. Twenty-one percent unfavorable around the GOP Convention, 27 percent in early September, up to 35 percent in late September. The latest numbers now 40 percent.</p><p>So she may be scoring points, but they have to be careful that this could backfire and turn off Independent voters -- Wolf.</p><p>BLITZER:  Especially, as you point out, those Independent voters.</p><p>Ed Henry working the story for us. Thank you.</p><p>Barack Obama makes it clear he won't sit back and take any abuse hurled by the other side. Listen to what he told a radio interview today.</p><p>(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. BARACK OBAMA (D-IL), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  And one of the things that we've done throughout this campaign, we don't throw the first punch. But we'll throw the last.</p><p>(END AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>BLITZER:  The Obama campaign is already counterpunching, unveiling a new Web video about John McCain's involvement in the so- called Keating Five scandal two decades ago. Back then, McCain participated in meetings with banking regulators on behalf of an Arizona savings and loan owner who was convicted of securities fraud. The Senate Ethics Committee later cleared McCain of wrongdoing, but said he showed poor judgment.</p><p>Some of the stories we're working on this hour here in THE SITUATION ROOM. Fallout from the nation's financial meltdown -- impact on the race for the White House.      And we're going to be talking about both of those subjects with Donald Trump. He's standing by like. Stand by for that.</p><p>Also, only hours left to register to vote in one critical battleground state -- the frantic effort to sign up young people.</p><p>Plus, long after the next president is gone, his influence will live on in the United States Supreme Court -- two, maybe three seats at stake. We're looking at what's at stake with those seats.</p><p>Stay with us. You're in THE SITUATION ROOM.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BLITZER:  Stocks continue to tumble despite a massive government bailout, with huge implications for these, the final weeks of the presidential campaign.</p><p>Joining us now on the phone is Donald Trump. He's watching all of this unfold with us. Were you getting a little heartburn watching the market collapse today, down at one point, 800 points, Donald, and then recovering, what closing almost down 370?</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, CHAIRMAN &amp; PRESIDENT, THE TRUMP ORGANIZATION: Well, it's a very sad point in this country's history, Wolf. There's no question about it.</p><p>BLITZER:  What should people who are watching this unfold before their eyes right now, what should they be doing given your background, your advice?</p><p>TRUMP:  All they can do is dream, Wolf. They can dream. They can dream about things getting better. And they will get better. Eventually, things are going to get better. This is like a cleansing action. It's being cleaned out. And, honestly, they have to start looking for opportunity, because there is more opportunity now than there was two years ago -- Wolf.</p><p>BLITZER:  So talk a little bit about that opportunity. But before you do that, when you say eventually things will get better, I've heard experts -- some say we're talking at least a year or two of a deep recession right now. Others saying we could be in trouble for four or five years. What do you think?</p><p>TRUMP:  Well, I never defined what eventually meant. It could be two or three years. It could be a long period of time. It could be shorter than that, but it could be a long period of time.</p><p>We are very, very much in deep trouble. If you look at oil prices, they're still way, way too high. I mean they're artificially set by OPEC and they're still way too high. The good news about this -- probably the only good news -- is that oil is going to drop like a rock, which, if you'll remember, I told you that last time.</p><p>BLITZER:  Right. It's down below $90 a barrel right now, which is a lot less than it was only a few months ago.      Because people are saying you know what, I'm going to take my money out of the stock market right now, I'm going to wait until it hits rock bottom and that will be a great time to start buying some bargains out there on the New York Stock Exchange.</p><p>TRUMP:  Well, I don't really recommend that too much. They've gone down a long way. Some of these folks have been in for a long time and they've taken a very horrible ride. And this isn't really the right time to be taking your money out. That doesn't mean it's not going to go lower. But it just doesn't seem to me to make sense.</p><p>If you have a particularly bad stock or whatever, maybe you do that. But it doesn't seem to be the right time, for me, to take money out of the stock market. So I wouldn't recommend that.</p><p>BLITZER:  The real estate market -- the experts say the mortgage -- the funny mortgages that were out there, that's the cause of this financial meltdown. But there's got to be huge bargains out there, if you know what you're doing, in real estate.</p><p>TRUMP:  Well, I don't think it's the only cause. I think a lot has to do with the price of oil, because I've always said that oil is the lifeblood of this country in terms of its economics. And when have you oil going for $150, it's -- that's just preposterous.</p><p>And I have a very, very smart friend who said anytime oil goes over $50 -- $50 -- you're going to have a depression. Not a recession a depression.</p><p>BLITZER:  Well, you think we're on the...</p><p>TRUMP:  Well, guess what?</p><p>We hit $150.</p><p>BLITZER:  Are we on the eve of depression or just a deep recession?</p><p>TRUMP:  Well, time will tell. And time will tell whether or not the $750 billion bailout is going to work, if it's going to have any effect. Some people think it makes things worse because you don't get that full cleansing.</p><p>And when it happens, it'll happen -- it'll delay it, but it will be a lot steeper.</p><p>So, we'll see what happens. You know, to a certain extent, it is trial and error. And that's a pretty bad situation for this country.</p><p>BLITZER:  How has President Bush handled this economic crisis?</p><p>TRUMP:  Well, look, it's not a favorite person of mine. Between the war and between all of the problems we have that he's gotten us into, you're not talking about my favorite person.     How has he handled it? He's tried. I think he's probably working harder than he usually would. But, you know, we'll have to see whether or not it works. But the bottom line is we are in a very, very deep recession, at least.</p><p>BLITZER:  How about you personally? How are you doing?</p><p>TRUMP:  Well, I'm doing well. I got a little lucky. I sold something for a lot of money to a Russian buyer. And now I see the Russian stock market is collapsing, also.</p><p>BLITZER:  I hope you got your money.</p><p>TRUMP:  I got my money.</p><p>BLITZER:  That's...</p><p>TRUMP:  It closed two weeks ago. Crazy, right?</p><p>BLITZER:  You're lucky you did that. But all the other buildings -- all the Trump buildings that are going up, not only in the United States, but around the world -- because we see the world markets out there in deep trouble right now. I know you're building in Dubai and elsewhere. How are they doing?</p><p>TRUMP:  Well, they've been doing really well. Outside of the United States, in particular, they've been doing really, really well. In the United States, for the most part, the buildings were completed two years ago. So they really have been tremendously successful and I'm very happy about it.</p><p>BLITZER:  All right. The last time we spoke, you told us you're going to vote for John McCain. Are you still going to do that?</p><p>TRUMP:  Well, I know him very well. He's a really good man. He's a tough man and he's a smart man. And that's what we need.</p><p>BLITZER:  And you think he's different than Bush?</p><p>TRUMP:  I do think he's different. He's different in a lot of ways, including his demeanor.</p><p>BLITZER:  So you're with McCain and Sarah Palin?</p><p>Do you think she's ready to be president, God forbid, one of these days...</p><p>TRUMP:  Well, she certainly has made impact...</p><p>BLITZER:  ...if something were to happen to the president?</p><p>TRUMP:  ...there's no doubt about that.</p><p>BLITZER:  She's what?</p><p>TRUMP:  She's made a lot of impact.</p><p>BLITZER:  But do you think she's ready for that?</p><p>TRUMP:  I think she's very smart and I think she did very, very well in the debate. And I think Biden did very well in the debate, also. I thought they both did very, very well. And they can be proud of each other. The fact is, it was an interesting evening.</p><p>BLITZER:  It was a fascinating -- 70 million Americans watched and tens of millions more around the world. Donald Trump, thanks very much for joining us.</p><p>TRUMP:  Thank you very much, Wolf.</p><p>BLITZER:  We'll speak to you soon.</p><p>TRUMP:  OK.</p><p>BLITZER:  America's financial crisis -- as you know, it's sending financial shock waves around the world. We're watching global markets. We'll get a live update from London. Stand by for that.</p><p>And meet the man in charge of saving Wall Street, overseeing the $700 billion bailout. Guess what? He's 35 years old.</p><p>Stay with us. You're in THE SITUATION ROOM.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BLITZER:  Let's check in with Susan Roesgen.</p><p>She's monitoring some other important stories incoming into THE SITUATION ROOM right now.</p><p>What's going on -- Susan?</p><p>SUSAN ROESGEN, CNN GULF COAST CORRESPONDENT:  Well, across the world, Wolf, China is retaliating for proposed U.S. arms sales to Taiwan. Beijing has called off upcoming senior level military visits to the U.S. and also called off visits by Chinese ships and other military and diplomatic contacts. China, of course, which considers Taiwan part of its territory, plans to officially protest the proposed weapons sale.</p><p>And eBay is slashing jobs as revenue slows for that company. The online auction site is cutting 1,000 employees and several hundred temporary workers. And that's about 10 percent of its workforce. EBay, however, also announced that it is buying online payment survey, Bill Me Later, for $945 million. That company gives users the option of deferred payments.</p><p>And the global financial meltdown sent oil prices plummeting today. The price of crude fell more than $5, to below $90 a barrel. That's on concern that the demand for energy is slowing. And that is the lowest the price of oil has been in nearly 10 months -- Wolf.</p><p>BLITZER:  Yes. It's a little silver lining for all the other bad economic news that's out there. Susan, thanks very much. Only 35 years old and now he's in charge of that $700 billion Wall Street bailout. So what makes him qualified? We're investigating.</p><p>Plus, a deadline looming in a must-win state, where young voters may make the difference.</p><p>Stay with us. You're in THE SITUATION ROOM.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BLITZER:  To our viewers, you're in THE SITUATION ROOM.</p><p>Happening now, less than seven hours left to register to vote in one crucial battleground state. We're there live following the frantic effort to recruit young voters. Stand by.</p><p>Also, the very young man in charge of administering that $700 billion Wall Street bailout -- what makes him so qualified for the tremendous task?</p><p>Plus, the lasting impact of the coming election on the U.S. Supreme Court -- one vote with an impact potentially lasting generations.</p><p>I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in THE SITUATION ROOM.</p><p>The Dow isn't suffering alone. Take a look what stocks are doing around the world. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index down almost five percent. Japan's Nikkei losing 4.5 -- 4.25 percent, that is. Germany's Dax off more than seven percent. And the British FTSE plunging almost eight percent.</p><p>For more now on the worldwide sell-off, what's going on, let's go to Richard Quest in London.</p><p>He's watching the story for us. This is just the latest evidence -- you're at Number 10 Downing Street in London, Richard -- that this economic crisis in the United States is spreading around the world.</p><p>RICHARD QUEST, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  We have talked about globalization on so many occasions, Wolf. Guess what? You're seeing it in action.</p><p>What happens in New York is followed in London, to Frankfurt, to Munich, to Russia, right the way around the world, through Asia.</p><p>There is literally nowhere where banks, where investors can hide. Perhaps gold, maybe. That's always been the oldest investment of them all. But when it comes to the markets, they are global. They don't like what they see. And there is a lack of confidence from one side of the globe to the other -- Wolf.</p><p>BLITZER:  And, Richard, the rules in Europe are different. The European community simply can't bail out a lot of these banks the way the federal government often does here. Is that right?</p><p>QUEST:  Basically, it's as if -- imagine each state insured and guaranteed each individual bank in the U.S. That's what you've got in Europe, where maybe a European Union, but national governments -- the British, the German, the French -- they all actually take care of and supervise their individual banks.      So what we are seeing -- and it is serious, indeed -- is in Britain and in Germany, we are seeing banks that have failed and that are failing.</p><p>But as yet, Wolf, we are not seeing that coordinated governmental response that perhaps would give a bailout of the size and scale that you saw in the United States.</p><p>BLITZER:  Richard Quest in London for us. We're going to stay in touch with you.</p><p>Only days ago, the candidates were focused on the economic meltdown. Now the McCain campaign has moved also into an attack mode. And the Obama campaign is hurrying to try to catch up on that front, as well.</p><p>Let's discuss this with our CNN political contributor, Hilary Rosen. She's editor-at-large at the HuffingtonPost.com. And Republican strategist John Feehery. Both of them here in THE SITUATION ROOM.</p><p>Was the McCain campaign counting on the $700 billion bailout vote alleviating this crisis somewhat so they could move on and change the subject, if will you?</p><p>JOHN FEEHERY, BLOGS FOR THEFEEHERYTHEORY:  Everyone knew it was going to take a long time to get this all settled out and worked out. I mean for the McCain campaign, they've got to get out an economic message.  The economic message for them is Barack Obama has a plan to raise taxes on investors and small business owners and they've got to hammer that time and time again.  People have to understand John McCain has a better plan to get us out of this mess than Barack Obama does.  </p><p>BLITZER:  What do you think?  Because the argument is at least the Obama campaign makes it repeatedly that if you like the economic policies of Bush, just get ready for more of the same under McCain.  </p><p>HILARY ROSEN, FORMER CHAIRWOMAN AND CEO OF THE RECORDING INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION OF AMERICA:  And I think that that message is resonating. People know that's what the McCain plan does is essentially continue Bush tax cuts for corporations and companies that don't wealthy individuals that don't need a tax cut right now.  They're not growing jobs.  And Barack Obama's going to put tax cuts where it's needed to people making less than $250,000 a year and small businesses earning less than $250,000 a year.  </p><p>BLITZER:  Because the economic news is bad enough for the McCain campaign.  We've seen movement not only nationally but in battleground states.  In the new CNN Opinion Research Corporation poll, Bush is now at Nixon numbers; only 24 percent approve of the way he's handling his job as president.  74 percent disapprove.  He's a Republican.  McCain is a Republican.  And a lot of Americans are going to say you know what?  We need somebody else in charge.  </p><p>FEEHERY:  That's why it's very important for the McCain campaign to keep on offense with Obama.  Right now, the McCain campaign is a little bit on the run.  They've got to get Obama on the run.  </p><p>BLITZER:  That's why Sarah Palin is doing what she's doing, raising the whole William Ayers the terrorist issue three days in a row? </p><p>FEEHERY:  I'm not sure how effective that's going to be.  They need to say this Chicago politician Barack Obama doesn't have a plan that's going to help you with your 401(k)s and need to get on the message as soon as possible.  </p><p>BLITZER:  Here's what Obama said today.  I want to play this little clip in this radio interview he did with Roland Martin on the Tom Joyner show.  Listen to this.  </p><p>(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>OBAMA:  One of the things we've done throughout this campaign, we don't throw the first punch but we'll throw the last.  </p><p>(END AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>BLITZER:  We don't throw the first punch but we'll throw the last.  He's learned lessons I assume from earlier Democratic presidential candidates whether it's John Kerry or Michael Dukakis where they sort of turned the other cheek.  </p><p>ROSEN:  I'll tell you, Democrats just listen to that and smile, with relief.  Because John McCain has decided he is willing to throw his dignity and his honor, whatever is left of it away by throwing the kitchen sink of nasty charges at Barack Obama.  This campaign is not going to take it.  Because they know that people want to talk about the economy and not just tax cuts.  But how investment in alternative energies, investments in education, how bringing a close to the war which is costing us $10 billion a month, how all of those things are going to put this country back on the right track.  </p><p>BLITZER:  Because it's interesting Sarah Palin three days in a Rojas been raising the William Ayers/Barack Obama relationship. Senator McCain delivered a touch speech and was very critical of Obama today but he didn't there, he didn't go to that William Ayers issue.  </p><p>FEEHERY:  That's the beauty of a vice presidential candidate. They can do that stuff.  That's what her role is.  That's what vice presidential roles are supposed to be, go after the other guy.  He's got to stay on a positive message on trying to fix this economy and focusing Barack Obama's message on tax hikes.  </p><p>BLITZER:  Would he have been better off, this is a question that you hear nowadays, especially in today's continued drop of the stock market, opposing the $700 billion bailout and citing the earmarks in it and saying I can't support this? </p><p>FEEHERY:  If the package had gone down a second time and if the economy had really tanked which it seems to be doing anyway, I think it would be worse.  Had he no choice but to support this bailout because it's the responsible thing to do.  Barack Obama all the responsible leaders say do this.  Terry Jeffries said he ought to oppose it, I'm not sure it would help.  </p><p>BLITZER:  A clip from Senator McCain.  He went after Senator Obama in strong words.  Listen to this.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. JOHN MCCAIN (R-AZ), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  What has this man ever actually accomplished in government? What does he plan for America? In short, who is -- who is the real Barack Obama?  But my friends, you ask such questions, and all you get in response is another angry barrage of insults.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BLITZER:  All right.  Strong words from Senator McCain, basically raising questions about his ability or his qualifications to be president of the United States.  </p><p>ROSEN:  The McCain campaign strategy for the next week has been laid out here.  Sarah Palin throws the mud and John McCain tries to establish the riskiness of an Obama presidency.  </p><p>BLITZER:  It's worked in the past for Republicans.  </p><p>ROSEN:  But that worked before Americans saw Barack Obama be smart and cool and thoughtful during an economic crisis.  And then before they saw him in a debate going toe to toe with John McCain on really complicated foreign policy issues.  </p><p>BLITZER:  It worked.  </p><p>ROSEN:  Those two things I think people came around and saw that -- </p><p>BLITZER:  It never worked against Bill Clinton in '92 and in '96 because he would respond in kind.  </p><p>FEEHERY:  You know, Bill Clinton was a pretty good candidate and I think that will McCain has to learn from the mistakes of the dole campaign and the first George Bush campaign and stick on positive issues going after the economy, talking about his Atlantic experience, Barack Obama's lack of experience and his record on raising taxes. That's one of the top issues for John McCain going in because in a recession people understand if you raise taxes on small businesses, it's going to be bad for jobs and people get that.  </p><p>BLITZER:  It's already pretty bad for jobs right now.  Guys, thanks very much for coming in.  </p><p>They're scared for the first time in their lives.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  It's hard to even get essentials like bread and milk has increased to a point it's almost ridiculous to buy.  </p><p>BLITZER:  We're talking to young voters very worried right now about the economy as they try to step out into the world.        And a stunning drop for stock marketed.  How low can they go? CNN's Ali Velshi standing by with the latest on Wall Street's slide and what it means for you.  </p><p>Stay with us.  You're in THE SITUATION ROOM.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BLITZER:  A rather disturbing global stock sell off today underscoring just how much is riding on the government's Wall Street bailout.  We now know who's in charge of it, a 35-year-old protege of the treasury secretary Henry Paulson.  Susan Roesgen is back with us. She's working the story for us.  </p><p>So what do we know about this 35-year-old, Susan?</p><p>ROESGEN:  He's apparently very smart and Wolf, get this before he got into investment banking he was in research and development for NASA.  Apparently a pretty sophisticated guy, really smart guy his name is Neal Kashkari.  Like several top administration officials he is a former executive from the same top Wall Street firm.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ROESGEN:  He's armed with a $700 billion line of credit.  His mission, to start buying bad debt.  Treasury official Neal Kashkari has been named to spearhead the Wall Street rescue plan.  Kashkari is a 35-year-old who has been working over the last year on mortgage and foreclosure issues including contingency planning if banks are crippled by bad mortgages.  He is a former vice president of Goldman Sachs.  That makes him the third top administration official to come from that will firm.  Alongside his boss Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and White House chief of staff Josh Bolten.  While some analysts say the number of Goldman alums involved raises the possibility of a conflict of interest, a White House spokesman says secretary Paulson is trying to bring in the best talent he can.  And others say the bailout team will need people with Wall Street experience.  </p><p>STEPHEN POPE, CANTOR FITZGERALD:  They have to be people that understand what is the heart and soul of the instruments concerned and secondly, are they able to try and imply a value the market might think is acceptable upon each instrument.  </p><p>ROESGEN:  And the treasury department won't handle all the buying itself.  Private firms will also play a role.  </p><p>HENRY PAULSON, TREASURY SECRETARY:  We're looking at a number of asset managers with good experience, very good experience and expertise from the private sector.  </p><p>ROESGEN:  Now, Kashkari is an interim appointment for three months till the new president is inaugurated.  Whoever that is can decide whether to keep him or choose be else.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)      BLITZER:  What about the potential for some firms hired for a conflict of interest out there? </p><p>ROESGEN:  Even the treasury department itself in the announcement today said there could be a conflict of interest.  They're sort of making up the rules as they go.  One thing they talk about is the private firms that will manage other private firms' bad debt might not be told everything about those companies to try to limit the amount of information that each firm knows so nobody gets too cozy.  </p><p>BLITZER:  This is a whole new territory for a lot of folks. They're looking for the best and brightest.  Hopefully they'll find him.  Thanks very much for that.  </p><p>Many young voters are excited about making their voices heard in this election and deeply concerned about the financial meltdown and what it means as they begin to step out into the world.  Let's gets to Mary Snow.  She's working this story for us in Columbus, Ohio, one of those battleground states.</p><p>Mary, what's on their minds? What are you hearing and seeing? </p><p>MARY SNOW, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Well, Wolf, clearly the election but also the economy, whether it comes to student loans or even just making day-to-day expenses.  We talked to several young voters here today who say the decisions about the economy are really shaping how they're going to cast their vote.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SNOW:  Call it Main Street 2.0, you don't have to look far at Ohio State University's campus to see signs students are worried about the economy.  Keiran Johnson is worried what kind of job market he'll face.  </p><p>KEIRAN JOHNSON, STUDENT:  Graduating hoping I can get something better.  That's what we're told to go to school and have a better life.  We don't know if that's true.  </p><p>SNOW:  For Amanda Kulcar, the concerns are more immediate like the price of gasoline.  </p><p>AMANDA KULCAR, STUDENT:  Even groceries increasing.  It's hard to get bread and mull can has increased to a point it's almost ridiculous to buy.  </p><p>PROF. PAUL BECK, OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY:  You're scared and they're scared maybe for the first time in their lives.  This has been a several decade period of unusual prosperity.  </p><p>SNOW:  Political science professor Paul Beck says while these young voters may be scared, they're also enthusiastic about this election.  Seizing on that enthusiasm, volunteers saturated the campus to get students to register and vote early and to see how coveted the youth vote, consider that just a stone's throw from the nation's largest university of nearly 53,000 students is an Obama campaign office.  Team Obama is offering students rides to polling places. Bruce Springsteen even performed at OSU on Sunday to try and drive turnout.  </p><p>BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN, SINGER:  We're also here four years ago.  This time we're winning.  </p><p>SNOW:  In 2004, Democrat John Kerry lost Ohio to George Bush by a slim margin.  Students for Obama say they believe they'll make the difference for Democrats in this state.  On the Republican side, no McCain office on campus, just a couple of table setups.  The college Republicans here say Sarah Palin has lit a fire for them.  </p><p>JONATHAN SNYDER, OHIO COLLEGE REPUBLICANS FED.:  Anytime you watch anything, it's all about Obama and the youth vote and how he's got it locked down.  That's simply not the case.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SNOW:  And Wolf, volunteers have spanned this campus today leading up to tonight's deadline to register to vote.  And also here in Ohio for the last six days, people have been able to register and vote on the same day.  And the campaigns are certainly hoping that will help get young voters to the polls since in the past, they haven't always been reliable showing up on Election Day although they have been eager to register.  </p><p>BLITZER:  People vote in much bigger percentages the older they get.  Let's see if that changes this time around.  Mary, thanks very much.  </p><p>Ohio, by the way, isn't the only state with a registration deadline.  Today the cutoff in at least 16 states plus the District of Columbia.  Among them such key battle grounds as Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Florida.  Florida has signed up more than half a million voters this year.  V has registered more than 300,000.  Several other states have deadlines later this week.  </p><p>The U.S. Supreme Court begins its new term a month before Election Day.  Why the justices are on the minds of so many voters right now.  </p><p>That $700 billion bailout doesn't stop the stock markets from taking a sickening plunge.  Lou Dobbs will weigh in on the wall streets nosedive coming up.  Stay with us.  You're in THE SITUATION ROOM. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BLITZER:  The first Monday in October means the start of a new term for the U.S. Supreme Court.  The first Tuesday in November is Election Day.  And the court certainly will be on the minds of a lot of voters.  Let's go to CNN's justice correspondent Kelli Arena -- Kelli?  </p><p>KELLI ARENA, CNN JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT:  Wolf, with issues like the economy dominating the campaign, you haven't heard much about the Supreme Court.  But don't let that fool you.  It's all some voters care about.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ARENA:  Make no mistake.  The Supreme Court is very much on the ballot.  </p><p>WENDY LONG, JUDICIAL CONFIRMATION NETWORK:  This is the American citizen's last chance to choose the man who's going to be picking at least probably several justices and shaping the court for most of this century.  </p><p>ARENA:  From abortion to the war on terror, the court will play a vital role.  </p><p>KATHRYN KOLBERT, PRES. PEOPLE FOR THE AMERICAN WAY:  I am petrified about what's at stake here.  </p><p>ARENA:  And activists from both parties are making sure the rest of the electorate knows it.  </p><p>MCCAIN:  We have not done enough.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  No, senator, McCain have you not.  Count on McCain to support judge who's support our rights.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Choosing the right justices is critical to America.  We don't know who Barack Obama would choose but know this. He chose as one of his financial backers a slumlord now convicted on 16 counts of corruption.  </p><p>ARENA:  The face of the court could go through some radical changes.  Observers speculate 88-year-old justice John Paul Stevens may retire.  Justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg in her late 70s has had health issues.  And friends of Justice David Suitor say that he might like to go back to New Hampshire.  All three lean left.  </p><p>EDWARD LAZARUS, AUTHOR, \"CLOSE CHAMBGERS\":  If Barack Obama becomes president, it is almost certain that the court will stay roughly the way it is.  If Senator McCain were to win the presidency, he would be replacing liberal justices, presumably, with justices far more conservative.  </p><p>ARENA:  Both candidates have made no secret about the types of justices they'd pick or avoid.  </p><p>OBAMA:  I would not have nominated Clarence Thomas.  </p><p>MCCAIN:  Justices Alito and Roberts are two of my most recent favorites, by the way.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ARENA:  For now, the court remains tightly divided.  Most decisions have come down to a 5-4 vote, which is far too close for true believers from both parties.  Wolf? </p><p>BLITZER:  Kelli, thanks very much.  A critical issue in this election.  </p><p>The Supreme Court, by the way, dismissed hundreds of appeals that piled up over the summer before hearing arguments.  Today, early indications that the justices might side with big tobacco in a case over deceptive advertising, three Maine residents sued the makers of light and low tar cigarettes as they're called saying the company knew for decades that they're just as dangerous as regular cigarettes.  In court today, several justices were skeptical that state laws against fraudulent advertising could be used as grounds for a suit.  </p><p>Another high-profile case, the FCC versus Fox TV.  The FCC wants tougher penalties against TV stations but network executives argue that it's a violation of free speech.  </p><p>And in yet another free speech case, a small religious group wants to build a monument in a public park, the same park where a monument of the Ten Commandments stands.  Officials in Grove City, Utah say the proposal monument doesn't fit in.  </p><p>The problems on Wall Street have plenty of people afraid and calls are pouring in from investors.  We're talking to the experts about what you should be doing right now.  </p><p>Plus, Barack Obama one-on-one with our own Roland Martin.  That interview coming up.  </p><p>Stay with us.  You're in THE SITUATION ROOM.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BLITZER:  As the McCain campaign goes on the offensive, Barack Obama is fighting back.  He was on the Tom Joyner radio show today, interviewed by CNN's Roland Martin.  Listen to this.  </p><p>(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>OBAMA:  I think the American people deserve better.  I think they deserve a last four weeks of talks about the economic crisis, about the 159 jobs that were lost, the 159,000 jobs that were lost just last week, last month.  But if John McCain wants to have a character debate, then I'm happy to have that debate because Mr. McCain's record, despite him calling himself a maverick, actually shows that he is continually somebody who relies on lobbyists for big oil and big corporations and that he makes decisions oftentimes based on what these lobbyists tell him to do.  </p><p>ROLAND MARTIN, CNN CONTRIBUTOR:  The campaign is launching this website, keatingeconomicing.com.  Charles Keating was an economics guy out of Arizona.  That failure cost American taxpayers $2.3 billion. Doesn't this put you in the position of going negative, taking away your message of running a different kind of campaign? </p><p>OBAMA:  Well, look.  One of the things we've done throughout this campaign, we don't throw the first punch.  But we'll throw the last. Because if the American people don't get the information that's relevant about these candidates and instead in the last four weeks all they're hearing about are smears and swift boat tactics, that can have an impact on the election.  We've seen it before.  And this election is too important to be sitting on the sidelines.  If Senator McCain wants to focus on the issues, then that's what we focus on, but if he wants to have a character debate, that's one that we're willing to have.  </p><p>MARTIN:  Senator, Senator McCain jumped into this deal, trying to push a deal forward.  You stayed more behind the scenes.  Is that an example of the contrast in leadership styles whereas you allowed the negotiators to work rather than broker a deal yourself? </p><p>OBAMA:  There's no doubt about it.  The fact is that, you know, if you are out there trying to politicize the situation, get in front of cameras, take a lot of credit in delicate negotiations in Washington, in the middle of a presidential campaign, then you can be counterproductive.  And what we decided was that for me to simply be in constant communications with the secretary of the treasury, to talk to congressional leaders, to let them do their work, to step in where necessary but not be worried about getting the credit on it, that that was going to be the most productive approach.  </p><p>(END AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>BLITZER:  Senator Obama speaking with Roland Martin earlier today on the Tom Joyner Radio Show.  </p><p>That $700 billion bailout didn't stop the stock markets, as you know, from taking another breath-taking plunge today.  Lou Dobbs has been watching this together with all of us.  </p><p>Lou, give us your analysis.  What happened today? </p><p>LOU DOBBS, CNN ANCHOR:  Well, what happened today is what we've been seeing happen for some time now.  Over the past two weeks, the president of the United States, the speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, Senator Harry Reid, the Senate majority leader, Henry Paulson, have been talking down the American economy, the stock markets, the credit markets.  And what would anybody expect to be the result? A sell-off.  That's exactly what we've seen.  </p><p>It started with the passage of that ignorant bailout.  And don't let anybody kid you.  That bailout was an absolute atrocity and an insult to the American people, laden with an additional $150 billion in pork just to get it through.  While the same people, the same leaders, so-called, were saying it was critically important in the national interest, but they had to add $150 billion.  What these markets are saying now is to the United States, to the American people, your leaders don't deserve confidence, don't deserve in any way respect.  </p><p>These markets are going to continue to go down until we get an intelligent response to the crisis.  That means instead of handing out money to Hank Paulson's buddies on Wall Street, it means that we start dealing with the issue of solvency.

The Dow drops by 800 points before making a partial comeback. Investors fearing the credit crisis will reach all the way around the world.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And what about the Wall Street bailout? Will that $700 billion boost do anything for Americans on Main Street? I'll ask Billionaire <person><nameText>Donald Trump. </nameText></person>He's here in THE SITUATION ROOM.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And <person><nameText>Sarah Palin </nameText></person>tries to tie <person><nameText>Barack Obama </nameText></person>to terrorism. She's leading the charge, as the McCain campaign goes into attack mode. But could that backfire with voters?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in THE SITUATION ROOM.</p><p>Shock waves from the U.S. financial crisis are reverberating around the world and coming back full circle today in a massive Wall Street sell-off that sent the Dow Jones Industrial Average spiraling down to a five year low. The Dow dropped below the 10,000 mark for the first time -- for the first time since October, 2003.</p><p>No doubt a bad day. But at one point it was looking disastrous. With the Dow down a record 800 points, recovery did set in during the final hour of trading, and that helped cut losses. But the Dow still closed down almost 370 points.</p><p>All this despite Washington's $700 billion Wall Street bailout. And there is bad news at the NASDAQ, as well.</p><p>Poppy Harlow of CNNMoney.com is there -- Poppy, what's going on at the NASDAQ?</p><p>POPPY HARLOW, CNNMONEY.COM: Well, the time that the Nasdaq is the worst hit of all these averages, today down 4.3 percent. It was down as much as 8 percent this afternoon. It's down more than 30 percent this year. That's because you have a mix of big tech stocks like Oracle and Cisco and Microsoft that have been hit hard. Some analysts say you can't short the financials right now because of that SEC ban. So people are shorting tech companies that rely on those financial institutions for a lot of their business.</p><p>Also, a lot of regional banks are traded here, names like Citizens, Republic Bancorp and Zion Bank that were hit very hard today and all this week.</p><p>So what you have, Wolf, is a sell-off across the board. And this index hit even harder than the Dow industrials -- Wolf.</p><p>BLITZER: The volatility that's enormous -- and it causes heartburn for so many folks who are looking at these numbers. Give us some perspective, Poppy, how this -- what this really means to investors who are watching us right now.</p><p>HARLOW: Yes, you might not have heard of this thing before, but it's called the VIC. There's an actual index that tracks the volatility of the market. And that index went nuts today, right?</p><p>We saw the Dow go from 800 points to close down 370. We saw the NASDAQ with big swings like that. And this shows the highest reading today since 1989. Why do you care out there?</p><p>Because it's showing you that fear and emotion is driving this market. It is no longer based on fundamentals. We haven't seen the volatility index this high in 19 years. You're seeing a reading of over 50 points. Just less than a month ago, in the middle of September, the reading was at 20 points.</p><p>So people are betting on the fact that the market is going to go up and down and up and down, but they're betting more so, Wolf, that the market is going to go down. That's what's going on right now -- Wolf.</p><p>BLITZER: Poppy is over at the NASDAQ. Stand by.</p><p>Even as the financial meltdown continues, Congress has convened its first hearing on the subject. The House Oversight and Government Reform Committee began with the largest bankruptcy in American history, Lehman Brothers, and its top executive.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RICHARD FULD, CHAIRMAN &amp; CEO, LEHMAN BROTHERS: Like many other financial institutions, Lehman Brothers got caught in this financial tsunami.</p><p>But I want to be very clear. I take full responsibility for the decisions that I made and for the actions that I took. Based on the information that we had at the time, I believed that these decisions and actions were both prudent and appropriate.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BLITZER: Our Special Investigations Unit correspondent, Abbie Boudreau, just got back from the hearing -- Abbie, you've been doing some digging into this CEO. hat do we know? What are we learning?</p><p>ABBIE BOUDREAU, CNN INVESTIGATIVE CORRESPONDENT: Well, Wolf, Richard Fuld is known as \"The Gorilla\" at Lehman Brothers, where he says he started as an intern 42 years ago. Now, as CEO since 1993, he's overseen more than 28,000 employees in over 28 countries.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BOUDREAU (voice-over): The 62-year-old Wall Street tycoon rakes in nearly a half billion dollars between 2000 and 2007 according to the Oversight Committee -- in one year alone, earning more than $106 million.</p><p>Along with all that money came immense homes -- this estate in Greenwich, Connecticut complete with tennis courts and swimming pool and a $21 million apartment on Park Avenue in New York City and a vacation spread in Juniper Island, Florida, with a postcard perfect view -- not to mention a lavish art collection reportedly worth millions.</p><p>Outside the hearing room, I tried to ask him about all of this.</p><p>(on camera): Do you think it's fair that you made so much money when your company is actually (INAUDIBLE)?</p><p>FULD: I'm sorry. I'm on my way to a...</p><p>BOUDREAU: Some of your critics have said that you have had a chance to save your company and you haven't.</p><p>Is it greed?</p><p>I mean do you have anything to say to the people that are -- that are watching this right now, that are wondering, you know, why this happened?</p><p>You have nothing to say?</p><p>FULD: Are you going to be in the testimony?</p><p>BOUDREAU: Absolutely.</p><p>FULD: Good.</p><p>BOUDREAU (voice-over): I also asked him about all of his real estate holdings.</p><p>(on camera): How do you rationalize that when the rest of the country is in turmoil?</p><p>(voice-over): At the hearing, Congressman Henry Waxman asked Fuld if he deserved all the money he's made at Lehman.</p><p>REP. HENRY WAXMAN (D), CALIFORNIA: Do you think it's fair and do you have any recommendations on fundamental reforms that would bring a new approach to executive compensation?</p><p>FULD: Mr. Chairman, we had a compensation committee that spent a tremendous amount of time making sure that the interests of the executives and the employees were aligned with shareholders.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BOUDREAU: Now, he chose not to the answer that very direct question. Congressman Waxman twice asked him that again, but never got a clear answer -- Wolf.</p><p>BLITZER: Abbie, thanks for that. Abbie Boudreau working the story.</p><p>The McCain campaign has seemingly moved on from the economy and gone into attack mode. Leading the offensive, the running mate, <person><nameText>Sarah Palin.</nameText></person></p><p>Let's go to Ed Henry. He's in Florida working this story for us. Governor Palin's trying to tie, since Saturday morning, <person><nameText>Barack Obama </nameText></person>to terrorism. Explain what she's suggesting.</p><p>ED HENRY, CNN CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT: That's right, Wolf.</p><p>The McCain camp insists they can do both -- they can talk about the economy and also raise questions about <person><nameText>Barack Obama's</nameText></person> fitness for office. What's really interesting is <person><nameText>Sarah Palin </nameText></person>is in the middle of this. Last week, we saw her trying to show her down to earth style in the debate. This week, a much more traditional role of a vice presidential candidate -- Palin as pit bull.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HENRY (voice-over): Say it isn't so Sarah -- after admonishing Democrats to stop looking backwards about the Bush years during last week's vice presidential debate...</p><p>GOV. <person><nameText>SARAH PALIN </nameText></person>(R-AK), VICE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Say it ain't so, Joe. There you go again, pointing backwards again.</p><p>HENRY: <person><nameText>Sarah Palin </nameText></person>is now using a story from four decades ago to attack <person><nameText>Barack Obama.</nameText></person></p><p>PALIN: This is about the truthfulness and the judgment needed in our next. President John McCain has it. <person><nameText>Barack Obama </nameText></person>doesn't have it.</p><p>HENRY: For the third straight day, Palin targeted Obama over his ties to Bill Ayers -- a radical who led nonfatal bombings at the Pentagon and Capitol Hill to protest the Vietnam War in the 1960s. Ayers held a 1995 coffee introducing Obama to Chicago's political establishment. Though chief adviser, David Axelrod, now tells CNN the candidate did not know Ayers' background at the time.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROBERT GIBBS, OBAMA COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR: Look, if that's what David said, that is true. Look, again, this is a relationship that <person><nameText>Barack Obama </nameText></person>has -- has condemned the actions of Bill Ayers.</p><p>HENRY: On the stump in the key state of Florida, Palin pounced.</p><p>PALIN: Today they're saying for the first time that <person><nameText>Barack Obama </nameText></person>didn't know back then about Ayers' radical background.</p><p>(BOOS) PALIN: Wait a minute. He didn't know a few months ago that he had launched his political career in the living room of a domestic terrorist?</p><p>HENRY: Obama aides insist this is just a diversion, because the financial crisis is sinking John McCain in battleground states.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GIBBS: What this is, is a classic smear campaign to distract the voters away from talking about the economy, just as they previewed in this weekend's papers. They were going to turn the page on the economy and get to character assassination.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HENRY: But there could be a down side for the Republican ticket from these attacks.</p><p>Take a look at the latest CNN/Opinion Research Corporation poll and how <person><nameText>Sarah Palin </nameText></person>is viewed by the public. Fifty-two percent view her favorably. But look at the unfavorable numbers. They've been climbing ever since the Convention. Twenty-one percent unfavorable around the GOP Convention, 27 percent in early September, up to 35 percent in late September. The latest numbers now 40 percent.</p><p>So she may be scoring points, but they have to be careful that this could backfire and turn off Independent voters -- Wolf.</p><p>BLITZER: Especially, as you point out, those Independent voters.</p><p>Ed Henry working the story for us. Thank you.</p><p><person><nameText>Barack Obama </nameText></person>makes it clear he won't sit back and take any abuse hurled by the other side. Listen to what he told a radio interview today.</p><p>(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. <person><nameText>BARACK OBAMA </nameText></person>(D-IL), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: And one of the things that we've done throughout this campaign, we don't throw the first punch. But we'll throw the last.</p><p>(END AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>BLITZER: The Obama campaign is already counterpunching, unveiling a new Web video about John McCain's involvement in the so- called Keating Five scandal two decades ago. Back then, McCain participated in meetings with banking regulators on behalf of an Arizona savings and loan owner who was convicted of securities fraud. The Senate Ethics Committee later cleared McCain of wrongdoing, but said he showed poor judgment.</p><p>Some of the stories we're working on this hour here in THE SITUATION ROOM. Fallout from the nation's financial meltdown -- impact on the race for the White House. And we're going to be talking about both of those subjects with <person><nameText>Donald Trump. </nameText></person>He's standing by like. Stand by for that.</p><p>Also, only hours left to register to vote in one critical battleground state -- the frantic effort to sign up young people.</p><p>Plus, long after the next president is gone, his influence will live on in the United States Supreme Court -- two, maybe three seats at stake. We're looking at what's at stake with those seats.</p><p>Stay with us. You're in THE SITUATION ROOM.</p><p>BLITZER: Stocks continue to tumble despite a massive government bailout, with huge implications for these, the final weeks of the presidential campaign.</p><p>Joining us now on the phone is <person><nameText>Donald Trump. </nameText></person>He's watching all of this unfold with us. Were you getting a little heartburn watching the market collapse today, down at one point, 800 points, Donald, and then recovering, what closing almost down 370?</p><p><person><nameText>DONALD TRUMP, </nameText></person>CHAIRMAN &amp; PRESIDENT, THE TRUMP ORGANIZATION: Well, it's a very sad point in this country's history, Wolf. There's no question about it.</p><p>BLITZER: What should people who are watching this unfold before their eyes right now, what should they be doing given your background, your advice?</p><p>TRUMP: All they can do is dream, Wolf. They can dream. They can dream about things getting better. And they will get better. Eventually, things are going to get better. This is like a cleansing action. It's being cleaned out. And, honestly, they have to start looking for opportunity, because there is more opportunity now than there was two years ago -- Wolf.</p><p>BLITZER: So talk a little bit about that opportunity. But before you do that, when you say eventually things will get better, I've heard experts -- some say we're talking at least a year or two of a deep recession right now. Others saying we could be in trouble for four or five years. What do you think?</p><p>TRUMP: Well, I never defined what eventually meant. It could be two or three years. It could be a long period of time. It could be shorter than that, but it could be a long period of time.</p><p>We are very, very much in deep trouble. If you look at oil prices, they're still way, way too high. I mean they're artificially set by OPEC and they're still way too high. The good news about this -- probably the only good news -- is that oil is going to drop like a rock, which, if you'll remember, I told you that last time.</p><p>BLITZER: Right. It's down below $90 a barrel right now, which is a lot less than it was only a few months ago. Because people are saying you know what, I'm going to take my money out of the stock market right now, I'm going to wait until it hits rock bottom and that will be a great time to start buying some bargains out there on the New York Stock Exchange.</p><p>TRUMP: Well, I don't really recommend that too much. They've gone down a long way. Some of these folks have been in for a long time and they've taken a very horrible ride. And this isn't really the right time to be taking your money out. That doesn't mean it's not going to go lower. But it just doesn't seem to me to make sense.</p><p>If you have a particularly bad stock or whatever, maybe you do that. But it doesn't seem to be the right time, for me, to take money out of the stock market. So I wouldn't recommend that.</p><p>BLITZER: The real estate market -- the experts say the mortgage -- the funny mortgages that were out there, that's the cause of this financial meltdown. But there's got to be huge bargains out there, if you know what you're doing, in real estate.</p><p>TRUMP: Well, I don't think it's the only cause. I think a lot has to do with the price of oil, because I've always said that oil is the lifeblood of this country in terms of its economics. And when have you oil going for $150, it's -- that's just preposterous.</p><p>And I have a very, very smart friend who said anytime oil goes over $50 -- $50 -- you're going to have a depression. Not a recession a depression.</p><p>BLITZER: Well, you think we're on the...</p><p>TRUMP: Well, guess what?</p><p>We hit $150.</p><p>BLITZER: Are we on the eve of depression or just a deep recession?</p><p>TRUMP: Well, time will tell. And time will tell whether or not the $750 billion bailout is going to work, if it's going to have any effect. Some people think it makes things worse because you don't get that full cleansing.</p><p>And when it happens, it'll happen -- it'll delay it, but it will be a lot steeper.</p><p>So, we'll see what happens. You know, to a certain extent, it is trial and error. And that's a pretty bad situation for this country.</p><p>BLITZER: How has President Bush handled this economic crisis?</p><p>TRUMP: Well, look, it's not a favorite person of mine. Between the war and between all of the problems we have that he's gotten us into, you're not talking about my favorite person. How has he handled it? He's tried. I think he's probably working harder than he usually would. But, you know, we'll have to see whether or not it works. But the bottom line is we are in a very, very deep recession, at least.</p><p>BLITZER: How about you personally? How are you doing?</p><p>TRUMP: Well, I'm doing well. I got a little lucky. I sold something for a lot of money to a Russian buyer. And now I see the Russian stock market is collapsing, also.</p><p>BLITZER: I hope you got your money.</p><p>TRUMP: I got my money.</p><p>BLITZER: That's...</p><p>TRUMP: It closed two weeks ago. Crazy, right?</p><p>BLITZER: You're lucky you did that. But all the other buildings -- all the Trump buildings that are going up, not only in the United States, but around the world -- because we see the world markets out there in deep trouble right now. I know you're building in Dubai and elsewhere. How are they doing?</p><p>TRUMP: Well, they've been doing really well. Outside of the United States, in particular, they've been doing really, really well. In the United States, for the most part, the buildings were completed two years ago. So they really have been tremendously successful and I'm very happy about it.</p><p>BLITZER: All right. The last time we spoke, you told us you're going to vote for John McCain. Are you still going to do that?</p><p>TRUMP: Well, I know him very well. He's a really good man. He's a tough man and he's a smart man. And that's what we need.</p><p>BLITZER: And you think he's different than Bush?</p><p>TRUMP: I do think he's different. He's different in a lot of ways, including his demeanor.</p><p>BLITZER: So you're with McCain and <person><nameText>Sarah Palin?</nameText></person></p><p>Do you think she's ready to be president, God forbid, one of these days...</p><p>TRUMP: Well, she certainly has made impact...</p><p>BLITZER: ...if something were to happen to the president?</p><p>TRUMP: ...there's no doubt about that.</p><p>BLITZER: She's what?</p><p>TRUMP: She's made a lot of impact.</p><p>BLITZER: But do you think she's ready for that?</p><p>TRUMP: I think she's very smart and I think she did very, very well in the debate. And I think Biden did very well in the debate, also. I thought they both did very, very well. And they can be proud of each other. The fact is, it was an interesting evening.</p><p>BLITZER: It was a fascinating -- 70 million Americans watched and tens of millions more around the world. <person><nameText>Donald Trump, </nameText></person>thanks very much for joining us.</p><p>TRUMP: Thank you very much, Wolf.</p><p>BLITZER: We'll speak to you soon.</p><p>TRUMP: OK.</p><p>BLITZER: America's financial crisis -- as you know, it's sending financial shock waves around the world. We're watching global markets. We'll get a live update from London. Stand by for that.</p><p>And meet the man in charge of saving Wall Street, overseeing the $700 billion bailout. Guess what? He's 35 years old.</p><p>Stay with us. You're in THE SITUATION ROOM.</p><p>BLITZER: Let's check in with Susan Roesgen.</p><p>She's monitoring some other important stories incoming into THE SITUATION ROOM right now.</p><p>What's going on -- Susan?</p><p>SUSAN ROESGEN, CNN GULF COAST CORRESPONDENT: Well, across the world, Wolf, China is retaliating for proposed U.S. arms sales to Taiwan. Beijing has called off upcoming senior level military visits to the U.S. and also called off visits by Chinese ships and other military and diplomatic contacts. China, of course, which considers Taiwan part of its territory, plans to officially protest the proposed weapons sale.</p><p>And eBay is slashing jobs as revenue slows for that company. The online auction site is cutting 1,000 employees and several hundred temporary workers. And that's about 10 percent of its workforce. EBay, however, also announced that it is buying online payment survey, Bill Me Later, for $945 million. That company gives users the option of deferred payments.</p><p>And the global financial meltdown sent oil prices plummeting today. The price of crude fell more than $5, to below $90 a barrel. That's on concern that the demand for energy is slowing. And that is the lowest the price of oil has been in nearly 10 months -- Wolf.</p><p>BLITZER: Yes. It's a little silver lining for all the other bad economic news that's out there. Susan, thanks very much. Only 35 years old and now he's in charge of that $700 billion Wall Street bailout. So what makes him qualified? We're investigating.</p><p>Plus, a deadline looming in a must-win state, where young voters may make the difference.</p><p>Stay with us. You're in THE SITUATION ROOM.</p><p>BLITZER: To our viewers, you're in THE SITUATION ROOM.</p><p>Happening now, less than seven hours left to register to vote in one crucial battleground state. We're there live following the frantic effort to recruit young voters. Stand by.</p><p>Also, the very young man in charge of administering that $700 billion Wall Street bailout -- what makes him so qualified for the tremendous task?</p><p>Plus, the lasting impact of the coming election on the U.S. Supreme Court -- one vote with an impact potentially lasting generations.</p><p>I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in THE SITUATION ROOM.</p><p>The Dow isn't suffering alone. Take a look what stocks are doing around the world. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index down almost five percent. Japan's Nikkei losing 4.5 -- 4.25 percent, that is. Germany's Dax off more than seven percent. And the British FTSE plunging almost eight percent.</p><p>For more now on the worldwide sell-off, what's going on, let's go to Richard Quest in London.</p><p>He's watching the story for us. This is just the latest evidence -- you're at Number 10 Downing Street in London, Richard -- that this economic crisis in the United States is spreading around the world.</p><p>RICHARD QUEST, CNN CORRESPONDENT: We have talked about globalization on so many occasions, Wolf. Guess what? You're seeing it in action.</p><p>What happens in New York is followed in London, to Frankfurt, to Munich, to Russia, right the way around the world, through Asia.</p><p>There is literally nowhere where banks, where investors can hide. Perhaps gold, maybe. That's always been the oldest investment of them all. But when it comes to the markets, they are global. They don't like what they see. And there is a lack of confidence from one side of the globe to the other -- Wolf.</p><p>BLITZER: And, Richard, the rules in Europe are different. The European community simply can't bail out a lot of these banks the way the federal government often does here. Is that right?</p><p>QUEST: Basically, it's as if -- imagine each state insured and guaranteed each individual bank in the U.S. That's what you've got in Europe, where maybe a European Union, but national governments -- the British, the German, the French -- they all actually take care of and supervise their individual banks. So what we are seeing -- and it is serious, indeed -- is in Britain and in Germany, we are seeing banks that have failed and that are failing.</p><p>But as yet, Wolf, we are not seeing that coordinated governmental response that perhaps would give a bailout of the size and scale that you saw in the United States.</p><p>BLITZER: Richard Quest in London for us. We're going to stay in touch with you.</p><p>Only days ago, the candidates were focused on the economic meltdown. Now the McCain campaign has moved also into an attack mode. And the Obama campaign is hurrying to try to catch up on that front, as well.</p><p>Let's discuss this with our CNN political contributor, Hilary Rosen. She's editor-at-large at the HuffingtonPost.com. And Republican strategist John Feehery. Both of them here in THE SITUATION ROOM.</p><p>Was the McCain campaign counting on the $700 billion bailout vote alleviating this crisis somewhat so they could move on and change the subject, if will you?</p><p>JOHN FEEHERY, BLOGS FOR THEFEEHERYTHEORY: Everyone knew it was going to take a long time to get this all settled out and worked out. I mean for the McCain campaign, they've got to get out an economic message. The economic message for them is <person><nameText>Barack Obama </nameText></person>has a plan to raise taxes on investors and small business owners and they've got to hammer that time and time again. People have to understand John McCain has a better plan to get us out of this mess than <person><nameText>Barack Obama </nameText></person>does.</p><p>BLITZER: What do you think? Because the argument is at least the Obama campaign makes it repeatedly that if you like the economic policies of Bush, just get ready for more of the same under McCain.</p><p>HILARY ROSEN, FORMER CHAIRWOMAN AND CEO OF THE RECORDING INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION OF AMERICA: And I think that that message is resonating. People know that's what the McCain plan does is essentially continue Bush tax cuts for corporations and companies that don't wealthy individuals that don't need a tax cut right now. They're not growing jobs. And <person><nameText>Barack Obama's</nameText></person> going to put tax cuts where it's needed to people making less than $250,000 a year and small businesses earning less than $250,000 a year.</p><p>BLITZER: Because the economic news is bad enough for the McCain campaign. We've seen movement not only nationally but in battleground states. In the new CNN Opinion Research Corporation poll, Bush is now at Nixon numbers; only 24 percent approve of the way he's handling his job as president. 74 percent disapprove. He's a Republican. McCain is a Republican. And a lot of Americans are going to say you know what? We need somebody else in charge.</p><p>FEEHERY: That's why it's very important for the McCain campaign to keep on offense with Obama. Right now, the McCain campaign is a little bit on the run. They've got to get Obama on the run.</p><p>BLITZER: That's why <person><nameText>Sarah Palin </nameText></person>is doing what she's doing, raising the whole William Ayers the terrorist issue three days in a row?</p><p>FEEHERY: I'm not sure how effective that's going to be. They need to say this Chicago politician <person><nameText>Barack Obama </nameText></person>doesn't have a plan that's going to help you with your 401(k)s and need to get on the message as soon as possible.</p><p>BLITZER: Here's what Obama said today. I want to play this little clip in this radio interview he did with Roland Martin on the Tom Joyner show. Listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>OBAMA: One of the things we've done throughout this campaign, we don't throw the first punch but we'll throw the last.</p><p>(END AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>BLITZER: We don't throw the first punch but we'll throw the last. He's learned lessons I assume from earlier Democratic presidential candidates whether it's John Kerry or Michael Dukakis where they sort of turned the other cheek.</p><p>ROSEN: I'll tell you, Democrats just listen to that and smile, with relief. Because John McCain has decided he is willing to throw his dignity and his honor, whatever is left of it away by throwing the kitchen sink of nasty charges at <person><nameText>Barack Obama. </nameText></person>This campaign is not going to take it. Because they know that people want to talk about the economy and not just tax cuts. But how investment in alternative energies, investments in education, how bringing a close to the war which is costing us $10 billion a month, how all of those things are going to put this country back on the right track.</p><p>BLITZER: Because it's interesting <person><nameText>Sarah Palin </nameText></person>three days in a Rojas been raising the William Ayers/<person><nameText>Barack Obama </nameText></person>relationship. Senator McCain delivered a touch speech and was very critical of Obama today but he didn't there, he didn't go to that William Ayers issue.</p><p>FEEHERY: That's the beauty of a vice presidential candidate. They can do that stuff. That's what her role is. That's what vice presidential roles are supposed to be, go after the other guy. He's got to stay on a positive message on trying to fix this economy and focusing <person><nameText>Barack Obama's</nameText></person> message on tax hikes.</p><p>BLITZER: Would he have been better off, this is a question that you hear nowadays, especially in today's continued drop of the stock market, opposing the $700 billion bailout and citing the earmarks in it and saying I can't support this?</p><p>FEEHERY: If the package had gone down a second time and if the economy had really tanked which it seems to be doing anyway, I think it would be worse. Had he no choice but to support this bailout because it's the responsible thing to do. <person><nameText>Barack Obama </nameText></person>all the responsible leaders say do this. Terry Jeffries said he ought to oppose it, I'm not sure it would help.</p><p>BLITZER: A clip from Senator McCain. He went after Senator Obama in strong words. Listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. JOHN MCCAIN (R-AZ), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: What has this man ever actually accomplished in government? What does he plan for America? In short, who is -- who is the real <person><nameText>Barack Obama? </nameText></person>But my friends, you ask such questions, and all you get in response is another angry barrage of insults.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BLITZER: All right. Strong words from Senator McCain, basically raising questions about his ability or his qualifications to be president of the United States.</p><p>ROSEN: The McCain campaign strategy for the next week has been laid out here. <person><nameText>Sarah Palin </nameText></person>throws the mud and John McCain tries to establish the riskiness of an Obama presidency.</p><p>BLITZER: It's worked in the past for Republicans.</p><p>ROSEN: But that worked before Americans saw <person><nameText>Barack Obama </nameText></person>be smart and cool and thoughtful during an economic crisis. And then before they saw him in a debate going toe to toe with John McCain on really complicated foreign policy issues.</p><p>BLITZER: It worked.</p><p>ROSEN: Those two things I think people came around and saw that --</p><p>BLITZER: It never worked against Bill Clinton in '92 and in '96 because he would respond in kind.</p><p>FEEHERY: You know, Bill Clinton was a pretty good candidate and I think that will McCain has to learn from the mistakes of the dole campaign and the first George Bush campaign and stick on positive issues going after the economy, talking about his Atlantic experience, <person><nameText>Barack Obama's</nameText></person> lack of experience and his record on raising taxes. That's one of the top issues for John McCain going in because in a recession people understand if you raise taxes on small businesses, it's going to be bad for jobs and people get that.</p><p>BLITZER: It's already pretty bad for jobs right now. Guys, thanks very much for coming in.</p><p>They're scared for the first time in their lives.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It's hard to even get essentials like bread and milk has increased to a point it's almost ridiculous to buy.</p><p>BLITZER: We're talking to young voters very worried right now about the economy as they try to step out into the world. And a stunning drop for stock marketed. How low can they go? CNN's Ali Velshi standing by with the latest on Wall Street's slide and what it means for you.</p><p>Stay with us. You're in THE SITUATION ROOM.</p><p>BLITZER: A rather disturbing global stock sell off today underscoring just how much is riding on the government's Wall Street bailout. We now know who's in charge of it, a 35-year-old protege of the treasury secretary Henry Paulson. Susan Roesgen is back with us. She's working the story for us.</p><p>So what do we know about this 35-year-old, Susan?</p><p>ROESGEN: He's apparently very smart and Wolf, get this before he got into investment banking he was in research and development for NASA. Apparently a pretty sophisticated guy, really smart guy his name is Neal Kashkari. Like several top administration officials he is a former executive from the same top Wall Street firm.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ROESGEN: He's armed with a $700 billion line of credit. His mission, to start buying bad debt. Treasury official Neal Kashkari has been named to spearhead the Wall Street rescue plan. Kashkari is a 35-year-old who has been working over the last year on mortgage and foreclosure issues including contingency planning if banks are crippled by bad mortgages. He is a former vice president of Goldman Sachs. That makes him the third top administration official to come from that will firm. Alongside his boss Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and White House chief of staff Josh Bolten. While some analysts say the number of Goldman alums involved raises the possibility of a conflict of interest, a White House spokesman says secretary Paulson is trying to bring in the best talent he can. And others say the bailout team will need people with Wall Street experience.</p><p>STEPHEN POPE, CANTOR FITZGERALD: They have to be people that understand what is the heart and soul of the instruments concerned and secondly, are they able to try and imply a value the market might think is acceptable upon each instrument.</p><p>ROESGEN: And the treasury department won't handle all the buying itself. Private firms will also play a role.</p><p>HENRY PAULSON, TREASURY SECRETARY: We're looking at a number of asset managers with good experience, very good experience and expertise from the private sector.</p><p>ROESGEN: Now, Kashkari is an interim appointment for three months till the new president is inaugurated. Whoever that is can decide whether to keep him or choose be else.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE) BLITZER: What about the potential for some firms hired for a conflict of interest out there?</p><p>ROESGEN: Even the treasury department itself in the announcement today said there could be a conflict of interest. They're sort of making up the rules as they go. One thing they talk about is the private firms that will manage other private firms' bad debt might not be told everything about those companies to try to limit the amount of information that each firm knows so nobody gets too cozy.</p><p>BLITZER: This is a whole new territory for a lot of folks. They're looking for the best and brightest. Hopefully they'll find him. Thanks very much for that.</p><p>Many young voters are excited about making their voices heard in this election and deeply concerned about the financial meltdown and what it means as they begin to step out into the world. Let's gets to Mary Snow. She's working this story for us in Columbus, Ohio, one of those battleground states.</p><p>Mary, what's on their minds? What are you hearing and seeing?</p><p>MARY SNOW, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, Wolf, clearly the election but also the economy, whether it comes to student loans or even just making day-to-day expenses. We talked to several young voters here today who say the decisions about the economy are really shaping how they're going to cast their vote.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SNOW: Call it Main Street 2.0, you don't have to look far at Ohio State University's campus to see signs students are worried about the economy. Keiran Johnson is worried what kind of job market he'll face.</p><p>KEIRAN JOHNSON, STUDENT: Graduating hoping I can get something better. That's what we're told to go to school and have a better life. We don't know if that's true.</p><p>SNOW: For Amanda Kulcar, the concerns are more immediate like the price of gasoline.</p><p>AMANDA KULCAR, STUDENT: Even groceries increasing. It's hard to get bread and mull can has increased to a point it's almost ridiculous to buy.</p><p>PROF. PAUL BECK, OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY: You're scared and they're scared maybe for the first time in their lives. This has been a several decade period of unusual prosperity.</p><p>SNOW: Political science professor Paul Beck says while these young voters may be scared, they're also enthusiastic about this election. Seizing on that enthusiasm, volunteers saturated the campus to get students to register and vote early and to see how coveted the youth vote, consider that just a stone's throw from the nation's largest university of nearly 53,000 students is an Obama campaign office. Team Obama is offering students rides to polling places. Bruce Springsteen even performed at OSU on Sunday to try and drive turnout.</p><p>BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN, SINGER: We're also here four years ago. This time we're winning.</p><p>SNOW: In 2004, Democrat John Kerry lost Ohio to George Bush by a slim margin. Students for Obama say they believe they'll make the difference for Democrats in this state. On the Republican side, no McCain office on campus, just a couple of table setups. The college Republicans here say <person><nameText>Sarah Palin </nameText></person>has lit a fire for them.</p><p>JONATHAN SNYDER, OHIO COLLEGE REPUBLICANS FED.: Anytime you watch anything, it's all about Obama and the youth vote and how he's got it locked down. That's simply not the case.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SNOW: And Wolf, volunteers have spanned this campus today leading up to tonight's deadline to register to vote. And also here in Ohio for the last six days, people have been able to register and vote on the same day. And the campaigns are certainly hoping that will help get young voters to the polls since in the past, they haven't always been reliable showing up on Election Day although they have been eager to register.</p><p>BLITZER: People vote in much bigger percentages the older they get. Let's see if that changes this time around. Mary, thanks very much.</p><p>Ohio, by the way, isn't the only state with a registration deadline. Today the cutoff in at least 16 states plus the District of Columbia. Among them such key battle grounds as Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Florida. Florida has signed up more than half a million voters this year. V has registered more than 300,000. Several other states have deadlines later this week.</p><p>The U.S. Supreme Court begins its new term a month before Election Day.

Lou Dobbs will weigh in on the wall streets nosedive coming up. Stay with us. You're in THE SITUATION ROOM.</p><p>BLITZER: The first Monday in October means the start of a new term for the U.S. Supreme Court. The first Tuesday in November is Election Day. And the court certainly will be on the minds of a lot of voters. Let's go to CNN's justice correspondent Kelli Arena -- Kelli?</p><p>KELLI ARENA, CNN JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT: Wolf, with issues like the economy dominating the campaign, you haven't heard much about the Supreme Court. But don't let that fool you. It's all some voters care about.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ARENA: Make no mistake. The Supreme Court is very much on the ballot.</p><p>WENDY LONG, JUDICIAL CONFIRMATION NETWORK: This is the American citizen's last chance to choose the man who's going to be picking at least probably several justices and shaping the court for most of this century.</p><p>ARENA: From abortion to the war on terror, the court will play a vital role.</p><p>KATHRYN KOLBERT, PRES. PEOPLE FOR THE AMERICAN WAY: I am petrified about what's at stake here.</p><p>ARENA: And activists from both parties are making sure the rest of the electorate knows it.</p><p>MCCAIN: We have not done enough.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: No, senator, McCain have you not. Count on McCain to support judge who's support our rights.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Choosing the right justices is critical to America. We don't know who <person><nameText>Barack Obama </nameText></person>would choose but know this. He chose as one of his financial backers a slumlord now convicted on 16 counts of corruption.</p><p>ARENA: The face of the court could go through some radical changes. Observers speculate 88-year-old justice John Paul Stevens may retire. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg in her late 70s has had health issues. And friends of Justice David Suitor say that he might like to go back to New Hampshire. All three lean left.</p><p>EDWARD LAZARUS, AUTHOR, \"CLOSE CHAMBGERS\": If <person><nameText>Barack Obama </nameText></person>becomes president, it is almost certain that the court will stay roughly the way it is. If Senator McCain were to win the presidency, he would be replacing liberal justices, presumably, with justices far more conservative.</p><p>ARENA: Both candidates have made no secret about the types of justices they'd pick or avoid.</p><p>OBAMA: I would not have nominated Clarence Thomas.</p><p>MCCAIN: Justices Alito and Roberts are two of my most recent favorites, by the way.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ARENA: For now, the court remains tightly divided. Most decisions have come down to a 5-4 vote, which is far too close for true believers from both parties. Wolf?</p><p>BLITZER: Kelli, thanks very much. A critical issue in this election.</p><p>The Supreme Court, by the way, dismissed hundreds of appeals that piled up over the summer before hearing arguments. Today, early indications that the justices might side with big tobacco in a case over deceptive advertising, three Maine residents sued the makers of light and low tar cigarettes as they're called saying the company knew for decades that they're just as dangerous as regular cigarettes. In court today, several justices were skeptical that state laws against fraudulent advertising could be used as grounds for a suit.</p><p>Another high-profile case, the FCC versus Fox TV. The FCC wants tougher penalties against TV stations but network executives argue that it's a violation of free speech.</p><p>And in yet another free speech case, a small religious group wants to build a monument in a public park, the same park where a monument of the Ten Commandments stands. Officials in Grove City, Utah say the proposal monument doesn't fit in.</p><p>The problems on Wall Street have plenty of people afraid and calls are pouring in from investors.

He was on the Tom Joyner radio show today, interviewed by CNN's Roland Martin. Listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>OBAMA: I think the American people deserve better. I think they deserve a last four weeks of talks about the economic crisis, about the 159 jobs that were lost, the 159,000 jobs that were lost just last week, last month. But if John McCain wants to have a character debate, then I'm happy to have that debate because Mr. McCain's record, despite him calling himself a maverick, actually shows that he is continually somebody who relies on lobbyists for big oil and big corporations and that he makes decisions oftentimes based on what these lobbyists tell him to do.</p><p>ROLAND MARTIN, CNN CONTRIBUTOR: The campaign is launching this website, keatingeconomicing.com. Charles Keating was an economics guy out of Arizona. That failure cost American taxpayers $2.3 billion. Doesn't this put you in the position of going negative, taking away your message of running a different kind of campaign?</p><p>OBAMA: Well, look. One of the things we've done throughout this campaign, we don't throw the first punch. But we'll throw the last. Because if the American people don't get the information that's relevant about these candidates and instead in the last four weeks all they're hearing about are smears and swift boat tactics, that can have an impact on the election. We've seen it before. And this election is too important to be sitting on the sidelines. If Senator McCain wants to focus on the issues, then that's what we focus on, but if he wants to have a character debate, that's one that we're willing to have.</p><p>MARTIN: Senator, Senator McCain jumped into this deal, trying to push a deal forward. You stayed more behind the scenes. Is that an example of the contrast in leadership styles whereas you allowed the negotiators to work rather than broker a deal yourself?</p><p>OBAMA: There's no doubt about it. The fact is that, you know, if you are out there trying to politicize the situation, get in front of cameras, take a lot of credit in delicate negotiations in Washington, in the middle of a presidential campaign, then you can be counterproductive. And what we decided was that for me to simply be in constant communications with the secretary of the treasury, to talk to congressional leaders, to let them do their work, to step in where necessary but not be worried about getting the credit on it, that that was going to be the most productive approach.</p><p>(END AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>BLITZER: Senator Obama speaking with Roland Martin earlier today on the Tom Joyner Radio Show.</p><p>That $700 billion bailout didn't stop the stock markets, as you know, from taking another breath-taking plunge today. Lou Dobbs has been watching this together with all of us.</p><p>Lou, give us your analysis. What happened today?</p><p>LOU DOBBS, CNN ANCHOR: Well, what happened today is what we've been seeing happen for some time now. Over the past two weeks, the president of the United States, the speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, Senator Harry Reid, the Senate majority leader, Henry Paulson, have been talking down the American economy, the stock markets, the credit markets. And what would anybody expect to be the result? A sell-off. That's exactly what we've seen.</p><p>It started with the passage of that ignorant bailout. And don't let anybody kid you. That bailout was an absolute atrocity and an insult to the American people, laden with an additional $150 billion in pork just to get it through. While the same people, the same leaders, so-called, were saying it was critically important in the national interest, but they had to add $150 billion. What these markets are saying now is to the United States, to the American people, your leaders don't deserve confidence, don't deserve in any way respect.</p><p>These markets are going to continue to go down until we get an intelligent response to the crisis. That means instead of handing out money to Hank Paulson's buddies on Wall Street, it means that we start dealing with the issue of solvency. If we don't do that, we're going to be in very big trouble.</p><p>BLITZER: Lou is going to have a lot more on this in an hour. We'll see you then, Lou.</p><p>DOBBS: Absolutely</p><p>BLITZER: Thank you.</p><p>And to our veiwers, you're in THE SITUATION ROOM</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

It will.</p><p>REGAN:  All right.  Thank you.  Fingers crossed.</p><p>CAVUTO:  All righty.</p><p>REGAN:  All right.  Thanks, Neil.</p><p>Breaking right now, everyone, another wild day on Wall Street, we're  looking at a Dow that's up, right now, 95 points after being up 400 points  at the open and then it dipped a little down into negative territory, now  we're back up.  Let's see what happened.  It's a wild ride.  We got a live  report from the NYSE straight ahead.</p><p>I am Trish Regan.  Welcome, everyone, to the final edition, dare I say, the  final edition of \"The Intelligence Report.\"</p><p>Also breaking today, an American pastor who has been detained in Turkey for  the last two years is finally coming back home.  President Trump thrilled  with the news, tweeting in all caps, \"Pastor Brunson just released, will be  home soon!\"  We have a live report coming up from the White House straight  ahead.</p><p>And take a look here at this devastating video coming to us from Mexico  Beach, Florida.  The small coastal town decimated by Hurricane Michael.  We  have a live report from Panama City, Florida on the cleanup and relief  efforts.</p><p>But first, we're going to Deirdre Bolton who's on the floor of the NYSE for  more on today's wild ride. What's causing it?</p><p>DEIRDRE BOLTON, FOX BUSINESS ANCHOR:  It's right, Trish, especially  following the previous two days that we've had.  So the big question of  course today is can these gains hold?</p><p>So right now I want to call your attention to the tech stocks.  These had  been the most beaten down in the past of two sessions combined.  They are  what is holding up the gains as we see right now.</p><p>So I'm going to go through some of the names that you know well.  We have  Apple, Amazon, Google and NVIDIA, I should say.  Alphabet Google still down  for the week but very much the strongest mover today.  Of course we pay a  lot of attention because as far as the weighting go in the S&amp;P 500 we know  that tech by market cap is the heaviest, the strongest as far as the  industry groups go.</p><p>Trish, we're also focused on the financials, as you know four banks  reported before the earnings started.  They remain actually the biggest  drag right now on the broader markets.  So interestingly enough, JPMorgan  shares (ph) beat on the top and the bottom line earlier.  This was mover to  the upside that has since changed.</p><p>And it seems as if traders are focused on one key part of the outlook  statement.  I'm going to read it directly.  The non-interest revenue growth  will be between seven percent and eight percent.</p><p>But the thing that is concerning a lot of investors in the stock, and  perhaps even in the broader industry is market dependent.  Meaning, let's  see how our business does outside of the profitable business that we expect  to have by loaning out money as rates go higher.</p><p>As for some of the other financials, PNC is down.  It has actually had a  very rough week.  Wells Fargo and Citi, the other two companies that  reported earnings before the bell, little bit of mixed.  Basically one  beating on revenue, slight miss on earnings, one beating on earnings,  slight miss on revenue, both of those stocks heading marginally higher.</p><p>So, Trish, the push and pull is basically tech versus financials.  Back to  you.</p><p>REGAN:  All right.  Deirdre Bolton, thank you very much.</p><p>Joining me right now onset, our very own Kristina Partsinevelos.  We also  have Kingsview Asset Management Chief Investment Officer, Scott Martin.   Good to see both of you both guys.</p><p>I believe -- do we have Paul Dietrich with us too?  Another investor.  He's  joining -- there we go.  There you -- I knew you're around there, Paul.</p><p>PAUL DIETRICH, FAIRFAX GLOBAL MARKET CEO:  Hi, Trish.</p><p>REGAN:  I'm going to start with you.  Wild market, is this the way of the  future right now or is this just a little blip?</p><p>DIETRICH:  What this is, is, this is a reversion to mean normalizing  correction.  One of the things that's happened over this past, actually  more than a year is that you've had five big tech stocks that have  dominated the performance as of the end of August, they were represented 47  percent of the performance of the S&amp;P 500.  And what we've seen basically,  really for the last month or so, is the tech stocks have been going down  and they're reverting to mean of a more normalized stock market trend.  And  they're very, very high in P.E.s.</p><p>And so, I see this as a very healthy correction in that, you know, the tech  stocks are coming back in line with the rest of the 495 stocks in the S&amp;P  500.</p><p>REGAN:  Kristina?</p><p>KRISTINA PARTSINEVELOS, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT:  I think we can't just  solely focus on tech.  If you look yesterday I was on the New York Stock  Exchange 2:43 p.m., just the intraday volume dropped so much, that we  haven't seen a drop like that in eight years since the \"flash crash.\"  So I  think that based of the traders I was speaking to -- volatility is going to  continue to be an issue.</p><p>We're heading -- earnings started today at JPMorgan.  JPMorgan is supposed  to be good right now.  Their revenue climbed higher, up what, 24 percent  for the quarter, the third quarter.  Sorry, profits up 24 percent.  And yet  you're seeing that stock down today which you would expect it to be better  like Deirdre brought up.  The guidance is concerning.</p><p>So I think going into the earning season, looking into the future, we're  going to be paying close attention to the guidance of a lot of these  companies.</p><p>REGAN:  Well, you know, right now, earning seem, actually Scott, pretty  good, right?  I mean, so far so good.  We've got strong economic  fundamentals.  I do wonder if some people are saying to themselves, wait a  second, you know what?  I can make a little more money on the C.D. at the  local bank because Treasury yields are going up, interest rates are going  up.  And so, is this a bit of a rotation as well and that people now have  more opportunity in the investment landscape?</p><p>SCOTT MARTN, KINGSVIEW ASSET MANAGEMENT CIO:  It could be.  Now, gosh, I  hope that mom and pop sitting at home aren't thinking about that, you know,  two percent or 2.5 percent C.D. just yet, Trish, because I think --</p><p>REGAN:  Well, Scott, you know that I'm using that to characterize something  broader, right?</p><p>MARTIN:  OK.  Sure.</p><p>REGAN:  Which is that investors are saying to themselves, \"OK, I have more  optionality.  It used to be equities are the only game in town.  Well maybe  I can put a little money in fixed income now.\"</p><p>MARTIN:  Fair play, right, exactly.  Maybe the 10-year bond.  And so you're  right.  That's providing an alternative.  And I to the point that k-parts  made was visibility is in question here.</p><p>I get it that earning are good, you know in fact, I think the bar, at least  psychologically based on some of the preannouncements has been lowered, so  that's good.  But the visibility is cloudy.  I mean, you look at the  incident surrounding tariffs.  GDP obviously going forward, it look strong,  but then the job market is kind of maybe leveling off here, I mean, still  growing but not growing at the higher rates that we saw it earlier this  year.</p><p>REGAN:  Yes, but is that enough to cause you to just say, you know, throw  in the towel and go?</p><p>SCOTT:  Well, what it could do though, here's the thing, in highly  psychological market as Paul mentioned, you know, this is a market, Trish,  that could take that as a reason to sell first and ask questions later.   And that's the story of say, certainly yesterday and the day before.</p><p>REGAN:  How does the Fed factor into all of this, Paul?  By the way the  President is not too happy with the Fed right now.  Most presidents don't  really like the Fed.</p><p>DIETRICH:  Yes.  Exactly.  Yes, I mean, --</p><p>REGAN:  Maybe Obama did.  He should have anyway.</p><p>DIETRICH:  -- let's face it.  This is an election year and President Trump  is really promoting the State of the U.S. economy which is really good and  it's firing on all cylinders.  And so when you see a stock market  collection like we've seen over the last few days, you know he has to blame  someone, and so he is blaming the Federal Reserve.</p><p>I think this is normal. This is politics. But --</p><p>SCOTT:  Dangerous.</p><p>DIETRICH:  No, no, no.</p><p>REGAN:  No, by the way, no, it's not dangerous.</p><p>DIETRICH:  Not if it's all rhetoric.</p><p>REGAN:  It's only if the Fed actually listened but, Scott, I'm going to  give Jay Powell a little more credit than that.</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS:  Oh, Jay Powell actually come out in broadcast interview  with NPR Marketplace that he's going to follow through with this.  He said  that he's going to stick to the facts, and what the economy is showing, not  a political play.  And it shouldn't be a political play.</p><p>REGAN:  No, absolutely.</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS:  You have presidents who have been very --</p><p>MARTIN: Reverse the lines.</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS:  -- critical of monetary policy.  But in this case look at  where interest rates are now.  Look at it historically, they've been very,  very low.  The economy is growing.</p><p>Yes, we had inflation coming at 2.3 percent, but we have a very, very tight  labor force.  You have Walgreen saying that they're going to increase their  salaries, Amazon announcing that $15 per hour.  So there's possibly this  inflation fear right now.</p><p>REGAN:  You know we were talking to the gentleman, the founder, Jerry Fine  of Oak Tree Asset Management just the other day, and one thing that he  mentioned was that a lot of the companies he speaks to regularly are  starting to say, places like Walmart for example, you know, inflation is  running a little higher than what you might think.  That wages are growing  faster than 2.8 percent.  And their production costs are increasing.</p><p>And so the Fed needs to take all that into account.  And that, Kristina,  their job is to make sure that, you know, things don't get too overheated,  right?</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS:  Right.</p><p>REGAN:  Because then you get problems down the road.  But it's a tightrope,  the Fed got to walk.</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS:  Which is -- it's very difficult position for Jay Powell to  be in.  But I think also we should preface that there is two different  kinds of inflation.  You also have manmade inflation when you have the  tariffs come into play.</p><p>So the fact that literally 50 percent of all Chinese goods that enter the  United States at this moment are being taxed.  And potentially could be all  100 percent.  That inevitably will have an effect on companies, on us.</p><p>REGAN:  Yes, no, I get you, I hear you.  But Scott, I think that that's  kind of a short-term play.  How are you thinking about China right now?   And you heard me say, if we don't start dealing with this, and the theft of  intellectual property, $600 billion a year, if we don't deal with it now  it's going to be a whole lot harder to deal with it in the future.</p><p>MARTIN:  I agree.  To your question, how is China?  I don't know, look at  their stock market, it's absolutely blasted.</p><p>REGAN:  It's not good.</p><p>MARTIN:  No, not good.</p><p>So, you're right, that probably brings them to the table, because honestly,  Trish, before this tariff talk really heated up, I mean if you go back even  to last year, there were problems under the surface in China, anyway  economically.  So now this is really starting to hurt them.</p><p>Your point with Kristina is good about inflation because if you look at  material cost guides, those are dropping by enlarge around the world.  You  know it's not that hard to produce things anymore.  There's a lot of price  competitiveness other than oil that we've seen bump up recently.</p><p>So, to me the inflation story is all about wages and it's nowhere.</p><p>REGAN:  All right, so Scott, are you buying right now or you're going to  sit by the sidelines and wait?</p><p>MARTIN:  Yes, sit by the fire, and maybe have a cigar and think about it.   But I will be buying probably next week.  I think you got to --</p><p>REGAN:  All right.</p><p>MARTIN:  -- let the psychological kind of walkout here, though.</p><p>REGAN:  You should have bought yesterday.  Paul, your thoughts, final  thoughts.</p><p>MARTIN:  Or maybe this morning.  Right.</p><p>DIETRICH:  The story that nobody is talking about with inflation, because  inflation has been a problem in the past, but -- and we've only seen for  the last 60 years bad inflation where the government spends too much and  then has to print money that causes inflation.  But there's good inflation.   You know when wages are going up, and prices are going up because people  can price in the cost, that creates a virtues circle and government doesn't  have to print money.</p><p>MARTIN:  It's natural.</p><p>REGAN:  Right.  And listen, you don't want to have to fight deflation,  that's whole other can of worms that incredibly --</p><p>MARTIN:  Can't win that fight.</p><p>REGAN:  Yes.  It's good to see you guys.  Thank you, Kristina, Paul, Scott.</p><p>I do want to point out we've got breaking news coming in to us right now.   The President says he will be traveling to Florida and to Georgia early  next week to survey some of the damage that are caused by Hurricane  Michael.  This is the tweet that he just issued.</p><p>He said, \"People have no idea how hard Hurricane Michael has hit the great  state of Georgia.  I will be visiting both Florida and Georgia early next  week.  We are working hard on every area and every state that was hit, we  are with you.\"</p><p>Also breaking today, American Pastor Andrew Bronson is on his way home  after being released by a Turkish court.  So what does that mean for U.S.  and Turkey relations going forward?  I'm going to asking New York  Congressman, Tom Reed, that very question next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>REGAN:  Another roller coaster ride here but at least for now anyway, we're  in positive territory.  You can see we've been all over the place.  Up as  much as 400 in change as we started the day.  And then down, well, now,  still up, barely.</p><p>Meanwhile, we've got some good news out of Turkey today as the American  Pastor Andrew Brunson is now on a plane home after a court ruled he should  be released.  He had been sentenced to more than three years on terrorism  charges despite living in Turkey for more than 20 years.</p><p>President Trump had imposed sanctions, some pretty strict sanctions on  Turkey in an attempt to secure his release.  And he tweeted, \"Pastor  Brunson just released, will be home soon!\"  He is going to feel, I would  imagine feel pretty good about that.</p><p>Edward Lawrence is live at the White House with the latest</p><p>And Edward, fill us in.</p><p>EDWARD LAWRENCE, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT:  Yes.  I can tell you right  now that Pastor Brunson, we understand, is on a plane on his way to  Germany, to an air force base to get medical treatment there just to make  sure that he is OK.  Then White House sources are saying he's going to be  on a plane to Andrews Air Force Base arriving tomorrow at 6:00 a.m.  There  might be some ceremony but he's obviously relieved.  His family, they said  they are just relieved about this news.</p><p>In fact his lawyer says he thanked everyone for their prayers.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JAY SEKULOW, AMERICAN CENTER FOR LAW AND JUSTICE:  Many of you have been  praying for this day.  I want to thank you.  I know the pastor and his  entire family want to thank you as well.  And of course, a huge thank you  to the President and his team for securing the release of Andrew Brunson.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LAWRENCE:  Now a Turkish court actually convicted Pastor Andrew Brunson on  terrorism charges, gave him little more than three years, but then give him  time served and they lifted the travel ban which is the reason he's able to  now leave the country.  He's gotten on a plane as we said.  The White House  saying that there was no deal made with Turkey to make this happen.  So  nothing was on the table.</p><p>Turkey may have been doing this to garner some goodwill.  They are looking  for help with the investigation on the missing columnist that went into the  Saudi consulate in Turkey.</p><p>Now officials in Turkey believe that he was killed inside that consulate,  Jammal Khashoggi.  Now, they say that they have audio and video evidence  that point to that effect.  \"The Wall Street Journal\" reporting that that  evidence has been shown to U.S. intelligence agencies.</p><p>Now, Saudi's officially said that he left even though video shows him going  in but not coming out.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ADAM KINZINGER (R-IL), HOUSE FOREIGN RELATIONS COMMITTEE:  If it's true, it  appears that it is, that he was murdered in their consulate by an  assassination team, there needs to be some significant consequences to  that.  I think that's maybe eventually targeted sanctions on individuals,  that, you know, any other host of things available to this administration.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LAWRENCE:  Now the President saying that even if the Saudi government is  proven to be behind this disappearance, the U.S. may not cancel its arms  deal that it has with Saudi Arabia which includes fighter jets.  The  President saying that does not want to see the jobs go to Russia.</p><p>Now on another note here, the senior White House official telling us that  they are moving in the direction for a meeting between with the Chinese  president, President Xi Jinping, and President Donald Trump next month at  the G20 summit, a bilateral, one-on-one meeting between the two.  China  trying to avoid the 25 percent tariffs that will be bumped up at January  1st.  They are worried about their market and the effects that will happen.</p><p>The Chinese president possibly trying to get the President to back off  those tariffs.  Now, the President would like China to step up and make  some changes, at least move forward towards a trade deal with the U.S.</p><p>Trish?</p><p>REGAN:  Thank you very much, Edward Lawrence.</p><p>All right.  Joining me right now with reaction, we have Republican  Congressman Tom Reed of New York.  Good to have you here, sir.</p><p>Congressman, I'm going to start first on the China front.  Do you think  they might actually be willing to give a little here?  I mean, we are their  biggest customer.</p><p>TOM REED (R), NEW YORK CONGRESSMAN: I think they are --</p><p>REGAN:  Not doing them any favors, right?  This whole sort of \"trade war\"  if you can call it that, it's not helping China?</p><p>REED:  No.  I would agree with that assessment.  This is not sustainable  for China.  They need to come to the table.  And I believe that is exactly  where these talks will lead that they are recognizing.  That it is not in  their interests, nor in America's interest to continue a protracted trade  war.  It's time for us to come together.  It's time for China to be held  accountable for their unfair trade practices.  And I think they are in a  position to have to sit at the table to resolve this.</p><p>REGAN:  You know, Congressman the difference, however is that in China they  don't have to get elected.  I mean you got to get elected every two years,  right?  And consequently if the economy starts to turn and if corporations  starts getting kind of upset including some of, say your donor, sir, that  they can't access the Chinese markets like they used to because of all of  these problems, then at what point does it start to really bite into the  ability of American politicians to really do what's best here where just to  confront the problem?</p><p>REED:  Well I think Trish, if you look at from the other perspective.  You  know, China has -- they're not subject to election, but I will tell you  they have tremendous amount of internal strife.  If their people don't have  an expanding economy to go to work, they can't put food on table, they  can't put a roof over their head.  That causes a tremendous amount of the  stability and instability in China.</p><p>And when you look at what China is doing in regards to a debt to GDP, it's  not sustainable there either.  So China cannot withstand these.  And I  understand the political pressure, but this elephant needs to be  confronted.  And that's what we're doing.</p><p>REGAN:  Why, why is everybody --</p><p>REED:  We're holding them accountable once and for all.</p><p>REGAN:  --kind of ignore it.  I mean for -- why is it that -- I mean we --  and I shouldn't say they ignore it.  Actually I've talked to former  Treasury Secretary Bob Rubin about this and he pointed out that China is  indeed a big, big problem.  And he tried to address it during the Clinton  years.  But everybody has tried, right?</p><p>Tim Geithner, I remember trying to take this one and spend time in China  trying to deal with this.  The theft of intellectual property is a real  problem for us.  And yet, no one was quite as vocal about it shall we say  as this President.  Is it because they feared to this talk of a trade war?   Do they fear a backlash from American CEOs that would say, \"No, no, we need  to be over there, we want to be over there, it's a big market for us?\"</p><p>REED:  I think that pressure was there.  But now obviously under this  administration and with our President, we're seeing a disruptive policy put  on the table.  And China can't take the risk of not having America follow  the status quo, the traditional path if you would.  And so what I believe  is happening is they're recognizing that President Trump is serious.  And  that he is serious about holding them accountable for these unfair trade  practices.  And now is the time you're seeing results in China's movement,  in their policy shifts to come to the table to recognize they have to  resolve these issues.</p><p>REGAN:  Real quick, before I let you go.  It's very good news that the  Pastor has been released . Does this show you that sanctions can actually  work, Congressman?</p><p>REED:  Absolutely, and you can get results through strength.  And that's  what the administration sent to Turkey.  Is what it said to Turkey is we  are not going to allow an American citizen to be held captive.  And now we  should all celebrate as Americans, as Democrats and Republicans that Pastor  Brunson is coming home and coming home to his family.  That is a joint  celebration every American should be proud of.</p><p>REGAN:  Here, here, I agree.  Thank you so much.  Congressman Reed, good to  see you.</p><p>REED:  Thanks.</p><p>REGAN:  All right, we're going to be following these markets again  throughout the hour as we watch Dow that's up 52 points right now, 25,101  is the level.  Stay with us.</p><p>Residents, meanwhile in the Florida Panhandle, they are coming to terms  with the utter destruction that Hurricane Michael had left behind.  We have  a live report on cleanup and relief efforts coming up next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>REGAN:  Very sad scene in Florida right now.  In fact, everywhere you look  in the Florida Panhandle, what you see is utter devastation.  You have  beach front homes have been completely obliterated.  Only slabs of concrete  remaining, entire communities actually destroyed when category 4 Hurricane  Michael roared ashore this week.  This destruction is being called  catastrophic.</p><p>Billions of dollars will be needed to rebuild.  And now 13 deaths are being  blamed on the most powerful hurricane to hit the U.S. mainland in a  generation.</p><p>And Michael is not done yet.  Causing flash flooding, heavy rains as far  away as Virginia.  Connell McShane is joining me right now on the phone  from one of the hardest hit areas, Panama City, Florida.</p><p>Hey, Connell.</p><p>CONNELL MCSHANE, FOX BUSINESS NEWS ANCHOR (via telephone):  Hi there Trish.</p><p>We're just east of Panama City right now.  We've been moving around a lot  today as much as we can.  And we've been encountering some of the same  difficulties as the people here are in trying to recover from Hurricane  Michael and as the first-responders are been trying to help those people so  badly hurt by this hurricane.</p><p>Let me start in Mexico Beach where we spent part of our afternoon and  evening yesterday before the curfew went into place.  Well I'm sure you've  seen what we'll be able to show now some of the video of Mexico Beach that  we and our other Fox colleagues were able to shoot particularly some of the  aerial shots where you can see just how Hurricane Michael caused so much  destruction.  And that's the word, not damage, it's destruction.</p><p>There were homes that were buried a day before the hurricane which just  aren't there anymore.  It's not as if they were damaged.  They were  completely wiped out.  I was speaking to some of the National Guard troops  who are assigned to Mexico Beach, one in particular told me he's from this  area, has worked a number of hurricanes and never seen anything even close  to this bad.</p><p>Now when you get back to the area you mentioned, Panama City where we were  earlier in the day, there are parts of it in particular in Panama City  Beach are starting to recover.  Even some power that's starting to come  back.  But those few and far between as of this morning, 90 percent of that  town in Bay County was still without power.</p><p>We move to the east where we are.  Then you encounter the communication  difficulties that are really making things doubly difficult for everybody  trying to respond to this hurricane.  And that's why I'm speaking to you  now on this side of the road on a satellite phone because in an area where  the cell phone service was perfect yesterday it no longer works at all  today.  So that's one of the things the companies no doubt are trying to  get in here and get their towers back up and running.  But it depends on  which service provider you have.  For example, many of us have AT&amp;T and  that was working in some areas beautifully.</p><p>Many of the people who live here do not have Verizon or Sprint or what have  you and they weren't working at all.  So, it depends where you are, what  service provider you have.  And people are having difficult even telling  someone that they're having trouble.</p><p>And, you know, we're running to a lady earlier for example, we've been able  to ride out the storm.  She's OK.  The tree that came down, a giant oak  tree fell into the street, thank goodness, not into her house but she was  having difficulty telling her family she was OK.</p><p>Finally, she was able to walk up of a block and randomly Facebook Messenger  it came on her phone even though it didn't seem that she has service  she  leave (ph) to give a quick message t some of her family members.  So that's  the kind of thing that it making hard to recover from this hurricane.  The  idea that communicating is so difficult.</p><p>I will say Trish, the transportation has improved a little.  It's all  relative but some of the road there were completely closed yesterday are  now starting to reopen.  Thanks for the hard work of some of the  professionals and also some of the volunteers, neighbors helping neighbors  pack with their saws and chainsaws and whatever (ph) to be able to cutdown  some of tress and open the roads up.</p><p>So FEMA and the other authorities can get in.  But that's a long way to go,  Trish.  It really is something else.</p><p>REGAN:  Wow, quite an aftermath.  Connell, thank you very much.</p><p>All right.  Roller coaster here on the market up 81 right now.  We've been  up as much as 400 then we were down.  So, where we're headed right now?   It's a Friday.  So investors are going into the weekend and of course, you  know, a lot of this is gone to center around what happened come midterm  elections, right?  Because economic policy is going to be influenced by  whoever is in office.  Our panel is going to debate all that next</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>REGAN:  All right.  We're watching what has become a very volatile market  this week.  A couple rough days we had but today is looking a little  better.</p><p>We're up 50 -- nearly 50 points.  We had been trading up as much as 414  though.  So, so much for that, but at least we're out of negative  territory.  The big question is, what are these markets really mean for  Republicans come the midterms?</p><p>Joining me right now, James Freeman of \"The Wall Street Journal\" and Former  Advisor to Bill Clinton, Doug Schoen.  Good to see you both.</p><p>DOUG SCHOEN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Good to see you.</p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, \"THE WALL STREET JOURNAL\":  Good to be here, Trish, thanks.</p><p>REGAN:  Doug, I'm going to start with you.  I mean people been feeling  pretty good about the economy.  I'd tell you all the economic data points  do some very, very strong fundamentals.  But, you know, when people open up  their 401k's and they see that maybe it wasn't as good as it was last  month, what kind of effect does that have on psychology for voters?</p><p>SCHOEN:  You know, Trish, at this point, not to duck the question, it's  hard to tell.  Because usually these things take a little bit longer to  play out than what you're describing which is, you know, the beginning of  November, they get their 401k's.  They're down and so they get less  inclined to vote Republican.</p><p>Usually takes three to six months for the impact of a brief downturn and it  has been brief and has been swift to be felt.  So, as we sit here today  can't say really anything.  The polling shows if anything the Republicans  up in the last week or so, certainly in the Senate races.</p><p>REGAN:  James, I personally, and I said this earlier in the show.  I think  is a blip.  I mean, I think there are very, very good fundamentals right  now.</p><p>I think, you know, the China thing yes, it's a little bit of a threat but  we'll make it through all of that.  And as long as we continue to see wage  growth and job growth.  We're heading in the right direction and economic  growth.  But you know, nonetheless, if you have a market that's trading  lower, I don't necessarily think it will in November.  But if it were to-- </p><p>FREEMAN:    Yes.</p><p>REGAN:  -- how does that influence in your view Republican voters?</p><p>FREEMAN:  Well, I think the economy is a win for Republicans barring some  huge, sort of catastrophic event.  As you said the fundamentals are very  strong.  We just really got another reminder that this morning with the  bank earnings</p><p>These are companies that get a pretty good window into the U.S. consumer.   People paying bills on time.  They're obviously able to find jobs.   Earnings are good for the companies, the economy is growing.  So I think  that's all good and that would suggest this is a blip.</p><p>The sort of conventional wisdom is maybe the economy is so good since there  are almost no economic problems.  People kind of take that for granted and  maybe they decide on other things.</p><p>REGAN:  And that's was so hard, right, in midterms?</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.</p><p>REGAN:  I mean, you have to motivate --</p><p>FREEMAN:  Right.</p><p>REGAN:  -- voters get out there.  And if they're feeling kind a OK, then,  Doug, you run the risk of complacency.  I do think Kavanaugh changed that,  however.  If there was any complacency among the Republican base, watching  what happened with Judge Kavanaugh may have them thinking differently?</p><p>SCHOEN:  Well, certainly that's the initial indication but we've got you  know, some 20 something days to go until the election.  And, whether there  are twists and turns in terms of enthusiasm and attitudes, really remains  to be seen.</p><p>A bunch of the most recent midterms have swung in the last week to 10 days.   So I think it's not clear what's going to happen but I think James is  right.  If you look at all the indicators and certainly, Trish, you as  well, it's more -- much more good news economically for the Republicans,  notwithstanding that midterms typically go for the out party, the  opposition.</p><p>REGAN:  Yes.  So, is all this at risk, James?  I mean, if the Republicans  are not successful in midterms?  Because you know, we've heard many  Democrats say they like to reverse the tax cut and they like to tax the  wealthy?</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.</p><p>REGAN:  And tax everyone else along the way, including corporations et  cetera.  So, is some of this policy really at risk?</p><p>FREEMAN:  Well, I think you have to say this at risk because depending on  how big -- let's just imagine a big Democratic wave, if president Trump  then feels the need to negotiate to do deals, to strike the \"art of the  deal\" with Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer, that could be a very different  policy mix.  It's -- obviously if you look at most of his history Donald  Trump was not a super conservative guy.  Does he evolve back if he is  dealing with Congressional leadership with big democratic majorities?  So  that would be a question.</p><p>REGAN:  Hey, Doug, can I just ask?</p><p>SCHOEN:  Yes.</p><p>REGAN:  Looking ahead to 2020, do you think Mike Bloomberg is going to be  in the ring?</p><p>SCHOEN:  You know, I don't think he's made a final decision.  Certainly  made it clear the other day that he was going to do everything he could to  stand up to policies that the Trump administration is pursued, that he  disagrees with.  He is spending obviously close to $100 million on the  midterm elections.  So whatever the mayor or the former mayor does, he will  be a force to be reckoned with.  That's for sure.</p><p>REGAN:  And he's never registered as a Democrat.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Well, you know, if he likes to have --</p><p>SCHOEN:  He is now.</p><p>FREEMAN:  -- pro-business Democrats again.  This -- for this reason I kind  of doubt whether he can go anywhere.</p><p>REGAN:  Yes.</p><p>FREEMAN:  But it would be nice to see a kind of a market-oriented voice  back in that party.</p><p>REGAN:  Yes.  It would be the alternative which is the Alexandria Cortez  and the Bernie Sanders camp.</p><p>FREEMAN:  A 100 percent.</p><p>REGAN:  We don't need the socialist there.  Anyway, good, red-blooded  American capitalism and that's what the nation was founded on.  Doug,  James, good to see you guys.  Thank you so much.</p><p>SCHOEN:  Thank you so much, Trish.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Thanks.</p><p>REGAN:  All right 29 million Facebook users have had their information  stolen in the massive security breach that happened there last month.   Facebook says the information included everything from names and contact  information to more personal profile information like places that people  checked into and the devices used to access Facebook.</p><p>Facebook said users can check if they were affected by the attack, visiting  Facebook's Online Help Center.</p><p>Tesla is giving its customers until Monday to place car orders eligible for  a $7500 federal tax credit.  Under federal law, the full tax credit lasts  until the car company reaches 200,000 sales in 2010 which it definitely did  in July.  You know, any vehicles ordered by Monday are expected to be  delivered by the end of the year.</p><p>President Trump sparking outraged and an outcry after slamming the Fed for  being too aggressive, t does he have a point?  Is the Fed getting a little  too happy about these rate hikes?  Our panel is going to weigh in on all  that, I'll see you here next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  We have interest rates  going up at a clip that's much faster than certainly a lot of people  including myself would have anticipated.  I think the Fed is out of  control.  I think what they're doing is wrong.  I think the Fed is far too  stringent and they're making a mistake.</p><p>They're so tight.  I think the Fed has gone crazy.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REGAN:  Tell us how you really feel.  That was President Trump blasting the  Fed for being too aggressive on interests rate hike.  President Trump's  very forward and obvious frustration with the Fed, well not doing so well  with some folks but the head of JPMorgan Chase, Mr. Jamie Dimon is  defending the President saying, and I, \"I have never seen a President who  wanted interest rates to go up.\"  I think he's right on that one.  Who  would?</p><p>Joining me right now, the host of \"Making Money\" on the Fox Business  network, Charles Payne, soon to be host of \"Making Money\" at 2:00 p.m.,  more on that in just a minute.  Also Moody's Chief Economist, John Lonski.</p><p>John, yes, I don't blame him.  Who the heck wants the cost of money to go  up?</p><p>JOHN LONSKI, MOODY'S CHIEF ECONOMIST:  You've got to be more diplomatic  about your criticism of the Fed.  You can't go out there because, say that  they're lunatics or whatever he was saying.  Jerome Powell is not crazy.</p><p>REGAN:  You know what though, I know a lot of people are saying that.  But,  you know, this is a President who has a different style entirely, right.   You know, he says what he thinks.  And I'm sure there are plenty of  Presidents that thought the Fed was doing a lousy job and acting crazy, but  maybe they just never said it quite so explicitly.</p><p>LONSKI:  That's right.  And, you know, the fed has to keep an eye on  financial markets.  We now have the, you know, the overall market has sold  off sharply thus far in the month of October.  It's clearly higher.  We  have certain segments, interest sensitive segments of the market.  For  instance, that index of housing, sectors stock prices this afternoon is  down 25 percent for the year-to-date.  That's versus the overall market up  by two percent.</p><p>And moreover, motor vehicle industry stock prices.  So they're median  decline for the year-to-date is roughly 23 percent.  That's not good.  And  I think that's telling the Fed that perhaps there is reason to proceed with  greater caution, not only when they hike rates --</p><p>REGAN:  I see where it run.</p><p>LONSKI:  -- but when they talk about rate hikes.</p><p>REGAN:  IE, John Lonski agrees with President Trump.  You don't want to see  the Fed, maybe they're not crazy --</p><p>LONSKI:  But with Jerome Powell is very intelligent, very wise man.</p><p>REGAN:  Wow.</p><p>LONSKI:  And I'm pretty sure that they're doing the best job possible.</p><p>REGAN:  I'm pretty sure that even though he's the President of the United  States, Charles Payne, the head of the Federal Reserve needs to be  independent.  And I would expect him to be independent.  So he may hear a  little of the chatter and a little of the noise, but really it comes down  to the data, shouldn't it?</p><p>CHARLES PAYNE, FOX BUSINESS ANCHOR:  It should come down to the data and  the Fed has said over and over that it does.  And I got to tell you the  official communiques that they put out like the so-called dot plot in the  FOMC, you know, communique.  They suggest a very level-headed Fed that's  not going to wreck the economy, but it's the comments that are made in his  speech because almost every single day someone at the Fed is giving a  speech somewhere around the world.</p><p>And I tell you, starting to roll markets in.  And you know, there shouldn't  be any sacred cows out there politi -- specifically on a political side.   And why should the Fed be completely independent in the sense that it's  unanswerable to anyone?  It's not federal.  It doesn't matter.  It's sort  of scary for the average person out there.</p><p>REGAN:  Yes.</p><p>PAYNE:  John just talking about housing being under pressure, autos being  under pressure, that we're talking about the average American house hold.   If the Fed is worried about, you know, the larger institutions, you know.</p><p>And then as far as President Trump's criticism, we went from 2008, 2014  with zero rate hikes.  And this one in 2015, Janet Yellen figures she made  a mistake, and she waited until after the election and she raised rates  again.  So, I can see --</p><p>REGAN:  So you feel that many feels like, hey, that's fair.</p><p>PAYNES:  Right.</p><p>REGAN:  What were you doing for President Obama?  And, you know, maybe send  a little of that my way.</p><p>But here's the difference, John Lonski, in this environment right now we  have a President who does understand the economy and understands that, you  know, you want to unleash those spirits, those economic spirits, what do  you, you lower taxes, you lessen regulation.  That has translated into  growth.  We didn't get that from the Obama administration.  So the Fed was  only game in town.</p><p>LONSKI:  And the President understands commercial real estate very well.   And he must be getting some information that things are beginning to soften  in a once very strong sector because of higher short-term interest rates  and long-term interest rates.</p><p>And let's not forget, this has to be brought up, but for the first time in  memory, perhaps history, we have the Fed firming monetary policy on two  fronts.  Not only are they hiking Fed funds and pushing short-term rates  directly higher but they're passive reduction regarding their holdings of  U.S. Treasury bonds is also putting some upward pressure on long-term  interest rates.</p><p>So again, the Fed's got --</p><p>REGAN:  OK.</p><p>LONSKI:  -- to proceed very carefully.</p><p>REGAN:  But very cautiously.</p><p>LONSKI:  Yes.</p><p>REGAN:  I mean, this is the delicate dance, right, that they're always  walking.  I mean, in the meantime, there are some legitimate or growing  concerns I should say, Charles Payne, about inflation.</p><p>PAYNE:  Yes.  There are, there are, although, you know, this week what we  saw inflation in the PPI number, airline travel went through the roof.  You  know no wonder delta had a pretty good earnings report.  But then we got  the CPI report yesterday, it was relatively benign.</p><p>And so, there are signs of inflation that's the kind of classical inflation  signals that you would think that the Fed would be, you know, yellow flags  or red flags.  Although, we know they want to be ahead of the curve.   There's just --</p><p>REGAN:  Improve it (ph).  They need to forget being as -- they're usually  behind anyway.</p><p>PAYNE:  Yes.  Yes.</p><p>LONSKI:  Today we can have report on import price inflation.  Less than one  percent for consumer goods, less than one percent for all imports excluding  petroleum imports.</p><p>REGAN:  All right.  Well, here's the one --</p><p>LONSKI:  That's not a sign of inflation taking off.</p><p>REGAN:  If there's not enough and there's not enough wage growth, you know,  maybe --</p><p>LONSKI:  What's the hurry?  What's -- there's no sense of urgency for rate  hikes, that's it.</p><p>REGAN:  All right.  You and President Trump.</p><p>LONSKI:  But Jerome Powell --</p><p>REGAN:  Its given Jay Powell appear to your mind.</p><p>LONSKI:  -- level at no.  Yes.</p><p>REGAN:  All right.  Good to -- hey, Charles, I'm really excited for you.</p><p>PAYNE:  Thank you.</p><p>REGAN:  This is a great audience, you know --</p><p>PAYNE:  Thank you.</p><p>REGAN:  -- here at 2:00 p.m.  And you're all going to see Charles beginning  Monday, that's this Monday, 2:00 p.m. October 15th, \"Making Money with  Charles Payne,\" moves to 2:00, and well, I'm moving somewhere else.  I'll  tell you all about that next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>REGAN:  All right.  It's my last day on \"The Intelligence Report\".  So this  market better close up, right?  We're up at 128 points.  Let's hope it  holds throughout the hour.</p><p>Big news?  I shared this a little while ago with you.  I'll tell you again  all about it.  I'm going to primetime, 8:00 p.m., starting Monday right  after my good friend Lou, Lou Dobbs is on from 7:00 to 8:00.  I will be on  from 8:00 to 9:00.  Kennedy will follow at 9:00.  We are live at night  right here on Fox Business.</p><p>I'm really excited about it.  I, you know, I do want to point out just what  an incredible three years it has been on this show.  I mean, we created  this show with you, really.  With you.  You tuned in and it's thanks to you  that we're able to cream the competition for the last three years,  something I'm really extremely proud of.</p><p>And it's thanks to you and it's thanks to this news cycle that, you know,  we're expanding.  We're expanding so we will be live, I will be live at  8:00 p.m. every night.  The news keeps happening.  It's a 24/7 news cycle.</p><p>We're on the front lines of history and I'm there with you, reporting on  all of it.  We analyze, we present both sides, you make the decisions about  what is best for you, your family, and your wallet, right?</p><p>I want to thank -- I have an amazing team.  I want to thank everybody on  this team.  So many of you in the control room right now have been with me  from the very beginning, from the first day I was ever in this chair on  this little set that we created, and it's been wonderful.</p><p>I've gotten to know all of you and your families and you've certainly  gotten to know mine, including all three of the kids which love to come by  and hang out at work and in the studio.  So I'm going to miss all of you.   Some of you are coming with me, of course, and I'm so excited for this new  chapter and what we can do and what we can accomplish.</p><p>We have so many tremendous journalists here at Fox Business and we are in a  tremendous news cycle.  So this is the value add that we bring.</p><p>It's going to be a little different at home, so my husband and I had to get  a little creative on this front because we used to have family dinner at  6:00 p.m. every night.  Now it's going to be family breakfast at 6:30, when  I take the kids to school.</p><p>And then it's following the news cycle for you.  I'm looking forward to it.   I'm going to see you Monday night.</p><p>Gosh, I hope this market ends up, Liz Claman, 137 points.  We got to hang  on to this one.</p><p>LIZ CLAMAN, FOX BUSINESS ANCHOR:  Yes.  Yes.  Let's give you a green good- bye.  Trish, another live --</p><p>REGAN:  Thank you.</p><p>CLAMAN:  -- presence in primetime on Fox Business.</p><p>REGAN:  Charles is going to be --</p><p>CLAMAN:  Go.  Go.  Go.</p><p>REGAN:  -- right here at 2:00 p.m.</p><p>CLAMAN:  Yes.  And we will welcome Charles and we wish you the best of  luck, Trish.</p><p>REGAN:  Thank you Liz.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC.

It's the way it is.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">REGAN:  Again, the market has to close up, right?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">CAVUTO:  It's got to.</p><p>REGAN:  It's my last day here at 2:00 o'clock.</p><p>CAVUTO:  It will.  It will.</p><p>REGAN:  All right.  Thank you.  Fingers crossed.</p><p>CAVUTO:  All righty.</p><p>REGAN:  All right.  Thanks, Neil.</p><p>Breaking right now, everyone, another wild day on Wall Street, we're  looking at a Dow that's up, right now, 95 points after being up 400 points  at the open and then it dipped a little down into negative territory, now  we're back up.  Let's see what happened.  It's a wild ride.  We got a live  report from the NYSE straight ahead.</p><p>I am Trish Regan.  Welcome, everyone, to the final edition, dare I say, the  final edition of \"The Intelligence Report.\"</p><p>Also breaking today, an American pastor who has been detained in Turkey for  the last two years is finally coming back home.  President Trump thrilled  with the news, tweeting in all caps, \"Pastor Brunson just released, will be  home soon!\"  We have a live report coming up from the White House straight  ahead.</p><p>And take a look here at this devastating video coming to us from Mexico  Beach, Florida.  The small coastal town decimated by Hurricane Michael.  We  have a live report from Panama City, Florida on the cleanup and relief  efforts.</p><p>But first, we're going to Deirdre Bolton who's on the floor of the NYSE for  more on today's wild ride. What's causing it?</p><p>DEIRDRE BOLTON, FOX BUSINESS ANCHOR:  It's right, Trish, especially  following the previous two days that we've had.  So the big question of  course today is can these gains hold?</p><p>So right now I want to call your attention to the tech stocks.  These had  been the most beaten down in the past of two sessions combined.  They are  what is holding up the gains as we see right now.</p><p>So I'm going to go through some of the names that you know well.  We have  Apple, Amazon, Google and NVIDIA, I should say.  Alphabet Google still down  for the week but very much the strongest mover today.  Of course we pay a  lot of attention because as far as the weighting go in the S&amp;P 500 we know  that tech by market cap is the heaviest, the strongest as far as the  industry groups go.</p><p>Trish, we're also focused on the financials, as you know four banks  reported before the earnings started.  They remain actually the biggest  drag right now on the broader markets.  So interestingly enough, JPMorgan  shares (ph) beat on the top and the bottom line earlier.  This was mover to  the upside that has since changed.</p><p>And it seems as if traders are focused on one key part of the outlook  statement.  I'm going to read it directly.  The non-interest revenue growth  will be between seven percent and eight percent.</p><p>But the thing that is concerning a lot of investors in the stock, and  perhaps even in the broader industry is market dependent.  Meaning, let's  see how our business does outside of the profitable business that we expect  to have by loaning out money as rates go higher.</p><p>As for some of the other financials, PNC is down.  It has actually had a  very rough week.  Wells Fargo and Citi, the other two companies that  reported earnings before the bell, little bit of mixed.  Basically one  beating on revenue, slight miss on earnings, one beating on earnings,  slight miss on revenue, both of those stocks heading marginally higher.</p><p>So, Trish, the push and pull is basically tech versus financials.  Back to  you.</p><p>REGAN:  All right.  Deirdre Bolton, thank you very much.</p><p>Joining me right now onset, our very own Kristina Partsinevelos.  We also  have Kingsview Asset Management Chief Investment Officer, Scott Martin.   Good to see both of you both guys.</p><p>I believe -- do we have Paul Dietrich with us too?  Another investor.  He's  joining -- there we go.  There you -- I knew you're around there, Paul.</p><p>PAUL DIETRICH, FAIRFAX GLOBAL MARKET CEO:  Hi, Trish.</p><p>REGAN:  I'm going to start with you.  Wild market, is this the way of the  future right now or is this just a little blip?</p><p>DIETRICH:  What this is, is, this is a reversion to mean normalizing  correction.  One of the things that's happened over this past, actually  more than a year is that you've had five big tech stocks that have  dominated the performance as of the end of August, they were represented 47  percent of the performance of the S&amp;P 500.  And what we've seen basically,  really for the last month or so, is the tech stocks have been going down  and they're reverting to mean of a more normalized stock market trend.  And  they're very, very high in P.E.s.</p><p>And so, I see this as a very healthy correction in that, you know, the tech  stocks are coming back in line with the rest of the 495 stocks in the S&amp;P  500.</p><p>REGAN:  Kristina?</p><p>KRISTINA PARTSINEVELOS, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT:  I think we can't just  solely focus on tech.  If you look yesterday I was on the New York Stock  Exchange 2:43 p.m., just the intraday volume dropped so much, that we  haven't seen a drop like that in eight years since the \"flash crash.\"  So I  think that based of the traders I was speaking to -- volatility is going to  continue to be an issue.</p><p>We're heading -- earnings started today at JPMorgan.  JPMorgan is supposed  to be good right now.  Their revenue climbed higher, up what, 24 percent  for the quarter, the third quarter.  Sorry, profits up 24 percent.  And yet  you're seeing that stock down today which you would expect it to be better  like Deirdre brought up.  The guidance is concerning.</p><p>So I think going into the earning season, looking into the future, we're  going to be paying close attention to the guidance of a lot of these  companies.</p><p>REGAN:  Well, you know, right now, earning seem, actually Scott, pretty  good, right?  I mean, so far so good.  We've got strong economic  fundamentals.  I do wonder if some people are saying to themselves, wait a  second, you know what?  I can make a little more money on the C.D. at the  local bank because Treasury yields are going up, interest rates are going  up.  And so, is this a bit of a rotation as well and that people now have  more opportunity in the investment landscape?</p><p>SCOTT MARTN, KINGSVIEW ASSET MANAGEMENT CIO:  It could be.  Now, gosh, I  hope that mom and pop sitting at home aren't thinking about that, you know,  two percent or 2.5 percent C.D. just yet, Trish, because I think --</p><p>REGAN:  Well, Scott, you know that I'm using that to characterize something  broader, right?</p><p>MARTIN:  OK.  Sure.</p><p>REGAN:  Which is that investors are saying to themselves, \"OK, I have more  optionality.  It used to be equities are the only game in town.  Well maybe  I can put a little money in fixed income now.\"</p><p>MARTIN:  Fair play, right, exactly.  Maybe the 10-year bond.  And so you're  right.  That's providing an alternative.  And I to the point that k-parts  made was visibility is in question here.</p><p>I get it that earning are good, you know in fact, I think the bar, at least  psychologically based on some of the preannouncements has been lowered, so  that's good.  But the visibility is cloudy.  I mean, you look at the  incident surrounding tariffs.  GDP obviously going forward, it look strong,  but then the job market is kind of maybe leveling off here, I mean, still  growing but not growing at the higher rates that we saw it earlier this  year.</p><p>REGAN:  Yes, but is that enough to cause you to just say, you know, throw  in the towel and go?</p><p>SCOTT:  Well, what it could do though, here's the thing, in highly  psychological market as Paul mentioned, you know, this is a market, Trish,  that could take that as a reason to sell first and ask questions later.   And that's the story of say, certainly yesterday and the day before.</p><p>REGAN:  How does the Fed factor into all of this, Paul?  By the way the  President is not too happy with the Fed right now.  Most presidents don't  really like the Fed.</p><p>DIETRICH:  Yes.  Exactly.  Yes, I mean, --</p><p>REGAN:  Maybe Obama did.  He should have anyway.</p><p>DIETRICH:  -- let's face it.  This is an election year and President Trump  is really promoting the State of the U.S. economy which is really good and  it's firing on all cylinders.  And so when you see a stock market  collection like we've seen over the last few days, you know he has to blame  someone, and so he is blaming the Federal Reserve.</p><p>I think this is normal. This is politics. But --</p><p>SCOTT:  Dangerous.</p><p>DIETRICH:  No, no, no.</p><p>REGAN:  No, by the way, no, it's not dangerous.</p><p>DIETRICH:  Not if it's all rhetoric.</p><p>REGAN:  It's only if the Fed actually listened but, Scott, I'm going to  give Jay Powell a little more credit than that.</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS:  Oh, Jay Powell actually come out in broadcast interview  with NPR Marketplace that he's going to follow through with this.  He said  that he's going to stick to the facts, and what the economy is showing, not  a political play.  And it shouldn't be a political play.</p><p>REGAN:  No, absolutely.</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS:  You have presidents who have been very --</p><p>MARTIN: Reverse the lines.</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS:  -- critical of monetary policy.  But in this case look at  where interest rates are now.  Look at it historically, they've been very,  very low.  The economy is growing.</p><p>Yes, we had inflation coming at 2.3 percent, but we have a very, very tight  labor force.  You have Walgreen saying that they're going to increase their  salaries, Amazon announcing that $15 per hour.  So there's possibly this  inflation fear right now.</p><p>REGAN:  You know we were talking to the gentleman, the founder, Jerry Fine  of Oak Tree Asset Management just the other day, and one thing that he  mentioned was that a lot of the companies he speaks to regularly are  starting to say, places like Walmart for example, you know, inflation is  running a little higher than what you might think.  That wages are growing  faster than 2.8 percent.  And their production costs are increasing.</p><p>And so the Fed needs to take all that into account.  And that, Kristina,  their job is to make sure that, you know, things don't get too overheated,  right?</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS:  Right.</p><p>REGAN:  Because then you get problems down the road.  But it's a tightrope,  the Fed got to walk.</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS:  Which is -- it's very difficult position for Jay Powell to  be in.  But I think also we should preface that there is two different  kinds of inflation.  You also have manmade inflation when you have the  tariffs come into play.</p><p>So the fact that literally 50 percent of all Chinese goods that enter the  United States at this moment are being taxed.  And potentially could be all  100 percent.  That inevitably will have an effect on companies, on us.</p><p>REGAN:  Yes, no, I get you, I hear you.  But Scott, I think that that's  kind of a short-term play.  How are you thinking about China right now?   And you heard me say, if we don't start dealing with this, and the theft of  intellectual property, $600 billion a year, if we don't deal with it now  it's going to be a whole lot harder to deal with it in the future.</p><p>MARTIN:  I agree.  To your question, how is China?  I don't know, look at  their stock market, it's absolutely blasted.</p><p>REGAN:  It's not good.</p><p>MARTIN:  No, not good.</p><p>So, you're right, that probably brings them to the table, because honestly,  Trish, before this tariff talk really heated up, I mean if you go back even  to last year, there were problems under the surface in China, anyway  economically.  So now this is really starting to hurt them.</p><p>Your point with Kristina is good about inflation because if you look at  material cost guides, those are dropping by enlarge around the world.  You  know it's not that hard to produce things anymore.  There's a lot of price  competitiveness other than oil that we've seen bump up recently.</p><p>So, to me the inflation story is all about wages and it's nowhere.</p><p>REGAN:  All right, so Scott, are you buying right now or you're going to  sit by the sidelines and wait?</p><p>MARTIN:  Yes, sit by the fire, and maybe have a cigar and think about it.   But I will be buying probably next week.  I think you got to --</p><p>REGAN:  All right.</p><p>MARTIN:  -- let the psychological kind of walkout here, though.</p><p>REGAN:  You should have bought yesterday.  Paul, your thoughts, final  thoughts.</p><p>MARTIN:  Or maybe this morning.  Right.</p><p>DIETRICH:  The story that nobody is talking about with inflation, because  inflation has been a problem in the past, but -- and we've only seen for  the last 60 years bad inflation where the government spends too much and  then has to print money that causes inflation.  But there's good inflation.   You know when wages are going up, and prices are going up because people  can price in the cost, that creates a virtues circle and government doesn't  have to print money.</p><p>MARTIN:  It's natural.</p><p>REGAN:  Right.  And listen, you don't want to have to fight deflation,  that's whole other can of worms that incredibly --</p><p>MARTIN:  Can't win that fight.</p><p>REGAN:  Yes.  It's good to see you guys.  Thank you, Kristina, Paul, Scott.</p><p>I do want to point out we've got breaking news coming in to us right now.   The President says he will be traveling to Florida and to Georgia early  next week to survey some of the damage that are caused by Hurricane  Michael.  This is the tweet that he just issued.</p><p>He said, \"People have no idea how hard Hurricane Michael has hit the great  state of Georgia.  I will be visiting both Florida and Georgia early next  week.  We are working hard on every area and every state that was hit, we  are with you.\"</p><p>Also breaking today, American Pastor Andrew Bronson is on his way home  after being released by a Turkish court.  So what does that mean for U.S.  and Turkey relations going forward?  I'm going to asking New York  Congressman, Tom Reed, that very question next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>REGAN:  Another roller coaster ride here but at least for now anyway, we're  in positive territory.  You can see we've been all over the place.  Up as  much as 400 in change as we started the day.  And then down, well, now,  still up, barely.</p><p>Meanwhile, we've got some good news out of Turkey today as the American  Pastor Andrew Brunson is now on a plane home after a court ruled he should  be released.  He had been sentenced to more than three years on terrorism  charges despite living in Turkey for more than 20 years.</p><p>President Trump had imposed sanctions, some pretty strict sanctions on  Turkey in an attempt to secure his release.  And he tweeted, \"Pastor  Brunson just released, will be home soon!\"  He is going to feel, I would  imagine feel pretty good about that.</p><p>Edward Lawrence is live at the White House with the latest</p><p>And Edward, fill us in.</p><p>EDWARD LAWRENCE, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT:  Yes.  I can tell you right  now that Pastor Brunson, we understand, is on a plane on his way to  Germany, to an air force base to get medical treatment there just to make  sure that he is OK.  Then White House sources are saying he's going to be  on a plane to Andrews Air Force Base arriving tomorrow at 6:00 a.m.  There  might be some ceremony but he's obviously relieved.  His family, they said  they are just relieved about this news.</p><p>In fact his lawyer says he thanked everyone for their prayers.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JAY SEKULOW, AMERICAN CENTER FOR LAW AND JUSTICE:  Many of you have been  praying for this day.  I want to thank you.  I know the pastor and his  entire family want to thank you as well.  And of course, a huge thank you  to the President and his team for securing the release of Andrew Brunson.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LAWRENCE:  Now a Turkish court actually convicted Pastor Andrew Brunson on  terrorism charges, gave him little more than three years, but then give him  time served and they lifted the travel ban which is the reason he's able to  now leave the country.  He's gotten on a plane as we said.  The White House  saying that there was no deal made with Turkey to make this happen.  So  nothing was on the table.</p><p>Turkey may have been doing this to garner some goodwill.  They are looking  for help with the investigation on the missing columnist that went into the  Saudi consulate in Turkey.</p><p>Now officials in Turkey believe that he was killed inside that consulate,  Jammal Khashoggi.  Now, they say that they have audio and video evidence  that point to that effect.  \"The Wall Street Journal\" reporting that that  evidence has been shown to U.S. intelligence agencies.</p><p>Now, Saudi's officially said that he left even though video shows him going  in but not coming out.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ADAM KINZINGER (R-IL), HOUSE FOREIGN RELATIONS COMMITTEE:  If it's true, it  appears that it is, that he was murdered in their consulate by an  assassination team, there needs to be some significant consequences to  that.  I think that's maybe eventually targeted sanctions on individuals,  that, you know, any other host of things available to this administration.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LAWRENCE:  Now the President saying that even if the Saudi government is  proven to be behind this disappearance, the U.S. may not cancel its arms  deal that it has with Saudi Arabia which includes fighter jets.  The  President saying that does not want to see the jobs go to Russia.</p><p>Now on another note here, the senior White House official telling us that  they are moving in the direction for a meeting between with the Chinese  president, President Xi Jinping, and President Donald Trump next month at  the G20 summit, a bilateral, one-on-one meeting between the two.  China  trying to avoid the 25 percent tariffs that will be bumped up at January  1st.  They are worried about their market and the effects that will happen.</p><p>The Chinese president possibly trying to get the President to back off  those tariffs.  Now, the President would like China to step up and make  some changes, at least move forward towards a trade deal with the U.S.</p><p>Trish?</p><p>REGAN:  Thank you very much, Edward Lawrence.</p><p>All right.  Joining me right now with reaction, we have Republican  Congressman Tom Reed of New York.  Good to have you here, sir.</p><p>Congressman, I'm going to start first on the China front.  Do you think  they might actually be willing to give a little here?  I mean, we are their  biggest customer.</p><p>TOM REED (R), NEW YORK CONGRESSMAN: I think they are --</p><p>REGAN:  Not doing them any favors, right?  This whole sort of \"trade war\"  if you can call it that, it's not helping China?</p><p>REED:  No.  I would agree with that assessment.  This is not sustainable  for China.  They need to come to the table.  And I believe that is exactly  where these talks will lead that they are recognizing.  That it is not in  their interests, nor in America's interest to continue a protracted trade  war.  It's time for us to come together.  It's time for China to be held  accountable for their unfair trade practices.  And I think they are in a  position to have to sit at the table to resolve this.</p><p>REGAN:  You know, Congressman the difference, however is that in China they  don't have to get elected.  I mean you got to get elected every two years,  right?  And consequently if the economy starts to turn and if corporations  starts getting kind of upset including some of, say your donor, sir, that  they can't access the Chinese markets like they used to because of all of  these problems, then at what point does it start to really bite into the  ability of American politicians to really do what's best here where just to  confront the problem?</p><p>REED:  Well I think Trish, if you look at from the other perspective.  You  know, China has -- they're not subject to election, but I will tell you  they have tremendous amount of internal strife.  If their people don't have  an expanding economy to go to work, they can't put food on table, they  can't put a roof over their head.  That causes a tremendous amount of the  stability and instability in China.</p><p>And when you look at what China is doing in regards to a debt to GDP, it's  not sustainable there either.  So China cannot withstand these.  And I  understand the political pressure, but this elephant needs to be  confronted.  And that's what we're doing.</p><p>REGAN:  Why, why is everybody --</p><p>REED:  We're holding them accountable once and for all.</p><p>REGAN:  --kind of ignore it.  I mean for -- why is it that -- I mean we --  and I shouldn't say they ignore it.  Actually I've talked to former  Treasury Secretary Bob Rubin about this and he pointed out that China is  indeed a big, big problem.  And he tried to address it during the Clinton  years.  But everybody has tried, right?</p><p>Tim Geithner, I remember trying to take this one and spend time in China  trying to deal with this.  The theft of intellectual property is a real  problem for us.  And yet, no one was quite as vocal about it shall we say  as this President.  Is it because they feared to this talk of a trade war?   Do they fear a backlash from American CEOs that would say, \"No, no, we need  to be over there, we want to be over there, it's a big market for us?\"</p><p>REED:  I think that pressure was there.  But now obviously under this  administration and with our President, we're seeing a disruptive policy put  on the table.  And China can't take the risk of not having America follow  the status quo, the traditional path if you would.  And so what I believe  is happening is they're recognizing that President Trump is serious.  And  that he is serious about holding them accountable for these unfair trade  practices.  And now is the time you're seeing results in China's movement,  in their policy shifts to come to the table to recognize they have to  resolve these issues.</p><p>REGAN:  Real quick, before I let you go.  It's very good news that the  Pastor has been released . Does this show you that sanctions can actually  work, Congressman?</p><p>REED:  Absolutely, and you can get results through strength.  And that's  what the administration sent to Turkey.  Is what it said to Turkey is we  are not going to allow an American citizen to be held captive.  And now we  should all celebrate as Americans, as Democrats and Republicans that Pastor  Brunson is coming home and coming home to his family.  That is a joint  celebration every American should be proud of.</p><p>REGAN:  Here, here, I agree.  Thank you so much.  Congressman Reed, good to  see you.</p><p>REED:  Thanks.</p><p>REGAN:  All right, we're going to be following these markets again  throughout the hour as we watch Dow that's up 52 points right now, 25,101  is the level.  Stay with us.</p><p>Residents, meanwhile in the Florida Panhandle, they are coming to terms  with the utter destruction that Hurricane Michael had left behind.  We have  a live report on cleanup and relief efforts coming up next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>REGAN:  Very sad scene in Florida right now.  In fact, everywhere you look  in the Florida Panhandle, what you see is utter devastation.  You have  beach front homes have been completely obliterated.  Only slabs of concrete  remaining, entire communities actually destroyed when category 4 Hurricane  Michael roared ashore this week.  This destruction is being called  catastrophic.</p><p>Billions of dollars will be needed to rebuild.  And now 13 deaths are being  blamed on the most powerful hurricane to hit the U.S. mainland in a  generation.</p><p>And Michael is not done yet.  Causing flash flooding, heavy rains as far  away as Virginia.  Connell McShane is joining me right now on the phone  from one of the hardest hit areas, Panama City, Florida.</p><p>Hey, Connell.</p><p>CONNELL MCSHANE, FOX BUSINESS NEWS ANCHOR (via telephone):  Hi there Trish.</p><p>We're just east of Panama City right now.  We've been moving around a lot  today as much as we can.  And we've been encountering some of the same  difficulties as the people here are in trying to recover from Hurricane  Michael and as the first-responders are been trying to help those people so  badly hurt by this hurricane.</p><p>Let me start in Mexico Beach where we spent part of our afternoon and  evening yesterday before the curfew went into place.  Well I'm sure you've  seen what we'll be able to show now some of the video of Mexico Beach that  we and our other Fox colleagues were able to shoot particularly some of the  aerial shots where you can see just how Hurricane Michael caused so much  destruction.  And that's the word, not damage, it's destruction.</p><p>There were homes that were buried a day before the hurricane which just  aren't there anymore.  It's not as if they were damaged.  They were  completely wiped out.  I was speaking to some of the National Guard troops  who are assigned to Mexico Beach, one in particular told me he's from this  area, has worked a number of hurricanes and never seen anything even close  to this bad.</p><p>Now when you get back to the area you mentioned, Panama City where we were  earlier in the day, there are parts of it in particular in Panama City  Beach are starting to recover.  Even some power that's starting to come  back.  But those few and far between as of this morning, 90 percent of that  town in Bay County was still without power.</p><p>We move to the east where we are.  Then you encounter the communication  difficulties that are really making things doubly difficult for everybody  trying to respond to this hurricane.  And that's why I'm speaking to you  now on this side of the road on a satellite phone because in an area where  the cell phone service was perfect yesterday it no longer works at all  today.  So that's one of the things the companies no doubt are trying to  get in here and get their towers back up and running.  But it depends on  which service provider you have.  For example, many of us have AT&amp;T and  that was working in some areas beautifully.</p><p>Many of the people who live here do not have Verizon or Sprint or what have  you and they weren't working at all.  So, it depends where you are, what  service provider you have.  And people are having difficult even telling  someone that they're having trouble.</p><p>And, you know, we're running to a lady earlier for example, we've been able  to ride out the storm.  She's OK.  The tree that came down, a giant oak  tree fell into the street, thank goodness, not into her house but she was  having difficulty telling her family she was OK.</p><p>Finally, she was able to walk up of a block and randomly Facebook Messenger  it came on her phone even though it didn't seem that she has service  she  leave (ph) to give a quick message t some of her family members.  So that's  the kind of thing that it making hard to recover from this hurricane.  The  idea that communicating is so difficult.</p><p>I will say Trish, the transportation has improved a little.  It's all  relative but some of the road there were completely closed yesterday are  now starting to reopen.  Thanks for the hard work of some of the  professionals and also some of the volunteers, neighbors helping neighbors  pack with their saws and chainsaws and whatever (ph) to be able to cutdown  some of tress and open the roads up.</p><p>So FEMA and the other authorities can get in.  But that's a long way to go,  Trish.  It really is something else.</p><p>REGAN:  Wow, quite an aftermath.  Connell, thank you very much.</p><p>All right.  Roller coaster here on the market up 81 right now.  We've been  up as much as 400 then we were down.  So, where we're headed right now?   It's a Friday.  So investors are going into the weekend and of course, you  know, a lot of this is gone to center around what happened come midterm  elections, right?  Because economic policy is going to be influenced by  whoever is in office.  Our panel is going to debate all that next</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>REGAN:  All right.  We're watching what has become a very volatile market  this week.  A couple rough days we had but today is looking a little  better.</p><p>We're up 50 -- nearly 50 points.  We had been trading up as much as 414  though.  So, so much for that, but at least we're out of negative  territory.  The big question is, what are these markets really mean for  Republicans come the midterms?</p><p>Joining me right now, James Freeman of \"The Wall Street Journal\" and Former  Advisor to Bill Clinton, Doug Schoen.  Good to see you both.</p><p>DOUG SCHOEN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Good to see you.</p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, \"THE WALL STREET JOURNAL\":  Good to be here, Trish, thanks.</p><p>REGAN:  Doug, I'm going to start with you.  I mean people been feeling  pretty good about the economy.  I'd tell you all the economic data points  do some very, very strong fundamentals.  But, you know, when people open up  their 401k's and they see that maybe it wasn't as good as it was last  month, what kind of effect does that have on psychology for voters?</p><p>SCHOEN:  You know, Trish, at this point, not to duck the question, it's  hard to tell.  Because usually these things take a little bit longer to  play out than what you're describing which is, you know, the beginning of  November, they get their 401k's.  They're down and so they get less  inclined to vote Republican.</p><p>Usually takes three to six months for the impact of a brief downturn and it  has been brief and has been swift to be felt.  So, as we sit here today  can't say really anything.  The polling shows if anything the Republicans  up in the last week or so, certainly in the Senate races.</p><p>REGAN:  James, I personally, and I said this earlier in the show.  I think  is a blip.  I mean, I think there are very, very good fundamentals right  now.</p><p>I think, you know, the China thing yes, it's a little bit of a threat but  we'll make it through all of that.  And as long as we continue to see wage  growth and job growth.  We're heading in the right direction and economic  growth.  But you know, nonetheless, if you have a market that's trading  lower, I don't necessarily think it will in November.  But if it were to-- </p><p>FREEMAN:    Yes.</p><p>REGAN:  -- how does that influence in your view Republican voters?</p><p>FREEMAN:  Well, I think the economy is a win for Republicans barring some  huge, sort of catastrophic event.  As you said the fundamentals are very  strong.  We just really got another reminder that this morning with the  bank earnings</p><p>These are companies that get a pretty good window into the U.S. consumer.   People paying bills on time.  They're obviously able to find jobs.   Earnings are good for the companies, the economy is growing.  So I think  that's all good and that would suggest this is a blip.</p><p>The sort of conventional wisdom is maybe the economy is so good since there  are almost no economic problems.  People kind of take that for granted and  maybe they decide on other things.</p><p>REGAN:  And that's was so hard, right, in midterms?</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.</p><p>REGAN:  I mean, you have to motivate --</p><p>FREEMAN:  Right.</p><p>REGAN:  -- voters get out there.  And if they're feeling kind a OK, then,  Doug, you run the risk of complacency.  I do think Kavanaugh changed that,  however.  If there was any complacency among the Republican base, watching  what happened with Judge Kavanaugh may have them thinking differently?</p><p>SCHOEN:  Well, certainly that's the initial indication but we've got you  know, some 20 something days to go until the election.  And, whether there  are twists and turns in terms of enthusiasm and attitudes, really remains  to be seen.</p><p>A bunch of the most recent midterms have swung in the last week to 10 days.   So I think it's not clear what's going to happen but I think James is  right.  If you look at all the indicators and certainly, Trish, you as  well, it's more -- much more good news economically for the Republicans,  notwithstanding that midterms typically go for the out party, the  opposition.</p><p>REGAN:  Yes.  So, is all this at risk, James?  I mean, if the Republicans  are not successful in midterms?  Because you know, we've heard many  Democrats say they like to reverse the tax cut and they like to tax the  wealthy?</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.</p><p>REGAN:  And tax everyone else along the way, including corporations et  cetera.  So, is some of this policy really at risk?</p><p>FREEMAN:  Well, I think you have to say this at risk because depending on  how big -- let's just imagine a big Democratic wave, if president Trump  then feels the need to negotiate to do deals, to strike the \"art of the  deal\" with Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer, that could be a very different  policy mix.  It's -- obviously if you look at most of his history Donald  Trump was not a super conservative guy.  Does he evolve back if he is  dealing with Congressional leadership with big democratic majorities?  So  that would be a question.</p><p>REGAN:  Hey, Doug, can I just ask?</p><p>SCHOEN:  Yes.</p><p>REGAN:  Looking ahead to 2020, do you think Mike Bloomberg is going to be  in the ring?</p><p>SCHOEN:  You know, I don't think he's made a final decision.  Certainly  made it clear the other day that he was going to do everything he could to  stand up to policies that the Trump administration is pursued, that he  disagrees with.  He is spending obviously close to $100 million on the  midterm elections.  So whatever the mayor or the former mayor does, he will  be a force to be reckoned with.  That's for sure.</p><p>REGAN:  And he's never registered as a Democrat.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Well, you know, if he likes to have --</p><p>SCHOEN:  He is now.</p><p>FREEMAN:  -- pro-business Democrats again.  This -- for this reason I kind  of doubt whether he can go anywhere.</p><p>REGAN:  Yes.</p><p>FREEMAN:  But it would be nice to see a kind of a market-oriented voice  back in that party.</p><p>REGAN:  Yes.  It would be the alternative which is the Alexandria Cortez  and the Bernie Sanders camp.</p><p>FREEMAN:  A 100 percent.</p><p>REGAN:  We don't need the socialist there.  Anyway, good, red-blooded  American capitalism and that's what the nation was founded on.  Doug,  James, good to see you guys.  Thank you so much.</p><p>SCHOEN:  Thank you so much, Trish.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Thanks.</p><p>REGAN:  All right 29 million Facebook users have had their information  stolen in the massive security breach that happened there last month.   Facebook says the information included everything from names and contact  information to more personal profile information like places that people  checked into and the devices used to access Facebook.</p><p>Facebook said users can check if they were affected by the attack, visiting  Facebook's Online Help Center.</p><p>Tesla is giving its customers until Monday to place car orders eligible for  a $7500 federal tax credit.  Under federal law, the full tax credit lasts  until the car company reaches 200,000 sales in 2010 which it definitely did  in July.  You know, any vehicles ordered by Monday are expected to be  delivered by the end of the year.</p><p>President Trump sparking outraged and an outcry after slamming the Fed for  being too aggressive, t does he have a point?  Is the Fed getting a little  too happy about these rate hikes?  Our panel is going to weigh in on all  that, I'll see you here next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  We have interest rates  going up at a clip that's much faster than certainly a lot of people  including myself would have anticipated.  I think the Fed is out of  control.  I think what they're doing is wrong.  I think the Fed is far too  stringent and they're making a mistake.</p><p>They're so tight.  I think the Fed has gone crazy.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REGAN:  Tell us how you really feel.  That was President Trump blasting the  Fed for being too aggressive on interests rate hike.  President Trump's  very forward and obvious frustration with the Fed, well not doing so well  with some folks but the head of JPMorgan Chase, Mr. Jamie Dimon is  defending the President saying, and I, \"I have never seen a President who  wanted interest rates to go up.\"  I think he's right on that one.  Who  would?</p><p>Joining me right now, the host of \"Making Money\" on the Fox Business  network, Charles Payne, soon to be host of \"Making Money\" at 2:00 p.m.,  more on that in just a minute.  Also Moody's Chief Economist, John Lonski.</p><p>John, yes, I don't blame him.  Who the heck wants the cost of money to go  up?</p><p>JOHN LONSKI, MOODY'S CHIEF ECONOMIST:  You've got to be more diplomatic  about your criticism of the Fed.  You can't go out there because, say that  they're lunatics or whatever he was saying.  Jerome Powell is not crazy.</p><p>REGAN:  You know what though, I know a lot of people are saying that.  But,  you know, this is a President who has a different style entirely, right.   You know, he says what he thinks.  And I'm sure there are plenty of  Presidents that thought the Fed was doing a lousy job and acting crazy, but  maybe they just never said it quite so explicitly.</p><p>LONSKI:  That's right.  And, you know, the fed has to keep an eye on  financial markets.  We now have the, you know, the overall market has sold  off sharply thus far in the month of October.  It's clearly higher.  We  have certain segments, interest sensitive segments of the market.  For  instance, that index of housing, sectors stock prices this afternoon is  down 25 percent for the year-to-date.  That's versus the overall market up  by two percent.</p><p>And moreover, motor vehicle industry stock prices.  So they're median  decline for the year-to-date is roughly 23 percent.  That's not good.  And  I think that's telling the Fed that perhaps there is reason to proceed with  greater caution, not only when they hike rates --</p><p>REGAN:  I see where it run.</p><p>LONSKI:  -- but when they talk about rate hikes.</p><p>REGAN:  IE, John Lonski agrees with President Trump.  You don't want to see  the Fed, maybe they're not crazy --</p><p>LONSKI:  But with Jerome Powell is very intelligent, very wise man.</p><p>REGAN:  Wow.</p><p>LONSKI:  And I'm pretty sure that they're doing the best job possible.</p><p>REGAN:  I'm pretty sure that even though he's the President of the United  States, Charles Payne, the head of the Federal Reserve needs to be  independent.  And I would expect him to be independent.  So he may hear a  little of the chatter and a little of the noise, but really it comes down  to the data, shouldn't it?</p><p>CHARLES PAYNE, FOX BUSINESS ANCHOR:  It should come down to the data and  the Fed has said over and over that it does.  And I got to tell you the  official communiques that they put out like the so-called dot plot in the  FOMC, you know, communique.  They suggest a very level-headed Fed that's  not going to wreck the economy, but it's the comments that are made in his  speech because almost every single day someone at the Fed is giving a  speech somewhere around the world.</p><p>And I tell you, starting to roll markets in.  And you know, there shouldn't  be any sacred cows out there politi -- specifically on a political side.   And why should the Fed be completely independent in the sense that it's  unanswerable to anyone?  It's not federal.  It doesn't matter.  It's sort  of scary for the average person out there.</p><p>REGAN:  Yes.</p><p>PAYNE:  John just talking about housing being under pressure, autos being  under pressure, that we're talking about the average American house hold.   If the Fed is worried about, you know, the larger institutions, you know.</p><p>And then as far as President Trump's criticism, we went from 2008, 2014  with zero rate hikes.  And this one in 2015, Janet Yellen figures she made  a mistake, and she waited until after the election and she raised rates  again.  So, I can see --</p><p>REGAN:  So you feel that many feels like, hey, that's fair.</p><p>PAYNES:  Right.</p><p>REGAN:  What were you doing for President Obama?  And, you know, maybe send  a little of that my way.</p><p>But here's the difference, John Lonski, in this environment right now we  have a President who does understand the economy and understands that, you  know, you want to unleash those spirits, those economic spirits, what do  you, you lower taxes, you lessen regulation.  That has translated into  growth.  We didn't get that from the Obama administration.  So the Fed was  only game in town.</p><p>LONSKI:  And the President understands commercial real estate very well.   And he must be getting some information that things are beginning to soften  in a once very strong sector because of higher short-term interest rates  and long-term interest rates.</p><p>And let's not forget, this has to be brought up, but for the first time in  memory, perhaps history, we have the Fed firming monetary policy on two  fronts.  Not only are they hiking Fed funds and pushing short-term rates  directly higher but they're passive reduction regarding their holdings of  U.S. Treasury bonds is also putting some upward pressure on long-term  interest rates.</p><p>So again, the Fed's got --</p><p>REGAN:  OK.</p><p>LONSKI:  -- to proceed very carefully.</p><p>REGAN:  But very cautiously.</p><p>LONSKI:  Yes.</p><p>REGAN:  I mean, this is the delicate dance, right, that they're always  walking.  I mean, in the meantime, there are some legitimate or growing  concerns I should say, Charles Payne, about inflation.</p><p>PAYNE:  Yes.  There are, there are, although, you know, this week what we  saw inflation in the PPI number, airline travel went through the roof.  You  know no wonder delta had a pretty good earnings report.  But then we got  the CPI report yesterday, it was relatively benign.</p><p>And so, there are signs of inflation that's the kind of classical inflation  signals that you would think that the Fed would be, you know, yellow flags  or red flags.  Although, we know they want to be ahead of the curve.   There's just --</p><p>REGAN:  Improve it (ph).  They need to forget being as -- they're usually  behind anyway.</p><p>PAYNE:  Yes.  Yes.</p><p>LONSKI:  Today we can have report on import price inflation.  Less than one  percent for consumer goods, less than one percent for all imports excluding  petroleum imports.</p><p>REGAN:  All right.  Well, here's the one --</p><p>LONSKI:  That's not a sign of inflation taking off.</p><p>REGAN:  If there's not enough and there's not enough wage growth, you know,  maybe --</p><p>LONSKI:  What's the hurry?  What's -- there's no sense of urgency for rate  hikes, that's it.</p><p>REGAN:  All right.  You and President Trump.</p><p>LONSKI:  But Jerome Powell --</p><p>REGAN:  Its given Jay Powell appear to your mind.</p><p>LONSKI:  -- level at no.  Yes.</p><p>REGAN:  All right.  Good to -- hey, Charles, I'm really excited for you.</p><p>PAYNE:  Thank you.</p><p>REGAN:  This is a great audience, you know --</p><p>PAYNE:  Thank you.</p><p>REGAN:  -- here at 2:00 p.m.  And you're all going to see Charles beginning  Monday, that's this Monday, 2:00 p.m. October 15th, \"Making Money with  Charles Payne,\" moves to 2:00, and well, I'm moving somewhere else.  I'll  tell you all about that next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>REGAN:  All right.  It's my last day on \"The Intelligence Report\".  So this  market better close up, right?  We're up at 128 points.  Let's hope it  holds throughout the hour.</p><p>Big news?  I shared this a little while ago with you.  I'll tell you again  all about it.  I'm going to primetime, 8:00 p.m., starting Monday right  after my good friend Lou, Lou Dobbs is on from 7:00 to 8:00.  I will be on  from 8:00 to 9:00.  Kennedy will follow at 9:00.  We are live at night  right here on Fox Business.</p><p>I'm really excited about it.  I, you know, I do want to point out just what  an incredible three years it has been on this show.  I mean, we created  this show with you, really.  With you.  You tuned in and it's thanks to you  that we're able to cream the competition for the last three years,  something I'm really extremely proud of.</p><p>And it's thanks to you and it's thanks to this news cycle that, you know,  we're expanding.  We're expanding so we will be live, I will be live at  8:00 p.m. every night.  The news keeps happening.  It's a 24/7 news cycle.</p><p>We're on the front lines of history and I'm there with you, reporting on  all of it.  We analyze, we present both sides, you make the decisions about  what is best for you, your family, and your wallet, right?</p><p>I want to thank -- I have an amazing team.  I want to thank everybody on  this team.  So many of you in the control room right now have been with me  from the very beginning, from the first day I was ever in this chair on  this little set that we created, and it's been wonderful.</p><p>I've gotten to know all of you and your families and you've certainly  gotten to know mine, including all three of the kids which love to come by  and hang out at work and in the studio.  So I'm going to miss all of you.   Some of you are coming with me, of course, and I'm so excited for this new  chapter and what we can do and what we can accomplish.</p><p>We have so many tremendous journalists here at Fox Business and we are in a  tremendous news cycle.  So this is the value add that we bring.</p><p>It's going to be a little different at home, so my husband and I had to get  a little creative on this front because we used to have family dinner at  6:00 p.m. every night.  Now it's going to be family breakfast at 6:30, when  I take the kids to school.</p><p>And then it's following the news cycle for you.  I'm looking forward to it.   I'm going to see you Monday night.</p><p>Gosh, I hope this market ends up, Liz Claman, 137 points.  We got to hang  on to this one.</p><p>LIZ CLAMAN, FOX BUSINESS ANCHOR:  Yes.  Yes.  Let's give you a green good- bye.  Trish, another live --</p><p>REGAN:  Thank you.</p><p>CLAMAN:  -- presence in primetime on Fox Business.</p><p>REGAN:  Charles is going to be --</p><p>CLAMAN:  Go.  Go.  Go.</p><p>REGAN:  -- right here at 2:00 p.m.</p><p>CLAMAN:  Yes.  And we will welcome Charles and we wish you the best of  luck, Trish.</p><p>REGAN:  Thank you Liz.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC.

It will.</p><p>REGAN: All right. Thank you. Fingers crossed.</p><p>CAVUTO: All righty.</p><p>REGAN: All right. Thanks, Neil.</p><p>Breaking right now, everyone, another wild day on Wall Street, we're looking at a Dow that's up, right now, 95 points after being up 400 points at the open and then it dipped a little down into negative territory, now we're back up. Let's see what happened. It's a wild ride. We got a live report from the NYSE straight ahead.</p><p>I am Trish Regan. Welcome, everyone, to the final edition, dare I say, the final edition of \"The Intelligence Report.\"</p><p>Also breaking today, an American pastor who has been detained in Turkey for the last two years is finally coming back home. <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>thrilled with the news, tweeting in all caps, \"Pastor Brunson just released, will be home soon!\" We have a live report coming up from the White House straight ahead.</p><p>And take a look here at this devastating video coming to us from Mexico Beach, Florida. The small coastal town decimated by Hurricane Michael. We have a live report from Panama City, Florida on the cleanup and relief efforts.</p><p>But first, we're going to Deirdre Bolton who's on the floor of the NYSE for more on today's wild ride. What's causing it?</p><p>DEIRDRE BOLTON, FOX BUSINESS ANCHOR: It's right, Trish, especially following the previous two days that we've had. So the big question of course today is can these gains hold?</p><p>So right now I want to call your attention to the tech stocks. These had been the most beaten down in the past of two sessions combined. They are what is holding up the gains as we see right now.</p><p>So I'm going to go through some of the names that you know well. We have Apple, Amazon, Google and NVIDIA, I should say. Alphabet Google still down for the week but very much the strongest mover today. Of course we pay a lot of attention because as far as the weighting go in the S&amp;P 500 we know that tech by market cap is the heaviest, the strongest as far as the industry groups go.</p><p>Trish, we're also focused on the financials, as you know four banks reported before the earnings started. They remain actually the biggest drag right now on the broader markets. So interestingly enough, JPMorgan shares (ph) beat on the top and the bottom line earlier. This was mover to the upside that has since changed.</p><p>And it seems as if traders are focused on one key part of the outlook statement. I'm going to read it directly. The non-interest revenue growth will be between seven percent and eight percent.</p><p>But the thing that is concerning a lot of investors in the stock, and perhaps even in the broader industry is market dependent. Meaning, let's see how our business does outside of the profitable business that we expect to have by loaning out money as rates go higher.</p><p>As for some of the other financials, PNC is down. It has actually had a very rough week. Wells Fargo and Citi, the other two companies that reported earnings before the bell, little bit of mixed. Basically one beating on revenue, slight miss on earnings, one beating on earnings, slight miss on revenue, both of those stocks heading marginally higher.</p><p>So, Trish, the push and pull is basically tech versus financials. Back to you.</p><p>REGAN: All right. Deirdre Bolton, thank you very much.</p><p>Joining me right now onset, our very own Kristina Partsinevelos. We also have Kingsview Asset Management Chief Investment Officer, Scott Martin. Good to see both of you both guys.</p><p>I believe -- do we have Paul Dietrich with us too? Another investor. He's joining -- there we go. There you -- I knew you're around there, Paul.</p><p>PAUL DIETRICH, FAIRFAX GLOBAL MARKET CEO: Hi, Trish.</p><p>REGAN: I'm going to start with you. Wild market, is this the way of the future right now or is this just a little blip?</p><p>DIETRICH: What this is, is, this is a reversion to mean normalizing correction. One of the things that's happened over this past, actually more than a year is that you've had five big tech stocks that have dominated the performance as of the end of August, they were represented 47 percent of the performance of the S&amp;P 500. And what we've seen basically, really for the last month or so, is the tech stocks have been going down and they're reverting to mean of a more normalized stock market trend. And they're very, very high in P.E.s.</p><p>And so, I see this as a very healthy correction in that, you know, the tech stocks are coming back in line with the rest of the 495 stocks in the S&amp;P 500.</p><p>REGAN: Kristina?</p><p>KRISTINA PARTSINEVELOS, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: I think we can't just solely focus on tech. If you look yesterday I was on the New York Stock Exchange 2:43 p.m., just the intraday volume dropped so much, that we haven't seen a drop like that in eight years since the \"flash crash.\" So I think that based of the traders I was speaking to -- volatility is going to continue to be an issue.</p><p>We're heading -- earnings started today at JPMorgan. JPMorgan is supposed to be good right now. Their revenue climbed higher, up what, 24 percent for the quarter, the third quarter. Sorry, profits up 24 percent. And yet you're seeing that stock down today which you would expect it to be better like Deirdre brought up. The guidance is concerning.</p><p>So I think going into the earning season, looking into the future, we're going to be paying close attention to the guidance of a lot of these companies.</p><p>REGAN: Well, you know, right now, earning seem, actually Scott, pretty good, right? I mean, so far so good. We've got strong economic fundamentals. I do wonder if some people are saying to themselves, wait a second, you know what? I can make a little more money on the C.D. at the local bank because Treasury yields are going up, interest rates are going up. And so, is this a bit of a rotation as well and that people now have more opportunity in the investment landscape?</p><p>SCOTT MARTN, KINGSVIEW ASSET MANAGEMENT CIO: It could be. Now, gosh, I hope that mom and pop sitting at home aren't thinking about that, you know, two percent or 2.5 percent C.D. just yet, Trish, because I think --</p><p>REGAN: Well, Scott, you know that I'm using that to characterize something broader, right?</p><p>MARTIN: OK. Sure.</p><p>REGAN: Which is that investors are saying to themselves, \"OK, I have more optionality. It used to be equities are the only game in town. Well maybe I can put a little money in fixed income now.\"</p><p>MARTIN: Fair play, right, exactly. Maybe the 10-year bond. And so you're right. That's providing an alternative. And I to the point that k-parts made was visibility is in question here.</p><p>I get it that earning are good, you know in fact, I think the bar, at least psychologically based on some of the preannouncements has been lowered, so that's good. But the visibility is cloudy. I mean, you look at the incident surrounding tariffs. GDP obviously going forward, it look strong, but then the job market is kind of maybe leveling off here, I mean, still growing but not growing at the higher rates that we saw it earlier this year.</p><p>REGAN: Yes, but is that enough to cause you to just say, you know, throw in the towel and go?</p><p>SCOTT: Well, what it could do though, here's the thing, in highly psychological market as Paul mentioned, you know, this is a market, Trish, that could take that as a reason to sell first and ask questions later. And that's the story of say, certainly yesterday and the day before.</p><p>REGAN: How does the Fed factor into all of this, Paul? By the way the President is not too happy with the Fed right now. Most presidents don't really like the Fed.</p><p>DIETRICH: Yes. Exactly. Yes, I mean, --</p><p>REGAN: Maybe Obama did. He should have anyway.</p><p>DIETRICH: -- let's face it. This is an election year and <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>is really promoting the State of the U.S. economy which is really good and it's firing on all cylinders. And so when you see a stock market collection like we've seen over the last few days, you know he has to blame someone, and so he is blaming the Federal Reserve.</p><p>I think this is normal. This is politics. But --</p><p>SCOTT: Dangerous.</p><p>DIETRICH: No, no, no.</p><p>REGAN: No, by the way, no, it's not dangerous.</p><p>DIETRICH: Not if it's all rhetoric.</p><p>REGAN: It's only if the Fed actually listened but, Scott, I'm going to give Jay Powell a little more credit than that.</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS: Oh, Jay Powell actually come out in broadcast interview with NPR Marketplace that he's going to follow through with this. He said that he's going to stick to the facts, and what the economy is showing, not a political play. And it shouldn't be a political play.</p><p>REGAN: No, absolutely.</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS: You have presidents who have been very --</p><p>MARTIN: Reverse the lines.</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS: -- critical of monetary policy. But in this case look at where interest rates are now. Look at it historically, they've been very, very low. The economy is growing.</p><p>Yes, we had inflation coming at 2.3 percent, but we have a very, very tight labor force. You have Walgreen saying that they're going to increase their salaries, Amazon announcing that $15 per hour. So there's possibly this inflation fear right now.</p><p>REGAN: You know we were talking to the gentleman, the founder, Jerry Fine of Oak Tree Asset Management just the other day, and one thing that he mentioned was that a lot of the companies he speaks to regularly are starting to say, places like Walmart for example, you know, inflation is running a little higher than what you might think. That wages are growing faster than 2.8 percent. And their production costs are increasing.</p><p>And so the Fed needs to take all that into account. And that, Kristina, their job is to make sure that, you know, things don't get too overheated, right?</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS: Right.</p><p>REGAN: Because then you get problems down the road. But it's a tightrope, the Fed got to walk.</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS: Which is -- it's very difficult position for Jay Powell to be in. But I think also we should preface that there is two different kinds of inflation. You also have manmade inflation when you have the tariffs come into play.</p><p>So the fact that literally 50 percent of all Chinese goods that enter the United States at this moment are being taxed. And potentially could be all 100 percent. That inevitably will have an effect on companies, on us.</p><p>REGAN: Yes, no, I get you, I hear you. But Scott, I think that that's kind of a short-term play. How are you thinking about China right now? And you heard me say, if we don't start dealing with this, and the theft of intellectual property, $600 billion a year, if we don't deal with it now it's going to be a whole lot harder to deal with it in the future.</p><p>MARTIN: I agree. To your question, how is China? I don't know, look at their stock market, it's absolutely blasted.</p><p>REGAN: It's not good.</p><p>MARTIN: No, not good.</p><p>So, you're right, that probably brings them to the table, because honestly, Trish, before this tariff talk really heated up, I mean if you go back even to last year, there were problems under the surface in China, anyway economically. So now this is really starting to hurt them.</p><p>Your point with Kristina is good about inflation because if you look at material cost guides, those are dropping by enlarge around the world. You know it's not that hard to produce things anymore. There's a lot of price competitiveness other than oil that we've seen bump up recently.</p><p>So, to me the inflation story is all about wages and it's nowhere.</p><p>REGAN: All right, so Scott, are you buying right now or you're going to sit by the sidelines and wait?</p><p>MARTIN: Yes, sit by the fire, and maybe have a cigar and think about it. But I will be buying probably next week. I think you got to --</p><p>REGAN: All right.</p><p>MARTIN: -- let the psychological kind of walkout here, though.</p><p>REGAN: You should have bought yesterday. Paul, your thoughts, final thoughts.</p><p>MARTIN: Or maybe this morning. Right.</p><p>DIETRICH: The story that nobody is talking about with inflation, because inflation has been a problem in the past, but -- and we've only seen for the last 60 years bad inflation where the government spends too much and then has to print money that causes inflation. But there's good inflation. You know when wages are going up, and prices are going up because people can price in the cost, that creates a virtues circle and government doesn't have to print money.</p><p>MARTIN: It's natural.</p><p>REGAN: Right. And listen, you don't want to have to fight deflation, that's whole other can of worms that incredibly --</p><p>MARTIN: Can't win that fight.</p><p>REGAN: Yes. It's good to see you guys. Thank you, Kristina, Paul, Scott.</p><p>I do want to point out we've got breaking news coming in to us right now. The President says he will be traveling to Florida and to Georgia early next week to survey some of the damage that are caused by Hurricane Michael. This is the tweet that he just issued.</p><p>He said, \"People have no idea how hard Hurricane Michael has hit the great state of Georgia. I will be visiting both Florida and Georgia early next week. We are working hard on every area and every state that was hit, we are with you.\"</p><p>Also breaking today, American Pastor Andrew Bronson is on his way home after being released by a Turkish court. So what does that mean for U.S. and Turkey relations going forward? I'm going to asking New York Congressman, Tom Reed, that very question next.</p><p>REGAN: Another roller coaster ride here but at least for now anyway, we're in positive territory. You can see we've been all over the place. Up as much as 400 in change as we started the day. And then down, well, now, still up, barely.</p><p>Meanwhile, we've got some good news out of Turkey today as the American Pastor Andrew Brunson is now on a plane home after a court ruled he should be released. He had been sentenced to more than three years on terrorism charges despite living in Turkey for more than 20 years.</p><p><person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>had imposed sanctions, some pretty strict sanctions on Turkey in an attempt to secure his release. And he tweeted, \"Pastor Brunson just released, will be home soon!\" He is going to feel, I would imagine feel pretty good about that.</p><p>Edward Lawrence is live at the White House with the latest</p><p>And Edward, fill us in.</p><p>EDWARD LAWRENCE, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Yes. I can tell you right now that Pastor Brunson, we understand, is on a plane on his way to Germany, to an air force base to get medical treatment there just to make sure that he is OK. Then White House sources are saying he's going to be on a plane to Andrews Air Force Base arriving tomorrow at 6:00 a.m. There might be some ceremony but he's obviously relieved. His family, they said they are just relieved about this news.</p><p>In fact his lawyer says he thanked everyone for their prayers.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JAY SEKULOW, AMERICAN CENTER FOR LAW AND JUSTICE: Many of you have been praying for this day. I want to thank you. I know the pastor and his entire family want to thank you as well. And of course, a huge thank you to the President and his team for securing the release of Andrew Brunson.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LAWRENCE: Now a Turkish court actually convicted Pastor Andrew Brunson on terrorism charges, gave him little more than three years, but then give him time served and they lifted the travel ban which is the reason he's able to now leave the country. He's gotten on a plane as we said. The White House saying that there was no deal made with Turkey to make this happen. So nothing was on the table.</p><p>Turkey may have been doing this to garner some goodwill. They are looking for help with the investigation on the missing columnist that went into the Saudi consulate in Turkey.</p><p>Now officials in Turkey believe that he was killed inside that consulate, Jammal Khashoggi. Now, they say that they have audio and video evidence that point to that effect. \"The Wall Street Journal\" reporting that that evidence has been shown to U.S. intelligence agencies.</p><p>Now, Saudi's officially said that he left even though video shows him going in but not coming out.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ADAM KINZINGER (R-IL), HOUSE FOREIGN RELATIONS COMMITTEE: If it's true, it appears that it is, that he was murdered in their consulate by an assassination team, there needs to be some significant consequences to that. I think that's maybe eventually targeted sanctions on individuals, that, you know, any other host of things available to this administration.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LAWRENCE: Now the President saying that even if the Saudi government is proven to be behind this disappearance, the U.S. may not cancel its arms deal that it has with Saudi Arabia which includes fighter jets. The President saying that does not want to see the jobs go to Russia.</p><p>Now on another note here, the senior White House official telling us that they are moving in the direction for a meeting between with the Chinese president, President Xi Jinping, and President Donald Trump next month at the G20 summit, a bilateral, one-on-one meeting between the two. China trying to avoid the 25 percent tariffs that will be bumped up at January 1st. They are worried about their market and the effects that will happen.</p><p>The Chinese president possibly trying to get the President to back off those tariffs. Now, the President would like China to step up and make some changes, at least move forward towards a trade deal with the U.S.</p><p>Trish?</p><p>REGAN: Thank you very much, Edward Lawrence.</p><p>All right. Joining me right now with reaction, we have Republican Congressman Tom Reed of New York. Good to have you here, sir.</p><p>Congressman, I'm going to start first on the China front. Do you think they might actually be willing to give a little here? I mean, we are their biggest customer.</p><p>TOM REED (R), NEW YORK CONGRESSMAN: I think they are --</p><p>REGAN: Not doing them any favors, right? This whole sort of \"trade war\" if you can call it that, it's not helping China?</p><p>REED: No. I would agree with that assessment. This is not sustainable for China. They need to come to the table. And I believe that is exactly where these talks will lead that they are recognizing. That it is not in their interests, nor in America's interest to continue a protracted trade war. It's time for us to come together. It's time for China to be held accountable for their unfair trade practices. And I think they are in a position to have to sit at the table to resolve this.</p><p>REGAN: You know, Congressman the difference, however is that in China they don't have to get elected. I mean you got to get elected every two years, right? And consequently if the economy starts to turn and if corporations starts getting kind of upset including some of, say your donor, sir, that they can't access the Chinese markets like they used to because of all of these problems, then at what point does it start to really bite into the ability of American politicians to really do what's best here where just to confront the problem?</p><p>REED: Well I think Trish, if you look at from the other perspective. You know, China has -- they're not subject to election, but I will tell you they have tremendous amount of internal strife. If their people don't have an expanding economy to go to work, they can't put food on table, they can't put a roof over their head. That causes a tremendous amount of the stability and instability in China.</p><p>And when you look at what China is doing in regards to a debt to GDP, it's not sustainable there either. So China cannot withstand these. And I understand the political pressure, but this elephant needs to be confronted. And that's what we're doing.</p><p>REGAN: Why, why is everybody --</p><p>REED: We're holding them accountable once and for all.</p><p>REGAN: --kind of ignore it. I mean for -- why is it that -- I mean we -- and I shouldn't say they ignore it. Actually I've talked to former Treasury Secretary Bob Rubin about this and he pointed out that China is indeed a big, big problem. And he tried to address it during the Clinton years. But everybody has tried, right?</p><p>Tim Geithner, I remember trying to take this one and spend time in China trying to deal with this. The theft of intellectual property is a real problem for us. And yet, no one was quite as vocal about it shall we say as this President. Is it because they feared to this talk of a trade war? Do they fear a backlash from American CEOs that would say, \"No, no, we need to be over there, we want to be over there, it's a big market for us?\"</p><p>REED: I think that pressure was there. But now obviously under this administration and with our President, we're seeing a disruptive policy put on the table. And China can't take the risk of not having America follow the status quo, the traditional path if you would. And so what I believe is happening is they're recognizing that <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>is serious. And that he is serious about holding them accountable for these unfair trade practices. And now is the time you're seeing results in China's movement, in their policy shifts to come to the table to recognize they have to resolve these issues.</p><p>REGAN: Real quick, before I let you go. It's very good news that the Pastor has been released . Does this show you that sanctions can actually work, Congressman?</p><p>REED: Absolutely, and you can get results through strength. And that's what the administration sent to Turkey. Is what it said to Turkey is we are not going to allow an American citizen to be held captive. And now we should all celebrate as Americans, as Democrats and Republicans that Pastor Brunson is coming home and coming home to his family. That is a joint celebration every American should be proud of.</p><p>REGAN: Here, here, I agree. Thank you so much. Congressman Reed, good to see you.</p><p>REED: Thanks.</p><p>REGAN: All right, we're going to be following these markets again throughout the hour as we watch Dow that's up 52 points right now, 25,101 is the level. Stay with us.</p><p>Residents, meanwhile in the Florida Panhandle, they are coming to terms with the utter destruction that Hurricane Michael had left behind. We have a live report on cleanup and relief efforts coming up next.</p><p>REGAN: Very sad scene in Florida right now. In fact, everywhere you look in the Florida Panhandle, what you see is utter devastation. You have beach front homes have been completely obliterated. Only slabs of concrete remaining, entire communities actually destroyed when category 4 Hurricane Michael roared ashore this week. This destruction is being called catastrophic.</p><p>Billions of dollars will be needed to rebuild. And now 13 deaths are being blamed on the most powerful hurricane to hit the U.S. mainland in a generation.</p><p>And Michael is not done yet. Causing flash flooding, heavy rains as far away as Virginia. Connell McShane is joining me right now on the phone from one of the hardest hit areas, Panama City, Florida.</p><p>Hey, Connell.</p><p>CONNELL MCSHANE, FOX BUSINESS NEWS ANCHOR (via telephone): Hi there Trish.</p><p>We're just east of Panama City right now. We've been moving around a lot today as much as we can. And we've been encountering some of the same difficulties as the people here are in trying to recover from Hurricane Michael and as the first-responders are been trying to help those people so badly hurt by this hurricane.</p><p>Let me start in Mexico Beach where we spent part of our afternoon and evening yesterday before the curfew went into place. Well I'm sure you've seen what we'll be able to show now some of the video of Mexico Beach that we and our other Fox colleagues were able to shoot particularly some of the aerial shots where you can see just how Hurricane Michael caused so much destruction. And that's the word, not damage, it's destruction.</p><p>There were homes that were buried a day before the hurricane which just aren't there anymore. It's not as if they were damaged. They were completely wiped out. I was speaking to some of the National Guard troops who are assigned to Mexico Beach, one in particular told me he's from this area, has worked a number of hurricanes and never seen anything even close to this bad.</p><p>Now when you get back to the area you mentioned, Panama City where we were earlier in the day, there are parts of it in particular in Panama City Beach are starting to recover. Even some power that's starting to come back. But those few and far between as of this morning, 90 percent of that town in Bay County was still without power.</p><p>We move to the east where we are. Then you encounter the communication difficulties that are really making things doubly difficult for everybody trying to respond to this hurricane. And that's why I'm speaking to you now on this side of the road on a satellite phone because in an area where the cell phone service was perfect yesterday it no longer works at all today. So that's one of the things the companies no doubt are trying to get in here and get their towers back up and running. But it depends on which service provider you have. For example, many of us have AT&amp;T and that was working in some areas beautifully.</p><p>Many of the people who live here do not have Verizon or Sprint or what have you and they weren't working at all. So, it depends where you are, what service provider you have. And people are having difficult even telling someone that they're having trouble.</p><p>And, you know, we're running to a lady earlier for example, we've been able to ride out the storm. She's OK. The tree that came down, a giant oak tree fell into the street, thank goodness, not into her house but she was having difficulty telling her family she was OK.</p><p>Finally, she was able to walk up of a block and randomly Facebook Messenger it came on her phone even though it didn't seem that she has service she leave (ph) to give a quick message t some of her family members. So that's the kind of thing that it making hard to recover from this hurricane. The idea that communicating is so difficult.</p><p>I will say Trish, the transportation has improved a little. It's all relative but some of the road there were completely closed yesterday are now starting to reopen. Thanks for the hard work of some of the professionals and also some of the volunteers, neighbors helping neighbors pack with their saws and chainsaws and whatever (ph) to be able to cutdown some of tress and open the roads up.</p><p>So FEMA and the other authorities can get in. But that's a long way to go, Trish. It really is something else.</p><p>REGAN: Wow, quite an aftermath. Connell, thank you very much.</p><p>All right. Roller coaster here on the market up 81 right now. We've been up as much as 400 then we were down. So, where we're headed right now? It's a Friday. So investors are going into the weekend and of course, you know, a lot of this is gone to center around what happened come midterm elections, right? Because economic policy is going to be influenced by whoever is in office. Our panel is going to debate all that next</p><p>REGAN: All right. We're watching what has become a very volatile market this week. A couple rough days we had but today is looking a little better.</p><p>We're up 50 -- nearly 50 points. We had been trading up as much as 414 though. So, so much for that, but at least we're out of negative territory. The big question is, what are these markets really mean for Republicans come the midterms?</p><p>Joining me right now, James Freeman of \"The Wall Street Journal\" and Former Advisor to Bill Clinton, Doug Schoen. Good to see you both.</p><p>DOUG SCHOEN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Good to see you.</p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, \"THE WALL STREET JOURNAL\": Good to be here, Trish, thanks.</p><p>REGAN: Doug, I'm going to start with you. I mean people been feeling pretty good about the economy. I'd tell you all the economic data points do some very, very strong fundamentals. But, you know, when people open up their 401k's and they see that maybe it wasn't as good as it was last month, what kind of effect does that have on psychology for voters?</p><p>SCHOEN: You know, Trish, at this point, not to duck the question, it's hard to tell. Because usually these things take a little bit longer to play out than what you're describing which is, you know, the beginning of November, they get their 401k's. They're down and so they get less inclined to vote Republican.</p><p>Usually takes three to six months for the impact of a brief downturn and it has been brief and has been swift to be felt. So, as we sit here today can't say really anything. The polling shows if anything the Republicans up in the last week or so, certainly in the Senate races.</p><p>REGAN: James, I personally, and I said this earlier in the show. I think is a blip. I mean, I think there are very, very good fundamentals right now.</p><p>I think, you know, the China thing yes, it's a little bit of a threat but we'll make it through all of that. And as long as we continue to see wage growth and job growth. We're heading in the right direction and economic growth. But you know, nonetheless, if you have a market that's trading lower, I don't necessarily think it will in November. But if it were to--</p><p>FREEMAN: Yes.</p><p>REGAN: -- how does that influence in your view Republican voters?</p><p>FREEMAN: Well, I think the economy is a win for Republicans barring some huge, sort of catastrophic event. As you said the fundamentals are very strong. We just really got another reminder that this morning with the bank earnings</p><p>These are companies that get a pretty good window into the U.S. consumer. People paying bills on time. They're obviously able to find jobs. Earnings are good for the companies, the economy is growing. So I think that's all good and that would suggest this is a blip.</p><p>The sort of conventional wisdom is maybe the economy is so good since there are almost no economic problems. People kind of take that for granted and maybe they decide on other things.</p><p>REGAN: And that's was so hard, right, in midterms?</p><p>FREEMAN: Yes.</p><p>REGAN: I mean, you have to motivate --</p><p>FREEMAN: Right.</p><p>REGAN: -- voters get out there. And if they're feeling kind a OK, then, Doug, you run the risk of complacency. I do think Kavanaugh changed that, however. If there was any complacency among the Republican base, watching what happened with Judge Kavanaugh may have them thinking differently?</p><p>SCHOEN: Well, certainly that's the initial indication but we've got you know, some 20 something days to go until the election. And, whether there are twists and turns in terms of enthusiasm and attitudes, really remains to be seen.</p><p>A bunch of the most recent midterms have swung in the last week to 10 days. So I think it's not clear what's going to happen but I think James is right. If you look at all the indicators and certainly, Trish, you as well, it's more -- much more good news economically for the Republicans, notwithstanding that midterms typically go for the out party, the opposition.</p><p>REGAN: Yes. So, is all this at risk, James? I mean, if the Republicans are not successful in midterms? Because you know, we've heard many Democrats say they like to reverse the tax cut and they like to tax the wealthy?</p><p>FREEMAN: Yes.</p><p>REGAN: And tax everyone else along the way, including corporations et cetera. So, is some of this policy really at risk?</p><p>FREEMAN: Well, I think you have to say this at risk because depending on how big -- let's just imagine a big Democratic wave, if <person><nameText>president Trump </nameText></person>then feels the need to negotiate to do deals, to strike the \"art of the deal\" with Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer, that could be a very different policy mix. It's -- obviously if you look at most of his history Donald Trump was not a super conservative guy. Does he evolve back if he is dealing with Congressional leadership with big democratic majorities? So that would be a question.</p><p>REGAN: Hey, Doug, can I just ask?</p><p>SCHOEN: Yes.</p><p>REGAN: Looking ahead to 2020, do you think Mike Bloomberg is going to be in the ring?</p><p>SCHOEN: You know, I don't think he's made a final decision. Certainly made it clear the other day that he was going to do everything he could to stand up to policies that the Trump administration is pursued, that he disagrees with. He is spending obviously close to $100 million on the midterm elections. So whatever the mayor or the former mayor does, he will be a force to be reckoned with. That's for sure.</p><p>REGAN: And he's never registered as a Democrat.</p><p>FREEMAN: Well, you know, if he likes to have --</p><p>SCHOEN: He is now.</p><p>FREEMAN: -- pro-business Democrats again. This -- for this reason I kind of doubt whether he can go anywhere.</p><p>REGAN: Yes.</p><p>FREEMAN: But it would be nice to see a kind of a market-oriented voice back in that party.</p><p>REGAN: Yes. It would be the alternative which is the Alexandria Cortez and the Bernie Sanders camp.</p><p>FREEMAN: A 100 percent.</p><p>REGAN: We don't need the socialist there. Anyway, good, red-blooded American capitalism and that's what the nation was founded on. Doug, James, good to see you guys. Thank you so much.</p><p>SCHOEN: Thank you so much, Trish.</p><p>FREEMAN: Thanks.</p><p>REGAN: All right 29 million Facebook users have had their information stolen in the massive security breach that happened there last month. Facebook says the information included everything from names and contact information to more personal profile information like places that people checked into and the devices used to access Facebook.</p><p>Facebook said users can check if they were affected by the attack, visiting Facebook's Online Help Center.</p><p>Tesla is giving its customers until Monday to place car orders eligible for a $7500 federal tax credit. Under federal law, the full tax credit lasts until the car company reaches 200,000 sales in 2010 which it definitely did in July. You know, any vehicles ordered by Monday are expected to be delivered by the end of the year.</p><p><person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>sparking outraged and an outcry after slamming the Fed for being too aggressive, t does he have a point? Is the Fed getting a little too happy about these rate hikes? Our panel is going to weigh in on all that, I'll see you here next.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We have interest rates going up at a clip that's much faster than certainly a lot of people including myself would have anticipated. I think the Fed is out of control. I think what they're doing is wrong. I think the Fed is far too stringent and they're making a mistake.</p><p>They're so tight. I think the Fed has gone crazy.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REGAN: Tell us how you really feel. That was <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>blasting the Fed for being too aggressive on interests rate hike. <person><nameText>President Trump's </nameText></person>very forward and obvious frustration with the Fed, well not doing so well with some folks but the head of JPMorgan Chase, Mr. Jamie Dimon is defending the President saying, and I, \"I have never seen a President who wanted interest rates to go up.\" I think he's right on that one. Who would?</p><p>Joining me right now, the host of \"Making Money\" on the Fox Business network, Charles Payne, soon to be host of \"Making Money\" at 2:00 p.m., more on that in just a minute. Also Moody's Chief Economist, John Lonski.</p><p>John, yes, I don't blame him. Who the heck wants the cost of money to go up?</p><p>JOHN LONSKI, MOODY'S CHIEF ECONOMIST: You've got to be more diplomatic about your criticism of the Fed. You can't go out there because, say that they're lunatics or whatever he was saying. Jerome Powell is not crazy.</p><p>REGAN: You know what though, I know a lot of people are saying that. But, you know, this is a President who has a different style entirely, right. You know, he says what he thinks. And I'm sure there are plenty of Presidents that thought the Fed was doing a lousy job and acting crazy, but maybe they just never said it quite so explicitly.</p><p>LONSKI: That's right. And, you know, the fed has to keep an eye on financial markets. We now have the, you know, the overall market has sold off sharply thus far in the month of October. It's clearly higher. We have certain segments, interest sensitive segments of the market. For instance, that index of housing, sectors stock prices this afternoon is down 25 percent for the year-to-date. That's versus the overall market up by two percent.</p><p>And moreover, motor vehicle industry stock prices. So they're median decline for the year-to-date is roughly 23 percent. That's not good. And I think that's telling the Fed that perhaps there is reason to proceed with greater caution, not only when they hike rates --</p><p>REGAN: I see where it run.</p><p>LONSKI: -- but when they talk about rate hikes.</p><p>REGAN: IE, John Lonski agrees with <person><nameText>President Trump. </nameText></person>You don't want to see the Fed, maybe they're not crazy --</p><p>LONSKI: But with Jerome Powell is very intelligent, very wise man.</p><p>REGAN: Wow.</p><p>LONSKI: And I'm pretty sure that they're doing the best job possible.</p><p>REGAN: I'm pretty sure that even though he's the President of the United States, Charles Payne, the head of the Federal Reserve needs to be independent. And I would expect him to be independent. So he may hear a little of the chatter and a little of the noise, but really it comes down to the data, shouldn't it?</p><p>CHARLES PAYNE, FOX BUSINESS ANCHOR: It should come down to the data and the Fed has said over and over that it does. And I got to tell you the official communiques that they put out like the so-called dot plot in the FOMC, you know, communique. They suggest a very level-headed Fed that's not going to wreck the economy, but it's the comments that are made in his speech because almost every single day someone at the Fed is giving a speech somewhere around the world.</p><p>And I tell you, starting to roll markets in. And you know, there shouldn't be any sacred cows out there politi -- specifically on a political side. And why should the Fed be completely independent in the sense that it's unanswerable to anyone? It's not federal. It doesn't matter. It's sort of scary for the average person out there.</p><p>REGAN: Yes.</p><p>PAYNE: John just talking about housing being under pressure, autos being under pressure, that we're talking about the average American house hold. If the Fed is worried about, you know, the larger institutions, you know.</p><p>And then as far as <person><nameText>President Trump's </nameText></person>criticism, we went from 2008, 2014 with zero rate hikes. And this one in 2015, Janet Yellen figures she made a mistake, and she waited until after the election and she raised rates again. So, I can see --</p><p>REGAN: So you feel that many feels like, hey, that's fair.</p><p>PAYNES: Right.</p><p>REGAN: What were you doing for President Obama? And, you know, maybe send a little of that my way.</p><p>But here's the difference, John Lonski, in this environment right now we have a President who does understand the economy and understands that, you know, you want to unleash those spirits, those economic spirits, what do you, you lower taxes, you lessen regulation. That has translated into growth. We didn't get that from the Obama administration. So the Fed was only game in town.</p><p>LONSKI: And the President understands commercial real estate very well. And he must be getting some information that things are beginning to soften in a once very strong sector because of higher short-term interest rates and long-term interest rates.</p><p>And let's not forget, this has to be brought up, but for the first time in memory, perhaps history, we have the Fed firming monetary policy on two fronts. Not only are they hiking Fed funds and pushing short-term rates directly higher but they're passive reduction regarding their holdings of U.S. Treasury bonds is also putting some upward pressure on long-term interest rates.</p><p>So again, the Fed's got --</p><p>REGAN: OK.</p><p>LONSKI: -- to proceed very carefully.</p><p>REGAN: But very cautiously.</p><p>LONSKI: Yes.</p><p>REGAN: I mean, this is the delicate dance, right, that they're always walking. I mean, in the meantime, there are some legitimate or growing concerns I should say, Charles Payne, about inflation.</p><p>PAYNE: Yes. There are, there are, although, you know, this week what we saw inflation in the PPI number, airline travel went through the roof. You know no wonder delta had a pretty good earnings report. But then we got the CPI report yesterday, it was relatively benign.</p><p>And so, there are signs of inflation that's the kind of classical inflation signals that you would think that the Fed would be, you know, yellow flags or red flags. Although, we know they want to be ahead of the curve. There's just --</p><p>REGAN: Improve it (ph). They need to forget being as -- they're usually behind anyway.</p><p>PAYNE: Yes. Yes.</p><p>LONSKI: Today we can have report on import price inflation. Less than one percent for consumer goods, less than one percent for all imports excluding petroleum imports.</p><p>REGAN: All right. Well, here's the one --</p><p>LONSKI: That's not a sign of inflation taking off.</p><p>REGAN: If there's not enough and there's not enough wage growth, you know, maybe --</p><p>LONSKI: What's the hurry? What's -- there's no sense of urgency for rate hikes, that's it.</p><p>REGAN: All right. You and <person><nameText>President Trump.</nameText></person></p><p>LONSKI: But Jerome Powell --</p><p>REGAN: Its given Jay Powell appear to your mind.</p><p>LONSKI: -- level at no. Yes.</p><p>REGAN: All right. Good to -- hey, Charles, I'm really excited for you.</p><p>PAYNE: Thank you.</p><p>REGAN: This is a great audience, you know --</p><p>PAYNE: Thank you.</p><p>REGAN: -- here at 2:00 p.m. And you're all going to see Charles beginning Monday, that's this Monday, 2:00 p.m. October 15th, \"Making Money with Charles Payne,\" moves to 2:00, and well, I'm moving somewhere else. I'll tell you all about that next.</p><p>REGAN: All right. It's my last day on \"The Intelligence Report\". So this market better close up, right? We're up at 128 points. Let's hope it holds throughout the hour.</p><p>Big news? I shared this a little while ago with you. I'll tell you again all about it. I'm going to primetime, 8:00 p.m., starting Monday right after my good friend Lou, Lou Dobbs is on from 7:00 to 8:00. I will be on from 8:00 to 9:00. Kennedy will follow at 9:00. We are live at night right here on Fox Business.</p><p>I'm really excited about it. I, you know, I do want to point out just what an incredible three years it has been on this show. I mean, we created this show with you, really. With you. You tuned in and it's thanks to you that we're able to cream the competition for the last three years, something I'm really extremely proud of.</p><p>And it's thanks to you and it's thanks to this news cycle that, you know, we're expanding. We're expanding so we will be live, I will be live at 8:00 p.m. every night. The news keeps happening. It's a 24/7 news cycle.</p><p>We're on the front lines of history and I'm there with you, reporting on all of it. We analyze, we present both sides, you make the decisions about what is best for you, your family, and your wallet, right?</p><p>I want to thank -- I have an amazing team. I want to thank everybody on this team. So many of you in the control room right now have been with me from the very beginning, from the first day I was ever in this chair on this little set that we created, and it's been wonderful.</p><p>I've gotten to know all of you and your families and you've certainly gotten to know mine, including all three of the kids which love to come by and hang out at work and in the studio. So I'm going to miss all of you. Some of you are coming with me, of course, and I'm so excited for this new chapter and what we can do and what we can accomplish.</p><p>We have so many tremendous journalists here at Fox Business and we are in a tremendous news cycle. So this is the value add that we bring.</p><p>It's going to be a little different at home, so my husband and I had to get a little creative on this front because we used to have family dinner at 6:00 p.m. every night. Now it's going to be family breakfast at 6:30, when I take the kids to school.</p><p>And then it's following the news cycle for you. I'm looking forward to it. I'm going to see you Monday night.</p><p>Gosh, I hope this market ends up, Liz Claman, 137 points. We got to hang on to this one.</p><p>LIZ CLAMAN, FOX BUSINESS ANCHOR: Yes. Yes. Let's give you a green good- bye. Trish, another live --</p><p>REGAN: Thank you.</p><p>CLAMAN: -- presence in primetime on Fox Business.</p><p>REGAN: Charles is going to be --</p><p>CLAMAN: Go. Go. Go.</p><p>REGAN: -- right here at 2:00 p.m.</p><p>CLAMAN: Yes. And we will welcome Charles and we wish you the best of luck, Trish.</p><p>REGAN: Thank you Liz.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INTELR-2018101201cb232</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXBNT2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TGB-VHG1-DXH2-6166-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">437067</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7343\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>INTELLIGENCE REPORT</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"10\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>October 12, 2018 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Show</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0001YLV</classCode><className>NVIDIA CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

It's the way it is.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">REGAN:  Again, the market has to close up, right?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">CAVUTO:  It's got to.</p><p>REGAN:  It's my last day here at 2:00 o'clock.</p><p>CAVUTO:  It will.  It will.</p><p>REGAN:  All right.  Thank you.  Fingers crossed.</p><p>CAVUTO:  All righty.</p><p>REGAN:  All right.  Thanks, Neil.</p><p>Breaking right now, everyone, another wild day on Wall Street, we're  looking at a Dow that's up, right now, 95 points after being up 400 points  at the open and then it dipped a little down into negative territory, now  we're back up.  Let's see what happened.  It's a wild ride.  We got a live  report from the NYSE straight ahead.</p><p>I am Trish Regan.  Welcome, everyone, to the final edition, dare I say, the  final edition of \"The Intelligence Report.\"</p><p>Also breaking today, an American pastor who has been detained in Turkey for  the last two years is finally coming back home.  President Trump thrilled  with the news, tweeting in all caps, \"Pastor Brunson just released, will be  home soon!\"  We have a live report coming up from the White House straight  ahead.</p><p>And take a look here at this devastating video coming to us from Mexico  Beach, Florida.  The small coastal town decimated by Hurricane Michael.  We  have a live report from Panama City, Florida on the cleanup and relief  efforts.</p><p>But first, we're going to Deirdre Bolton who's on the floor of the NYSE for  more on today's wild ride. What's causing it?</p><p>DEIRDRE BOLTON, FOX BUSINESS ANCHOR:  It's right, Trish, especially  following the previous two days that we've had.  So the big question of  course today is can these gains hold?</p><p>So right now I want to call your attention to the tech stocks.  These had  been the most beaten down in the past of two sessions combined.  They are  what is holding up the gains as we see right now.</p><p>So I'm going to go through some of the names that you know well.  We have  Apple, Amazon, Google and NVIDIA, I should say.  Alphabet Google still down  for the week but very much the strongest mover today.  Of course we pay a  lot of attention because as far as the weighting go in the S&amp;P 500 we know  that tech by market cap is the heaviest, the strongest as far as the  industry groups go.</p><p>Trish, we're also focused on the financials, as you know four banks  reported before the earnings started.  They remain actually the biggest  drag right now on the broader markets.  So interestingly enough, JPMorgan  shares (ph) beat on the top and the bottom line earlier.  This was mover to  the upside that has since changed.</p><p>And it seems as if traders are focused on one key part of the outlook  statement.  I'm going to read it directly.  The non-interest revenue growth  will be between seven percent and eight percent.</p><p>But the thing that is concerning a lot of investors in the stock, and  perhaps even in the broader industry is market dependent.  Meaning, let's  see how our business does outside of the profitable business that we expect  to have by loaning out money as rates go higher.</p><p>As for some of the other financials, PNC is down.  It has actually had a  very rough week.  Wells Fargo and Citi, the other two companies that  reported earnings before the bell, little bit of mixed.  Basically one  beating on revenue, slight miss on earnings, one beating on earnings,  slight miss on revenue, both of those stocks heading marginally higher.</p><p>So, Trish, the push and pull is basically tech versus financials.  Back to  you.</p><p>REGAN:  All right.  Deirdre Bolton, thank you very much.</p><p>Joining me right now onset, our very own Kristina Partsinevelos.  We also  have Kingsview Asset Management Chief Investment Officer, Scott Martin.   Good to see both of you both guys.</p><p>I believe -- do we have Paul Dietrich with us too?  Another investor.  He's  joining -- there we go.  There you -- I knew you're around there, Paul.</p><p>PAUL DIETRICH, FAIRFAX GLOBAL MARKET CEO:  Hi, Trish.</p><p>REGAN:  I'm going to start with you.  Wild market, is this the way of the  future right now or is this just a little blip?</p><p>DIETRICH:  What this is, is, this is a reversion to mean normalizing  correction.  One of the things that's happened over this past, actually  more than a year is that you've had five big tech stocks that have  dominated the performance as of the end of August, they were represented 47  percent of the performance of the S&amp;P 500.  And what we've seen basically,  really for the last month or so, is the tech stocks have been going down  and they're reverting to mean of a more normalized stock market trend.  And  they're very, very high in P.E.s.</p><p>And so, I see this as a very healthy correction in that, you know, the tech  stocks are coming back in line with the rest of the 495 stocks in the S&amp;P  500.</p><p>REGAN:  Kristina?</p><p>KRISTINA PARTSINEVELOS, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT:  I think we can't just  solely focus on tech.  If you look yesterday I was on the New York Stock  Exchange 2:43 p.m., just the intraday volume dropped so much, that we  haven't seen a drop like that in eight years since the \"flash crash.\"  So I  think that based of the traders I was speaking to -- volatility is going to  continue to be an issue.</p><p>We're heading -- earnings started today at JPMorgan.  JPMorgan is supposed  to be good right now.  Their revenue climbed higher, up what, 24 percent  for the quarter, the third quarter.  Sorry, profits up 24 percent.  And yet  you're seeing that stock down today which you would expect it to be better  like Deirdre brought up.  The guidance is concerning.</p><p>So I think going into the earning season, looking into the future, we're  going to be paying close attention to the guidance of a lot of these  companies.</p><p>REGAN:  Well, you know, right now, earning seem, actually Scott, pretty  good, right?  I mean, so far so good.  We've got strong economic  fundamentals.  I do wonder if some people are saying to themselves, wait a  second, you know what?  I can make a little more money on the C.D. at the  local bank because Treasury yields are going up, interest rates are going  up.  And so, is this a bit of a rotation as well and that people now have  more opportunity in the investment landscape?</p><p>SCOTT MARTN, KINGSVIEW ASSET MANAGEMENT CIO:  It could be.  Now, gosh, I  hope that mom and pop sitting at home aren't thinking about that, you know,  two percent or 2.5 percent C.D. just yet, Trish, because I think --</p><p>REGAN:  Well, Scott, you know that I'm using that to characterize something  broader, right?</p><p>MARTIN:  OK.  Sure.</p><p>REGAN:  Which is that investors are saying to themselves, \"OK, I have more  optionality.  It used to be equities are the only game in town.  Well maybe  I can put a little money in fixed income now.\"</p><p>MARTIN:  Fair play, right, exactly.  Maybe the 10-year bond.  And so you're  right.  That's providing an alternative.  And I to the point that k-parts  made was visibility is in question here.</p><p>I get it that earning are good, you know in fact, I think the bar, at least  psychologically based on some of the preannouncements has been lowered, so  that's good.  But the visibility is cloudy.  I mean, you look at the  incident surrounding tariffs.  GDP obviously going forward, it look strong,  but then the job market is kind of maybe leveling off here, I mean, still  growing but not growing at the higher rates that we saw it earlier this  year.</p><p>REGAN:  Yes, but is that enough to cause you to just say, you know, throw  in the towel and go?</p><p>SCOTT:  Well, what it could do though, here's the thing, in highly  psychological market as Paul mentioned, you know, this is a market, Trish,  that could take that as a reason to sell first and ask questions later.   And that's the story of say, certainly yesterday and the day before.</p><p>REGAN:  How does the Fed factor into all of this, Paul?  By the way the  President is not too happy with the Fed right now.  Most presidents don't  really like the Fed.</p><p>DIETRICH:  Yes.  Exactly.  Yes, I mean, --</p><p>REGAN:  Maybe Obama did.  He should have anyway.</p><p>DIETRICH:  -- let's face it.  This is an election year and President Trump  is really promoting the State of the U.S. economy which is really good and  it's firing on all cylinders.  And so when you see a stock market  collection like we've seen over the last few days, you know he has to blame  someone, and so he is blaming the Federal Reserve.</p><p>I think this is normal. This is politics. But --</p><p>SCOTT:  Dangerous.</p><p>DIETRICH:  No, no, no.</p><p>REGAN:  No, by the way, no, it's not dangerous.</p><p>DIETRICH:  Not if it's all rhetoric.</p><p>REGAN:  It's only if the Fed actually listened but, Scott, I'm going to  give Jay Powell a little more credit than that.</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS:  Oh, Jay Powell actually come out in broadcast interview  with NPR Marketplace that he's going to follow through with this.  He said  that he's going to stick to the facts, and what the economy is showing, not  a political play.  And it shouldn't be a political play.</p><p>REGAN:  No, absolutely.</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS:  You have presidents who have been very --</p><p>MARTIN: Reverse the lines.</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS:  -- critical of monetary policy.  But in this case look at  where interest rates are now.  Look at it historically, they've been very,  very low.  The economy is growing.</p><p>Yes, we had inflation coming at 2.3 percent, but we have a very, very tight  labor force.  You have Walgreen saying that they're going to increase their  salaries, Amazon announcing that $15 per hour.  So there's possibly this  inflation fear right now.</p><p>REGAN:  You know we were talking to the gentleman, the founder, Jerry Fine  of Oak Tree Asset Management just the other day, and one thing that he  mentioned was that a lot of the companies he speaks to regularly are  starting to say, places like Walmart for example, you know, inflation is  running a little higher than what you might think.  That wages are growing  faster than 2.8 percent.  And their production costs are increasing.</p><p>And so the Fed needs to take all that into account.  And that, Kristina,  their job is to make sure that, you know, things don't get too overheated,  right?</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS:  Right.</p><p>REGAN:  Because then you get problems down the road.  But it's a tightrope,  the Fed got to walk.</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS:  Which is -- it's very difficult position for Jay Powell to  be in.  But I think also we should preface that there is two different  kinds of inflation.  You also have manmade inflation when you have the  tariffs come into play.</p><p>So the fact that literally 50 percent of all Chinese goods that enter the  United States at this moment are being taxed.  And potentially could be all  100 percent.  That inevitably will have an effect on companies, on us.</p><p>REGAN:  Yes, no, I get you, I hear you.  But Scott, I think that that's  kind of a short-term play.  How are you thinking about China right now?   And you heard me say, if we don't start dealing with this, and the theft of  intellectual property, $600 billion a year, if we don't deal with it now  it's going to be a whole lot harder to deal with it in the future.</p><p>MARTIN:  I agree.  To your question, how is China?  I don't know, look at  their stock market, it's absolutely blasted.</p><p>REGAN:  It's not good.</p><p>MARTIN:  No, not good.</p><p>So, you're right, that probably brings them to the table, because honestly,  Trish, before this tariff talk really heated up, I mean if you go back even  to last year, there were problems under the surface in China, anyway  economically.  So now this is really starting to hurt them.</p><p>Your point with Kristina is good about inflation because if you look at  material cost guides, those are dropping by enlarge around the world.  You  know it's not that hard to produce things anymore.  There's a lot of price  competitiveness other than oil that we've seen bump up recently.</p><p>So, to me the inflation story is all about wages and it's nowhere.</p><p>REGAN:  All right, so Scott, are you buying right now or you're going to  sit by the sidelines and wait?</p><p>MARTIN:  Yes, sit by the fire, and maybe have a cigar and think about it.   But I will be buying probably next week.  I think you got to --</p><p>REGAN:  All right.</p><p>MARTIN:  -- let the psychological kind of walkout here, though.</p><p>REGAN:  You should have bought yesterday.  Paul, your thoughts, final  thoughts.</p><p>MARTIN:  Or maybe this morning.  Right.</p><p>DIETRICH:  The story that nobody is talking about with inflation, because  inflation has been a problem in the past, but -- and we've only seen for  the last 60 years bad inflation where the government spends too much and  then has to print money that causes inflation.  But there's good inflation.   You know when wages are going up, and prices are going up because people  can price in the cost, that creates a virtues circle and government doesn't  have to print money.</p><p>MARTIN:  It's natural.</p><p>REGAN:  Right.  And listen, you don't want to have to fight deflation,  that's whole other can of worms that incredibly --</p><p>MARTIN:  Can't win that fight.</p><p>REGAN:  Yes.  It's good to see you guys.  Thank you, Kristina, Paul, Scott.</p><p>I do want to point out we've got breaking news coming in to us right now.   The President says he will be traveling to Florida and to Georgia early  next week to survey some of the damage that are caused by Hurricane  Michael.  This is the tweet that he just issued.</p><p>He said, \"People have no idea how hard Hurricane Michael has hit the great  state of Georgia.  I will be visiting both Florida and Georgia early next  week.  We are working hard on every area and every state that was hit, we  are with you.\"</p><p>Also breaking today, American Pastor Andrew Bronson is on his way home  after being released by a Turkish court.  So what does that mean for U.S.  and Turkey relations going forward?  I'm going to asking New York  Congressman, Tom Reed, that very question next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>REGAN:  Another roller coaster ride here but at least for now anyway, we're  in positive territory.  You can see we've been all over the place.  Up as  much as 400 in change as we started the day.  And then down, well, now,  still up, barely.</p><p>Meanwhile, we've got some good news out of Turkey today as the American  Pastor Andrew Brunson is now on a plane home after a court ruled he should  be released.  He had been sentenced to more than three years on terrorism  charges despite living in Turkey for more than 20 years.</p><p>President Trump had imposed sanctions, some pretty strict sanctions on  Turkey in an attempt to secure his release.  And he tweeted, \"Pastor  Brunson just released, will be home soon!\"  He is going to feel, I would  imagine feel pretty good about that.</p><p>Edward Lawrence is live at the White House with the latest</p><p>And Edward, fill us in.</p><p>EDWARD LAWRENCE, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT:  Yes.  I can tell you right  now that Pastor Brunson, we understand, is on a plane on his way to  Germany, to an air force base to get medical treatment there just to make  sure that he is OK.  Then White House sources are saying he's going to be  on a plane to Andrews Air Force Base arriving tomorrow at 6:00 a.m.  There  might be some ceremony but he's obviously relieved.  His family, they said  they are just relieved about this news.</p><p>In fact his lawyer says he thanked everyone for their prayers.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JAY SEKULOW, AMERICAN CENTER FOR LAW AND JUSTICE:  Many of you have been  praying for this day.  I want to thank you.  I know the pastor and his  entire family want to thank you as well.  And of course, a huge thank you  to the President and his team for securing the release of Andrew Brunson.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LAWRENCE:  Now a Turkish court actually convicted Pastor Andrew Brunson on  terrorism charges, gave him little more than three years, but then give him  time served and they lifted the travel ban which is the reason he's able to  now leave the country.  He's gotten on a plane as we said.  The White House  saying that there was no deal made with Turkey to make this happen.  So  nothing was on the table.</p><p>Turkey may have been doing this to garner some goodwill.  They are looking  for help with the investigation on the missing columnist that went into the  Saudi consulate in Turkey.</p><p>Now officials in Turkey believe that he was killed inside that consulate,  Jammal Khashoggi.  Now, they say that they have audio and video evidence  that point to that effect.  \"The Wall Street Journal\" reporting that that  evidence has been shown to U.S. intelligence agencies.</p><p>Now, Saudi's officially said that he left even though video shows him going  in but not coming out.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ADAM KINZINGER (R-IL), HOUSE FOREIGN RELATIONS COMMITTEE:  If it's true, it  appears that it is, that he was murdered in their consulate by an  assassination team, there needs to be some significant consequences to  that.  I think that's maybe eventually targeted sanctions on individuals,  that, you know, any other host of things available to this administration.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LAWRENCE:  Now the President saying that even if the Saudi government is  proven to be behind this disappearance, the U.S. may not cancel its arms  deal that it has with Saudi Arabia which includes fighter jets.  The  President saying that does not want to see the jobs go to Russia.</p><p>Now on another note here, the senior White House official telling us that  they are moving in the direction for a meeting between with the Chinese  president, President Xi Jinping, and President Donald Trump next month at  the G20 summit, a bilateral, one-on-one meeting between the two.  China  trying to avoid the 25 percent tariffs that will be bumped up at January  1st.  They are worried about their market and the effects that will happen.</p><p>The Chinese president possibly trying to get the President to back off  those tariffs.  Now, the President would like China to step up and make  some changes, at least move forward towards a trade deal with the U.S.</p><p>Trish?</p><p>REGAN:  Thank you very much, Edward Lawrence.</p><p>All right.  Joining me right now with reaction, we have Republican  Congressman Tom Reed of New York.  Good to have you here, sir.</p><p>Congressman, I'm going to start first on the China front.  Do you think  they might actually be willing to give a little here?  I mean, we are their  biggest customer.</p><p>TOM REED (R), NEW YORK CONGRESSMAN: I think they are --</p><p>REGAN:  Not doing them any favors, right?  This whole sort of \"trade war\"  if you can call it that, it's not helping China?</p><p>REED:  No.  I would agree with that assessment.  This is not sustainable  for China.  They need to come to the table.  And I believe that is exactly  where these talks will lead that they are recognizing.  That it is not in  their interests, nor in America's interest to continue a protracted trade  war.  It's time for us to come together.  It's time for China to be held  accountable for their unfair trade practices.  And I think they are in a  position to have to sit at the table to resolve this.</p><p>REGAN:  You know, Congressman the difference, however is that in China they  don't have to get elected.  I mean you got to get elected every two years,  right?  And consequently if the economy starts to turn and if corporations  starts getting kind of upset including some of, say your donor, sir, that  they can't access the Chinese markets like they used to because of all of  these problems, then at what point does it start to really bite into the  ability of American politicians to really do what's best here where just to  confront the problem?</p><p>REED:  Well I think Trish, if you look at from the other perspective.  You  know, China has -- they're not subject to election, but I will tell you  they have tremendous amount of internal strife.  If their people don't have  an expanding economy to go to work, they can't put food on table, they  can't put a roof over their head.  That causes a tremendous amount of the  stability and instability in China.</p><p>And when you look at what China is doing in regards to a debt to GDP, it's  not sustainable there either.  So China cannot withstand these.  And I  understand the political pressure, but this elephant needs to be  confronted.  And that's what we're doing.</p><p>REGAN:  Why, why is everybody --</p><p>REED:  We're holding them accountable once and for all.</p><p>REGAN:  --kind of ignore it.  I mean for -- why is it that -- I mean we --  and I shouldn't say they ignore it.  Actually I've talked to former  Treasury Secretary Bob Rubin about this and he pointed out that China is  indeed a big, big problem.  And he tried to address it during the Clinton  years.  But everybody has tried, right?</p><p>Tim Geithner, I remember trying to take this one and spend time in China  trying to deal with this.  The theft of intellectual property is a real  problem for us.  And yet, no one was quite as vocal about it shall we say  as this President.  Is it because they feared to this talk of a trade war?   Do they fear a backlash from American CEOs that would say, \"No, no, we need  to be over there, we want to be over there, it's a big market for us?\"</p><p>REED:  I think that pressure was there.  But now obviously under this  administration and with our President, we're seeing a disruptive policy put  on the table.  And China can't take the risk of not having America follow  the status quo, the traditional path if you would.  And so what I believe  is happening is they're recognizing that President Trump is serious.  And  that he is serious about holding them accountable for these unfair trade  practices.  And now is the time you're seeing results in China's movement,  in their policy shifts to come to the table to recognize they have to  resolve these issues.</p><p>REGAN:  Real quick, before I let you go.  It's very good news that the  Pastor has been released . Does this show you that sanctions can actually  work, Congressman?</p><p>REED:  Absolutely, and you can get results through strength.  And that's  what the administration sent to Turkey.  Is what it said to Turkey is we  are not going to allow an American citizen to be held captive.  And now we  should all celebrate as Americans, as Democrats and Republicans that Pastor  Brunson is coming home and coming home to his family.  That is a joint  celebration every American should be proud of.</p><p>REGAN:  Here, here, I agree.  Thank you so much.  Congressman Reed, good to  see you.</p><p>REED:  Thanks.</p><p>REGAN:  All right, we're going to be following these markets again  throughout the hour as we watch Dow that's up 52 points right now, 25,101  is the level.  Stay with us.</p><p>Residents, meanwhile in the Florida Panhandle, they are coming to terms  with the utter destruction that Hurricane Michael had left behind.  We have  a live report on cleanup and relief efforts coming up next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>REGAN:  Very sad scene in Florida right now.  In fact, everywhere you look  in the Florida Panhandle, what you see is utter devastation.  You have  beach front homes have been completely obliterated.  Only slabs of concrete  remaining, entire communities actually destroyed when category 4 Hurricane  Michael roared ashore this week.  This destruction is being called  catastrophic.</p><p>Billions of dollars will be needed to rebuild.  And now 13 deaths are being  blamed on the most powerful hurricane to hit the U.S. mainland in a  generation.</p><p>And Michael is not done yet.  Causing flash flooding, heavy rains as far  away as Virginia.  Connell McShane is joining me right now on the phone  from one of the hardest hit areas, Panama City, Florida.</p><p>Hey, Connell.</p><p>CONNELL MCSHANE, FOX BUSINESS NEWS ANCHOR (via telephone):  Hi there Trish.</p><p>We're just east of Panama City right now.  We've been moving around a lot  today as much as we can.  And we've been encountering some of the same  difficulties as the people here are in trying to recover from Hurricane  Michael and as the first-responders are been trying to help those people so  badly hurt by this hurricane.</p><p>Let me start in Mexico Beach where we spent part of our afternoon and  evening yesterday before the curfew went into place.  Well I'm sure you've  seen what we'll be able to show now some of the video of Mexico Beach that  we and our other Fox colleagues were able to shoot particularly some of the  aerial shots where you can see just how Hurricane Michael caused so much  destruction.  And that's the word, not damage, it's destruction.</p><p>There were homes that were buried a day before the hurricane which just  aren't there anymore.  It's not as if they were damaged.  They were  completely wiped out.  I was speaking to some of the National Guard troops  who are assigned to Mexico Beach, one in particular told me he's from this  area, has worked a number of hurricanes and never seen anything even close  to this bad.</p><p>Now when you get back to the area you mentioned, Panama City where we were  earlier in the day, there are parts of it in particular in Panama City  Beach are starting to recover.  Even some power that's starting to come  back.  But those few and far between as of this morning, 90 percent of that  town in Bay County was still without power.</p><p>We move to the east where we are.  Then you encounter the communication  difficulties that are really making things doubly difficult for everybody  trying to respond to this hurricane.  And that's why I'm speaking to you  now on this side of the road on a satellite phone because in an area where  the cell phone service was perfect yesterday it no longer works at all  today.  So that's one of the things the companies no doubt are trying to  get in here and get their towers back up and running.  But it depends on  which service provider you have.  For example, many of us have AT&amp;T and  that was working in some areas beautifully.</p><p>Many of the people who live here do not have Verizon or Sprint or what have  you and they weren't working at all.  So, it depends where you are, what  service provider you have.  And people are having difficult even telling  someone that they're having trouble.</p><p>And, you know, we're running to a lady earlier for example, we've been able  to ride out the storm.  She's OK.  The tree that came down, a giant oak  tree fell into the street, thank goodness, not into her house but she was  having difficulty telling her family she was OK.</p><p>Finally, she was able to walk up of a block and randomly Facebook Messenger  it came on her phone even though it didn't seem that she has service  she  leave (ph) to give a quick message t some of her family members.  So that's  the kind of thing that it making hard to recover from this hurricane.  The  idea that communicating is so difficult.</p><p>I will say Trish, the transportation has improved a little.  It's all  relative but some of the road there were completely closed yesterday are  now starting to reopen.  Thanks for the hard work of some of the  professionals and also some of the volunteers, neighbors helping neighbors  pack with their saws and chainsaws and whatever (ph) to be able to cutdown  some of tress and open the roads up.</p><p>So FEMA and the other authorities can get in.  But that's a long way to go,  Trish.  It really is something else.</p><p>REGAN:  Wow, quite an aftermath.  Connell, thank you very much.</p><p>All right.  Roller coaster here on the market up 81 right now.  We've been  up as much as 400 then we were down.  So, where we're headed right now?   It's a Friday.  So investors are going into the weekend and of course, you  know, a lot of this is gone to center around what happened come midterm  elections, right?  Because economic policy is going to be influenced by  whoever is in office.  Our panel is going to debate all that next</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>REGAN:  All right.  We're watching what has become a very volatile market  this week.  A couple rough days we had but today is looking a little  better.</p><p>We're up 50 -- nearly 50 points.  We had been trading up as much as 414  though.  So, so much for that, but at least we're out of negative  territory.  The big question is, what are these markets really mean for  Republicans come the midterms?</p><p>Joining me right now, James Freeman of \"The Wall Street Journal\" and Former  Advisor to Bill Clinton, Doug Schoen.  Good to see you both.</p><p>DOUG SCHOEN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Good to see you.</p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, \"THE WALL STREET JOURNAL\":  Good to be here, Trish, thanks.</p><p>REGAN:  Doug, I'm going to start with you.  I mean people been feeling  pretty good about the economy.  I'd tell you all the economic data points  do some very, very strong fundamentals.  But, you know, when people open up  their 401k's and they see that maybe it wasn't as good as it was last  month, what kind of effect does that have on psychology for voters?</p><p>SCHOEN:  You know, Trish, at this point, not to duck the question, it's  hard to tell.  Because usually these things take a little bit longer to  play out than what you're describing which is, you know, the beginning of  November, they get their 401k's.  They're down and so they get less  inclined to vote Republican.</p><p>Usually takes three to six months for the impact of a brief downturn and it  has been brief and has been swift to be felt.  So, as we sit here today  can't say really anything.  The polling shows if anything the Republicans  up in the last week or so, certainly in the Senate races.</p><p>REGAN:  James, I personally, and I said this earlier in the show.  I think  is a blip.  I mean, I think there are very, very good fundamentals right  now.</p><p>I think, you know, the China thing yes, it's a little bit of a threat but  we'll make it through all of that.  And as long as we continue to see wage  growth and job growth.  We're heading in the right direction and economic  growth.  But you know, nonetheless, if you have a market that's trading  lower, I don't necessarily think it will in November.  But if it were to-- </p><p>FREEMAN:    Yes.</p><p>REGAN:  -- how does that influence in your view Republican voters?</p><p>FREEMAN:  Well, I think the economy is a win for Republicans barring some  huge, sort of catastrophic event.  As you said the fundamentals are very  strong.  We just really got another reminder that this morning with the  bank earnings</p><p>These are companies that get a pretty good window into the U.S. consumer.   People paying bills on time.  They're obviously able to find jobs.   Earnings are good for the companies, the economy is growing.  So I think  that's all good and that would suggest this is a blip.</p><p>The sort of conventional wisdom is maybe the economy is so good since there  are almost no economic problems.  People kind of take that for granted and  maybe they decide on other things.</p><p>REGAN:  And that's was so hard, right, in midterms?</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.</p><p>REGAN:  I mean, you have to motivate --</p><p>FREEMAN:  Right.</p><p>REGAN:  -- voters get out there.  And if they're feeling kind a OK, then,  Doug, you run the risk of complacency.  I do think Kavanaugh changed that,  however.  If there was any complacency among the Republican base, watching  what happened with Judge Kavanaugh may have them thinking differently?</p><p>SCHOEN:  Well, certainly that's the initial indication but we've got you  know, some 20 something days to go until the election.  And, whether there  are twists and turns in terms of enthusiasm and attitudes, really remains  to be seen.</p><p>A bunch of the most recent midterms have swung in the last week to 10 days.   So I think it's not clear what's going to happen but I think James is  right.  If you look at all the indicators and certainly, Trish, you as  well, it's more -- much more good news economically for the Republicans,  notwithstanding that midterms typically go for the out party, the  opposition.</p><p>REGAN:  Yes.  So, is all this at risk, James?  I mean, if the Republicans  are not successful in midterms?  Because you know, we've heard many  Democrats say they like to reverse the tax cut and they like to tax the  wealthy?</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.</p><p>REGAN:  And tax everyone else along the way, including corporations et  cetera.  So, is some of this policy really at risk?</p><p>FREEMAN:  Well, I think you have to say this at risk because depending on  how big -- let's just imagine a big Democratic wave, if president Trump  then feels the need to negotiate to do deals, to strike the \"art of the  deal\" with Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer, that could be a very different  policy mix.  It's -- obviously if you look at most of his history Donald  Trump was not a super conservative guy.  Does he evolve back if he is  dealing with Congressional leadership with big democratic majorities?  So  that would be a question.</p><p>REGAN:  Hey, Doug, can I just ask?</p><p>SCHOEN:  Yes.</p><p>REGAN:  Looking ahead to 2020, do you think Mike Bloomberg is going to be  in the ring?</p><p>SCHOEN:  You know, I don't think he's made a final decision.  Certainly  made it clear the other day that he was going to do everything he could to  stand up to policies that the Trump administration is pursued, that he  disagrees with.  He is spending obviously close to $100 million on the  midterm elections.  So whatever the mayor or the former mayor does, he will  be a force to be reckoned with.  That's for sure.</p><p>REGAN:  And he's never registered as a Democrat.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Well, you know, if he likes to have --</p><p>SCHOEN:  He is now.</p><p>FREEMAN:  -- pro-business Democrats again.  This -- for this reason I kind  of doubt whether he can go anywhere.</p><p>REGAN:  Yes.</p><p>FREEMAN:  But it would be nice to see a kind of a market-oriented voice  back in that party.</p><p>REGAN:  Yes.  It would be the alternative which is the Alexandria Cortez  and the Bernie Sanders camp.</p><p>FREEMAN:  A 100 percent.</p><p>REGAN:  We don't need the socialist there.  Anyway, good, red-blooded  American capitalism and that's what the nation was founded on.  Doug,  James, good to see you guys.  Thank you so much.</p><p>SCHOEN:  Thank you so much, Trish.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Thanks.</p><p>REGAN:  All right 29 million Facebook users have had their information  stolen in the massive security breach that happened there last month.   Facebook says the information included everything from names and contact  information to more personal profile information like places that people  checked into and the devices used to access Facebook.</p><p>Facebook said users can check if they were affected by the attack, visiting  Facebook's Online Help Center.</p><p>Tesla is giving its customers until Monday to place car orders eligible for  a $7500 federal tax credit.  Under federal law, the full tax credit lasts  until the car company reaches 200,000 sales in 2010 which it definitely did  in July.  You know, any vehicles ordered by Monday are expected to be  delivered by the end of the year.</p><p>President Trump sparking outraged and an outcry after slamming the Fed for  being too aggressive, t does he have a point?  Is the Fed getting a little  too happy about these rate hikes?  Our panel is going to weigh in on all  that, I'll see you here next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  We have interest rates  going up at a clip that's much faster than certainly a lot of people  including myself would have anticipated.  I think the Fed is out of  control.  I think what they're doing is wrong.  I think the Fed is far too  stringent and they're making a mistake.</p><p>They're so tight.  I think the Fed has gone crazy.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REGAN:  Tell us how you really feel.  That was President Trump blasting the  Fed for being too aggressive on interests rate hike.  President Trump's  very forward and obvious frustration with the Fed, well not doing so well  with some folks but the head of JPMorgan Chase, Mr. Jamie Dimon is  defending the President saying, and I, \"I have never seen a President who  wanted interest rates to go up.\"  I think he's right on that one.  Who  would?</p><p>Joining me right now, the host of \"Making Money\" on the Fox Business  network, Charles Payne, soon to be host of \"Making Money\" at 2:00 p.m.,  more on that in just a minute.  Also Moody's Chief Economist, John Lonski.</p><p>John, yes, I don't blame him.  Who the heck wants the cost of money to go  up?</p><p>JOHN LONSKI, MOODY'S CHIEF ECONOMIST:  You've got to be more diplomatic  about your criticism of the Fed.  You can't go out there because, say that  they're lunatics or whatever he was saying.  Jerome Powell is not crazy.</p><p>REGAN:  You know what though, I know a lot of people are saying that.  But,  you know, this is a President who has a different style entirely, right.   You know, he says what he thinks.  And I'm sure there are plenty of  Presidents that thought the Fed was doing a lousy job and acting crazy, but  maybe they just never said it quite so explicitly.</p><p>LONSKI:  That's right.  And, you know, the fed has to keep an eye on  financial markets.  We now have the, you know, the overall market has sold  off sharply thus far in the month of October.  It's clearly higher.  We  have certain segments, interest sensitive segments of the market.  For  instance, that index of housing, sectors stock prices this afternoon is  down 25 percent for the year-to-date.  That's versus the overall market up  by two percent.</p><p>And moreover, motor vehicle industry stock prices.  So they're median  decline for the year-to-date is roughly 23 percent.  That's not good.  And  I think that's telling the Fed that perhaps there is reason to proceed with  greater caution, not only when they hike rates --</p><p>REGAN:  I see where it run.</p><p>LONSKI:  -- but when they talk about rate hikes.</p><p>REGAN:  IE, John Lonski agrees with President Trump.  You don't want to see  the Fed, maybe they're not crazy --</p><p>LONSKI:  But with Jerome Powell is very intelligent, very wise man.</p><p>REGAN:  Wow.</p><p>LONSKI:  And I'm pretty sure that they're doing the best job possible.</p><p>REGAN:  I'm pretty sure that even though he's the President of the United  States, Charles Payne, the head of the Federal Reserve needs to be  independent.  And I would expect him to be independent.  So he may hear a  little of the chatter and a little of the noise, but really it comes down  to the data, shouldn't it?</p><p>CHARLES PAYNE, FOX BUSINESS ANCHOR:  It should come down to the data and  the Fed has said over and over that it does.  And I got to tell you the  official communiques that they put out like the so-called dot plot in the  FOMC, you know, communique.  They suggest a very level-headed Fed that's  not going to wreck the economy, but it's the comments that are made in his  speech because almost every single day someone at the Fed is giving a  speech somewhere around the world.</p><p>And I tell you, starting to roll markets in.  And you know, there shouldn't  be any sacred cows out there politi -- specifically on a political side.   And why should the Fed be completely independent in the sense that it's  unanswerable to anyone?  It's not federal.  It doesn't matter.  It's sort  of scary for the average person out there.</p><p>REGAN:  Yes.</p><p>PAYNE:  John just talking about housing being under pressure, autos being  under pressure, that we're talking about the average American house hold.   If the Fed is worried about, you know, the larger institutions, you know.</p><p>And then as far as President Trump's criticism, we went from 2008, 2014  with zero rate hikes.  And this one in 2015, Janet Yellen figures she made  a mistake, and she waited until after the election and she raised rates  again.  So, I can see --</p><p>REGAN:  So you feel that many feels like, hey, that's fair.</p><p>PAYNES:  Right.</p><p>REGAN:  What were you doing for President Obama?  And, you know, maybe send  a little of that my way.</p><p>But here's the difference, John Lonski, in this environment right now we  have a President who does understand the economy and understands that, you  know, you want to unleash those spirits, those economic spirits, what do  you, you lower taxes, you lessen regulation.  That has translated into  growth.  We didn't get that from the Obama administration.  So the Fed was  only game in town.</p><p>LONSKI:  And the President understands commercial real estate very well.   And he must be getting some information that things are beginning to soften  in a once very strong sector because of higher short-term interest rates  and long-term interest rates.</p><p>And let's not forget, this has to be brought up, but for the first time in  memory, perhaps history, we have the Fed firming monetary policy on two  fronts.  Not only are they hiking Fed funds and pushing short-term rates  directly higher but they're passive reduction regarding their holdings of  U.S. Treasury bonds is also putting some upward pressure on long-term  interest rates.</p><p>So again, the Fed's got --</p><p>REGAN:  OK.</p><p>LONSKI:  -- to proceed very carefully.</p><p>REGAN:  But very cautiously.</p><p>LONSKI:  Yes.</p><p>REGAN:  I mean, this is the delicate dance, right, that they're always  walking.  I mean, in the meantime, there are some legitimate or growing  concerns I should say, Charles Payne, about inflation.</p><p>PAYNE:  Yes.  There are, there are, although, you know, this week what we  saw inflation in the PPI number, airline travel went through the roof.  You  know no wonder delta had a pretty good earnings report.  But then we got  the CPI report yesterday, it was relatively benign.</p><p>And so, there are signs of inflation that's the kind of classical inflation  signals that you would think that the Fed would be, you know, yellow flags  or red flags.  Although, we know they want to be ahead of the curve.   There's just --</p><p>REGAN:  Improve it (ph).  They need to forget being as -- they're usually  behind anyway.</p><p>PAYNE:  Yes.  Yes.</p><p>LONSKI:  Today we can have report on import price inflation.  Less than one  percent for consumer goods, less than one percent for all imports excluding  petroleum imports.</p><p>REGAN:  All right.  Well, here's the one --</p><p>LONSKI:  That's not a sign of inflation taking off.</p><p>REGAN:  If there's not enough and there's not enough wage growth, you know,  maybe --</p><p>LONSKI:  What's the hurry?  What's -- there's no sense of urgency for rate  hikes, that's it.</p><p>REGAN:  All right.  You and President Trump.</p><p>LONSKI:  But Jerome Powell --</p><p>REGAN:  Its given Jay Powell appear to your mind.</p><p>LONSKI:  -- level at no.  Yes.</p><p>REGAN:  All right.  Good to -- hey, Charles, I'm really excited for you.</p><p>PAYNE:  Thank you.</p><p>REGAN:  This is a great audience, you know --</p><p>PAYNE:  Thank you.</p><p>REGAN:  -- here at 2:00 p.m.  And you're all going to see Charles beginning  Monday, that's this Monday, 2:00 p.m. October 15th, \"Making Money with  Charles Payne,\" moves to 2:00, and well, I'm moving somewhere else.  I'll  tell you all about that next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>REGAN:  All right.  It's my last day on \"The Intelligence Report\".  So this  market better close up, right?  We're up at 128 points.  Let's hope it  holds throughout the hour.</p><p>Big news?  I shared this a little while ago with you.  I'll tell you again  all about it.  I'm going to primetime, 8:00 p.m., starting Monday right  after my good friend Lou, Lou Dobbs is on from 7:00 to 8:00.  I will be on  from 8:00 to 9:00.  Kennedy will follow at 9:00.  We are live at night  right here on Fox Business.</p><p>I'm really excited about it.  I, you know, I do want to point out just what  an incredible three years it has been on this show.  I mean, we created  this show with you, really.  With you.  You tuned in and it's thanks to you  that we're able to cream the competition for the last three years,  something I'm really extremely proud of.</p><p>And it's thanks to you and it's thanks to this news cycle that, you know,  we're expanding.  We're expanding so we will be live, I will be live at  8:00 p.m. every night.  The news keeps happening.  It's a 24/7 news cycle.</p><p>We're on the front lines of history and I'm there with you, reporting on  all of it.  We analyze, we present both sides, you make the decisions about  what is best for you, your family, and your wallet, right?</p><p>I want to thank -- I have an amazing team.  I want to thank everybody on  this team.  So many of you in the control room right now have been with me  from the very beginning, from the first day I was ever in this chair on  this little set that we created, and it's been wonderful.</p><p>I've gotten to know all of you and your families and you've certainly  gotten to know mine, including all three of the kids which love to come by  and hang out at work and in the studio.  So I'm going to miss all of you.

It's the way it is.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> REGAN:  Again, the market has to close up, right?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> CAVUTO:  It's got to.</p><p> REGAN:  It's my last day here at 2:00 o'clock.</p><p> CAVUTO:  It will.  It will.</p><p> REGAN:  All right.  Thank you.  Fingers crossed.</p><p> CAVUTO:  All righty.</p><p> REGAN:  All right.  Thanks, Neil.</p><p> Breaking right now, everyone, another wild day on Wall Street, we're  looking at a Dow that's up, right now, 95 points after being up 400 points  at the open and then it dipped a little down into negative territory, now  we're back up.  Let's see what happened.  It's a wild ride.  We got a live  report from the NYSE straight ahead.</p><p> I am Trish Regan.  Welcome, everyone, to the final edition, dare I say, the  final edition of \"The Intelligence Report.\"</p><p> Also breaking today, an American pastor who has been detained in Turkey for  the last two years is finally coming back home.  President Trump thrilled  with the news, tweeting in all caps, \"Pastor Brunson just released, will be  home soon!\"  We have a live report coming up from the White House straight  ahead.</p><p> And take a look here at this devastating video coming to us from Mexico  Beach, Florida.  The small coastal town decimated by Hurricane Michael.  We  have a live report from Panama City, Florida on the cleanup and relief  efforts.</p><p> But first, we're going to Deirdre Bolton who's on the floor of the NYSE for  more on today's wild ride. What's causing it?</p><p> DEIRDRE BOLTON, FOX BUSINESS ANCHOR:  It's right, Trish, especially  following the previous two days that we've had.  So the big question of  course today is can these gains hold?</p><p> So right now I want to call your attention to the tech stocks.  These had  been the most beaten down in the past of two sessions combined.  They are  what is holding up the gains as we see right now.</p><p> So I'm going to go through some of the names that you know well.  We have  Apple, Amazon, Google and NVIDIA, I should say.  Alphabet Google still down  for the week but very much the strongest mover today.  Of course we pay a  lot of attention because as far as the weighting go in the S&amp;P 500 we know  that tech by market cap is the heaviest, the strongest as far as the  industry groups go.</p><p> Trish, we're also focused on the financials, as you know four banks  reported before the earnings started.  They remain actually the biggest  drag right now on the broader markets.  So interestingly enough, JPMorgan  shares (ph) beat on the top and the bottom line earlier.  This was mover to  the upside that has since changed.</p><p> And it seems as if traders are focused on one key part of the outlook  statement.  I'm going to read it directly.  The non-interest revenue growth  will be between seven percent and eight percent.</p><p> But the thing that is concerning a lot of investors in the stock, and  perhaps even in the broader industry is market dependent.  Meaning, let's  see how our business does outside of the profitable business that we expect  to have by loaning out money as rates go higher.</p><p> As for some of the other financials, PNC is down.  It has actually had a  very rough week.  Wells Fargo and Citi, the other two companies that  reported earnings before the bell, little bit of mixed.  Basically one  beating on revenue, slight miss on earnings, one beating on earnings,  slight miss on revenue, both of those stocks heading marginally higher.</p><p> So, Trish, the push and pull is basically tech versus financials.  Back to  you.</p><p> REGAN:  All right.  Deirdre Bolton, thank you very much.</p><p> Joining me right now onset, our very own Kristina Partsinevelos.  We also  have Kingsview Asset Management Chief Investment Officer, Scott Martin.   Good to see both of you both guys.</p><p> I believe -- do we have Paul Dietrich with us too?  Another investor.  He's  joining -- there we go.  There you -- I knew you're around there, Paul.</p><p> PAUL DIETRICH, FAIRFAX GLOBAL MARKET CEO:  Hi, Trish.</p><p> REGAN:  I'm going to start with you.  Wild market, is this the way of the  future right now or is this just a little blip?</p><p> DIETRICH:  What this is, is, this is a reversion to mean normalizing  correction.  One of the things that's happened over this past, actually  more than a year is that you've had five big tech stocks that have  dominated the performance as of the end of August, they were represented 47  percent of the performance of the S&amp;P 500.  And what we've seen basically,  really for the last month or so, is the tech stocks have been going down  and they're reverting to mean of a more normalized stock market trend.  And  they're very, very high in P.E.s.</p><p> And so, I see this as a very healthy correction in that, you know, the tech  stocks are coming back in line with the rest of the 495 stocks in the S&amp;P  500.</p><p> REGAN:  Kristina?</p><p> KRISTINA PARTSINEVELOS, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT:  I think we can't just  solely focus on tech.  If you look yesterday I was on the New York Stock  Exchange 2:43 p.m., just the intraday volume dropped so much, that we  haven't seen a drop like that in eight years since the \"flash crash.\"  So I  think that based of the traders I was speaking to -- volatility is going to  continue to be an issue.</p><p> We're heading -- earnings started today at JPMorgan.  JPMorgan is supposed  to be good right now.  Their revenue climbed higher, up what, 24 percent  for the quarter, the third quarter.  Sorry, profits up 24 percent.  And yet  you're seeing that stock down today which you would expect it to be better  like Deirdre brought up.  The guidance is concerning.</p><p> So I think going into the earning season, looking into the future, we're  going to be paying close attention to the guidance of a lot of these  companies.</p><p> REGAN:  Well, you know, right now, earning seem, actually Scott, pretty  good, right?  I mean, so far so good.  We've got strong economic  fundamentals.  I do wonder if some people are saying to themselves, wait a  second, you know what?  I can make a little more money on the C.D. at the  local bank because Treasury yields are going up, interest rates are going  up.  And so, is this a bit of a rotation as well and that people now have  more opportunity in the investment landscape?</p><p> SCOTT MARTN, KINGSVIEW ASSET MANAGEMENT CIO:  It could be.  Now, gosh, I  hope that mom and pop sitting at home aren't thinking about that, you know,  two percent or 2.5 percent C.D. just yet, Trish, because I think --</p><p> REGAN:  Well, Scott, you know that I'm using that to characterize something  broader, right?</p><p> MARTIN:  OK.  Sure.</p><p> REGAN:  Which is that investors are saying to themselves, \"OK, I have more  optionality.  It used to be equities are the only game in town.  Well maybe  I can put a little money in fixed income now.\"</p><p> MARTIN:  Fair play, right, exactly.  Maybe the 10-year bond.  And so you're  right.  That's providing an alternative.  And I to the point that k-parts  made was visibility is in question here.</p><p> I get it that earning are good, you know in fact, I think the bar, at least  psychologically based on some of the preannouncements has been lowered, so  that's good.  But the visibility is cloudy.  I mean, you look at the  incident surrounding tariffs.  GDP obviously going forward, it look strong,  but then the job market is kind of maybe leveling off here, I mean, still  growing but not growing at the higher rates that we saw it earlier this  year.</p><p> REGAN:  Yes, but is that enough to cause you to just say, you know, throw  in the towel and go?</p><p> SCOTT:  Well, what it could do though, here's the thing, in highly  psychological market as Paul mentioned, you know, this is a market, Trish,  that could take that as a reason to sell first and ask questions later.   And that's the story of say, certainly yesterday and the day before.</p><p> REGAN:  How does the Fed factor into all of this, Paul?  By the way the  President is not too happy with the Fed right now.  Most presidents don't  really like the Fed.</p><p> DIETRICH:  Yes.  Exactly.  Yes, I mean, --</p><p> REGAN:  Maybe Obama did.  He should have anyway.</p><p> DIETRICH:  -- let's face it.  This is an election year and President Trump  is really promoting the State of the U.S. economy which is really good and  it's firing on all cylinders.  And so when you see a stock market  collection like we've seen over the last few days, you know he has to blame  someone, and so he is blaming the Federal Reserve.</p><p> I think this is normal. This is politics. But --</p><p> SCOTT:  Dangerous.</p><p> DIETRICH:  No, no, no.</p><p> REGAN:  No, by the way, no, it's not dangerous.</p><p> DIETRICH:  Not if it's all rhetoric.</p><p> REGAN:  It's only if the Fed actually listened but, Scott, I'm going to  give Jay Powell a little more credit than that.</p><p> PARTSINEVELOS:  Oh, Jay Powell actually come out in broadcast interview  with NPR Marketplace that he's going to follow through with this.  He said  that he's going to stick to the facts, and what the economy is showing, not  a political play.  And it shouldn't be a political play.</p><p> REGAN:  No, absolutely.</p><p> PARTSINEVELOS:  You have presidents who have been very --</p><p> MARTIN: Reverse the lines.</p><p> PARTSINEVELOS:  -- critical of monetary policy.  But in this case look at  where interest rates are now.  Look at it historically, they've been very,  very low.  The economy is growing.</p><p> Yes, we had inflation coming at 2.3 percent, but we have a very, very tight  labor force.  You have Walgreen saying that they're going to increase their  salaries, Amazon announcing that $15 per hour.  So there's possibly this  inflation fear right now.</p><p> REGAN:  You know we were talking to the gentleman, the founder, Jerry Fine  of Oak Tree Asset Management just the other day, and one thing that he  mentioned was that a lot of the companies he speaks to regularly are  starting to say, places like Walmart for example, you know, inflation is  running a little higher than what you might think.  That wages are growing  faster than 2.8 percent.  And their production costs are increasing.</p><p> And so the Fed needs to take all that into account.  And that, Kristina,  their job is to make sure that, you know, things don't get too overheated,  right?</p><p> PARTSINEVELOS:  Right.</p><p> REGAN:  Because then you get problems down the road.  But it's a tightrope,  the Fed got to walk.</p><p> PARTSINEVELOS:  Which is -- it's very difficult position for Jay Powell to  be in.  But I think also we should preface that there is two different  kinds of inflation.  You also have manmade inflation when you have the  tariffs come into play.</p><p> So the fact that literally 50 percent of all Chinese goods that enter the  United States at this moment are being taxed.  And potentially could be all  100 percent.  That inevitably will have an effect on companies, on us.</p><p> REGAN:  Yes, no, I get you, I hear you.  But Scott, I think that that's  kind of a short-term play.  How are you thinking about China right now?   And you heard me say, if we don't start dealing with this, and the theft of  intellectual property, $600 billion a year, if we don't deal with it now  it's going to be a whole lot harder to deal with it in the future.</p><p> MARTIN:  I agree.  To your question, how is China?  I don't know, look at  their stock market, it's absolutely blasted.</p><p> REGAN:  It's not good.</p><p> MARTIN:  No, not good.</p><p> So, you're right, that probably brings them to the table, because honestly,  Trish, before this tariff talk really heated up, I mean if you go back even  to last year, there were problems under the surface in China, anyway  economically.  So now this is really starting to hurt them.</p><p> Your point with Kristina is good about inflation because if you look at  material cost guides, those are dropping by enlarge around the world.  You  know it's not that hard to produce things anymore.  There's a lot of price  competitiveness other than oil that we've seen bump up recently.</p><p> So, to me the inflation story is all about wages and it's nowhere.</p><p> REGAN:  All right, so Scott, are you buying right now or you're going to  sit by the sidelines and wait?</p><p> MARTIN:  Yes, sit by the fire, and maybe have a cigar and think about it.   But I will be buying probably next week.  I think you got to --</p><p> REGAN:  All right.</p><p> MARTIN:  -- let the psychological kind of walkout here, though.</p><p> REGAN:  You should have bought yesterday.  Paul, your thoughts, final  thoughts.</p><p> MARTIN:  Or maybe this morning.  Right.</p><p> DIETRICH:  The story that nobody is talking about with inflation, because  inflation has been a problem in the past, but -- and we've only seen for  the last 60 years bad inflation where the government spends too much and  then has to print money that causes inflation.  But there's good inflation.   You know when wages are going up, and prices are going up because people  can price in the cost, that creates a virtues circle and government doesn't  have to print money.</p><p> MARTIN:  It's natural.</p><p> REGAN:  Right.  And listen, you don't want to have to fight deflation,  that's whole other can of worms that incredibly --</p><p> MARTIN:  Can't win that fight.</p><p> REGAN:  Yes.  It's good to see you guys.  Thank you, Kristina, Paul, Scott.</p><p> I do want to point out we've got breaking news coming in to us right now.   The President says he will be traveling to Florida and to Georgia early  next week to survey some of the damage that are caused by Hurricane  Michael.  This is the tweet that he just issued.</p><p> He said, \"People have no idea how hard Hurricane Michael has hit the great  state of Georgia.  I will be visiting both Florida and Georgia early next  week.  We are working hard on every area and every state that was hit, we  are with you.\"</p><p> Also breaking today, American Pastor Andrew Bronson is on his way home  after being released by a Turkish court.  So what does that mean for U.S.  and Turkey relations going forward?  I'm going to asking New York  Congressman, Tom Reed, that very question next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> REGAN:  Another roller coaster ride here but at least for now anyway, we're  in positive territory.  You can see we've been all over the place.  Up as  much as 400 in change as we started the day.  And then down, well, now,  still up, barely.</p><p> Meanwhile, we've got some good news out of Turkey today as the American  Pastor Andrew Brunson is now on a plane home after a court ruled he should  be released.  He had been sentenced to more than three years on terrorism  charges despite living in Turkey for more than 20 years.</p><p> President Trump had imposed sanctions, some pretty strict sanctions on  Turkey in an attempt to secure his release.  And he tweeted, \"Pastor  Brunson just released, will be home soon!\"  He is going to feel, I would  imagine feel pretty good about that.</p><p> Edward Lawrence is live at the White House with the latest</p><p> And Edward, fill us in.</p><p> EDWARD LAWRENCE, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT:  Yes.  I can tell you right  now that Pastor Brunson, we understand, is on a plane on his way to  Germany, to an air force base to get medical treatment there just to make  sure that he is OK.  Then White House sources are saying he's going to be  on a plane to Andrews Air Force Base arriving tomorrow at 6:00 a.m.  There  might be some ceremony but he's obviously relieved.  His family, they said  they are just relieved about this news.</p><p> In fact his lawyer says he thanked everyone for their prayers.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> JAY SEKULOW, AMERICAN CENTER FOR LAW AND JUSTICE:  Many of you have been  praying for this day.  I want to thank you.  I know the pastor and his  entire family want to thank you as well.  And of course, a huge thank you  to the President and his team for securing the release of Andrew Brunson.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> LAWRENCE:  Now a Turkish court actually convicted Pastor Andrew Brunson on  terrorism charges, gave him little more than three years, but then give him  time served and they lifted the travel ban which is the reason he's able to  now leave the country.  He's gotten on a plane as we said.  The White House  saying that there was no deal made with Turkey to make this happen.  So  nothing was on the table.</p><p> Turkey may have been doing this to garner some goodwill.  They are looking  for help with the investigation on the missing columnist that went into the  Saudi consulate in Turkey.</p><p> Now officials in Turkey believe that he was killed inside that consulate,  Jammal Khashoggi.  Now, they say that they have audio and video evidence  that point to that effect.  \"The Wall Street Journal\" reporting that that  evidence has been shown to U.S. intelligence agencies.</p><p> Now, Saudi's officially said that he left even though video shows him going  in but not coming out.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> ADAM KINZINGER (R-IL), HOUSE FOREIGN RELATIONS COMMITTEE:  If it's true, it  appears that it is, that he was murdered in their consulate by an  assassination team, there needs to be some significant consequences to  that.  I think that's maybe eventually targeted sanctions on individuals,  that, you know, any other host of things available to this administration.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> LAWRENCE:  Now the President saying that even if the Saudi government is  proven to be behind this disappearance, the U.S. may not cancel its arms  deal that it has with Saudi Arabia which includes fighter jets.  The  President saying that does not want to see the jobs go to Russia.</p><p> Now on another note here, the senior White House official telling us that  they are moving in the direction for a meeting between with the Chinese  president, President Xi Jinping, and President Donald Trump next month at  the G20 summit, a bilateral, one-on-one meeting between the two.  China  trying to avoid the 25 percent tariffs that will be bumped up at January  1st.  They are worried about their market and the effects that will happen.</p><p> The Chinese president possibly trying to get the President to back off  those tariffs.  Now, the President would like China to step up and make  some changes, at least move forward towards a trade deal with the U.S.</p><p> Trish?</p><p> REGAN:  Thank you very much, Edward Lawrence.</p><p> All right.  Joining me right now with reaction, we have Republican  Congressman Tom Reed of New York.  Good to have you here, sir.</p><p> Congressman, I'm going to start first on the China front.  Do you think  they might actually be willing to give a little here?  I mean, we are their  biggest customer.</p><p> TOM REED (R), NEW YORK CONGRESSMAN: I think they are --</p><p> REGAN:  Not doing them any favors, right?  This whole sort of \"trade war\"  if you can call it that, it's not helping China?</p><p> REED:  No.  I would agree with that assessment.  This is not sustainable  for China.  They need to come to the table.  And I believe that is exactly  where these talks will lead that they are recognizing.  That it is not in  their interests, nor in America's interest to continue a protracted trade  war.  It's time for us to come together.  It's time for China to be held  accountable for their unfair trade practices.  And I think they are in a  position to have to sit at the table to resolve this.</p><p> REGAN:  You know, Congressman the difference, however is that in China they  don't have to get elected.  I mean you got to get elected every two years,  right?  And consequently if the economy starts to turn and if corporations  starts getting kind of upset including some of, say your donor, sir, that  they can't access the Chinese markets like they used to because of all of  these problems, then at what point does it start to really bite into the  ability of American politicians to really do what's best here where just to  confront the problem?</p><p> REED:  Well I think Trish, if you look at from the other perspective.  You  know, China has -- they're not subject to election, but I will tell you  they have tremendous amount of internal strife.  If their people don't have  an expanding economy to go to work, they can't put food on table, they  can't put a roof over their head.  That causes a tremendous amount of the  stability and instability in China.</p><p> And when you look at what China is doing in regards to a debt to GDP, it's  not sustainable there either.  So China cannot withstand these.  And I  understand the political pressure, but this elephant needs to be  confronted.  And that's what we're doing.</p><p> REGAN:  Why, why is everybody --</p><p> REED:  We're holding them accountable once and for all.</p><p> REGAN:  --kind of ignore it.  I mean for -- why is it that -- I mean we --  and I shouldn't say they ignore it.  Actually I've talked to former  Treasury Secretary Bob Rubin about this and he pointed out that China is  indeed a big, big problem.  And he tried to address it during the Clinton  years.  But everybody has tried, right?</p><p> Tim Geithner, I remember trying to take this one and spend time in China  trying to deal with this.  The theft of intellectual property is a real  problem for us.  And yet, no one was quite as vocal about it shall we say  as this President.  Is it because they feared to this talk of a trade war?   Do they fear a backlash from American CEOs that would say, \"No, no, we need  to be over there, we want to be over there, it's a big market for us?\"</p><p> REED:  I think that pressure was there.  But now obviously under this  administration and with our President, we're seeing a disruptive policy put  on the table.  And China can't take the risk of not having America follow  the status quo, the traditional path if you would.  And so what I believe  is happening is they're recognizing that President Trump is serious.  And  that he is serious about holding them accountable for these unfair trade  practices.  And now is the time you're seeing results in China's movement,  in their policy shifts to come to the table to recognize they have to  resolve these issues.</p><p> REGAN:  Real quick, before I let you go.  It's very good news that the  Pastor has been released . Does this show you that sanctions can actually  work, Congressman?</p><p> REED:  Absolutely, and you can get results through strength.  And that's  what the administration sent to Turkey.  Is what it said to Turkey is we  are not going to allow an American citizen to be held captive.  And now we  should all celebrate as Americans, as Democrats and Republicans that Pastor  Brunson is coming home and coming home to his family.  That is a joint  celebration every American should be proud of.</p><p> REGAN:  Here, here, I agree.  Thank you so much.  Congressman Reed, good to  see you.</p><p> REED:  Thanks.</p><p> REGAN:  All right, we're going to be following these markets again  throughout the hour as we watch Dow that's up 52 points right now, 25,101  is the level.  Stay with us.</p><p> Residents, meanwhile in the Florida Panhandle, they are coming to terms  with the utter destruction that Hurricane Michael had left behind.  We have  a live report on cleanup and relief efforts coming up next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> REGAN:  Very sad scene in Florida right now.  In fact, everywhere you look  in the Florida Panhandle, what you see is utter devastation.  You have  beach front homes have been completely obliterated.  Only slabs of concrete  remaining, entire communities actually destroyed when category 4 Hurricane  Michael roared ashore this week.  This destruction is being called  catastrophic.</p><p> Billions of dollars will be needed to rebuild.  And now 13 deaths are being  blamed on the most powerful hurricane to hit the U.S. mainland in a  generation.</p><p> And Michael is not done yet.  Causing flash flooding, heavy rains as far  away as Virginia.  Connell McShane is joining me right now on the phone  from one of the hardest hit areas, Panama City, Florida.</p><p> Hey, Connell.</p><p> CONNELL MCSHANE, FOX BUSINESS NEWS ANCHOR (via telephone):  Hi there Trish.</p><p> We're just east of Panama City right now.  We've been moving around a lot  today as much as we can.  And we've been encountering some of the same  difficulties as the people here are in trying to recover from Hurricane  Michael and as the first-responders are been trying to help those people so  badly hurt by this hurricane.</p><p> Let me start in Mexico Beach where we spent part of our afternoon and  evening yesterday before the curfew went into place.  Well I'm sure you've  seen what we'll be able to show now some of the video of Mexico Beach that  we and our other Fox colleagues were able to shoot particularly some of the  aerial shots where you can see just how Hurricane Michael caused so much  destruction.  And that's the word, not damage, it's destruction.</p><p> There were homes that were buried a day before the hurricane which just  aren't there anymore.  It's not as if they were damaged.  They were  completely wiped out.  I was speaking to some of the National Guard troops  who are assigned to Mexico Beach, one in particular told me he's from this  area, has worked a number of hurricanes and never seen anything even close  to this bad.</p><p> Now when you get back to the area you mentioned, Panama City where we were  earlier in the day, there are parts of it in particular in Panama City  Beach are starting to recover.  Even some power that's starting to come  back.  But those few and far between as of this morning, 90 percent of that  town in Bay County was still without power.</p><p> We move to the east where we are.  Then you encounter the communication  difficulties that are really making things doubly difficult for everybody  trying to respond to this hurricane.  And that's why I'm speaking to you  now on this side of the road on a satellite phone because in an area where  the cell phone service was perfect yesterday it no longer works at all  today.  So that's one of the things the companies no doubt are trying to  get in here and get their towers back up and running.  But it depends on  which service provider you have.  For example, many of us have AT&amp;T and  that was working in some areas beautifully.</p><p> Many of the people who live here do not have Verizon or Sprint or what have  you and they weren't working at all.  So, it depends where you are, what  service provider you have.  And people are having difficult even telling  someone that they're having trouble.</p><p> And, you know, we're running to a lady earlier for example, we've been able  to ride out the storm.  She's OK.  The tree that came down, a giant oak  tree fell into the street, thank goodness, not into her house but she was  having difficulty telling her family she was OK.</p><p> Finally, she was able to walk up of a block and randomly Facebook Messenger  it came on her phone even though it didn't seem that she has service  she  leave (ph) to give a quick message t some of her family members.  So that's  the kind of thing that it making hard to recover from this hurricane.  The  idea that communicating is so difficult.</p><p> I will say Trish, the transportation has improved a little.  It's all  relative but some of the road there were completely closed yesterday are  now starting to reopen.  Thanks for the hard work of some of the  professionals and also some of the volunteers, neighbors helping neighbors  pack with their saws and chainsaws and whatever (ph) to be able to cutdown  some of tress and open the roads up.</p><p> So FEMA and the other authorities can get in.  But that's a long way to go,  Trish.  It really is something else.</p><p> REGAN:  Wow, quite an aftermath.  Connell, thank you very much.</p><p> All right.  Roller coaster here on the market up 81 right now.  We've been  up as much as 400 then we were down.  So, where we're headed right now?   It's a Friday.  So investors are going into the weekend and of course, you  know, a lot of this is gone to center around what happened come midterm  elections, right?  Because economic policy is going to be influenced by  whoever is in office.  Our panel is going to debate all that next</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> REGAN:  All right.  We're watching what has become a very volatile market  this week.  A couple rough days we had but today is looking a little  better.</p><p> We're up 50 -- nearly 50 points.  We had been trading up as much as 414  though.  So, so much for that, but at least we're out of negative  territory.  The big question is, what are these markets really mean for  Republicans come the midterms?</p><p> Joining me right now, James Freeman of \"The Wall Street Journal\" and Former  Advisor to Bill Clinton, Doug Schoen.  Good to see you both.</p><p> DOUG SCHOEN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Good to see you.</p><p> JAMES FREEMAN, \"THE WALL STREET JOURNAL\":  Good to be here, Trish, thanks.</p><p> REGAN:  Doug, I'm going to start with you.  I mean people been feeling  pretty good about the economy.  I'd tell you all the economic data points  do some very, very strong fundamentals.  But, you know, when people open up  their 401k's and they see that maybe it wasn't as good as it was last  month, what kind of effect does that have on psychology for voters?</p><p> SCHOEN:  You know, Trish, at this point, not to duck the question, it's  hard to tell.  Because usually these things take a little bit longer to  play out than what you're describing which is, you know, the beginning of  November, they get their 401k's.  They're down and so they get less  inclined to vote Republican.</p><p> Usually takes three to six months for the impact of a brief downturn and it  has been brief and has been swift to be felt.  So, as we sit here today  can't say really anything.  The polling shows if anything the Republicans  up in the last week or so, certainly in the Senate races.</p><p> REGAN:  James, I personally, and I said this earlier in the show.  I think  is a blip.  I mean, I think there are very, very good fundamentals right  now.</p><p> I think, you know, the China thing yes, it's a little bit of a threat but  we'll make it through all of that.  And as long as we continue to see wage  growth and job growth.  We're heading in the right direction and economic  growth.  But you know, nonetheless, if you have a market that's trading  lower, I don't necessarily think it will in November.  But if it were to-- </p><p> FREEMAN:    Yes.</p><p> REGAN:  -- how does that influence in your view Republican voters?</p><p> FREEMAN:  Well, I think the economy is a win for Republicans barring some  huge, sort of catastrophic event.  As you said the fundamentals are very  strong.  We just really got another reminder that this morning with the  bank earnings</p><p>  These are companies that get a pretty good window into the U.S. consumer.   People paying bills on time.  They're obviously able to find jobs.   Earnings are good for the companies, the economy is growing.  So I think  that's all good and that would suggest this is a blip.</p><p> The sort of conventional wisdom is maybe the economy is so good since there  are almost no economic problems.  People kind of take that for granted and  maybe they decide on other things.</p><p> REGAN:  And that's was so hard, right, in midterms?</p><p> FREEMAN:  Yes.</p><p> REGAN:  I mean, you have to motivate --</p><p> FREEMAN:  Right.</p><p> REGAN:  -- voters get out there.  And if they're feeling kind a OK, then,  Doug, you run the risk of complacency.  I do think Kavanaugh changed that,  however.  If there was any complacency among the Republican base, watching  what happened with Judge Kavanaugh may have them thinking differently?</p><p> SCHOEN:  Well, certainly that's the initial indication but we've got you  know, some 20 something days to go until the election.  And, whether there  are twists and turns in terms of enthusiasm and attitudes, really remains  to be seen.</p><p> A bunch of the most recent midterms have swung in the last week to 10 days.   So I think it's not clear what's going to happen but I think James is  right.  If you look at all the indicators and certainly, Trish, you as  well, it's more -- much more good news economically for the Republicans,  notwithstanding that midterms typically go for the out party, the  opposition.</p><p> REGAN:  Yes.  So, is all this at risk, James?  I mean, if the Republicans  are not successful in midterms?  Because you know, we've heard many  Democrats say they like to reverse the tax cut and they like to tax the  wealthy?</p><p> FREEMAN:  Yes.</p><p> REGAN:  And tax everyone else along the way, including corporations et  cetera.  So, is some of this policy really at risk?</p><p> FREEMAN:  Well, I think you have to say this at risk because depending on  how big -- let's just imagine a big Democratic wave, if president Trump  then feels the need to negotiate to do deals, to strike the \"art of the  deal\" with Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer, that could be a very different  policy mix.  It's -- obviously if you look at most of his history Donald  Trump was not a super conservative guy.  Does he evolve back if he is  dealing with Congressional leadership with big democratic majorities?  So  that would be a question.</p><p> REGAN:  Hey, Doug, can I just ask?</p><p> SCHOEN:  Yes.</p><p> REGAN:  Looking ahead to 2020, do you think Mike Bloomberg is going to be  in the ring?</p><p> SCHOEN:  You know, I don't think he's made a final decision.  Certainly  made it clear the other day that he was going to do everything he could to  stand up to policies that the Trump administration is pursued, that he  disagrees with.  He is spending obviously close to $100 million on the  midterm elections.  So whatever the mayor or the former mayor does, he will  be a force to be reckoned with.  That's for sure.</p><p> REGAN:  And he's never registered as a Democrat.</p><p> FREEMAN:  Well, you know, if he likes to have --</p><p> SCHOEN:  He is now.</p><p> FREEMAN:  -- pro-business Democrats again.  This -- for this reason I kind  of doubt whether he can go anywhere.</p><p> REGAN:  Yes.</p><p> FREEMAN:  But it would be nice to see a kind of a market-oriented voice  back in that party.</p><p> REGAN:  Yes.  It would be the alternative which is the Alexandria Cortez  and the Bernie Sanders camp.</p><p> FREEMAN:  A 100 percent.</p><p> REGAN:  We don't need the socialist there.  Anyway, good, red-blooded  American capitalism and that's what the nation was founded on.  Doug,  James, good to see you guys.  Thank you so much.</p><p> SCHOEN:  Thank you so much, Trish.</p><p> FREEMAN:  Thanks.</p><p> REGAN:  All right 29 million Facebook users have had their information  stolen in the massive security breach that happened there last month.   Facebook says the information included everything from names and contact  information to more personal profile information like places that people  checked into and the devices used to access Facebook.</p><p>Facebook said users can check if they were affected by the attack, visiting  Facebook's Online Help Center.</p><p>Tesla is giving its customers until Monday to place car orders eligible for  a $7500 federal tax credit.  Under federal law, the full tax credit lasts  until the car company reaches 200,000 sales in 2010 which it definitely did  in July.  You know, any vehicles ordered by Monday are expected to be  delivered by the end of the year.</p><p> President Trump sparking outraged and an outcry after slamming the Fed for  being too aggressive, t does he have a point?  Is the Fed getting a little  too happy about these rate hikes?  Our panel is going to weigh in on all  that, I'll see you here next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  We have interest rates  going up at a clip that's much faster than certainly a lot of people  including myself would have anticipated.  I think the Fed is out of  control.  I think what they're doing is wrong.  I think the Fed is far too  stringent and they're making a mistake.</p><p> They're so tight.  I think the Fed has gone crazy.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> REGAN:  Tell us how you really feel.  That was President Trump blasting the  Fed for being too aggressive on interests rate hike.  President Trump's  very forward and obvious frustration with the Fed, well not doing so well  with some folks but the head of JPMorgan Chase, Mr. Jamie Dimon is  defending the President saying, and I, \"I have never seen a President who  wanted interest rates to go up.\"  I think he's right on that one.  Who  would?</p><p> Joining me right now, the host of \"Making Money\" on the Fox Business  network, Charles Payne, soon to be host of \"Making Money\" at 2:00 p.m.,  more on that in just a minute.  Also Moody's Chief Economist, John Lonski.</p><p> John, yes, I don't blame him.  Who the heck wants the cost of money to go  up?</p><p> JOHN LONSKI, MOODY'S CHIEF ECONOMIST:  You've got to be more diplomatic  about your criticism of the Fed.  You can't go out there because, say that  they're lunatics or whatever he was saying.  Jerome Powell is not crazy.</p><p> REGAN:  You know what though, I know a lot of people are saying that.  But,  you know, this is a President who has a different style entirely, right.   You know, he says what he thinks.  And I'm sure there are plenty of  Presidents that thought the Fed was doing a lousy job and acting crazy, but  maybe they just never said it quite so explicitly.</p><p> LONSKI:  That's right.  And, you know, the fed has to keep an eye on  financial markets.  We now have the, you know, the overall market has sold  off sharply thus far in the month of October.  It's clearly higher.  We  have certain segments, interest sensitive segments of the market.  For  instance, that index of housing, sectors stock prices this afternoon is  down 25 percent for the year-to-date.  That's versus the overall market up  by two percent.</p><p> And moreover, motor vehicle industry stock prices.  So they're median  decline for the year-to-date is roughly 23 percent.  That's not good.  And  I think that's telling the Fed that perhaps there is reason to proceed with  greater caution, not only when they hike rates --</p><p> REGAN:  I see where it run.</p><p> LONSKI:  -- but when they talk about rate hikes.</p><p> REGAN:  IE, John Lonski agrees with President Trump.  You don't want to see  the Fed, maybe they're not crazy --</p><p> LONSKI:  But with Jerome Powell is very intelligent, very wise man.</p><p> REGAN:  Wow.</p><p> LONSKI:  And I'm pretty sure that they're doing the best job possible.</p><p> REGAN:  I'm pretty sure that even though he's the President of the United  States, Charles Payne, the head of the Federal Reserve needs to be  independent.  And I would expect him to be independent.  So he may hear a  little of the chatter and a little of the noise, but really it comes down  to the data, shouldn't it?</p><p> CHARLES PAYNE, FOX BUSINESS ANCHOR:  It should come down to the data and  the Fed has said over and over that it does.  And I got to tell you the  official communiques that they put out like the so-called dot plot in the  FOMC, you know, communique.  They suggest a very level-headed Fed that's  not going to wreck the economy, but it's the comments that are made in his  speech because almost every single day someone at the Fed is giving a  speech somewhere around the world.</p><p> And I tell you, starting to roll markets in.  And you know, there shouldn't  be any sacred cows out there politi -- specifically on a political side.   And why should the Fed be completely independent in the sense that it's  unanswerable to anyone?  It's not federal.  It doesn't matter.  It's sort  of scary for the average person out there.</p><p> REGAN:  Yes.</p><p> PAYNE:  John just talking about housing being under pressure, autos being  under pressure, that we're talking about the average American house hold.   If the Fed is worried about, you know, the larger institutions, you know.</p><p> And then as far as President Trump's criticism, we went from 2008, 2014  with zero rate hikes.  And this one in 2015, Janet Yellen figures she made  a mistake, and she waited until after the election and she raised rates  again.  So, I can see --</p><p> REGAN:  So you feel that many feels like, hey, that's fair.</p><p> PAYNES:  Right.</p><p> REGAN:  What were you doing for President Obama?  And, you know, maybe send  a little of that my way.</p><p> But here's the difference, John Lonski, in this environment right now we  have a President who does understand the economy and understands that, you  know, you want to unleash those spirits, those economic spirits, what do  you, you lower taxes, you lessen regulation.  That has translated into  growth.  We didn't get that from the Obama administration.  So the Fed was  only game in town.</p><p> LONSKI:  And the President understands commercial real estate very well.   And he must be getting some information that things are beginning to soften  in a once very strong sector because of higher short-term interest rates  and long-term interest rates.</p><p> And let's not forget, this has to be brought up, but for the first time in  memory, perhaps history, we have the Fed firming monetary policy on two  fronts.  Not only are they hiking Fed funds and pushing short-term rates  directly higher but they're passive reduction regarding their holdings of  U.S. Treasury bonds is also putting some upward pressure on long-term  interest rates.</p><p> So again, the Fed's got --</p><p> REGAN:  OK.</p><p> LONSKI:  -- to proceed very carefully.</p><p> REGAN:  But very cautiously.</p><p> LONSKI:  Yes.</p><p> REGAN:  I mean, this is the delicate dance, right, that they're always  walking.  I mean, in the meantime, there are some legitimate or growing  concerns I should say, Charles Payne, about inflation.</p><p> PAYNE:  Yes.  There are, there are, although, you know, this week what we  saw inflation in the PPI number, airline travel went through the roof.  You  know no wonder delta had a pretty good earnings report.  But then we got  the CPI report yesterday, it was relatively benign.</p><p> And so, there are signs of inflation that's the kind of classical inflation  signals that you would think that the Fed would be, you know, yellow flags  or red flags.  Although, we know they want to be ahead of the curve.   There's just --</p><p> REGAN:  Improve it (ph).  They need to forget being as -- they're usually  behind anyway.</p><p> PAYNE:  Yes.  Yes.</p><p> LONSKI:  Today we can have report on import price inflation.  Less than one  percent for consumer goods, less than one percent for all imports excluding  petroleum imports.</p><p> REGAN:  All right.  Well, here's the one --</p><p> LONSKI:  That's not a sign of inflation taking off.</p><p> REGAN:  If there's not enough and there's not enough wage growth, you know,  maybe --</p><p> LONSKI:  What's the hurry?  What's -- there's no sense of urgency for rate  hikes, that's it.</p><p> REGAN:  All right.  You and President Trump.</p><p> LONSKI:  But Jerome Powell --</p><p> REGAN:  Its given Jay Powell appear to your mind.</p><p> LONSKI:  -- level at no.  Yes.</p><p> REGAN:  All right.  Good to -- hey, Charles, I'm really excited for you.</p><p> PAYNE:  Thank you.</p><p> REGAN:  This is a great audience, you know --</p><p> PAYNE:  Thank you.</p><p> REGAN:  -- here at 2:00 p.m.  And you're all going to see Charles beginning  Monday, that's this Monday, 2:00 p.m. October 15th, \"Making Money with  Charles Payne,\" moves to 2:00, and well, I'm moving somewhere else.  I'll  tell you all about that next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> REGAN:  All right.  It's my last day on \"The Intelligence Report\".  So this  market better close up, right?  We're up at 128 points.  Let's hope it  holds throughout the hour.</p><p> Big news?  I shared this a little while ago with you.  I'll tell you again  all about it.  I'm going to primetime, 8:00 p.m., starting Monday right  after my good friend Lou, Lou Dobbs is on from 7:00 to 8:00.  I will be on  from 8:00 to 9:00.  Kennedy will follow at 9:00.  We are live at night  right here on Fox Business.</p><p> I'm really excited about it.  I, you know, I do want to point out just what  an incredible three years it has been on this show.  I mean, we created  this show with you, really.  With you.  You tuned in and it's thanks to you  that we're able to cream the competition for the last three years,  something I'm really extremely proud of.</p><p> And it's thanks to you and it's thanks to this news cycle that, you know,  we're expanding.  We're expanding so we will be live, I will be live at  8:00 p.m. every night.  The news keeps happening.  It's a 24/7 news cycle.</p><p> We're on the front lines of history and I'm there with you, reporting on  all of it.  We analyze, we present both sides, you make the decisions about  what is best for you, your family, and your wallet, right?</p><p> I want to thank -- I have an amazing team.  I want to thank everybody on  this team.  So many of you in the control room right now have been with me  from the very beginning, from the first day I was ever in this chair on  this little set that we created, and it's been wonderful.</p><p> I've gotten to know all of you and your families and you've certainly  gotten to know mine, including all three of the kids which love to come by  and hang out at work and in the studio.  So I'm going to miss all of you.   Some of you are coming with me, of course, and I'm so excited for this new  chapter and what we can do and what we can accomplish.</p><p> We have so many tremendous journalists here at Fox Business and we are in a  tremendous news cycle.  So this is the value add that we bring.</p><p> It's going to be a little different at home, so my husband and I had to get  a little creative on this front because we used to have family dinner at  6:00 p.m. every night.  Now it's going to be family breakfast at 6:30, when  I take the kids to school.</p><p> And then it's following the news cycle for you.  I'm looking forward to it.   I'm going to see you Monday night.</p><p> Gosh, I hope this market ends up, Liz Claman, 137 points.  We got to hang  on to this one.</p><p> LIZ CLAMAN, FOX BUSINESS ANCHOR:  Yes.  Yes.  Let's give you a green good- bye.  Trish, another live --</p><p> REGAN:  Thank you.</p><p> CLAMAN:  -- presence in primetime on Fox Business.</p><p> REGAN:  Charles is going to be --</p><p> CLAMAN:  Go.  Go.  Go.</p><p> REGAN:  -- right here at 2:00 p.m.</p><p> CLAMAN:  Yes.  And we will welcome Charles and we wish you the best of  luck, Trish.</p><p> REGAN:  Thank you Liz.</p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC.

It will.</p><p>REGAN:  All right.  Thank you.  Fingers crossed.</p><p>CAVUTO:  All righty.</p><p>REGAN:  All right.  Thanks, Neil.</p><p>Breaking right now, everyone, another wild day on Wall Street, we're  looking at a Dow that's up, right now, 95 points after being up 400 points  at the open and then it dipped a little down into negative territory, now  we're back up.  Let's see what happened.  It's a wild ride.  We got a live  report from the NYSE straight ahead.</p><p>I am Trish Regan.  Welcome, everyone, to the final edition, dare I say, the  final edition of \"The Intelligence Report.\"</p><p>Also breaking today, an American pastor who has been detained in Turkey for  the last two years is finally coming back home.  President Trump thrilled  with the news, tweeting in all caps, \"Pastor Brunson just released, will be  home soon!\"  We have a live report coming up from the White House straight  ahead.</p><p>And take a look here at this devastating video coming to us from Mexico  Beach, Florida.  The small coastal town decimated by Hurricane Michael.  We  have a live report from Panama City, Florida on the cleanup and relief  efforts.</p><p>But first, we're going to Deirdre Bolton who's on the floor of the NYSE for  more on today's wild ride. What's causing it?</p><p>DEIRDRE BOLTON, FOX BUSINESS ANCHOR:  It's right, Trish, especially  following the previous two days that we've had.  So the big question of  course today is can these gains hold?</p><p>So right now I want to call your attention to the tech stocks.  These had  been the most beaten down in the past of two sessions combined.  They are  what is holding up the gains as we see right now.</p><p>So I'm going to go through some of the names that you know well.  We have  Apple, Amazon, Google and NVIDIA, I should say.  Alphabet Google still down  for the week but very much the strongest mover today.  Of course we pay a  lot of attention because as far as the weighting go in the S&amp;P 500 we know  that tech by market cap is the heaviest, the strongest as far as the  industry groups go.</p><p>Trish, we're also focused on the financials, as you know four banks  reported before the earnings started.  They remain actually the biggest  drag right now on the broader markets.  So interestingly enough, JPMorgan  shares (ph) beat on the top and the bottom line earlier.  This was mover to  the upside that has since changed.</p><p>And it seems as if traders are focused on one key part of the outlook  statement.  I'm going to read it directly.  The non-interest revenue growth  will be between seven percent and eight percent.</p><p>But the thing that is concerning a lot of investors in the stock, and  perhaps even in the broader industry is market dependent.  Meaning, let's  see how our business does outside of the profitable business that we expect  to have by loaning out money as rates go higher.</p><p>As for some of the other financials, PNC is down.  It has actually had a  very rough week.  Wells Fargo and Citi, the other two companies that  reported earnings before the bell, little bit of mixed.  Basically one  beating on revenue, slight miss on earnings, one beating on earnings,  slight miss on revenue, both of those stocks heading marginally higher.</p><p>So, Trish, the push and pull is basically tech versus financials.  Back to  you.</p><p>REGAN:  All right.  Deirdre Bolton, thank you very much.</p><p>Joining me right now onset, our very own Kristina Partsinevelos.  We also  have Kingsview Asset Management Chief Investment Officer, Scott Martin.   Good to see both of you both guys.</p><p>I believe -- do we have Paul Dietrich with us too?  Another investor.  He's  joining -- there we go.  There you -- I knew you're around there, Paul.</p><p>PAUL DIETRICH, FAIRFAX GLOBAL MARKET CEO:  Hi, Trish.</p><p>REGAN:  I'm going to start with you.  Wild market, is this the way of the  future right now or is this just a little blip?</p><p>DIETRICH:  What this is, is, this is a reversion to mean normalizing  correction.  One of the things that's happened over this past, actually  more than a year is that you've had five big tech stocks that have  dominated the performance as of the end of August, they were represented 47  percent of the performance of the S&amp;P 500.  And what we've seen basically,  really for the last month or so, is the tech stocks have been going down  and they're reverting to mean of a more normalized stock market trend.  And  they're very, very high in P.E.s.</p><p>And so, I see this as a very healthy correction in that, you know, the tech  stocks are coming back in line with the rest of the 495 stocks in the S&amp;P  500.</p><p>REGAN:  Kristina?</p><p>KRISTINA PARTSINEVELOS, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT:  I think we can't just  solely focus on tech.  If you look yesterday I was on the New York Stock  Exchange 2:43 p.m., just the intraday volume dropped so much, that we  haven't seen a drop like that in eight years since the \"flash crash.\"  So I  think that based of the traders I was speaking to -- volatility is going to  continue to be an issue.</p><p>We're heading -- earnings started today at JPMorgan.  JPMorgan is supposed  to be good right now.  Their revenue climbed higher, up what, 24 percent  for the quarter, the third quarter.  Sorry, profits up 24 percent.  And yet  you're seeing that stock down today which you would expect it to be better  like Deirdre brought up.  The guidance is concerning.</p><p>So I think going into the earning season, looking into the future, we're  going to be paying close attention to the guidance of a lot of these  companies.</p><p>REGAN:  Well, you know, right now, earning seem, actually Scott, pretty  good, right?  I mean, so far so good.  We've got strong economic  fundamentals.  I do wonder if some people are saying to themselves, wait a  second, you know what?  I can make a little more money on the C.D. at the  local bank because Treasury yields are going up, interest rates are going  up.  And so, is this a bit of a rotation as well and that people now have  more opportunity in the investment landscape?</p><p>SCOTT MARTN, KINGSVIEW ASSET MANAGEMENT CIO:  It could be.  Now, gosh, I  hope that mom and pop sitting at home aren't thinking about that, you know,  two percent or 2.5 percent C.D. just yet, Trish, because I think --</p><p>REGAN:  Well, Scott, you know that I'm using that to characterize something  broader, right?</p><p>MARTIN:  OK.  Sure.</p><p>REGAN:  Which is that investors are saying to themselves, \"OK, I have more  optionality.  It used to be equities are the only game in town.  Well maybe  I can put a little money in fixed income now.\"</p><p>MARTIN:  Fair play, right, exactly.  Maybe the 10-year bond.  And so you're  right.  That's providing an alternative.  And I to the point that k-parts  made was visibility is in question here.</p><p>I get it that earning are good, you know in fact, I think the bar, at least  psychologically based on some of the preannouncements has been lowered, so  that's good.  But the visibility is cloudy.  I mean, you look at the  incident surrounding tariffs.  GDP obviously going forward, it look strong,  but then the job market is kind of maybe leveling off here, I mean, still  growing but not growing at the higher rates that we saw it earlier this  year.</p><p>REGAN:  Yes, but is that enough to cause you to just say, you know, throw  in the towel and go?</p><p>SCOTT:  Well, what it could do though, here's the thing, in highly  psychological market as Paul mentioned, you know, this is a market, Trish,  that could take that as a reason to sell first and ask questions later.   And that's the story of say, certainly yesterday and the day before.</p><p>REGAN:  How does the Fed factor into all of this, Paul?  By the way the  President is not too happy with the Fed right now.  Most presidents don't  really like the Fed.</p><p>DIETRICH:  Yes.  Exactly.  Yes, I mean, --</p><p>REGAN:  Maybe Obama did.  He should have anyway.</p><p>DIETRICH:  -- let's face it.  This is an election year and President Trump  is really promoting the State of the U.S. economy which is really good and  it's firing on all cylinders.  And so when you see a stock market  collection like we've seen over the last few days, you know he has to blame  someone, and so he is blaming the Federal Reserve.</p><p>I think this is normal. This is politics. But --</p><p>SCOTT:  Dangerous.</p><p>DIETRICH:  No, no, no.</p><p>REGAN:  No, by the way, no, it's not dangerous.</p><p>DIETRICH:  Not if it's all rhetoric.</p><p>REGAN:  It's only if the Fed actually listened but, Scott, I'm going to  give Jay Powell a little more credit than that.</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS:  Oh, Jay Powell actually come out in broadcast interview  with NPR Marketplace that he's going to follow through with this.  He said  that he's going to stick to the facts, and what the economy is showing, not  a political play.  And it shouldn't be a political play.</p><p>REGAN:  No, absolutely.</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS:  You have presidents who have been very --</p><p>MARTIN: Reverse the lines.</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS:  -- critical of monetary policy.  But in this case look at  where interest rates are now.  Look at it historically, they've been very,  very low.  The economy is growing.</p><p>Yes, we had inflation coming at 2.3 percent, but we have a very, very tight  labor force.  You have Walgreen saying that they're going to increase their  salaries, Amazon announcing that $15 per hour.  So there's possibly this  inflation fear right now.</p><p>REGAN:  You know we were talking to the gentleman, the founder, Jerry Fine  of Oak Tree Asset Management just the other day, and one thing that he  mentioned was that a lot of the companies he speaks to regularly are  starting to say, places like Walmart for example, you know, inflation is  running a little higher than what you might think.  That wages are growing  faster than 2.8 percent.  And their production costs are increasing.</p><p>And so the Fed needs to take all that into account.  And that, Kristina,  their job is to make sure that, you know, things don't get too overheated,  right?</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS:  Right.</p><p>REGAN:  Because then you get problems down the road.  But it's a tightrope,  the Fed got to walk.</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS:  Which is -- it's very difficult position for Jay Powell to  be in.  But I think also we should preface that there is two different  kinds of inflation.  You also have manmade inflation when you have the  tariffs come into play.</p><p>So the fact that literally 50 percent of all Chinese goods that enter the  United States at this moment are being taxed.  And potentially could be all  100 percent.  That inevitably will have an effect on companies, on us.</p><p>REGAN:  Yes, no, I get you, I hear you.  But Scott, I think that that's  kind of a short-term play.  How are you thinking about China right now?   And you heard me say, if we don't start dealing with this, and the theft of  intellectual property, $600 billion a year, if we don't deal with it now  it's going to be a whole lot harder to deal with it in the future.</p><p>MARTIN:  I agree.  To your question, how is China?  I don't know, look at  their stock market, it's absolutely blasted.</p><p>REGAN:  It's not good.</p><p>MARTIN:  No, not good.</p><p>So, you're right, that probably brings them to the table, because honestly,  Trish, before this tariff talk really heated up, I mean if you go back even  to last year, there were problems under the surface in China, anyway  economically.  So now this is really starting to hurt them.</p><p>Your point with Kristina is good about inflation because if you look at  material cost guides, those are dropping by enlarge around the world.  You  know it's not that hard to produce things anymore.  There's a lot of price  competitiveness other than oil that we've seen bump up recently.</p><p>So, to me the inflation story is all about wages and it's nowhere.</p><p>REGAN:  All right, so Scott, are you buying right now or you're going to  sit by the sidelines and wait?</p><p>MARTIN:  Yes, sit by the fire, and maybe have a cigar and think about it.   But I will be buying probably next week.  I think you got to --</p><p>REGAN:  All right.</p><p>MARTIN:  -- let the psychological kind of walkout here, though.</p><p>REGAN:  You should have bought yesterday.  Paul, your thoughts, final  thoughts.</p><p>MARTIN:  Or maybe this morning.  Right.</p><p>DIETRICH:  The story that nobody is talking about with inflation, because  inflation has been a problem in the past, but -- and we've only seen for  the last 60 years bad inflation where the government spends too much and  then has to print money that causes inflation.  But there's good inflation.   You know when wages are going up, and prices are going up because people  can price in the cost, that creates a virtues circle and government doesn't  have to print money.</p><p>MARTIN:  It's natural.</p><p>REGAN:  Right.  And listen, you don't want to have to fight deflation,  that's whole other can of worms that incredibly --</p><p>MARTIN:  Can't win that fight.</p><p>REGAN:  Yes.  It's good to see you guys.  Thank you, Kristina, Paul, Scott.</p><p>I do want to point out we've got breaking news coming in to us right now.   The President says he will be traveling to Florida and to Georgia early  next week to survey some of the damage that are caused by Hurricane  Michael.  This is the tweet that he just issued.</p><p>He said, \"People have no idea how hard Hurricane Michael has hit the great  state of Georgia.  I will be visiting both Florida and Georgia early next  week.  We are working hard on every area and every state that was hit, we  are with you.\"</p><p>Also breaking today, American Pastor Andrew Bronson is on his way home  after being released by a Turkish court.  So what does that mean for U.S.  and Turkey relations going forward?  I'm going to asking New York  Congressman, Tom Reed, that very question next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>REGAN:  Another roller coaster ride here but at least for now anyway, we're  in positive territory.  You can see we've been all over the place.  Up as  much as 400 in change as we started the day.  And then down, well, now,  still up, barely.</p><p>Meanwhile, we've got some good news out of Turkey today as the American  Pastor Andrew Brunson is now on a plane home after a court ruled he should  be released.  He had been sentenced to more than three years on terrorism  charges despite living in Turkey for more than 20 years.</p><p>President Trump had imposed sanctions, some pretty strict sanctions on  Turkey in an attempt to secure his release.  And he tweeted, \"Pastor  Brunson just released, will be home soon!\"  He is going to feel, I would  imagine feel pretty good about that.</p><p>Edward Lawrence is live at the White House with the latest</p><p>And Edward, fill us in.</p><p>EDWARD LAWRENCE, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT:  Yes.  I can tell you right  now that Pastor Brunson, we understand, is on a plane on his way to  Germany, to an air force base to get medical treatment there just to make  sure that he is OK.  Then White House sources are saying he's going to be  on a plane to Andrews Air Force Base arriving tomorrow at 6:00 a.m.  There  might be some ceremony but he's obviously relieved.  His family, they said  they are just relieved about this news.</p><p>In fact his lawyer says he thanked everyone for their prayers.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JAY SEKULOW, AMERICAN CENTER FOR LAW AND JUSTICE:  Many of you have been  praying for this day.  I want to thank you.  I know the pastor and his  entire family want to thank you as well.  And of course, a huge thank you  to the President and his team for securing the release of Andrew Brunson.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LAWRENCE:  Now a Turkish court actually convicted Pastor Andrew Brunson on  terrorism charges, gave him little more than three years, but then give him  time served and they lifted the travel ban which is the reason he's able to  now leave the country.  He's gotten on a plane as we said.  The White House  saying that there was no deal made with Turkey to make this happen.  So  nothing was on the table.</p><p>Turkey may have been doing this to garner some goodwill.  They are looking  for help with the investigation on the missing columnist that went into the  Saudi consulate in Turkey.</p><p>Now officials in Turkey believe that he was killed inside that consulate,  Jammal Khashoggi.  Now, they say that they have audio and video evidence  that point to that effect.  \"The Wall Street Journal\" reporting that that  evidence has been shown to U.S. intelligence agencies.</p><p>Now, Saudi's officially said that he left even though video shows him going  in but not coming out.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ADAM KINZINGER (R-IL), HOUSE FOREIGN RELATIONS COMMITTEE:  If it's true, it  appears that it is, that he was murdered in their consulate by an  assassination team, there needs to be some significant consequences to  that.  I think that's maybe eventually targeted sanctions on individuals,  that, you know, any other host of things available to this administration.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LAWRENCE:  Now the President saying that even if the Saudi government is  proven to be behind this disappearance, the U.S. may not cancel its arms  deal that it has with Saudi Arabia which includes fighter jets.  The  President saying that does not want to see the jobs go to Russia.</p><p>Now on another note here, the senior White House official telling us that  they are moving in the direction for a meeting between with the Chinese  president, President Xi Jinping, and President Donald Trump next month at  the G20 summit, a bilateral, one-on-one meeting between the two.  China  trying to avoid the 25 percent tariffs that will be bumped up at January  1st.  They are worried about their market and the effects that will happen.</p><p>The Chinese president possibly trying to get the President to back off  those tariffs.  Now, the President would like China to step up and make  some changes, at least move forward towards a trade deal with the U.S.</p><p>Trish?</p><p>REGAN:  Thank you very much, Edward Lawrence.</p><p>All right.  Joining me right now with reaction, we have Republican  Congressman Tom Reed of New York.  Good to have you here, sir.</p><p>Congressman, I'm going to start first on the China front.  Do you think  they might actually be willing to give a little here?  I mean, we are their  biggest customer.</p><p>TOM REED (R), NEW YORK CONGRESSMAN: I think they are --</p><p>REGAN:  Not doing them any favors, right?  This whole sort of \"trade war\"  if you can call it that, it's not helping China?</p><p>REED:  No.  I would agree with that assessment.  This is not sustainable  for China.  They need to come to the table.  And I believe that is exactly  where these talks will lead that they are recognizing.  That it is not in  their interests, nor in America's interest to continue a protracted trade  war.  It's time for us to come together.  It's time for China to be held  accountable for their unfair trade practices.  And I think they are in a  position to have to sit at the table to resolve this.</p><p>REGAN:  You know, Congressman the difference, however is that in China they  don't have to get elected.  I mean you got to get elected every two years,  right?  And consequently if the economy starts to turn and if corporations  starts getting kind of upset including some of, say your donor, sir, that  they can't access the Chinese markets like they used to because of all of  these problems, then at what point does it start to really bite into the  ability of American politicians to really do what's best here where just to  confront the problem?</p><p>REED:  Well I think Trish, if you look at from the other perspective.  You  know, China has -- they're not subject to election, but I will tell you  they have tremendous amount of internal strife.  If their people don't have  an expanding economy to go to work, they can't put food on table, they  can't put a roof over their head.  That causes a tremendous amount of the  stability and instability in China.</p><p>And when you look at what China is doing in regards to a debt to GDP, it's  not sustainable there either.  So China cannot withstand these.  And I  understand the political pressure, but this elephant needs to be  confronted.  And that's what we're doing.</p><p>REGAN:  Why, why is everybody --</p><p>REED:  We're holding them accountable once and for all.</p><p>REGAN:  --kind of ignore it.  I mean for -- why is it that -- I mean we --  and I shouldn't say they ignore it.  Actually I've talked to former  Treasury Secretary Bob Rubin about this and he pointed out that China is  indeed a big, big problem.  And he tried to address it during the Clinton  years.  But everybody has tried, right?</p><p>Tim Geithner, I remember trying to take this one and spend time in China  trying to deal with this.  The theft of intellectual property is a real  problem for us.  And yet, no one was quite as vocal about it shall we say  as this President.  Is it because they feared to this talk of a trade war?   Do they fear a backlash from American CEOs that would say, \"No, no, we need  to be over there, we want to be over there, it's a big market for us?\"</p><p>REED:  I think that pressure was there.  But now obviously under this  administration and with our President, we're seeing a disruptive policy put  on the table.  And China can't take the risk of not having America follow  the status quo, the traditional path if you would.  And so what I believe  is happening is they're recognizing that President Trump is serious.  And  that he is serious about holding them accountable for these unfair trade  practices.  And now is the time you're seeing results in China's movement,  in their policy shifts to come to the table to recognize they have to  resolve these issues.</p><p>REGAN:  Real quick, before I let you go.  It's very good news that the  Pastor has been released . Does this show you that sanctions can actually  work, Congressman?</p><p>REED:  Absolutely, and you can get results through strength.  And that's  what the administration sent to Turkey.  Is what it said to Turkey is we  are not going to allow an American citizen to be held captive.  And now we  should all celebrate as Americans, as Democrats and Republicans that Pastor  Brunson is coming home and coming home to his family.  That is a joint  celebration every American should be proud of.</p><p>REGAN:  Here, here, I agree.  Thank you so much.  Congressman Reed, good to  see you.</p><p>REED:  Thanks.</p><p>REGAN:  All right, we're going to be following these markets again  throughout the hour as we watch Dow that's up 52 points right now, 25,101  is the level.  Stay with us.</p><p>Residents, meanwhile in the Florida Panhandle, they are coming to terms  with the utter destruction that Hurricane Michael had left behind.  We have  a live report on cleanup and relief efforts coming up next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>REGAN:  Very sad scene in Florida right now.  In fact, everywhere you look  in the Florida Panhandle, what you see is utter devastation.  You have  beach front homes have been completely obliterated.  Only slabs of concrete  remaining, entire communities actually destroyed when category 4 Hurricane  Michael roared ashore this week.  This destruction is being called  catastrophic.</p><p>Billions of dollars will be needed to rebuild.  And now 13 deaths are being  blamed on the most powerful hurricane to hit the U.S. mainland in a  generation.</p><p>And Michael is not done yet.  Causing flash flooding, heavy rains as far  away as Virginia.  Connell McShane is joining me right now on the phone  from one of the hardest hit areas, Panama City, Florida.</p><p>Hey, Connell.</p><p>CONNELL MCSHANE, FOX BUSINESS NEWS ANCHOR (via telephone):  Hi there Trish.</p><p>We're just east of Panama City right now.  We've been moving around a lot  today as much as we can.  And we've been encountering some of the same  difficulties as the people here are in trying to recover from Hurricane  Michael and as the first-responders are been trying to help those people so  badly hurt by this hurricane.</p><p>Let me start in Mexico Beach where we spent part of our afternoon and  evening yesterday before the curfew went into place.  Well I'm sure you've  seen what we'll be able to show now some of the video of Mexico Beach that  we and our other Fox colleagues were able to shoot particularly some of the  aerial shots where you can see just how Hurricane Michael caused so much  destruction.  And that's the word, not damage, it's destruction.</p><p>There were homes that were buried a day before the hurricane which just  aren't there anymore.  It's not as if they were damaged.  They were  completely wiped out.  I was speaking to some of the National Guard troops  who are assigned to Mexico Beach, one in particular told me he's from this  area, has worked a number of hurricanes and never seen anything even close  to this bad.</p><p>Now when you get back to the area you mentioned, Panama City where we were  earlier in the day, there are parts of it in particular in Panama City  Beach are starting to recover.  Even some power that's starting to come  back.  But those few and far between as of this morning, 90 percent of that  town in Bay County was still without power.</p><p>We move to the east where we are.  Then you encounter the communication  difficulties that are really making things doubly difficult for everybody  trying to respond to this hurricane.  And that's why I'm speaking to you  now on this side of the road on a satellite phone because in an area where  the cell phone service was perfect yesterday it no longer works at all  today.  So that's one of the things the companies no doubt are trying to  get in here and get their towers back up and running.  But it depends on  which service provider you have.  For example, many of us have AT&amp;T and  that was working in some areas beautifully.</p><p>Many of the people who live here do not have Verizon or Sprint or what have  you and they weren't working at all.  So, it depends where you are, what  service provider you have.  And people are having difficult even telling  someone that they're having trouble.</p><p>And, you know, we're running to a lady earlier for example, we've been able  to ride out the storm.  She's OK.  The tree that came down, a giant oak  tree fell into the street, thank goodness, not into her house but she was  having difficulty telling her family she was OK.</p><p>Finally, she was able to walk up of a block and randomly Facebook Messenger  it came on her phone even though it didn't seem that she has service  she  leave (ph) to give a quick message t some of her family members.  So that's  the kind of thing that it making hard to recover from this hurricane.  The  idea that communicating is so difficult.</p><p>I will say Trish, the transportation has improved a little.  It's all  relative but some of the road there were completely closed yesterday are  now starting to reopen.  Thanks for the hard work of some of the  professionals and also some of the volunteers, neighbors helping neighbors  pack with their saws and chainsaws and whatever (ph) to be able to cutdown  some of tress and open the roads up.</p><p>So FEMA and the other authorities can get in.  But that's a long way to go,  Trish.  It really is something else.</p><p>REGAN:  Wow, quite an aftermath.  Connell, thank you very much.</p><p>All right.  Roller coaster here on the market up 81 right now.  We've been  up as much as 400 then we were down.  So, where we're headed right now?   It's a Friday.  So investors are going into the weekend and of course, you  know, a lot of this is gone to center around what happened come midterm  elections, right?  Because economic policy is going to be influenced by  whoever is in office.  Our panel is going to debate all that next</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>REGAN:  All right.  We're watching what has become a very volatile market  this week.  A couple rough days we had but today is looking a little  better.</p><p>We're up 50 -- nearly 50 points.  We had been trading up as much as 414  though.  So, so much for that, but at least we're out of negative  territory.  The big question is, what are these markets really mean for  Republicans come the midterms?</p><p>Joining me right now, James Freeman of \"The Wall Street Journal\" and Former  Advisor to Bill Clinton, Doug Schoen.  Good to see you both.</p><p>DOUG SCHOEN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Good to see you.</p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, \"THE WALL STREET JOURNAL\":  Good to be here, Trish, thanks.</p><p>REGAN:  Doug, I'm going to start with you.  I mean people been feeling  pretty good about the economy.  I'd tell you all the economic data points  do some very, very strong fundamentals.  But, you know, when people open up  their 401k's and they see that maybe it wasn't as good as it was last  month, what kind of effect does that have on psychology for voters?</p><p>SCHOEN:  You know, Trish, at this point, not to duck the question, it's  hard to tell.  Because usually these things take a little bit longer to  play out than what you're describing which is, you know, the beginning of  November, they get their 401k's.  They're down and so they get less  inclined to vote Republican.</p><p>Usually takes three to six months for the impact of a brief downturn and it  has been brief and has been swift to be felt.  So, as we sit here today  can't say really anything.  The polling shows if anything the Republicans  up in the last week or so, certainly in the Senate races.</p><p>REGAN:  James, I personally, and I said this earlier in the show.  I think  is a blip.  I mean, I think there are very, very good fundamentals right  now.</p><p>I think, you know, the China thing yes, it's a little bit of a threat but  we'll make it through all of that.  And as long as we continue to see wage  growth and job growth.  We're heading in the right direction and economic  growth.  But you know, nonetheless, if you have a market that's trading  lower, I don't necessarily think it will in November.  But if it were to-- </p><p>FREEMAN:    Yes.</p><p>REGAN:  -- how does that influence in your view Republican voters?</p><p>FREEMAN:  Well, I think the economy is a win for Republicans barring some  huge, sort of catastrophic event.  As you said the fundamentals are very  strong.  We just really got another reminder that this morning with the  bank earnings</p><p>These are companies that get a pretty good window into the U.S. consumer.   People paying bills on time.  They're obviously able to find jobs.   Earnings are good for the companies, the economy is growing.  So I think  that's all good and that would suggest this is a blip.</p><p>The sort of conventional wisdom is maybe the economy is so good since there  are almost no economic problems.  People kind of take that for granted and  maybe they decide on other things.</p><p>REGAN:  And that's was so hard, right, in midterms?</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.</p><p>REGAN:  I mean, you have to motivate --</p><p>FREEMAN:  Right.</p><p>REGAN:  -- voters get out there.  And if they're feeling kind a OK, then,  Doug, you run the risk of complacency.  I do think Kavanaugh changed that,  however.  If there was any complacency among the Republican base, watching  what happened with Judge Kavanaugh may have them thinking differently?</p><p>SCHOEN:  Well, certainly that's the initial indication but we've got you  know, some 20 something days to go until the election.  And, whether there  are twists and turns in terms of enthusiasm and attitudes, really remains  to be seen.</p><p>A bunch of the most recent midterms have swung in the last week to 10 days.   So I think it's not clear what's going to happen but I think James is  right.  If you look at all the indicators and certainly, Trish, you as  well, it's more -- much more good news economically for the Republicans,  notwithstanding that midterms typically go for the out party, the  opposition.</p><p>REGAN:  Yes.  So, is all this at risk, James?  I mean, if the Republicans  are not successful in midterms?  Because you know, we've heard many  Democrats say they like to reverse the tax cut and they like to tax the  wealthy?</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.</p><p>REGAN:  And tax everyone else along the way, including corporations et  cetera.  So, is some of this policy really at risk?</p><p>FREEMAN:  Well, I think you have to say this at risk because depending on  how big -- let's just imagine a big Democratic wave, if president Trump  then feels the need to negotiate to do deals, to strike the \"art of the  deal\" with Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer, that could be a very different  policy mix.  It's -- obviously if you look at most of his history Donald  Trump was not a super conservative guy.  Does he evolve back if he is  dealing with Congressional leadership with big democratic majorities?  So  that would be a question.</p><p>REGAN:  Hey, Doug, can I just ask?</p><p>SCHOEN:  Yes.</p><p>REGAN:  Looking ahead to 2020, do you think Mike Bloomberg is going to be  in the ring?</p><p>SCHOEN:  You know, I don't think he's made a final decision.  Certainly  made it clear the other day that he was going to do everything he could to  stand up to policies that the Trump administration is pursued, that he  disagrees with.  He is spending obviously close to $100 million on the  midterm elections.  So whatever the mayor or the former mayor does, he will  be a force to be reckoned with.  That's for sure.</p><p>REGAN:  And he's never registered as a Democrat.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Well, you know, if he likes to have --</p><p>SCHOEN:  He is now.</p><p>FREEMAN:  -- pro-business Democrats again.  This -- for this reason I kind  of doubt whether he can go anywhere.</p><p>REGAN:  Yes.</p><p>FREEMAN:  But it would be nice to see a kind of a market-oriented voice  back in that party.</p><p>REGAN:  Yes.  It would be the alternative which is the Alexandria Cortez  and the Bernie Sanders camp.</p><p>FREEMAN:  A 100 percent.</p><p>REGAN:  We don't need the socialist there.  Anyway, good, red-blooded  American capitalism and that's what the nation was founded on.  Doug,  James, good to see you guys.  Thank you so much.</p><p>SCHOEN:  Thank you so much, Trish.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Thanks.</p><p>REGAN:  All right 29 million Facebook users have had their information  stolen in the massive security breach that happened there last month.   Facebook says the information included everything from names and contact  information to more personal profile information like places that people  checked into and the devices used to access Facebook.</p><p>Facebook said users can check if they were affected by the attack, visiting  Facebook's Online Help Center.</p><p>Tesla is giving its customers until Monday to place car orders eligible for  a $7500 federal tax credit.  Under federal law, the full tax credit lasts  until the car company reaches 200,000 sales in 2010 which it definitely did  in July.  You know, any vehicles ordered by Monday are expected to be  delivered by the end of the year.</p><p>President Trump sparking outraged and an outcry after slamming the Fed for  being too aggressive, t does he have a point?  Is the Fed getting a little  too happy about these rate hikes?  Our panel is going to weigh in on all  that, I'll see you here next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  We have interest rates  going up at a clip that's much faster than certainly a lot of people  including myself would have anticipated.  I think the Fed is out of  control.  I think what they're doing is wrong.  I think the Fed is far too  stringent and they're making a mistake.</p><p>They're so tight.  I think the Fed has gone crazy.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REGAN:  Tell us how you really feel.  That was President Trump blasting the  Fed for being too aggressive on interests rate hike.  President Trump's  very forward and obvious frustration with the Fed, well not doing so well  with some folks but the head of JPMorgan Chase, Mr. Jamie Dimon is  defending the President saying, and I, \"I have never seen a President who  wanted interest rates to go up.\"  I think he's right on that one.  Who  would?</p><p>Joining me right now, the host of \"Making Money\" on the Fox Business  network, Charles Payne, soon to be host of \"Making Money\" at 2:00 p.m.,  more on that in just a minute.  Also Moody's Chief Economist, John Lonski.</p><p>John, yes, I don't blame him.  Who the heck wants the cost of money to go  up?</p><p>JOHN LONSKI, MOODY'S CHIEF ECONOMIST:  You've got to be more diplomatic  about your criticism of the Fed.  You can't go out there because, say that  they're lunatics or whatever he was saying.  Jerome Powell is not crazy.</p><p>REGAN:  You know what though, I know a lot of people are saying that.  But,  you know, this is a President who has a different style entirely, right.   You know, he says what he thinks.  And I'm sure there are plenty of  Presidents that thought the Fed was doing a lousy job and acting crazy, but  maybe they just never said it quite so explicitly.</p><p>LONSKI:  That's right.  And, you know, the fed has to keep an eye on  financial markets.  We now have the, you know, the overall market has sold  off sharply thus far in the month of October.  It's clearly higher.  We  have certain segments, interest sensitive segments of the market.  For  instance, that index of housing, sectors stock prices this afternoon is  down 25 percent for the year-to-date.  That's versus the overall market up  by two percent.</p><p>And moreover, motor vehicle industry stock prices.  So they're median  decline for the year-to-date is roughly 23 percent.  That's not good.  And  I think that's telling the Fed that perhaps there is reason to proceed with  greater caution, not only when they hike rates --</p><p>REGAN:  I see where it run.</p><p>LONSKI:  -- but when they talk about rate hikes.</p><p>REGAN:  IE, John Lonski agrees with President Trump.  You don't want to see  the Fed, maybe they're not crazy --</p><p>LONSKI:  But with Jerome Powell is very intelligent, very wise man.</p><p>REGAN:  Wow.</p><p>LONSKI:  And I'm pretty sure that they're doing the best job possible.</p><p>REGAN:  I'm pretty sure that even though he's the President of the United  States, Charles Payne, the head of the Federal Reserve needs to be  independent.  And I would expect him to be independent.  So he may hear a  little of the chatter and a little of the noise, but really it comes down  to the data, shouldn't it?</p><p>CHARLES PAYNE, FOX BUSINESS ANCHOR:  It should come down to the data and  the Fed has said over and over that it does.  And I got to tell you the  official communiques that they put out like the so-called dot plot in the  FOMC, you know, communique.  They suggest a very level-headed Fed that's  not going to wreck the economy, but it's the comments that are made in his  speech because almost every single day someone at the Fed is giving a  speech somewhere around the world.</p><p>And I tell you, starting to roll markets in.  And you know, there shouldn't  be any sacred cows out there politi -- specifically on a political side.   And why should the Fed be completely independent in the sense that it's  unanswerable to anyone?  It's not federal.  It doesn't matter.  It's sort  of scary for the average person out there.</p><p>REGAN:  Yes.</p><p>PAYNE:  John just talking about housing being under pressure, autos being  under pressure, that we're talking about the average American house hold.   If the Fed is worried about, you know, the larger institutions, you know.</p><p>And then as far as President Trump's criticism, we went from 2008, 2014  with zero rate hikes.  And this one in 2015, Janet Yellen figures she made  a mistake, and she waited until after the election and she raised rates  again.  So, I can see --</p><p>REGAN:  So you feel that many feels like, hey, that's fair.</p><p>PAYNES:  Right.</p><p>REGAN:  What were you doing for President Obama?  And, you know, maybe send  a little of that my way.</p><p>But here's the difference, John Lonski, in this environment right now we  have a President who does understand the economy and understands that, you  know, you want to unleash those spirits, those economic spirits, what do  you, you lower taxes, you lessen regulation.  That has translated into  growth.  We didn't get that from the Obama administration.  So the Fed was  only game in town.</p><p>LONSKI:  And the President understands commercial real estate very well.   And he must be getting some information that things are beginning to soften  in a once very strong sector because of higher short-term interest rates  and long-term interest rates.</p><p>And let's not forget, this has to be brought up, but for the first time in  memory, perhaps history, we have the Fed firming monetary policy on two  fronts.  Not only are they hiking Fed funds and pushing short-term rates  directly higher but they're passive reduction regarding their holdings of  U.S. Treasury bonds is also putting some upward pressure on long-term  interest rates.</p><p>So again, the Fed's got --</p><p>REGAN:  OK.</p><p>LONSKI:  -- to proceed very carefully.</p><p>REGAN:  But very cautiously.</p><p>LONSKI:  Yes.</p><p>REGAN:  I mean, this is the delicate dance, right, that they're always  walking.  I mean, in the meantime, there are some legitimate or growing  concerns I should say, Charles Payne, about inflation.</p><p>PAYNE:  Yes.  There are, there are, although, you know, this week what we  saw inflation in the PPI number, airline travel went through the roof.  You  know no wonder delta had a pretty good earnings report.  But then we got  the CPI report yesterday, it was relatively benign.</p><p>And so, there are signs of inflation that's the kind of classical inflation  signals that you would think that the Fed would be, you know, yellow flags  or red flags.  Although, we know they want to be ahead of the curve.   There's just --</p><p>REGAN:  Improve it (ph).  They need to forget being as -- they're usually  behind anyway.</p><p>PAYNE:  Yes.  Yes.</p><p>LONSKI:  Today we can have report on import price inflation.  Less than one  percent for consumer goods, less than one percent for all imports excluding  petroleum imports.</p><p>REGAN:  All right.  Well, here's the one --</p><p>LONSKI:  That's not a sign of inflation taking off.</p><p>REGAN:  If there's not enough and there's not enough wage growth, you know,  maybe --</p><p>LONSKI:  What's the hurry?  What's -- there's no sense of urgency for rate  hikes, that's it.</p><p>REGAN:  All right.  You and President Trump.</p><p>LONSKI:  But Jerome Powell --</p><p>REGAN:  Its given Jay Powell appear to your mind.</p><p>LONSKI:  -- level at no.  Yes.</p><p>REGAN:  All right.  Good to -- hey, Charles, I'm really excited for you.</p><p>PAYNE:  Thank you.</p><p>REGAN:  This is a great audience, you know --</p><p>PAYNE:  Thank you.</p><p>REGAN:  -- here at 2:00 p.m.  And you're all going to see Charles beginning  Monday, that's this Monday, 2:00 p.m. October 15th, \"Making Money with  Charles Payne,\" moves to 2:00, and well, I'm moving somewhere else.  I'll  tell you all about that next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>REGAN:  All right.  It's my last day on \"The Intelligence Report\".  So this  market better close up, right?  We're up at 128 points.  Let's hope it  holds throughout the hour.</p><p>Big news?  I shared this a little while ago with you.  I'll tell you again  all about it.  I'm going to primetime, 8:00 p.m., starting Monday right  after my good friend Lou, Lou Dobbs is on from 7:00 to 8:00.  I will be on  from 8:00 to 9:00.  Kennedy will follow at 9:00.  We are live at night  right here on Fox Business.</p><p>I'm really excited about it.  I, you know, I do want to point out just what  an incredible three years it has been on this show.  I mean, we created  this show with you, really.  With you.  You tuned in and it's thanks to you  that we're able to cream the competition for the last three years,  something I'm really extremely proud of.</p><p>And it's thanks to you and it's thanks to this news cycle that, you know,  we're expanding.  We're expanding so we will be live, I will be live at  8:00 p.m. every night.  The news keeps happening.  It's a 24/7 news cycle.</p><p>We're on the front lines of history and I'm there with you, reporting on  all of it.  We analyze, we present both sides, you make the decisions about  what is best for you, your family, and your wallet, right?</p><p>I want to thank -- I have an amazing team.  I want to thank everybody on  this team.  So many of you in the control room right now have been with me  from the very beginning, from the first day I was ever in this chair on  this little set that we created, and it's been wonderful.</p><p>I've gotten to know all of you and your families and you've certainly  gotten to know mine, including all three of the kids which love to come by  and hang out at work and in the studio.  So I'm going to miss all of you.   Some of you are coming with me, of course, and I'm so excited for this new  chapter and what we can do and what we can accomplish.</p><p>We have so many tremendous journalists here at Fox Business and we are in a  tremendous news cycle.  So this is the value add that we bring.</p><p>It's going to be a little different at home, so my husband and I had to get  a little creative on this front because we used to have family dinner at  6:00 p.m. every night.  Now it's going to be family breakfast at 6:30, when  I take the kids to school.</p><p>And then it's following the news cycle for you.  I'm looking forward to it.   I'm going to see you Monday night.</p><p>Gosh, I hope this market ends up, Liz Claman, 137 points.  We got to hang  on to this one.</p><p>LIZ CLAMAN, FOX BUSINESS ANCHOR:  Yes.  Yes.  Let's give you a green good- bye.  Trish, another live --</p><p>REGAN:  Thank you.</p><p>CLAMAN:  -- presence in primetime on Fox Business.</p><p>REGAN:  Charles is going to be --</p><p>CLAMAN:  Go.  Go.  Go.</p><p>REGAN:  -- right here at 2:00 p.m.</p><p>CLAMAN:  Yes.  And we will welcome Charles and we wish you the best of  luck, Trish.</p><p>REGAN:  Thank you Liz.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC.

It will.</p><p> REGAN:  All right.  Thank you.  Fingers crossed.</p><p> CAVUTO:  All righty.</p><p> REGAN:  All right.  Thanks, Neil.</p><p> Breaking right now, everyone, another wild day on Wall Street, we're  looking at a Dow that's up, right now, 95 points after being up 400 points  at the open and then it dipped a little down into negative territory, now  we're back up.  Let's see what happened.  It's a wild ride.  We got a live  report from the NYSE straight ahead.</p><p> I am Trish Regan.  Welcome, everyone, to the final edition, dare I say, the  final edition of \"The Intelligence Report.\"</p><p> Also breaking today, an American pastor who has been detained in Turkey for  the last two years is finally coming back home.  President Trump thrilled  with the news, tweeting in all caps, \"Pastor Brunson just released, will be  home soon!\"  We have a live report coming up from the White House straight  ahead.</p><p> And take a look here at this devastating video coming to us from Mexico  Beach, Florida.  The small coastal town decimated by Hurricane Michael.  We  have a live report from Panama City, Florida on the cleanup and relief  efforts.</p><p> But first, we're going to Deirdre Bolton who's on the floor of the NYSE for  more on today's wild ride. What's causing it?</p><p> DEIRDRE BOLTON, FOX BUSINESS ANCHOR:  It's right, Trish, especially  following the previous two days that we've had.  So the big question of  course today is can these gains hold?</p><p> So right now I want to call your attention to the tech stocks.  These had  been the most beaten down in the past of two sessions combined.  They are  what is holding up the gains as we see right now.</p><p> So I'm going to go through some of the names that you know well.  We have  Apple, Amazon, Google and NVIDIA, I should say.  Alphabet Google still down  for the week but very much the strongest mover today.  Of course we pay a  lot of attention because as far as the weighting go in the S&amp;P 500 we know  that tech by market cap is the heaviest, the strongest as far as the  industry groups go.</p><p> Trish, we're also focused on the financials, as you know four banks  reported before the earnings started.  They remain actually the biggest  drag right now on the broader markets.  So interestingly enough, JPMorgan  shares (ph) beat on the top and the bottom line earlier.  This was mover to  the upside that has since changed.</p><p> And it seems as if traders are focused on one key part of the outlook  statement.  I'm going to read it directly.  The non-interest revenue growth  will be between seven percent and eight percent.</p><p> But the thing that is concerning a lot of investors in the stock, and  perhaps even in the broader industry is market dependent.  Meaning, let's  see how our business does outside of the profitable business that we expect  to have by loaning out money as rates go higher.</p><p> As for some of the other financials, PNC is down.  It has actually had a  very rough week.  Wells Fargo and Citi, the other two companies that  reported earnings before the bell, little bit of mixed.  Basically one  beating on revenue, slight miss on earnings, one beating on earnings,  slight miss on revenue, both of those stocks heading marginally higher.</p><p> So, Trish, the push and pull is basically tech versus financials.  Back to  you.</p><p> REGAN:  All right.  Deirdre Bolton, thank you very much.</p><p> Joining me right now onset, our very own Kristina Partsinevelos.  We also  have Kingsview Asset Management Chief Investment Officer, Scott Martin.   Good to see both of you both guys.</p><p> I believe -- do we have Paul Dietrich with us too?  Another investor.  He's  joining -- there we go.  There you -- I knew you're around there, Paul.</p><p> PAUL DIETRICH, FAIRFAX GLOBAL MARKET CEO:  Hi, Trish.</p><p> REGAN:  I'm going to start with you.  Wild market, is this the way of the  future right now or is this just a little blip?</p><p> DIETRICH:  What this is, is, this is a reversion to mean normalizing  correction.  One of the things that's happened over this past, actually  more than a year is that you've had five big tech stocks that have  dominated the performance as of the end of August, they were represented 47  percent of the performance of the S&amp;P 500.  And what we've seen basically,  really for the last month or so, is the tech stocks have been going down  and they're reverting to mean of a more normalized stock market trend.  And  they're very, very high in P.E.s.</p><p> And so, I see this as a very healthy correction in that, you know, the tech  stocks are coming back in line with the rest of the 495 stocks in the S&amp;P  500.</p><p> REGAN:  Kristina?</p><p> KRISTINA PARTSINEVELOS, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT:  I think we can't just  solely focus on tech.  If you look yesterday I was on the New York Stock  Exchange 2:43 p.m., just the intraday volume dropped so much, that we  haven't seen a drop like that in eight years since the \"flash crash.\"  So I  think that based of the traders I was speaking to -- volatility is going to  continue to be an issue.</p><p> We're heading -- earnings started today at JPMorgan.  JPMorgan is supposed  to be good right now.  Their revenue climbed higher, up what, 24 percent  for the quarter, the third quarter.  Sorry, profits up 24 percent.  And yet  you're seeing that stock down today which you would expect it to be better  like Deirdre brought up.  The guidance is concerning.</p><p> So I think going into the earning season, looking into the future, we're  going to be paying close attention to the guidance of a lot of these  companies.</p><p> REGAN:  Well, you know, right now, earning seem, actually Scott, pretty  good, right?  I mean, so far so good.  We've got strong economic  fundamentals.  I do wonder if some people are saying to themselves, wait a  second, you know what?  I can make a little more money on the C.D. at the  local bank because Treasury yields are going up, interest rates are going  up.  And so, is this a bit of a rotation as well and that people now have  more opportunity in the investment landscape?</p><p> SCOTT MARTN, KINGSVIEW ASSET MANAGEMENT CIO:  It could be.  Now, gosh, I  hope that mom and pop sitting at home aren't thinking about that, you know,  two percent or 2.5 percent C.D. just yet, Trish, because I think --</p><p> REGAN:  Well, Scott, you know that I'm using that to characterize something  broader, right?</p><p> MARTIN:  OK.  Sure.</p><p> REGAN:  Which is that investors are saying to themselves, \"OK, I have more  optionality.  It used to be equities are the only game in town.  Well maybe  I can put a little money in fixed income now.\"</p><p> MARTIN:  Fair play, right, exactly.  Maybe the 10-year bond.  And so you're  right.  That's providing an alternative.  And I to the point that k-parts  made was visibility is in question here.</p><p> I get it that earning are good, you know in fact, I think the bar, at least  psychologically based on some of the preannouncements has been lowered, so  that's good.  But the visibility is cloudy.  I mean, you look at the  incident surrounding tariffs.  GDP obviously going forward, it look strong,  but then the job market is kind of maybe leveling off here, I mean, still  growing but not growing at the higher rates that we saw it earlier this  year.</p><p> REGAN:  Yes, but is that enough to cause you to just say, you know, throw  in the towel and go?</p><p> SCOTT:  Well, what it could do though, here's the thing, in highly  psychological market as Paul mentioned, you know, this is a market, Trish,  that could take that as a reason to sell first and ask questions later.   And that's the story of say, certainly yesterday and the day before.</p><p> REGAN:  How does the Fed factor into all of this, Paul?  By the way the  President is not too happy with the Fed right now.  Most presidents don't  really like the Fed.</p><p> DIETRICH:  Yes.  Exactly.  Yes, I mean, --</p><p> REGAN:  Maybe Obama did.  He should have anyway.</p><p> DIETRICH:  -- let's face it.  This is an election year and President Trump  is really promoting the State of the U.S. economy which is really good and  it's firing on all cylinders.  And so when you see a stock market  collection like we've seen over the last few days, you know he has to blame  someone, and so he is blaming the Federal Reserve.</p><p> I think this is normal. This is politics. But --</p><p> SCOTT:  Dangerous.</p><p> DIETRICH:  No, no, no.</p><p> REGAN:  No, by the way, no, it's not dangerous.</p><p> DIETRICH:  Not if it's all rhetoric.</p><p> REGAN:  It's only if the Fed actually listened but, Scott, I'm going to  give Jay Powell a little more credit than that.</p><p> PARTSINEVELOS:  Oh, Jay Powell actually come out in broadcast interview  with NPR Marketplace that he's going to follow through with this.  He said  that he's going to stick to the facts, and what the economy is showing, not  a political play.  And it shouldn't be a political play.</p><p> REGAN:  No, absolutely.</p><p> PARTSINEVELOS:  You have presidents who have been very --</p><p> MARTIN: Reverse the lines.</p><p> PARTSINEVELOS:  -- critical of monetary policy.  But in this case look at  where interest rates are now.  Look at it historically, they've been very,  very low.  The economy is growing.</p><p> Yes, we had inflation coming at 2.3 percent, but we have a very, very tight  labor force.  You have Walgreen saying that they're going to increase their  salaries, Amazon announcing that $15 per hour.  So there's possibly this  inflation fear right now.</p><p> REGAN:  You know we were talking to the gentleman, the founder, Jerry Fine  of Oak Tree Asset Management just the other day, and one thing that he  mentioned was that a lot of the companies he speaks to regularly are  starting to say, places like Walmart for example, you know, inflation is  running a little higher than what you might think.  That wages are growing  faster than 2.8 percent.  And their production costs are increasing.</p><p> And so the Fed needs to take all that into account.  And that, Kristina,  their job is to make sure that, you know, things don't get too overheated,  right?</p><p> PARTSINEVELOS:  Right.</p><p> REGAN:  Because then you get problems down the road.  But it's a tightrope,  the Fed got to walk.</p><p> PARTSINEVELOS:  Which is -- it's very difficult position for Jay Powell to  be in.  But I think also we should preface that there is two different  kinds of inflation.  You also have manmade inflation when you have the  tariffs come into play.</p><p> So the fact that literally 50 percent of all Chinese goods that enter the  United States at this moment are being taxed.  And potentially could be all  100 percent.  That inevitably will have an effect on companies, on us.</p><p> REGAN:  Yes, no, I get you, I hear you.  But Scott, I think that that's  kind of a short-term play.  How are you thinking about China right now?   And you heard me say, if we don't start dealing with this, and the theft of  intellectual property, $600 billion a year, if we don't deal with it now  it's going to be a whole lot harder to deal with it in the future.</p><p> MARTIN:  I agree.  To your question, how is China?  I don't know, look at  their stock market, it's absolutely blasted.</p><p> REGAN:  It's not good.</p><p> MARTIN:  No, not good.</p><p> So, you're right, that probably brings them to the table, because honestly,  Trish, before this tariff talk really heated up, I mean if you go back even  to last year, there were problems under the surface in China, anyway  economically.  So now this is really starting to hurt them.</p><p> Your point with Kristina is good about inflation because if you look at  material cost guides, those are dropping by enlarge around the world.  You  know it's not that hard to produce things anymore.  There's a lot of price  competitiveness other than oil that we've seen bump up recently.</p><p> So, to me the inflation story is all about wages and it's nowhere.</p><p> REGAN:  All right, so Scott, are you buying right now or you're going to  sit by the sidelines and wait?</p><p> MARTIN:  Yes, sit by the fire, and maybe have a cigar and think about it.   But I will be buying probably next week.  I think you got to --</p><p> REGAN:  All right.</p><p> MARTIN:  -- let the psychological kind of walkout here, though.</p><p> REGAN:  You should have bought yesterday.  Paul, your thoughts, final  thoughts.</p><p> MARTIN:  Or maybe this morning.  Right.</p><p> DIETRICH:  The story that nobody is talking about with inflation, because  inflation has been a problem in the past, but -- and we've only seen for  the last 60 years bad inflation where the government spends too much and  then has to print money that causes inflation.  But there's good inflation.   You know when wages are going up, and prices are going up because people  can price in the cost, that creates a virtues circle and government doesn't  have to print money.</p><p> MARTIN:  It's natural.</p><p> REGAN:  Right.  And listen, you don't want to have to fight deflation,  that's whole other can of worms that incredibly --</p><p> MARTIN:  Can't win that fight.</p><p> REGAN:  Yes.  It's good to see you guys.  Thank you, Kristina, Paul, Scott.</p><p> I do want to point out we've got breaking news coming in to us right now.   The President says he will be traveling to Florida and to Georgia early  next week to survey some of the damage that are caused by Hurricane  Michael.  This is the tweet that he just issued.</p><p> He said, \"People have no idea how hard Hurricane Michael has hit the great  state of Georgia.  I will be visiting both Florida and Georgia early next  week.  We are working hard on every area and every state that was hit, we  are with you.\"</p><p> Also breaking today, American Pastor Andrew Bronson is on his way home  after being released by a Turkish court.  So what does that mean for U.S.  and Turkey relations going forward?  I'm going to asking New York  Congressman, Tom Reed, that very question next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> REGAN:  Another roller coaster ride here but at least for now anyway, we're  in positive territory.  You can see we've been all over the place.  Up as  much as 400 in change as we started the day.  And then down, well, now,  still up, barely.</p><p> Meanwhile, we've got some good news out of Turkey today as the American  Pastor Andrew Brunson is now on a plane home after a court ruled he should  be released.  He had been sentenced to more than three years on terrorism  charges despite living in Turkey for more than 20 years.</p><p> President Trump had imposed sanctions, some pretty strict sanctions on  Turkey in an attempt to secure his release.  And he tweeted, \"Pastor  Brunson just released, will be home soon!\"  He is going to feel, I would  imagine feel pretty good about that.</p><p> Edward Lawrence is live at the White House with the latest</p><p> And Edward, fill us in.</p><p> EDWARD LAWRENCE, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT:  Yes.  I can tell you right  now that Pastor Brunson, we understand, is on a plane on his way to  Germany, to an air force base to get medical treatment there just to make  sure that he is OK.  Then White House sources are saying he's going to be  on a plane to Andrews Air Force Base arriving tomorrow at 6:00 a.m.  There  might be some ceremony but he's obviously relieved.  His family, they said  they are just relieved about this news.</p><p> In fact his lawyer says he thanked everyone for their prayers.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> JAY SEKULOW, AMERICAN CENTER FOR LAW AND JUSTICE:  Many of you have been  praying for this day.  I want to thank you.  I know the pastor and his  entire family want to thank you as well.  And of course, a huge thank you  to the President and his team for securing the release of Andrew Brunson.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> LAWRENCE:  Now a Turkish court actually convicted Pastor Andrew Brunson on  terrorism charges, gave him little more than three years, but then give him  time served and they lifted the travel ban which is the reason he's able to  now leave the country.  He's gotten on a plane as we said.  The White House  saying that there was no deal made with Turkey to make this happen.  So  nothing was on the table.</p><p> Turkey may have been doing this to garner some goodwill.  They are looking  for help with the investigation on the missing columnist that went into the  Saudi consulate in Turkey.</p><p> Now officials in Turkey believe that he was killed inside that consulate,  Jammal Khashoggi.  Now, they say that they have audio and video evidence  that point to that effect.  \"The Wall Street Journal\" reporting that that  evidence has been shown to U.S. intelligence agencies.</p><p> Now, Saudi's officially said that he left even though video shows him going  in but not coming out.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> ADAM KINZINGER (R-IL), HOUSE FOREIGN RELATIONS COMMITTEE:  If it's true, it  appears that it is, that he was murdered in their consulate by an  assassination team, there needs to be some significant consequences to  that.  I think that's maybe eventually targeted sanctions on individuals,  that, you know, any other host of things available to this administration.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> LAWRENCE:  Now the President saying that even if the Saudi government is  proven to be behind this disappearance, the U.S. may not cancel its arms  deal that it has with Saudi Arabia which includes fighter jets.  The  President saying that does not want to see the jobs go to Russia.</p><p> Now on another note here, the senior White House official telling us that  they are moving in the direction for a meeting between with the Chinese  president, President Xi Jinping, and President Donald Trump next month at  the G20 summit, a bilateral, one-on-one meeting between the two.  China  trying to avoid the 25 percent tariffs that will be bumped up at January  1st.  They are worried about their market and the effects that will happen.</p><p> The Chinese president possibly trying to get the President to back off  those tariffs.  Now, the President would like China to step up and make  some changes, at least move forward towards a trade deal with the U.S.</p><p> Trish?</p><p> REGAN:  Thank you very much, Edward Lawrence.</p><p> All right.  Joining me right now with reaction, we have Republican  Congressman Tom Reed of New York.  Good to have you here, sir.</p><p> Congressman, I'm going to start first on the China front.  Do you think  they might actually be willing to give a little here?  I mean, we are their  biggest customer.</p><p> TOM REED (R), NEW YORK CONGRESSMAN: I think they are --</p><p> REGAN:  Not doing them any favors, right?  This whole sort of \"trade war\"  if you can call it that, it's not helping China?</p><p> REED:  No.  I would agree with that assessment.  This is not sustainable  for China.  They need to come to the table.  And I believe that is exactly  where these talks will lead that they are recognizing.  That it is not in  their interests, nor in America's interest to continue a protracted trade  war.  It's time for us to come together.  It's time for China to be held  accountable for their unfair trade practices.  And I think they are in a  position to have to sit at the table to resolve this.</p><p> REGAN:  You know, Congressman the difference, however is that in China they  don't have to get elected.  I mean you got to get elected every two years,  right?  And consequently if the economy starts to turn and if corporations  starts getting kind of upset including some of, say your donor, sir, that  they can't access the Chinese markets like they used to because of all of  these problems, then at what point does it start to really bite into the  ability of American politicians to really do what's best here where just to  confront the problem?</p><p> REED:  Well I think Trish, if you look at from the other perspective.  You  know, China has -- they're not subject to election, but I will tell you  they have tremendous amount of internal strife.  If their people don't have  an expanding economy to go to work, they can't put food on table, they  can't put a roof over their head.  That causes a tremendous amount of the  stability and instability in China.</p><p> And when you look at what China is doing in regards to a debt to GDP, it's  not sustainable there either.  So China cannot withstand these.  And I  understand the political pressure, but this elephant needs to be  confronted.  And that's what we're doing.</p><p> REGAN:  Why, why is everybody --</p><p> REED:  We're holding them accountable once and for all.</p><p> REGAN:  --kind of ignore it.  I mean for -- why is it that -- I mean we --  and I shouldn't say they ignore it.  Actually I've talked to former  Treasury Secretary Bob Rubin about this and he pointed out that China is  indeed a big, big problem.  And he tried to address it during the Clinton  years.  But everybody has tried, right?</p><p> Tim Geithner, I remember trying to take this one and spend time in China  trying to deal with this.  The theft of intellectual property is a real  problem for us.  And yet, no one was quite as vocal about it shall we say  as this President.  Is it because they feared to this talk of a trade war?   Do they fear a backlash from American CEOs that would say, \"No, no, we need  to be over there, we want to be over there, it's a big market for us?\"</p><p> REED:  I think that pressure was there.  But now obviously under this  administration and with our President, we're seeing a disruptive policy put  on the table.  And China can't take the risk of not having America follow  the status quo, the traditional path if you would.  And so what I believe  is happening is they're recognizing that President Trump is serious.  And  that he is serious about holding them accountable for these unfair trade  practices.  And now is the time you're seeing results in China's movement,  in their policy shifts to come to the table to recognize they have to  resolve these issues.</p><p> REGAN:  Real quick, before I let you go.  It's very good news that the  Pastor has been released . Does this show you that sanctions can actually  work, Congressman?</p><p> REED:  Absolutely, and you can get results through strength.  And that's  what the administration sent to Turkey.  Is what it said to Turkey is we  are not going to allow an American citizen to be held captive.  And now we  should all celebrate as Americans, as Democrats and Republicans that Pastor  Brunson is coming home and coming home to his family.  That is a joint  celebration every American should be proud of.</p><p> REGAN:  Here, here, I agree.  Thank you so much.  Congressman Reed, good to  see you.</p><p> REED:  Thanks.</p><p> REGAN:  All right, we're going to be following these markets again  throughout the hour as we watch Dow that's up 52 points right now, 25,101  is the level.  Stay with us.</p><p> Residents, meanwhile in the Florida Panhandle, they are coming to terms  with the utter destruction that Hurricane Michael had left behind.  We have  a live report on cleanup and relief efforts coming up next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> REGAN:  Very sad scene in Florida right now.  In fact, everywhere you look  in the Florida Panhandle, what you see is utter devastation.  You have  beach front homes have been completely obliterated.  Only slabs of concrete  remaining, entire communities actually destroyed when category 4 Hurricane  Michael roared ashore this week.  This destruction is being called  catastrophic.</p><p> Billions of dollars will be needed to rebuild.  And now 13 deaths are being  blamed on the most powerful hurricane to hit the U.S. mainland in a  generation.</p><p> And Michael is not done yet.  Causing flash flooding, heavy rains as far  away as Virginia.  Connell McShane is joining me right now on the phone  from one of the hardest hit areas, Panama City, Florida.</p><p> Hey, Connell.</p><p> CONNELL MCSHANE, FOX BUSINESS NEWS ANCHOR (via telephone):  Hi there Trish.</p><p> We're just east of Panama City right now.  We've been moving around a lot  today as much as we can.  And we've been encountering some of the same  difficulties as the people here are in trying to recover from Hurricane  Michael and as the first-responders are been trying to help those people so  badly hurt by this hurricane.</p><p> Let me start in Mexico Beach where we spent part of our afternoon and  evening yesterday before the curfew went into place.  Well I'm sure you've  seen what we'll be able to show now some of the video of Mexico Beach that  we and our other Fox colleagues were able to shoot particularly some of the  aerial shots where you can see just how Hurricane Michael caused so much  destruction.  And that's the word, not damage, it's destruction.</p><p> There were homes that were buried a day before the hurricane which just  aren't there anymore.  It's not as if they were damaged.  They were  completely wiped out.  I was speaking to some of the National Guard troops  who are assigned to Mexico Beach, one in particular told me he's from this  area, has worked a number of hurricanes and never seen anything even close  to this bad.</p><p> Now when you get back to the area you mentioned, Panama City where we were  earlier in the day, there are parts of it in particular in Panama City  Beach are starting to recover.  Even some power that's starting to come  back.  But those few and far between as of this morning, 90 percent of that  town in Bay County was still without power.</p><p> We move to the east where we are.  Then you encounter the communication  difficulties that are really making things doubly difficult for everybody  trying to respond to this hurricane.  And that's why I'm speaking to you  now on this side of the road on a satellite phone because in an area where  the cell phone service was perfect yesterday it no longer works at all  today.  So that's one of the things the companies no doubt are trying to  get in here and get their towers back up and running.  But it depends on  which service provider you have.  For example, many of us have AT&amp;T and  that was working in some areas beautifully.</p><p> Many of the people who live here do not have Verizon or Sprint or what have  you and they weren't working at all.  So, it depends where you are, what  service provider you have.  And people are having difficult even telling  someone that they're having trouble.</p><p> And, you know, we're running to a lady earlier for example, we've been able  to ride out the storm.  She's OK.  The tree that came down, a giant oak  tree fell into the street, thank goodness, not into her house but she was  having difficulty telling her family she was OK.</p><p> Finally, she was able to walk up of a block and randomly Facebook Messenger  it came on her phone even though it didn't seem that she has service  she  leave (ph) to give a quick message t some of her family members.  So that's  the kind of thing that it making hard to recover from this hurricane.  The  idea that communicating is so difficult.</p><p> I will say Trish, the transportation has improved a little.  It's all  relative but some of the road there were completely closed yesterday are  now starting to reopen.  Thanks for the hard work of some of the  professionals and also some of the volunteers, neighbors helping neighbors  pack with their saws and chainsaws and whatever (ph) to be able to cutdown  some of tress and open the roads up.</p><p> So FEMA and the other authorities can get in.  But that's a long way to go,  Trish.  It really is something else.</p><p> REGAN:  Wow, quite an aftermath.  Connell, thank you very much.</p><p> All right.  Roller coaster here on the market up 81 right now.  We've been  up as much as 400 then we were down.  So, where we're headed right now?   It's a Friday.  So investors are going into the weekend and of course, you  know, a lot of this is gone to center around what happened come midterm  elections, right?  Because economic policy is going to be influenced by  whoever is in office.  Our panel is going to debate all that next</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> REGAN:  All right.  We're watching what has become a very volatile market  this week.  A couple rough days we had but today is looking a little  better.</p><p> We're up 50 -- nearly 50 points.  We had been trading up as much as 414  though.  So, so much for that, but at least we're out of negative  territory.  The big question is, what are these markets really mean for  Republicans come the midterms?</p><p> Joining me right now, James Freeman of \"The Wall Street Journal\" and Former  Advisor to Bill Clinton, Doug Schoen.  Good to see you both.</p><p> DOUG SCHOEN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Good to see you.</p><p> JAMES FREEMAN, \"THE WALL STREET JOURNAL\":  Good to be here, Trish, thanks.</p><p> REGAN:  Doug, I'm going to start with you.  I mean people been feeling  pretty good about the economy.  I'd tell you all the economic data points  do some very, very strong fundamentals.  But, you know, when people open up  their 401k's and they see that maybe it wasn't as good as it was last  month, what kind of effect does that have on psychology for voters?</p><p> SCHOEN:  You know, Trish, at this point, not to duck the question, it's  hard to tell.  Because usually these things take a little bit longer to  play out than what you're describing which is, you know, the beginning of  November, they get their 401k's.  They're down and so they get less  inclined to vote Republican.</p><p> Usually takes three to six months for the impact of a brief downturn and it  has been brief and has been swift to be felt.  So, as we sit here today  can't say really anything.  The polling shows if anything the Republicans  up in the last week or so, certainly in the Senate races.</p><p> REGAN:  James, I personally, and I said this earlier in the show.  I think  is a blip.  I mean, I think there are very, very good fundamentals right  now.</p><p> I think, you know, the China thing yes, it's a little bit of a threat but  we'll make it through all of that.  And as long as we continue to see wage  growth and job growth.  We're heading in the right direction and economic  growth.  But you know, nonetheless, if you have a market that's trading  lower, I don't necessarily think it will in November.  But if it were to-- </p><p> FREEMAN:    Yes.</p><p> REGAN:  -- how does that influence in your view Republican voters?</p><p> FREEMAN:  Well, I think the economy is a win for Republicans barring some  huge, sort of catastrophic event.  As you said the fundamentals are very  strong.  We just really got another reminder that this morning with the  bank earnings</p><p>  These are companies that get a pretty good window into the U.S. consumer.   People paying bills on time.  They're obviously able to find jobs.   Earnings are good for the companies, the economy is growing.  So I think  that's all good and that would suggest this is a blip.</p><p> The sort of conventional wisdom is maybe the economy is so good since there  are almost no economic problems.  People kind of take that for granted and  maybe they decide on other things.</p><p> REGAN:  And that's was so hard, right, in midterms?</p><p> FREEMAN:  Yes.</p><p> REGAN:  I mean, you have to motivate --</p><p> FREEMAN:  Right.</p><p> REGAN:  -- voters get out there.  And if they're feeling kind a OK, then,  Doug, you run the risk of complacency.  I do think Kavanaugh changed that,  however.  If there was any complacency among the Republican base, watching  what happened with Judge Kavanaugh may have them thinking differently?</p><p> SCHOEN:  Well, certainly that's the initial indication but we've got you  know, some 20 something days to go until the election.  And, whether there  are twists and turns in terms of enthusiasm and attitudes, really remains  to be seen.</p><p> A bunch of the most recent midterms have swung in the last week to 10 days.   So I think it's not clear what's going to happen but I think James is  right.  If you look at all the indicators and certainly, Trish, you as  well, it's more -- much more good news economically for the Republicans,  notwithstanding that midterms typically go for the out party, the  opposition.</p><p> REGAN:  Yes.  So, is all this at risk, James?  I mean, if the Republicans  are not successful in midterms?  Because you know, we've heard many  Democrats say they like to reverse the tax cut and they like to tax the  wealthy?</p><p> FREEMAN:  Yes.</p><p> REGAN:  And tax everyone else along the way, including corporations et  cetera.  So, is some of this policy really at risk?</p><p> FREEMAN:  Well, I think you have to say this at risk because depending on  how big -- let's just imagine a big Democratic wave, if president Trump  then feels the need to negotiate to do deals, to strike the \"art of the  deal\" with Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer, that could be a very different  policy mix.  It's -- obviously if you look at most of his history Donald  Trump was not a super conservative guy.  Does he evolve back if he is  dealing with Congressional leadership with big democratic majorities?  So  that would be a question.</p><p> REGAN:  Hey, Doug, can I just ask?</p><p> SCHOEN:  Yes.</p><p> REGAN:  Looking ahead to 2020, do you think Mike Bloomberg is going to be  in the ring?</p><p> SCHOEN:  You know, I don't think he's made a final decision.  Certainly  made it clear the other day that he was going to do everything he could to  stand up to policies that the Trump administration is pursued, that he  disagrees with.  He is spending obviously close to $100 million on the  midterm elections.  So whatever the mayor or the former mayor does, he will  be a force to be reckoned with.  That's for sure.</p><p> REGAN:  And he's never registered as a Democrat.</p><p> FREEMAN:  Well, you know, if he likes to have --</p><p> SCHOEN:  He is now.</p><p> FREEMAN:  -- pro-business Democrats again.  This -- for this reason I kind  of doubt whether he can go anywhere.</p><p> REGAN:  Yes.</p><p> FREEMAN:  But it would be nice to see a kind of a market-oriented voice  back in that party.</p><p> REGAN:  Yes.  It would be the alternative which is the Alexandria Cortez  and the Bernie Sanders camp.</p><p> FREEMAN:  A 100 percent.</p><p> REGAN:  We don't need the socialist there.  Anyway, good, red-blooded  American capitalism and that's what the nation was founded on.  Doug,  James, good to see you guys.  Thank you so much.</p><p> SCHOEN:  Thank you so much, Trish.</p><p> FREEMAN:  Thanks.</p><p> REGAN:  All right 29 million Facebook users have had their information  stolen in the massive security breach that happened there last month.   Facebook says the information included everything from names and contact  information to more personal profile information like places that people  checked into and the devices used to access Facebook.</p><p>Facebook said users can check if they were affected by the attack, visiting  Facebook's Online Help Center.</p><p>Tesla is giving its customers until Monday to place car orders eligible for  a $7500 federal tax credit.  Under federal law, the full tax credit lasts  until the car company reaches 200,000 sales in 2010 which it definitely did  in July.  You know, any vehicles ordered by Monday are expected to be  delivered by the end of the year.</p><p> President Trump sparking outraged and an outcry after slamming the Fed for  being too aggressive, t does he have a point?  Is the Fed getting a little  too happy about these rate hikes?  Our panel is going to weigh in on all  that, I'll see you here next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  We have interest rates  going up at a clip that's much faster than certainly a lot of people  including myself would have anticipated.  I think the Fed is out of  control.  I think what they're doing is wrong.  I think the Fed is far too  stringent and they're making a mistake.</p><p> They're so tight.  I think the Fed has gone crazy.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> REGAN:  Tell us how you really feel.  That was President Trump blasting the  Fed for being too aggressive on interests rate hike.  President Trump's  very forward and obvious frustration with the Fed, well not doing so well  with some folks but the head of JPMorgan Chase, Mr. Jamie Dimon is  defending the President saying, and I, \"I have never seen a President who  wanted interest rates to go up.\"  I think he's right on that one.  Who  would?</p><p> Joining me right now, the host of \"Making Money\" on the Fox Business  network, Charles Payne, soon to be host of \"Making Money\" at 2:00 p.m.,  more on that in just a minute.  Also Moody's Chief Economist, John Lonski.</p><p> John, yes, I don't blame him.  Who the heck wants the cost of money to go  up?</p><p> JOHN LONSKI, MOODY'S CHIEF ECONOMIST:  You've got to be more diplomatic  about your criticism of the Fed.  You can't go out there because, say that  they're lunatics or whatever he was saying.  Jerome Powell is not crazy.</p><p> REGAN:  You know what though, I know a lot of people are saying that.  But,  you know, this is a President who has a different style entirely, right.   You know, he says what he thinks.  And I'm sure there are plenty of  Presidents that thought the Fed was doing a lousy job and acting crazy, but  maybe they just never said it quite so explicitly.</p><p> LONSKI:  That's right.  And, you know, the fed has to keep an eye on  financial markets.  We now have the, you know, the overall market has sold  off sharply thus far in the month of October.  It's clearly higher.  We  have certain segments, interest sensitive segments of the market.  For  instance, that index of housing, sectors stock prices this afternoon is  down 25 percent for the year-to-date.  That's versus the overall market up  by two percent.</p><p> And moreover, motor vehicle industry stock prices.  So they're median  decline for the year-to-date is roughly 23 percent.  That's not good.  And  I think that's telling the Fed that perhaps there is reason to proceed with  greater caution, not only when they hike rates --</p><p> REGAN:  I see where it run.</p><p> LONSKI:  -- but when they talk about rate hikes.</p><p> REGAN:  IE, John Lonski agrees with President Trump.  You don't want to see  the Fed, maybe they're not crazy --</p><p> LONSKI:  But with Jerome Powell is very intelligent, very wise man.</p><p> REGAN:  Wow.</p><p> LONSKI:  And I'm pretty sure that they're doing the best job possible.</p><p> REGAN:  I'm pretty sure that even though he's the President of the United  States, Charles Payne, the head of the Federal Reserve needs to be  independent.  And I would expect him to be independent.  So he may hear a  little of the chatter and a little of the noise, but really it comes down  to the data, shouldn't it?</p><p> CHARLES PAYNE, FOX BUSINESS ANCHOR:  It should come down to the data and  the Fed has said over and over that it does.  And I got to tell you the  official communiques that they put out like the so-called dot plot in the  FOMC, you know, communique.  They suggest a very level-headed Fed that's  not going to wreck the economy, but it's the comments that are made in his  speech because almost every single day someone at the Fed is giving a  speech somewhere around the world.</p><p> And I tell you, starting to roll markets in.  And you know, there shouldn't  be any sacred cows out there politi -- specifically on a political side.   And why should the Fed be completely independent in the sense that it's  unanswerable to anyone?  It's not federal.  It doesn't matter.  It's sort  of scary for the average person out there.</p><p> REGAN:  Yes.</p><p> PAYNE:  John just talking about housing being under pressure, autos being  under pressure, that we're talking about the average American house hold.   If the Fed is worried about, you know, the larger institutions, you know.</p><p> And then as far as President Trump's criticism, we went from 2008, 2014  with zero rate hikes.  And this one in 2015, Janet Yellen figures she made  a mistake, and she waited until after the election and she raised rates  again.  So, I can see --</p><p> REGAN:  So you feel that many feels like, hey, that's fair.</p><p> PAYNES:  Right.</p><p> REGAN:  What were you doing for President Obama?  And, you know, maybe send  a little of that my way.</p><p> But here's the difference, John Lonski, in this environment right now we  have a President who does understand the economy and understands that, you  know, you want to unleash those spirits, those economic spirits, what do  you, you lower taxes, you lessen regulation.  That has translated into  growth.  We didn't get that from the Obama administration.  So the Fed was  only game in town.</p><p> LONSKI:  And the President understands commercial real estate very well.   And he must be getting some information that things are beginning to soften  in a once very strong sector because of higher short-term interest rates  and long-term interest rates.</p><p> And let's not forget, this has to be brought up, but for the first time in  memory, perhaps history, we have the Fed firming monetary policy on two  fronts.  Not only are they hiking Fed funds and pushing short-term rates  directly higher but they're passive reduction regarding their holdings of  U.S. Treasury bonds is also putting some upward pressure on long-term  interest rates.</p><p> So again, the Fed's got --</p><p> REGAN:  OK.</p><p> LONSKI:  -- to proceed very carefully.</p><p> REGAN:  But very cautiously.</p><p> LONSKI:  Yes.</p><p> REGAN:  I mean, this is the delicate dance, right, that they're always  walking.  I mean, in the meantime, there are some legitimate or growing  concerns I should say, Charles Payne, about inflation.</p><p> PAYNE:  Yes.  There are, there are, although, you know, this week what we  saw inflation in the PPI number, airline travel went through the roof.  You  know no wonder delta had a pretty good earnings report.  But then we got  the CPI report yesterday, it was relatively benign.</p><p> And so, there are signs of inflation that's the kind of classical inflation  signals that you would think that the Fed would be, you know, yellow flags  or red flags.  Although, we know they want to be ahead of the curve.   There's just --</p><p> REGAN:  Improve it (ph).  They need to forget being as -- they're usually  behind anyway.</p><p> PAYNE:  Yes.  Yes.</p><p> LONSKI:  Today we can have report on import price inflation.  Less than one  percent for consumer goods, less than one percent for all imports excluding  petroleum imports.</p><p> REGAN:  All right.  Well, here's the one --</p><p> LONSKI:  That's not a sign of inflation taking off.</p><p> REGAN:  If there's not enough and there's not enough wage growth, you know,  maybe --</p><p> LONSKI:  What's the hurry?  What's -- there's no sense of urgency for rate  hikes, that's it.</p><p> REGAN:  All right.  You and President Trump.</p><p> LONSKI:  But Jerome Powell --</p><p> REGAN:  Its given Jay Powell appear to your mind.</p><p> LONSKI:  -- level at no.  Yes.</p><p> REGAN:  All right.  Good to -- hey, Charles, I'm really excited for you.</p><p> PAYNE:  Thank you.</p><p> REGAN:  This is a great audience, you know --</p><p> PAYNE:  Thank you.</p><p> REGAN:  -- here at 2:00 p.m.  And you're all going to see Charles beginning  Monday, that's this Monday, 2:00 p.m. October 15th, \"Making Money with  Charles Payne,\" moves to 2:00, and well, I'm moving somewhere else.  I'll  tell you all about that next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> REGAN:  All right.  It's my last day on \"The Intelligence Report\".  So this  market better close up, right?  We're up at 128 points.  Let's hope it  holds throughout the hour.</p><p> Big news?  I shared this a little while ago with you.  I'll tell you again  all about it.  I'm going to primetime, 8:00 p.m., starting Monday right  after my good friend Lou, Lou Dobbs is on from 7:00 to 8:00.  I will be on  from 8:00 to 9:00.  Kennedy will follow at 9:00.  We are live at night  right here on Fox Business.</p><p> I'm really excited about it.  I, you know, I do want to point out just what  an incredible three years it has been on this show.  I mean, we created  this show with you, really.  With you.  You tuned in and it's thanks to you  that we're able to cream the competition for the last three years,  something I'm really extremely proud of.</p><p> And it's thanks to you and it's thanks to this news cycle that, you know,  we're expanding.  We're expanding so we will be live, I will be live at  8:00 p.m. every night.  The news keeps happening.  It's a 24/7 news cycle.</p><p> We're on the front lines of history and I'm there with you, reporting on  all of it.  We analyze, we present both sides, you make the decisions about  what is best for you, your family, and your wallet, right?</p><p> I want to thank -- I have an amazing team.  I want to thank everybody on  this team.  So many of you in the control room right now have been with me  from the very beginning, from the first day I was ever in this chair on  this little set that we created, and it's been wonderful.</p><p> I've gotten to know all of you and your families and you've certainly  gotten to know mine, including all three of the kids which love to come by  and hang out at work and in the studio.  So I'm going to miss all of you.   Some of you are coming with me, of course, and I'm so excited for this new  chapter and what we can do and what we can accomplish.</p><p> We have so many tremendous journalists here at Fox Business and we are in a  tremendous news cycle.  So this is the value add that we bring.</p><p> It's going to be a little different at home, so my husband and I had to get  a little creative on this front because we used to have family dinner at  6:00 p.m. every night.  Now it's going to be family breakfast at 6:30, when  I take the kids to school.</p><p> And then it's following the news cycle for you.  I'm looking forward to it.   I'm going to see you Monday night.</p><p> Gosh, I hope this market ends up, Liz Claman, 137 points.  We got to hang  on to this one.</p><p> LIZ CLAMAN, FOX BUSINESS ANCHOR:  Yes.  Yes.  Let's give you a green good- bye.  Trish, another live --</p><p> REGAN:  Thank you.</p><p> CLAMAN:  -- presence in primetime on Fox Business.</p><p> REGAN:  Charles is going to be --</p><p> CLAMAN:  Go.  Go.  Go.</p><p> REGAN:  -- right here at 2:00 p.m.</p><p> CLAMAN:  Yes.  And we will welcome Charles and we wish you the best of  luck, Trish.</p><p> REGAN:  Thank you Liz.</p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC.

I\u2019d like to thank our panel of witnesses for joining us virtually today.</p><p>While the Committee has held several virtual hearings so far, this is the first one I have chaired, so please bear with us.</p><p>The matter before the Committee today is one of pressing importance, the flood of disinformation online - principally distributed by social media companies - and the dangerous and divisive impact it is having on our nation as we endure the COVID-19 epidemic.</p><p>More than 120,000 Americans have already lost their lives to this virus, and nearly 2.4 million Americans have been infected. Tens of millions of people are out of work as we attempt to stop the spread of this virus and prevent an even greater disaster.</p><p>In the midst of this historic crisis, we are also facing a historic opportunity. Tens of millions of Americans are calling for racial justice and systemic changes to end racism and police brutality in the wake of the horrific murders of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and countless other Black Americans at the hands of law enforcement.</p><p>The Black Lives Matter movement has resulted in protests around the globe and online, as people are taking to the streets and to social media to express their support for change.</p><p>But as we march for progress and grapple with this deadly disease, the divisions in our country are growing. While our nation has long been divided, today we see that much of this division is driven by misinformation distributed and amplified by social media companies \u2013 the largest among them being Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter.</p><p>These platforms have become central to the daily lives of many around the globe \u2013 and to the way that people get their news, interact with each other, and engage in political discourse.</p><p>Our nation and the world are facing an unprecedented tsunami of disinformation that threatens to devastate our country and the world. It has been driven by hostile foreign powers seeking to weaken our democracy and divide our people, by those in our country who seek to divide us for their own political gain, and by the social media companies themselves \u2013 who have put profits before people as their platforms have become awash in disinformation and their business models have come to depend on the engaging and enraging nature of these false truths.</p><p>When Congress enacted Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act in 1996, this provision provided online companies with a sword and a shield to address concerns about content moderation and a website\u2019s liability for hosting third party content. And while a number of websites have used 230 for years to remove sexually explicit and overly violent content, they have failed to act to curtail the spread of disinformation. Instead they have built systems to spread it at scale and to monetize the way it confirms our implicit biases.</p><p>Everyone likes to hear and to read things that confirm what they think is true, and these companies have made trillions of dollars by feeding people what they want to hear. As a result, these platforms have peddled lies about COVID 19, Black Lives Matter, voting by mail, and much, much more.</p><p>When companies have done the right thing and stepped up to take down disinformation, they have been attacked by those who have benefited from it. Recently, Twitter labelled a number of tweets by President Trump as inaccurate, abusive, and glorifying violence. In response, President Trump issued an Executive Order threatening all social media companies. The Department of Justice has issued similarly thuggish proposals as well. The intent of these actions is clear: to bully social media companies into inaction.</p><p>Social media companies need to step up to protect our civil rights, our human rights, and human lives \u2013 NOT sit on the sidelines as our nation drowns in a sea of disinformation.</p><p>Make no mistake, the future of our democracy is at stake and the status quo is unacceptable.</p><p>While Section 230 has long provided online companies the flexibility and liability protections they need to innovate and to connect people from around the world, it has become clear that reform is necessary if we want to stem the tide of disinformation rolling over our country.</p><p>Chair Schakowsky: Good morning and thank you for being here today. Thank you to our distinguished panel for joining us today.</p><p>Last fall Chairman Doyle and I held a joint hearing on Section 230, and subsequently my subcommittee held a hearing on unsafe products and fake reviews found online. At both hearings, industry representatives from Big Tech testified, and we heard that content moderation and consumer protection were really hard, and that industry could always do better. They made promises and discouraged Congressional action. I think they may have even apologized, as Big Tech typically does when it appears before this committee.</p><p>Fast forward 6 months, add a global health crisis and nationwide protests against police brutality and racial inequality. As we will hear today, it\u2019s an understatement to say that industry could still be doing better.</p><p>The harms associated with misinformation and disinformation continue to fall disproportionately on communities of color, who already suffer worse outcomes from COVID-19.</p><p>All the while, the President himself is continually spreading dangerous disinformation that Big Tech is all too eager to profit from.</p><p>No matter what the absolutists say, Section 230 is not only about free speech and content moderation. If it were, our conversation today would be different. Instead, Big Tech uses it as a shield to protect itself from liability when it fails to protect consumers or harms public health, and uses it as a sword to intimidate cities and states when they consider legislation, as Airbnb did in 2016 when New York City was considering regulating its online rental market for private homes.</p><p>The truth is, Section 230 protects business models that generate profits off scams, fake news, fake reviews, and unsafe, counterfeit, and stolen products. This was never the intent, and since both courts and industry refuse to change, Congress must act.</p><p>But we must do so responsibly. The President\u2019s recent actions are designed to kneecap platforms that fact check him or engage in what he claims is bias against conservative views. Let me be clear, the President is using his position to chill speech and that is wrong.</p><p>We must encourage content moderation that fosters a safer and healthy online world. And don\u2019t be fooled by made up claims of bias against conservatives. Today, it seems there is a less of a bias against conservatives and rather a bias for conservatives.</p><p>On June 19th, 9 of the 10 top-performing political pages on Facebook were conservative pages, including Donald J. Trump, Donald Trump for President, Ben Shapiro, Breitbart and Sean Hannity.</p><p>And as the New York Times reported over the weekend, Facebook in particular seems to enjoy a cozy relationship with the Trump Administration, aided by Facebook\u2019s own loyal Trump supporters, Joel Kaplan and Peter Theil. I hope Mr. Kaplan and Mr. Theil will soon make themselves available to Congress to answer questions about what role they play in information dissemination, and how they balance this incredible responsibility with their extreme partisan ties and views.</p><p>Regardless, as the testimony today demonstrates, something needs to be done. The American people are dying and suffering as a result of online disinformation. I look forward to working with my colleagues to modernize Section 230 and put platforms on a path that helps all Americans.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IMNWSE-INS3451884</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IMNWSE2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:606T-3501-JDG9-Y0WB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438631</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1350\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Impact Media Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Impact News Service</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"56562\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"06\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>June 24, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

It has been driven by hostile foreign powers seeking to weaken our democracy and divide our people, by those in our country who seek to divide us for their own political gain, and by the social media companies themselves - who have put profits before people as their platforms have become awash in disinformation and their business models have come to depend on the engaging and enraging nature of these false truths.</p><p>When Congress enacted Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act in 1996, this provision provided online companies with a sword and a shield to address concerns about content moderation and a website's liability for hosting third party content. And while a number of websites have used 230 for years to remove sexually explicit and overly violent content, they have failed to act to curtail the spread of disinformation. Instead they have built systems to spread it at scale and to monetize the way it confirms our implicit biases.</p><p>Everyone likes to hear and to read things that confirm what they think is true, and these companies have made trillions of dollars by feeding people what they want to hear. As a result, these platforms have peddled lies about COVID 19, Black Lives Matter, voting by mail, and much, much more.</p><p>When companies have done the right thing and stepped up to take down disinformation, they have been attacked by those who have benefited from it. Recently, Twitter labelled a number of tweets by President Trump as inaccurate, abusive, and glorifying violence. In response, President Trump issued an Executive Order threatening all social media companies. The Department of Justice has issued similarly thuggish proposals as well. The intent of these actions is clear: to bully social media companies into inaction.</p><p>Social media companies need to step up to protect our civil rights, our human rights, and human lives - NOT sit on the sidelines as our nation drowns in a sea of disinformation.</p><p>Make no mistake, the future of our democracy is at stake and the status quo is unacceptable.</p><p>While Section 230 has long provided online companies the flexibility and liability protections they need to innovate and to connect people from around the world, it has become clear that reform is necessary if we want to stem the tide of disinformation rolling over our country.</p><p>Chair Schakowsky: Good morning and thank you for being here today. Thank you to our distinguished panel for joining us today.</p><p>Last fall Chairman Doyle and I held a joint hearing on Section 230, and subsequently my subcommittee held a hearing on unsafe products and fake reviews found online. At both hearings, industry representatives from Big Tech testified, and we heard that content moderation and consumer protection were really hard, and that industry could always do better. They made promises and discouraged Congressional action. I think they may have even apologized, as Big Tech typically does when it appears before this committee.</p><p>Fast forward 6 months, add a global health crisis and nationwide protests against police brutality and racial inequality. As we will hear today, it's an understatement to say that industry could still be doing better.</p><p>The harms associated with misinformation and disinformation continue to fall disproportionately on communities of color, who already suffer worse outcomes from COVID-19.</p><p>All the while, the President himself is continually spreading dangerous disinformation that Big Tech is all too eager to profit from.</p><p>No matter what the absolutists say, Section 230 is not only about free speech and content moderation. If it were, our conversation today would be different. Instead, Big Tech uses it as a shield to protect itself from liability when it fails to protect consumers or harms public health, and uses it as a sword to intimidate cities and states when they consider legislation, as Airbnb did in 2016 when New York City was considering regulating its online rental market for private homes.</p><p>The truth is, Section 230 protects business models that generate profits off scams, fake news, fake reviews, and unsafe, counterfeit, and stolen products. This was never the intent, and since both courts and industry refuse to change, Congress must act.</p><p>But we must do so responsibly. The President's recent actions are designed to kneecap platforms that fact check him or engage in what he claims is bias against conservative views. Let me be clear, the President is using his position to chill speech and that is wrong.</p><p>We must encourage content moderation that fosters a safer and healthy online world. And don't be fooled by made up claims of bias against conservatives. Today, it seems there is a less of a bias against conservatives and rather a bias for conservatives.</p><p>On June 19th, 9 of the 10 top-performing political pages on Facebook were conservative pages, including Donald J. Trump, Donald Trump for President, Ben Shapiro, Breitbart and Sean Hannity.</p><p>And as the New York Times reported over the weekend, Facebook in particular seems to enjoy a cozy relationship with the Trump Administration, aided by Facebook's own loyal Trump supporters, Joel Kaplan and Peter Theil. I hope Mr. Kaplan and Mr. Theil will soon make themselves available to Congress to answer questions about what role they play in information dissemination, and how they balance this incredible responsibility with their extreme partisan ties and views.</p><p>Regardless, as the testimony today demonstrates, something needs to be done. The American people are dying and suffering as a result of online disinformation. I look forward to working with my colleagues to modernize Section 230 and put platforms on a path that helps all Americans.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CODUPB-COH15306242020</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CO2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:606N-JG61-JCCP-047G-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">468349</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1353\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Federal Information and News Dispatch, Inc.</copyright><publicationName>Congressional Documents and Publications</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"06\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>June 24, 2020</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Report</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Country &amp;

I'd like to thank our panel of witnesses for joining us virtually today.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">While the Committee has held several virtual hearings so far, this is the first one I have chaired, so please bear with us.</p><p>The matter before the Committee today is one of pressing importance, the flood of disinformation online - principally distributed by social media companies - and the dangerous and divisive impact it is having on our nation as we endure the COVID-19 epidemic.</p><p>More than 120,000 Americans have already lost their lives to this virus, and nearly 2.4 million Americans have been infected. Tens of millions of people are out of work as we attempt to stop the spread of this virus and prevent an even greater disaster.</p><p>In the midst of this historic crisis, we are also facing a historic opportunity. Tens of millions of Americans are calling for racial justice and systemic changes to end racism and police brutality in the wake of the horrific murders of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and countless other Black Americans at the hands of law enforcement.</p><p>The Black Lives Matter movement has resulted in protests around the globe and online, as people are taking to the streets and to social media to express their support for change.</p><p>But as we march for progress and grapple with this deadly disease, the divisions in our country are growing. While our nation has long been divided, today we see that much of this division is driven by misinformation distributed and amplified by social media companies the largest among them being Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter.</p><p>These platforms have become central to the daily lives of many around the globe and to the way that people get their news, interact with each other, and engage in political discourse.</p><p>Our nation and the world are facing an unprecedented tsunami of disinformation that threatens to devastate our country and the world. It has been driven by hostile foreign powers seeking to weaken our democracy and divide our people, by those in our country who seek to divide us for their own political gain, and by the social media companies themselves who have put profits before people as their platforms have become awash in disinformation and their business models have come to depend on the engaging and enraging nature of these false truths.</p><p>When Congress enacted Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act in 1996, this provision provided online companies with a sword and a shield to address concerns about content moderation and a website's liability for hosting third party content. And while a number of websites have used 230 for years to remove sexually explicit and overly violent content, they have failed to act to curtail the spread of disinformation. Instead they have built systems to spread it at scale and to monetize the way it confirms our implicit biases.</p><p>Everyone likes to hear and to read things that confirm what they think is true, and these companies have made trillions of dollars by feeding people what they want to hear. As a result, these platforms have peddled lies about COVID 19, Black Lives Matter, voting by mail, and much, much more.</p><p>When companies have done the right thing and stepped up to take down disinformation, they have been attacked by those who have benefited from it. Recently, Twitter labelled a number of tweets by President Trump as inaccurate, abusive, and glorifying violence. In response, President Trump issued an Executive Order threatening all social media companies. The Department of Justice has issued similarly thuggish proposals as well. The intent of these actions is clear: to bully social media companies into inaction.</p><p>Social media companies need to step up to protect our civil rights, our human rights, and human lives NOT sit on the sidelines as our nation drowns in a sea of disinformation.</p><p>Make no mistake, the future of our democracy is at stake and the status quo is unacceptable.</p><p>While Section 230 has long provided online companies the flexibility and liability protections they need to innovate and to connect people from around the world, it has become clear that reform is necessary if we want to stem the tide of disinformation rolling over our country.</p><p>Chair Schakowsky: Good morning and thank you for being here today. Thank you to our distinguished panel for joining us today.</p><p>Last fall Chairman Doyle and I held a joint hearing on Section 230, and subsequently my subcommittee held a hearing on unsafe products and fake reviews found online. At both hearings, industry representatives from Big Tech testified, and we heard that content moderation and consumer protection were really hard, and that industry could always do better. They made promises and discouraged Congressional action. I think they may have even apologized, as Big Tech typically does when it appears before this committee.</p><p>Fast forward 6 months, add a global health crisis and nationwide protests against police brutality and racial inequality. As we will hear today, it's an understatement to say that industry could still be doing better.</p><p>The harms associated with misinformation and disinformation continue to fall disproportionately on communities of color, who already suffer worse outcomes from COVID-19.</p><p>All the while, the President himself is continually spreading dangerous disinformation that Big Tech is all too eager to profit from.</p><p>No matter what the absolutists say, Section 230 is not only about free speech and content moderation. If it were, our conversation today would be different. Instead, Big Tech uses it as a shield to protect itself from liability when it fails to protect consumers or harms public health, and uses it as a sword to intimidate cities and states when they consider legislation, as Airbnb did in 2016 when New York City was considering regulating its online rental market for private homes.</p><p>The truth is, Section 230 protects business models that generate profits off scams, fake news, fake reviews, and unsafe, counterfeit, and stolen products. This was never the intent, and since both courts and industry refuse to change, Congress must act.</p><p>But we must do so responsibly. The President's recent actions are designed to kneecap platforms that fact check him or engage in what he claims is bias against conservative views. Let me be clear, the President is using his position to chill speech and that is wrong.</p><p>We must encourage content moderation that fosters a safer and healthy online world. And don't be fooled by made up claims of bias against conservatives. Today, it seems there is a less of a bias against conservatives and rather a bias for conservatives.</p><p>On June 19th, 9 of the 10 top-performing political pages on Facebook were conservative pages, including Donald J. Trump, Donald Trump for President, Ben Shapiro, Breitbart and Sean Hannity.</p><p>And as the New York Times reported over the weekend, Facebook in particular seems to enjoy a cozy relationship with the Trump Administration, aided by Facebook's own loyal Trump supporters, Joel Kaplan and Peter Theil. I hope Mr. Kaplan and Mr. Theil will soon make themselves available to Congress to answer questions about what role they play in information dissemination, and how they balance this incredible responsibility with their extreme partisan ties and views.</p><p>Regardless, as the testimony today demonstrates, something needs to be done. The American people are dying and suffering as a result of online disinformation. I look forward to working with my colleagues to modernize Section 230 and put platforms on a path that helps all Americans.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1123779327</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:606M-Y7G1-DYTH-G197-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1346\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"06\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>June 24, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

I'd like to thank our panel of witnesses for joining us virtually today.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">While the Committee has held several virtual hearings so far, this is the first one I have chaired, so please bear with us.</p><p>The matter before the Committee today is one of pressing importance, the flood of disinformation online - principally distributed by social media companies - and the dangerous and divisive impact it is having on our nation as we endure the COVID-19 epidemic.</p><p>More than 120,000 Americans have already lost their lives to this virus, and nearly 2.4 million Americans have been infected. Tens of millions of people are out of work as we attempt to stop the spread of this virus and prevent an even greater disaster.</p><p>In the midst of this historic crisis, we are also facing a historic opportunity. Tens of millions of Americans are calling for racial justice and systemic changes to end racism and police brutality in the wake of the horrific murders of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and countless other Black Americans at the hands of law enforcement.</p><p>The Black Lives Matter movement has resulted in protests around the globe and online, as people are taking to the streets and to social media to express their support for change.</p><p>But as we march for progress and grapple with this deadly disease, the divisions in our country are growing. While our nation has long been divided, today we see that much of this division is driven by misinformation distributed and amplified by social media companies - the largest among them being Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter.</p><p>These platforms have become central to the daily lives of many around the globe - and to the way that people get their news, interact with each other, and engage in political discourse.</p><p>Our nation and the world are facing an unprecedented tsunami of disinformation that threatens to devastate our country and the world. It has been driven by hostile foreign powers seeking to weaken our democracy and divide our people, by those in our country who seek to divide us for their own political gain, and by the social media companies themselves - who have put profits before people as their platforms have become awash in disinformation and their business models have come to depend on the engaging and enraging nature of these false truths.</p><p>When Congress enacted Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act in 1996, this provision provided online companies with a sword and a shield to address concerns about content moderation and a website's liability for hosting third party content. And while a number of websites have used 230 for years to remove sexually explicit and overly violent content, they have failed to act to curtail the spread of disinformation. Instead they have built systems to spread it at scale and to monetize the way it confirms our implicit biases.</p><p>Everyone likes to hear and to read things that confirm what they think is true, and these companies have made trillions of dollars by feeding people what they want to hear. As a result, these platforms have peddled lies about COVID 19, Black Lives Matter, voting by mail, and much, much more.</p><p>When companies have done the right thing and stepped up to take down disinformation, they have been attacked by those who have benefited from it. Recently, Twitter labelled a number of tweets by President Trump as inaccurate, abusive, and glorifying violence. In response, President Trump issued an Executive Order threatening all social media companies. The Department of Justice has issued similarly thuggish proposals as well. The intent of these actions is clear: to bully social media companies into inaction.</p><p>Social media companies need to step up to protect our civil rights, our human rights, and human lives - NOT sit on the sidelines as our nation drowns in a sea of disinformation.</p><p>Make no mistake, the future of our democracy is at stake and the status quo is unacceptable.</p><p>While Section 230 has long provided online companies the flexibility and liability protections they need to innovate and to connect people from around the world, it has become clear that reform is necessary if we want to stem the tide of disinformation rolling over our country.</p><p>Chair Schakowsky: Good morning and thank you for being here today. Thank you to our distinguished panel for joining us today.</p><p>Last fall Chairman Doyle and I held a joint hearing on Section 230, and subsequently my subcommittee held a hearing on unsafe products and fake reviews found online. At both hearings, industry representatives from Big Tech testified, and we heard that content moderation and consumer protection were really hard, and that industry could always do better. They made promises and discouraged Congressional action. I think they may have even apologized, as Big Tech typically does when it appears before this committee.</p><p>Fast forward 6 months, add a global health crisis and nationwide protests against police brutality and racial inequality. As we will hear today, it's an understatement to say that industry could still be doing better.</p><p>The harms associated with misinformation and disinformation continue to fall disproportionately on communities of color, who already suffer worse outcomes from COVID-19.</p><p>All the while, the President himself is continually spreading dangerous disinformation that Big Tech is all too eager to profit from.</p><p>No matter what the absolutists say, Section 230 is not only about free speech and content moderation. If it were, our conversation today would be different. Instead, Big Tech uses it as a shield to protect itself from liability when it fails to protect consumers or harms public health, and uses it as a sword to intimidate cities and states when they consider legislation, as Airbnb did in 2016 when New York City was considering regulating its online rental market for private homes.</p><p>The truth is, Section 230 protects business models that generate profits off scams, fake news, fake reviews, and unsafe, counterfeit, and stolen products. This was never the intent, and since both courts and industry refuse to change, Congress must act.</p><p>But we must do so responsibly. The President's recent actions are designed to kneecap platforms that fact check him or engage in what he claims is bias against conservative views. Let me be clear, the President is using his position to chill speech and that is wrong.</p><p>We must encourage content moderation that fosters a safer and healthy online world. And don't be fooled by made up claims of bias against conservatives. Today, it seems there is a less of a bias against conservatives and rather a bias for conservatives.</p><p>On June 19th, 9 of the 10 top-performing political pages on Facebook were conservative pages, including Donald J. Trump, Donald Trump for President, Ben Shapiro, Breitbart and Sean Hannity.</p><p>And as the New York Times reported over the weekend, Facebook in particular seems to enjoy a cozy relationship with the Trump Administration, aided by Facebook's own loyal Trump supporters, Joel Kaplan and Peter Theil. I hope Mr. Kaplan and Mr. Theil will soon make themselves available to Congress to answer questions about what role they play in information dissemination, and how they balance this incredible responsibility with their extreme partisan ties and views.</p><p>Regardless, as the testimony today demonstrates, something needs to be done. The American people are dying and suffering as a result of online disinformation. I look forward to working with my colleagues to modernize Section 230 and put platforms on a path that helps all Americans.</p><p>Read this original document at: <url normalizedValue=\"https://energycommerce.house.gov/newsroom/press-releases/doyle-and-schakowsky-opening-remarks-at-hearing-on-disinformation-online\">https://energycommerce.house.gov/newsroom/press-releases/doyle-and-schakowsky-opening-remarks-at-hearing-on-disinformation-online</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CODUPB-COSHP624005T1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CO2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:607W-8G51-DYVR-P18H-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">468349</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1360\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Federal Information and News Dispatch, Inc.</copyright><publicationName>Congressional Documents and Publications</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"06\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>June 24, 2020</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Report</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Country &amp;

But it's happened. And it will almost certainly affect everyone reading this in some way.</p><p>Facebook is spooked. But it believes that the DPC has moved far too quickly. It will present its legal arguments as to why next week. A good guess is that it will say the Irish DPC has boobed by opening an enquiry and making a preliminary decision at the same time, contrary to what a regulated entity might expect.</p><p>Is this just a stalling tactic to delay the inevitable?</p><p>The problem with Facebook's argument is that the DPC is really only doing what the European Court of Justice said it now has to do.</p><p>In July, in the Schrems-Facebook case that saw the transatlantic 'Privacy Shield' data transfer agreement struck down, the court said that the US treats EU citizens' privacy like dirt. Consequently, it said that data regulators now had to start shutting off data transfers that are based on existing legal mechanisms like 'standard contractual clauses'.</p><p>So that's what the Irish DPC is doing. Hence the order to Facebook.</p><p>If the tech giant argues that the Irish regulator should, in fact, wait a bit longer to see whether European colleagues can come up with something of a replacement to standard contractual clauses, should that be heeded?</p><p>It very much depends on who you ask. To trade organisations, this has the potential to be a disruptive nightmare. Remember what we're talking about here: legal uncertainty (or even prohibition) from using cloud hosting services, ecommerce portals and video-conferencing platforms as they're currently set up.</p><p>An extreme case was set out by Facebook's global affairs vice-president (and former UK deputy prime minister) Nick Clegg.</p><p>\"In the worst-case scenario, this could mean that a small tech start-up in Germany would no longer be able to use a US-based cloud provider,\" he said.</p><p>\"A Spanish product development company could no longer be able to run an operation across multiple time zones. A French retailer may find they can no longer maintain a call centre in Morocco.\"</p><p>To be fair, Clegg would say that, wouldn't he? But he isn't alone. There are a lot of trade bodies who are freaked out by the possible implications from all of this.</p><p>On the other hand, consider the position that the Irish DPC is in. What is the overwhelming criticism that her office gets, day in, day out?</p><p>That it moves too slowly. That it pays too much heed to the considerations of the tech giants it's regulating.</p><p>That it holds back from implementing the most serious enforcement remedies.</p><p>Given that it now effectively has a directive from Europe's highest court, and is still fighting rearguard actions against privacy campaigners ceaselessly snapping at its heels to move quicker to stop transatlantic data transfers, isn't it understandable that it has made this preliminary order?</p><p>When this topic gets discussed in detail, my experience is that it makes many people's eyes glaze over. The absence of that middle ground is quite important. It leaves the debate in the hands of profit-driven companies and privacy true believers, who are at polar opposites of the spectrum.</p><p>The problem with the companies is that they can't see much further than their own bottom line. But the challenge with leaving everything up to the privacy advocates is that many of them are willing to blow up trade in defence of privacy, which they regard as a bigger <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.priority.No\">www.priority.No</url> more Facebook or Amazon or Google? Sounds great, many of them say. To be sure, there is an arguable case here. Big tech companies haven't helped themselves on many occasions over the last few years. But it's less clear whether the general public is quite in step with a view that we'd be largely better off without them.</p><p>Regardless of any of that, the actual question here is an even bigger one. There is a fundamental issue that we can no longer dodge: the EU and the US do not agree on what an acceptable level of 'security surveillance' of citizens' data is. Both sides appear happy to sink transatlantic trade to defend their core view on it.</p><p>For instance, does anyone really believe that Donald Trump's administration - or even a Joe Biden one - will suddenly agree that Europe's objections to its security surveillance laws are to be adhered to? If you're one of those who argues that the power of the EU's market to persuade them of this should do the trick, you may be more isolated than you imagine.</p><p>And it's a similar question for the Americans. Do their authorities and politicians really believe that European 'wimps' will get in line on the US's \"proportional\" security response in the form of surveillance laws? Sorry, but that boat seems to have sailed. And there's no longer the UK to act as a proxy on it inside the Union.</p><p>Even if we wanted to tone it down on this side of the Atlantic, we can't.</p><p>\"Supervisory authorities are required to suspend or prohibit a transfer of personal data to a third country where they take the view, in the light of all the circumstances of that transfer, that the standard data protection clauses are not or cannot be complied with in that country and that the protection of the data transferred that is required by EU law cannot be ensured by other means,\" said Europe's highest court in July.</p><p>This is very, very serious. We need to get ready for an unprecedented level of disruption very soon.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Facing down Facebook: Ireland's Data Protection Commissioner Helen Dixon</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SINDIR-163132652</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SINDIR2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60TW-K3T1-DYTY-C18R-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">333993</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"939\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Independent Newspapers Ireland Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Sunday Independent</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"58258\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 13, 2020</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

He proposed a one-off tax on big tech firms such as Google and Facebook. But not to fund hospitals, social care or anything useful.</p><p>Instead, Corbyn wants to back \"news co-operatives\" that will produce \"investigative, public-interest journalism\" and produce a more \"informed public\".</p><p>Corbyn's speech was full of cuddly sounding expressions. But the real message was clear: Never mind all that freedom nonsense - let's nationalise the news.</p><p>So, the Labour leader says he wants to invest taxes in public-interest journalism. Who would want journalism that goes against the public good?</p><p>But the question is: Who decides what the publicinterest might mean?</p><p>Government ministers? High court judges? Simon Cowell and Cheryl? Jeremy Corbyn's press office?</p><p>Look a little closer and it is clear there is no consensus on what qualifies as publicinterest journalism.</p><p>It is just an ethicalsounding excuse for imposing your own interests on what are really matters of personal taste and political preference.</p><p>One thing seems certain: It will not be the British public deciding which sort of publicinterest journalism taxes should finance.</p><p>There are no independent angels floating above the grubby political battles below, st as ir nt ed th with only the publicinterest at heart. Everybody has interests and agendas of their own. Labour's independent media funding body would be another government-backed quango, stacked with placemen from the political and cultural elites.</p><p>Corbyn had the nerve to protest that the media today is \"unaccountable\".</p><p>Yet his independent media board would be less accountable to the public than newspapers, which must respond to their readers who pay their hard-earned money for their newspaper of choice.</p><p>As for taxes funding journalism to create a more informed public - informed by who, peddling which line? It is not hard to imagine the sort of information Corbyn wants the media to feed us, it would be like the old Russian Communist party paper Pravda.</p><p>It is no coincidence that the Labour Party's biggest individual donor last year was the odious, Press-hating Max Mosley.</p><p>The Labour leader singled out something called the Bureau Of Investigative Journalism as an example of an independent outfit that should be given charitable status and tax perks.</p><p>Would that be the same self-righteous bureau that prompted the BBC's flagship Newsnight programme to throw its ethics overboard a few years ago and falsely inform us that a Tory lord was a paedophile? Newsnight never recovered its reputation in the wake of the debacle.</p><p>When Corbynites talk about wanting a more \"diverse\" media, one thing they do not mean is diversity of content and opinion. They want a conformist media that will report what it is told and not ask awkward questions.</p><p>Even the BBC - bastion of the Remainstream media establishment - is too insolent for Labour's tastes. If you want to see the real face of Labour's attitude to journalism, just look at Corbyn's smirking response to a Sky News reporter who asked him some straight questions about the recent wreath-laying controversy.</p><p>His contemptuous reply basically said, \"You have no right to know what I do or think\" - in which case, neither do the mass of viewers.</p><p>Labour's track record gives the lie to any notion that it is interested in a more open media. The non-Corbynite deputy leader, Tom Watson, is an even more embittered Presshater.</p><p>Who does Jeremy Corbyn think he is, to be laying down the law on what a free Press should or should not investigate, and protesting to regulators when they report facts or express opinions not to his liking? Yet Corbyn's quasi-Stalinist vision of Stateapproved journalism seems to go down well with his cultish fan club, who ensured that #ChangeTheMedia was trending on Twitter even before he spoke in Edinburgh.</p><p>Perhaps they should more honestly have made it #ChangeTheMedia-OrElse.</p><p>\"Just because it's on the front page of The Sun or The Mail,\" Corbyn claimed yesterday, \"doesn't automatically make it news.\"</p><p>If he had his way, it would be more a case of: \"Just because it's news, doesn't automatically mean it should be allowed on the front page of The Sun.\"</p><p>Mick Hume is editor at large of <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.spiked-online.com\">www.spiked-online.com</url>.</p><p>Corbynites want no awkward questions</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>RED ALL OVER \u2026 how Corbyn paper may look</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THESUN-140885170</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THESUN2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5T3P-BJ21-DYV0-618X-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">234674</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">1901-11-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"777\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 NEWS GROUP NEWSPAPERS LTD All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Sun (England)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"31984\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"08\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>August 24, 2018 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>National Edition</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>N813940MM</classCode><className>POLITICAL PARTIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001905</classCode><className>JOURNALISM</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DLQX</classCode><className>UK LABOUR PARTY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX000707</classCode><className>FESTIVALS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST0008X0A</classCode><className>NATIONALIZATION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST000DLPE</classCode><className>UK POLITICAL PARTIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>STX000969</classCode><className>INVESTIGATIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>ST000DKY8</classCode><className>BREXIT</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>STX001688</classCode><className>TAXES &amp;

Senator <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/08/us/politics/elizabeth-warren-amazon.html\">Elizabeth Warren has already kicked off that debate</url>, and it would be the tone-deaf candidate who wasn\u2019t alert to the increasing anxiety among the public over the power Silicon Valley giants wield.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.pewinternet.org/2018/06/28/public-attitudes-toward-technology-companies/pi_2018-06-28_tech-companies_0-05/\">According to a 2018 survey by Pew Research Center</url>, 57 percent of Democrats and 44 percent of Republicans feel that big tech companies should be regulated more than they are now.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A candidate who fails to address these issues in a meaningful way is not taking these concerns seriously. But how should we, as citizens, evaluate these proposals?</p><p>Any effort to regulate big tech will have to address two main issues. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/02/opinion/internet-facebook-google-consent.html\">The first is consumer protection.</url>When the private sector controls so much of our data, Americans should be able to know who has access to this data and how they use it. The second issue relates to \u201cplatform companies,\u201d services that connect two or more sides of a transaction: Google Search connects people with websites, Amazon connects buyers with sellers, Apple\u2019s iOS and Google\u2019s Android connect consumers with apps, and so on. The concern is that platforms can build services that compete with third-party services running on their platforms, and can easily give themselves an unfair advantage.</p><p>The more visible concern is consumer protection, particularly protections for privacy. Any regulation addressing consumer protection should, first, specify whether consumers have the right to access data that companies store about them and whether firms are allowed to share confidential data with a third party.</p><p>Just as important, the policy should say whether companies are allowed to make socially consequential decisions, such as mortgage approval or job recruiting, based on that sensitive information. If so, are those companies required to tell consumers what decisions might be based on such data? </p><p>These efforts get even more complicated and less transparent when algorithms are involved. Some of the best-performing algorithms, such as neural networks, are not easily interpretable, even to their programmers. At the same time, modern machine learning algorithms are <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/01/business/ethics-artificial-intelligence.html\">susceptible to the same gender, race, and age biases</url> that affect human decisions. </p><p>While these concerns are particularly notable with big tech, they are just as relevant for retail, health care or financial services firms. Any proposed consumer protection regulation should include formal audits by companies to verify that their algorithms are fair, preserve privacy and are reliable, at least in settings where algorithmic decisions have social consequences, such as hiring, news curation and school admissions.</p><p>Proposals to regulate big tech also have to deal with how platform companies treat the firms that offer products, content or services on their platforms. Anticompetitive practices can stifle innovation and also limit consumers\u2019 ability to easily switch to alternative products or services on the platform. Anticompetitive practices include, among other things, giving preferred placement to a platform\u2019s own products and blocking third-party services from access to certain platform features. </p><p>For example, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.eater.com/2017/9/12/16294380/yelp-google-scraping-feud\">Yelp has repeatedly accused Google</url> of deprioritizing its pages on Google search results. Similarly,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-03-13/apple-faces-spotify-antitrust-complaint-to-eu-over-app-store\">Spotify has complained</url> that Apple forces app developers to use its payment platform for processing in-app purchases; this ability to charge Spotify a commission gives Apple Music a pricing advantage over its rival.</p><p>Senator Warren suggests that platforms should not be allowed to offer services. Under her plan, Amazon Marketplace, for example, would not be permitted to sell AmazonBasics products, which competes with marketplace sellers. </p><p>In theory, banning platforms from offering their own products and services would offer protection against anti-competitive behavior. But in practice, it is difficult for a new platform with few users to lure third-party service and product providers. So platforms often have to build some core services when they launch. </p><p>The original iPhone, for example, lacked an app store and mostly featured apps developed by Apple, including apps for note-taking, weather and messaging. This attracts an early base of users, who demonstrate that people want that service, in turn drawing other companies that might be able to provide a better version of that same service.</p><p>Companies also sometimes launch services and then wake up to their platform potential later. Amazon, for example, set up its marketplace many years after its launch as a bookseller. Moreover, deep integration between platforms and services is sometimes useful to consumers: Payment is built into Apple\u2019s iOS platform in part to increase security and convenience. Might these benefits be worth the competitive disadvantage to third-party payment services such as PayPal?</p><p>This brings us to the regulatory question: Where should regulators draw the line that separates platforms from the services built on the platform? A clever proposal will be one that manages to create a logical way to separate services that are essential for a platform to exist (and which the platform is therefore allowed to operate) from those that platforms either must not operate or, if they do, must be treated in the same way as third-party services.</p><p>Yes, some of this gets technical, but we need an informed citizenry on tech regulation, just as we do for the political debates over health care, jobs or foreign policy. Overzealous actions by elected officials will affect the tech industry, the growth engine of the American economy. It\u2019s time for citizens to engage with these questions because they will shape not only the economy but also how we use the digital services that are so firmly entrenched in our lives.</p><p>Kartik Hosanagar, a professor at The Wharton School of The University of Pennsylvania, is the author of \u201cA Human\u2019s Guide to Machine Intelligence.\u201d</p><p>The Times is committed to publishing <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/31/opinion/letters/letters-to-editor-new-york-times-women.html\">a diversity of letters</url> to the editor.

No other choices.</p><p>That's futurist Amy Webb's prediction of what we will face in the near future. Starting with their smart speakers - Amazon's Echo, Google's Home, and Apple's HomePod - each of the tech giants is working on creating closed systems that will control just about every device in your home and garage.</p><p>\"What this means,\" she writes, \"is that sometime in the next decade, all the start-ups and hardware manufacturers and the rest of the A.I. ecosystem will converge around just a few systems. All of us will have to accept a new order and pledge our allegiance to one of the few companies that now act as the operating systems for everyday life.\"</p><p>She continues: \"Once your data, gadgets, appliances, cars and services are entangled, you'll be locked in to Amazon, Google or Apple. As you buy more stuff - mobile phones, connected refrigerators, smart earbuds - you'll find that not only are your devices not compatible with other systems, you and your family aren't either.\"</p><p>If she is right, and the case she lays out seems to me to be compelling (check it out at amywebb.io) we don't have much time to decide if we want to cede that kind of control over our lives to giant, profit-motivated corporations.</p><p>In a report this month to the British Competition and Markets Authority, Jason Furman, President Obama's chief economic adviser and now a professor at Harvard, wrote: \"The digital sector has created substantial benefits but these have come at the cost of increasing dominance of a few companies, which is limiting competition and consumer choice and innovation. Some say this is inevitable or even desirable. I think the UK can do better.\"</p><p>I think the U.S. can too.</p><p>Furman called for strict new rules on how large technology companies and social media sites operate. He wants new regulations that will stop the alarming number of takeovers of rivals by the five largest tech companies.</p><p>Consumers need more control of their data, he said, suggesting they ought to be able to move personal data from one website to another at the press of a computer key. His primary objective is to give more choices and protection to consumers.</p><p>The Furman panel rejected tech giant claims that competition is thriving online and no competition policy changes are needed.</p><p>But they also rejected the idea of regulating large digital companies like energy utilities, preferring to create more competition with tighter regulations.</p><p>Earlier this month, Democratic Presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren presented some very different ideas.</p><p>\"Today's big tech companies have too much power,\" she said, \"too much power over our economy, our society, and our democracy. They've bulldozed competition, used our private information for profit, and tilted the playing field against everyone else. And in the process, they have hurt small businesses and stifled innovation.\"</p><p>Senator Warren proposed that designated \"platform utilities\" with more than $25 billion in global revenue would be prohibited from owning any of the participants on their own platform.</p><p>In other words, Amazon Marketplace and Amazon Basics would be split apart. So would Google Ads from Google Search.</p><p>She called for a reversal of Facebook's purchase of Instagram and WhatsApp, Amazon's purchase of Whole Foods, and Google's purchase of Nest.</p><p>She explained the net effect of her changes by saying, \"Small businesses would have a fair shot to sell their products on Amazon without the fear of Amazon pushing them out of business. Google couldn't smother competitors by demoting their products on Google Search. Facebook would face real pressure from Instagram and WhatsApp to improve the user experience and protect our privacy. Tech entrepreneurs would have a fighting chance to compete against the tech giants.\"</p><p>I don't know at this point if I agree totally with either Mr. Furman or Senator Warren, but I do believe it is vitally important we have a serious national debate about the issue. I for one don't want to live in the no-choice world predicted by Amy Webb.</p><p>We cannot continue to allow the tech giants unfettered license to control our lives.</p><p>Ted Kaufman is a former U.S. senator from Delaware.</p><p>Ted Kaufman</p><p>Guest columnist</p><p>I don't know at this point if I agree totally with either Mr. Furman or Senator Warren, but I do believe it is vitally important we have a serious national debate about the issue.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Ted Kaufman</p></caption></nitf:media><nitf:media><caption><p>Guest columnist</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWJNL-wil-1841362849</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NEWJNL2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VRH-RHR1-DYJJ-P2PW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">255272</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"767\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The News Journal All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The News Journal (Wilmington, Delaware)</publicationName><edition>1 Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 24, 2019 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The Washington Post was first to report the expected announcement. </p><p>\"We continue to work constructively with regulators, including attorneys general, in answering questions about our business and the dynamic technology sector,\" a spokesperson for Google told CNN Business in a statement on Tuesday.</p><p>While the announcement will focus on Google, other companies could be drawn in by the states --- either as targets of other investigations or to serve as effective witnesses.</p><p>\"With all the investigations going on, there'll be multiple cases against multiple defendants on multiple theories [of harm],\" another source said. </p><p>The looming wave of state-led probes adds to the pressure that tech companies now face from policymakers and regulators, who have highlighted concerns that Silicon Valley may be harming competition. The House Judiciary Committee has launched a \"top-to-bottom\" antitrust probe of Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google. Meanwhile, the Department of Justice is conducting an antitrust review of the nation's biggest tech companies. </p><p>A number of states recently met with Justice Department antitrust chief Makan Delrahim to discuss Big Tech following the Justice Department's announcement of its review. Last month, Delrahim acknowledged at a conference in Aspen that his office is coordinating with the states on their proceeding. </p><p>The states themselves have not been shy about investigating the tech companies. Herbert Slatery III,Tennessee's attorney general, said at a conference in Omaha, Nebraska, in June that \"structural change driven by the government may well be necessary\" to address some of the harms stemming from the tech industry. </p><p>At the same conference, Louisiana Attorney General Jeff Landry criticized Google for its dominance in online advertising, saying that the company has the power to make it inefficient and inconvenient for advertisers to use any other platform.</p><p>\"Google gets to pick winners and losers because the system is rigged in their favor,\" Landry said. \"Continuing down this road will kill online publishing, or Google will control who stays and who goes.\"</p><p>Tennessee, along with Nebraska and Louisiana, have widely been viewed as the leaders of an antitrust effort against the tech industry, at least at the state level. But Texas will be the lead state on Monday's announcement, one of the sources said.</p><p>The looming investigation from the states isn't the only sign that Silicon Valley's antitrust headache is getting worse. On Tuesday, the Senate Judiciary Committee's antitrust panel announced its own tech-focused antitrust hearing, zeroing in on corporate acquisitions by large platforms such as Facebook and Google.</p><p>Senator Mike Lee, a Republican, said in a statement that tech giants can often use those acquisitions to improve competition. But, he added, \"they also run the risk of eliminating the very competition that may challenge the incumbent firm's leading position in the future.\"</p><p>TM &amp; \u00a9 2019 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

The probe into Google is reportedly due to be announced Monday and will be led by Attorney General Ken Paxton of Texas. The Journal said the Facebook probe would be led by Attorney General Letitia James of New York, who has voiced concern before over how tech giants handle personal data. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.[1] Facebook and Google are staring down the barrel of yet more antitrust scrutiny, according to a Friday report from The Wall Street Journal[2]. Sources familiar with the matter told The Journal that two separate groups of attorneys general were preparing to launch antitrust investigations into Facebook and Google.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/states-may-start-investigate-big-tech-companies-like-facebook-google-2019-8?r=US...T?utm_source=partner..._medium=newstex..._term=original..._campaign=partner\">https://www.businessinsider.com/states-may-start-investigate-big-tech-companies-like-facebook-google-2019-8?r=US...T?utm_source=partner..._medium=newstex..._term=original..._campaign=partner</url> Reports last month had already suggested[3] that states could be preparing to launch such investigations.      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/google-antitrust-probe-state-attorneys-general-2019-9?r=US...T?utm_source=partner..._medium=newstex..._term=original..._campaign=partner\">https://www.businessinsider.com/google-antitrust-probe-state-attorneys-general-2019-9?r=US...T?utm_source=partner..._medium=newstex..._term=original..._campaign=partner</url> The Washington Post reported[4] earlier this week that Google was to be the subject of an antitrust investigation by \"more than half\" of the state attorneys general. According to The Journal, the Google investigation is expected to be officially announced Monday and will consist of roughly 36 state attorneys general led by Ken Paxton, a Texas Republican. A second group led by Letitia James, New York's Democratic attorney general, will investigate Facebook.

When contacted by The Journal, Facebook declined to comment. A Google spokeswoman restated the company's position to Business Insider that it would \"continue to work constructively with regulators, including attorneys general.\" Facebook was stung by a $5 billion fine from the Federal Trade Commission in June[6] over its handling of user data in the Cambridge Analytica scandal. The FTC also opened an antitrust investigation[7] into the company over its core social-media business. No formal antitrust investigation into Google has been announced, but reports have been circulating since May[8] that the Department of Justice is readying its own investigation into the company.

defends speed of inquiries</p></bodyText></highlight></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Data Protection Commissioner has said concluding investigations that are underway into large multinational tech firms is the number one priority for her office.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Helen Dixon said the Data Protection Commission takes its responsibility as the lead authority for regulating big tech companies that are based in Ireland but operate across the EU very seriously.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Addressing an Institute of International and European Affairs webinar, Ms Dixon defended the speed with which her office is dealing with probes into the data practices of such platforms, which include Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram and Twitter.</p><p>Referring to questions that have been raised across Europe about the pace of enforcement proceedings being taken against large tech companies by the DPC, Ms Dixon said the standard of decision-making and reasoning the Irish courts expect from her office is well clarified.</p><p>She said it is objectively the case that what would be acceptable to courts in other member states, would not be accepted in Ireland.</p><p>Because Irish law has always provided for the appeal of a DPC decision, her office is uniquely accustomed to litigation.</p><p>She said legal reasoning has to be built from the ground up under the new regulatory framework of the General Data Protection Regulation, because of the lack of existing case law or precedents.</p><p>The DPC has already taken its first draft decision in relation to a big tech platform to the process of co-decision making among other EU data protection authorities and is already well advanced in relation to the lessons to be learned from that.</p><p>She also highlighted the complexities of the data processing processes of some of the platforms the DPC has to investigate, which she added clearly distinguishes these cases from many others.</p><p>The DPC is learning and has learned techniques over the past two years which will allow it speed up in future cases.</p><p>On the question of whether fines change behaviour, Ms Dixon said the DPC will apply fines as it is required by GDPR to do so.</p><p>\"But I don't think we can guarantee based on the evidence before us that behavioural changes in organisations are necessarily going to be achieved,\" she said.</p><p>\"And so I think there needs to be more realism about what enforcement can deliver.\"</p><p>In relation to an expected judgement from the European Court of Justice on Thursday in a case taken by the DPC against Facebook and Austrian privacy campaigner Max Schrems about the safeguards around the transfer of EU citizens data to the US, Ms Dixon said it was keenly awaited.</p><p>She said the DPC anticipates that it will provide a definitive reference point against which the challenges presented by EU to US transfers can be addressed into the future and will bring certainty to bare.</p><p>\"In short there is a huge amount at stake in terms of these legal transfer mechanisms, but lots to look forward to on Thursday in terms of certainty,\" she said.</p><p>Asked whether her office has sufficient resources to regulate tech companies as lead regulator in the EU, she said it depends on how quickly people anticipate outputs will be generated.</p><p>\"We have enough resources and the right resources to conclude, but we can't do it all simultaneously and immediately,\" she said.</p><p>She said if people \"want it all done, and want it all done quicker,\" then her office absolutely needs additional resources to do that.</p><p>\"We can only go at the pace we can go as we balance all the obligatory tasks that we have,\" she added.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

But its more recent foray into medical data was not much of a surprise for those paying attention. AP</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">There now can be no doubt that artificial intelligence does help save lives. AI technologies are increasingly being used for robotic surgery, medical image analysis, analysing large volumes of medical data and even patient diagnosis.</p><p>Of course, the success of any AI system is heavily dependent on the data available to it and AI developers often need access to patient data in order to develop effective medical systems. The more ambitious the goals, the more data is required.</p><p>Then it should come as no surprise that Google, one of the largest developers of artificial intelligence in the world, this week announced that it signed a partnership agreement with Ascension, the second largest healthcare system in the US, under which it gains access to the health records of millions of Americans across 21 states.</p><p>What has proved to be a surprise to the media, American public and other stakeholders is that - according to confidential sources quoted in a report in the Wall Street Journal - the partnership (code-named 'Project Nightingale') began last year in secret and without any level of communication to doctors or patients.</p><p>Although the old English adage 'trust me, I'm a doctor' perhaps doesn't carry the same weight as it once did, patient privacy is something that the medical profession and governments around the world take very seriously. Meanwhile, there are privacy advocates who have concerns about moves to share patient data more widely and the impact on personal privacy.</p><p>In this case, Ascension has confirmed that the project is in compliance with the US 1996 Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and Google noted in a blog post on Monday that patient data \"cannot and will not be combined with any Google consumer data\".</p><p>Frankly, it's unlikely that the Project Nightingale team will be interested in, for instance, Mrs. Smith's 2008 kidney stone operation in particular. What will interest them is the large volume of patient data that can be prepared for AI systems to analyse at scale, thereby identifying trends, similarities in data related to physical conditions and shedding light on medical anomalies.</p><p>For example, everyone wants a cure for cancer and its diagnosis is currently one of the most active areas in AI-assisted research. By preparing volumes of medical image data from CT or MRI scans and creating algorithms to process that data, artificial intelligence systems can often learn to spot the signs of cancer far earlier than human technicians, allowing earlier patient diagnosis and treatment. Broadly speaking, the greater the volume of cancer cases that can be analysed by AI, the better the system works and so more lives can potentially be saved.</p><p>The same principle applies for many different subjects of medical machine learning projects. It's often possible to get some encouraging results from small sets of data, but to ensure reliability and realise the full benefit of using AI technologies for medical analysis, bigger data sets are required.</p><p>In the past, many technology providers have had access to patient records and personal medical data, and in the US this has long been governed by a law that was written to legislate sharing of health records among ecosystem partners. So, why the uproar about Google gaining access to patient healthcare records this week?</p><p>It may simply boil down to a matter of trust.</p><p>Although comparing Google's handling of confidential patient records and its handling of personal social media data would hardly be a fair comparison, last year's data security breach of Google+ compromising the data of over five million users is still fresh in the minds of social media users, policymakers and the cyber security community.</p><p>Meanwhile, there is the investigation into potential 'monopolistic behaviour' launched by 50 US states and territories in September. There is also the antitrust ruling by the European Commission earlier this year requiring Google to pay a fine of \u20ac1.49 billion (Dh5.9bn). Neither help the digital giant engender public perceptions of trust.</p><p>Nevertheless, few would argue that harnessing the power of Google's AI to improve healthcare patient treatment, reduce pain and suffering and, ultimately, save more lives is a bad thing.</p><p>The fact is that, in need of improvement, though some of them maybe, there are existing laws and professional standards that can be applied to the usage of patient data. As Google CEO Sundar Pichai said earlier this year in a NDTV interview \"if AI can shape healthcare, it has to work through the regulations of healthcare\". That's a given. Trust, on the other hand, isn't always a matter of law.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://imgs.syndigate.info/233/818/31/157356770327.jpg\">http://imgs.syndigate.info/233/818/31/157356770327.jpg</url></p><p>Google is increasingly moving into hardware - like its $2.1 billion acquisition of Fitbit. But its more recent foray into medical data was not much of a surprise for those paying attention.

The shock of losing air travel and public transportation has proven one sector of the American workforce to be especially resilient: the road warriors. Though they\u2019re not immune, they\u2019re out in force.     A mass shift to single-occupancy vehicles is occurring nationwide according to new research from Cornell University, which poses a major traffic and pollution problem in many cities. The solution, according to today\u2019s most influential automakers, is to accelerate the development of electric, driverless cars programmed by artificial intelligence.      For real. Our Meet George Jetson! destiny is not only inevitable, it will arrive sooner than we think, now that Volkswagen, the world\u2019s largest motor vehicle manufacturer, and its blue chip competitors have decided it\u2019s a profitable path.    \u201cIt goes without saying that we will see various types of driverless cars on our streets soon. Great advances are being made in the necessary technology,\u201d said Herbert Diess, CEO of Volkswagen Group during an interview with the Federal Minister for Economic Affairs Peter Altmaier. To that end, Volkswagen AG pledged more than a fifth of its vehicles will be electric by 2025, while investing 44 billion euros ($52 billion) on autonomous driving and \u201cmobility services\u201d by 2023.   Enter Big Tech     Companies like Microsoft, Amazon, and Argo AI are already enlisted to help create \u201cnext-level\u201d driverless vehicles requiring up to 1 billion lines of code, as compared to the mere 20 million lines of code needed for today\u2019s existing navigation systems.     \u201cToday\u2019s vehicles are software intensive and already have more lines of code than fighter jets.  In automated vehicles, even more code is required because the system is responsible for the entirety of the dynamic driving task (DDT),\u201d says Edward Straub, DM, Director of the Office of Automation at SAE International , previously known as the Society of Automotive Engineers. DDT is defined as \u201call of the real-time operational and tactical functions required to operate a vehicle in on-road traffic.\u201d    That amounts to more than weekend drivers realize. Truly driverless automation, explains Staub, is a system that must not only maintain the vehicle\u2019s position in a lane among traffic, it must also detect, process, and issue vehicle control commands that account for \u201call of the relevant events in the driving environment.\u201d This includes weather-related conditions, road surface conditions, roadway infrastructure\u2014and anything else that could possibly affect the operational domain.     This isn\u2019t a futuristic fantasy. It\u2019s a high-stakes race already in motion between Volkswagen, Ford, General Motors, Amazon, and Tesla to be the first to offer the biggest and best electric vehicle subscription programs *and own* the large-scale production of autonomous vehicles. The trophy is nothing less than a place at the forefront of a global carbon-reducing revolution.     But the road to get there is wildly uneven, and speed isn\u2019t everything. Beyond developing safe AI-powered software, these companies must nail vehicle development at scale, fleet operations, and geographic reach to truly come out on top. \u201cA lot also depends on what authorities in each location approve. That will look different in China, the United States and Europe,\u201d adds Diess.     In the United States, any automaker will have to get on the track Tesla built. Elon Musk\u2019s electric car maker, with a market value of roughly $267 billion, already offers \u201c Tesla Autopilot ,\u201d a semi-autonomous navigation system enabling traffic-aware cruise control, self-parking, automatic lane changes, and the ability to summon the car from a garage or parking lot. It isn\u2019t Westworld , or even full self-driving (FSD), it\u2019s driver assistance software \u2014 but it\u2019s as close as anyone has come to passing the electric self-driving acid test.    Though driverless dreams still elude Musk and the rest of the world, he continues to not only invest in the space, but is constantly collecting the machine learning data needed to \u201cteach\u201d self-driving to the 550,000 Teslas sold worldwide since the start of 2019, according to Statista . So, we grant him his grandiosity: \u201cIf you buy a car that does not have the hardware necessary for full self-driving, it is like buying a horse,\u201d said Elon Musk during an \u201cAutonomy Day\u201d presentation to shareholders in April, 2019.    It\u2019s taken years for traditional automakers to buy into the fantasy. But they\u2019re now fully and irreversibly in the game, with billions invested. Below are the biggest strategic partnerships and acquisitions putting these companies ahead in today\u2019s autonomous race:    Volkswagen Allocates $52 Billion     June 2020: Volkswagen finalized its $2.6 billion investment in the Pittsburgh-based, self-driving tech startup Argo AI .   June 2020: Volkswagen Financial Services, a division of Volkswagen, purchased corporate travel startup Voya for an undisclosed sum, combining vehicle fleet and AI-supported corporate travel management (think chat-based booking services with informed humans, not bots) to become a \u201cmobility service.\u201d    \u201cIt\u2019s no longer enough to be a fleet manager. You have to offer the complete mobility package. We are able to manage fleet costs and travel costs to optimize total mobility costs for companies. We think that\u2019s the future,\u201d Knut Kr\u00f6sche, managing director for Volkswagen Leasing, tells Forbes.     General Motors Earmarks $20 Billion     July 2020: GM announces partnership with electric-vehicle charging operator EVgo to build America\u2019s largest fast-charging network, by adding \u201c2,700 new chargers over the next five years.\u201d   March 2020: GM announces a $20 billion investment to roll out an electric vehicle for each of its brands starting this year.   \u201cWe will offer EVs from every brand, in every segment and every price point. The path we\u2019re on will get us to an all-electric future profitably,\u201d said CEO Mary Barra in March, during an investor event in Michigan.    Ford Allocates $4 Billion     Ford is slated to launch its commercial self-driving service in Austin, Miami and Washington DC by 2022, according to a Ford Autonomous Vehicles LLC spokesperson.   February 2017: Ford committed to spending $4 billion through 2023 on the development of its self-driving service, including a $1 billion investment into Argo AI, with a current market valuation of $7.5 billion.   \u201cBuilding a safe, scalable and trusted self-driving service, however, is no small task. It\u2019s also not a cheap one,\u201d John Lawler, CEO of Ford Autonomous Vehicles said in a June 2020 blog post .    Amazon Spends Reported $1 Billion     June 2020: Amazon acquires Zoox, an early developer of autonomous vehicles, to develop its own zero-emissions, autonomous ride-hailing service\u2014complete with proprietary autonomy software.  Amazon previously invested in autonomous driving startup Aurora, and has tested self-driving trucks powered by Embark.  \u201cZoox is working to imagine, invent, and design a world-class autonomous ride-hailing experience,\" said Jeff Wilke, Amazon\u2019s CEO, Worldwide Consumer. \"Like Amazon, Zoox is passionate about innovation and about its customers, and we're excited to help the talented Zoox team to bring their vision to reality in the years ahead.\"   THE CASE   The benefits of autonomous ride-sharing are pretty straightforward. Most people don\u2019t really need to own a car anymore. In a world where corporate offices play a part-time role in the modern workplace, and on-demand telecommunication is king\u2014car payments, maintenance, and car insurance start to make less and less sense. Why spend thousands, when monthly or annual subscription models can offer on-demand convenience for a fraction of the cost?    To quote tech doyenne Kara Swisher in the New York Times: \u201cOwning a car will soon be as quaint as owning a horse.\u201d She\u2019s spot on if you just look at how quickly modern humans adapt to digital services, either because it\u2019s cool, convenient, or cost-effective. In a few short years, we all went from shopping in stores to shopping online, from reading actual maps to app maps, from dating actual people to trolling avatars! (Or so I\u2019m told).     There\u2019s also the larger societal benefit. The widespread adoption of autonomous vehicles is expected to produce fewer fatal crashes and lower greenhouse gas emissions. Who cares about our sentimental attachment to Johnny the Jeep Wrangler, if large swathes of the population can find employment in the next wave of tech-driven manufacturing, and commit to a more carbon-free lifestyle?    THE CATCH     We\u2019re nowhere near the finish line. Despite all the hype, full driverless technology hasn\u2019t proven that it performs better than humans. How could it, when it doesn\u2019t exist in the real world yet? Thus far, both technical and regulatory hurdles have stalled the self-driving revolution.     But all that was happening pre-Covid. The crippling of commercial aviation has accelerated the development of autonomous technology to levels never before seen in corporate America. \u201cNon-aviation businesses are more important amid pandemic,\u201d said Larry Kulp, CEO of General Electric this week on Bloomberg Television. (Revenue in GE\u2019s aviation business plunged 44% since the onset of the coronavirus).    Suddenly software is equally as important to the future of the auto industry as hardware. And nothing, it seems, can keep deep-pocketed private sector titans from throwing billions at the prospect. Meanwhile, the rest of us are stuck owning the proverbial horse.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

This articleoriginallyappeared[2]in the Motley Fool. If the autonomous vehicle revolution lives up to the expectations of futurists and forecasters, its effects will be far-reaching. Not only will everyday commuting and transportation be transformed due to the rise of \"mobility as a service[3]\" \u2014 as thedriverless revolution[4]has been called \u2014 but a wide range of industries will also be changed for better or worse as they adapt to a world where people can easily move from one destination to another in computerized pods. Just asthe cloud[5]has led to the transition of computing as a scalable service rather than a concrete product like hardware, analysts see a similar evolution with self-driving cars. </p><p>As autonomous vehicle technology advances, commuters and others (especially in cities) are expected to no longer need their own cars and can rely on a fleet of driverless vehicles to ferry them to and from work, home, or wherever they need to go. Since the biggest cost today of ridesharing services like Uber is the driver, eliminating that will make such rides vastly cheaper, therefore making the comparative expense of owning a car untenable for many. Among the industries that will be most clearly impacted are auto manufacturers and ridesharing services, but also insurance companies will bear a burden since car crashes are expected to decline. Gas stations, airlines, and hotels are all connected to the transportation industry and will be changed as well. Manufacturing costs for cars will increase due to the quantity and cost of the technology necessary in AVs, meaning that potentially car ownership will decline.

Photo: Kim Kulish/Corbis via Getty Images We'll examine how these and other industries will be affected by the proliferation of driverless technology, but first let's take a look at where driverless technology is today,its potential[6]and the challenges it faces, as well as the other key aspects investors should understand. For the sake of our discussion, a driverless car is defined as a vehicle that can operate itself without human input through a network of sensors including cameras, radar, lasers, and other technologies. A brief history of self-driving cars To a degree, autonomous vehicle (AV) technology has existed in a diluted form for a while. Cruise control has been a standard option for decades, and other features like cameras to assist with parallel parking or blind spot detection have become common in new vehicles, making the driving experience more automated. Today, autonomous driving has become a reality on controlled tracks and other such environments. A number of states have begun allowing AV testing on public roads. California, which is home to AV leaders likeAlphabet(NASDAQ:GOOG[7])(NASDAQ:GOOGL[8]),Tesla(NASDAQ:TSLA[9]), and private ridesharing company Uber recently moved to allow AVs on its roads without a driver. Driverless vehicles have also been tested in a number of states and cities including Arizona, where the weather is easy on driving, and Pittsburgh, which Uber chose due to its challenging terrain.However, autonomous vehicles have yet to make a full transition to everyday use in all types of weather and traffic situations where they would have to react to sudden surprises. AVs use a combination of technologies such as computer vision, made up of a network of cameras that can detect objects to the front, back, and to the side of a car,radar, andLiDAR[10]\u2014 a system that works similarly to radar but uses light from a series of lasers to detect nearby objects. The information received by the cameras and LiDAR gets overlaid with mapping technology to direct the car and plan the best route available. AVs can also predict the moves of other cars, enhancing safety. Autonomous vehicles can learn to predict behaviors of other automobiles and pedestrians by usingartificial intelligence[11]andmachine learning[12]. Through repeated observations and modeling, the software behind the autonomous vehicle can develop a data set that allows itto extrapolate the most likely moves of other vehicles on the road based on what it has recorded in the past. As more AVs take to the road, the technology will become even safer since they will be able to communicate with one another, and will not have to worry about the variance of human error. The industry uses afive-level scale[13]to measure autonomous vehicle capabilities.Level Zero \u2014 No Automation:The driver performs all tasks. Level One \u2014 Driver Assistance:Vehicle assists with features like adaptive cruise control, which can slow down the car according to traffic, or lane keep assist, which keeps the car inside highway lanes. However, the driver still must be in control of the car. Level Two \u2014 Partial Automation:At level two, the car can help control speed and steering, helping with spacing in between cars and centering in lanes. Some examples of level two automation includeTeslaautopilot,VolvoPilot Assist, andAudiTraffic Jam Assist. Level Three \u2014 Conditional Automation:Representing the next forefront in AV technology, level three vehicles can operate themselves under ideal conditions such as limited access highways. A driver is still required to be behind the wheel of a level-three vehicle, but they can take their hands off of it. Level Four \u2014 High Automation:At level four, vehicles can drive themselves without human interaction. Waymo,Alphabet's autonomous vehicle division, has developed and is now testing level-four vehicles on both closed-track environments and public roads that can drive themselves in most conditions, and has now logged more than 5 million miles, making it the leader. Uber, meanwhile, has racked up 2 million miles as of December 2017. Level Five \u2014 Full Automation:At level five, a vehicle can drive itself on known and unknown roads and doesn't require any human input. Such vehicles can operate under any road conditions and since they don't need human input, they will be designed without steering wheels and pedals. Below isGeneral Motors'(NYSE:GM[14])Cruise AV, a fully autonomous model without a steering wheel or pedals that the company hopes to deploy next year.Today, autonomous vehicles on the road are somewhere between level two and level three. Since these vehicles rely on connected software to program them, an example of theInternet of Things[15],companies like Tesla can easily upload the latest upgrades for its customers, making it easier for the technology to advance. The automaker says that its vehicles \"regularly receives over-the-air software updates that add new features and functionality,\" a notable difference from traditional cars. Opportunities and challenges It's hard to understate theopportunity of the driverless economy.[16]Intel(NASDAQ:INTC[17])\u2014 which has gained a strong position in autonomous vehicles thanks to itsacquisition of Mobileye[18]\u2014 and research firm Strategy Analytics predicted that in the years 2035-2045, 585,000 liveswould be saved[19]by AV technology, $234 billion in public safety costs would be cut, and 250 million commuter hours annually would be saved. They also predicted that the passenger economy would be worth $7 trillion by 2050. By remaking transportation and the way space is used \u2014 especially in cities \u2014 the effects of autonomous vehicles will be far-reaching, bearing consequences well beyond carmakers and the technology companies that are developing software for AVs. For instance, parking lots could be repurposed as parks, solar farms, retail spaces, apartments, or any of a number of ways that are more environmentally friendly and useful than a paved parking lot. Similarly, on-street parking can also be removed to create more room for traffic flow, bike lanes, sidewalks, or greenery. Still, there are plenty of obstacles to a future where autonomous vehicles are the norm. The response to arecent Uber crash[20]shows one such risk. After a self-driving Uber killed a pedestrian in Tempe, Arizona, there have beencalls to slow down[21]the spread of autonomous vehicles until there was a greater assurance of safety.While experts believe that AVs will be safer than human-driven vehicles, thegeneral public may need more persuasion[22]for now as there will almost certainly be more accidents like this one. Regulatory barriers[23]may also delay the advance of autonomous vehicles.Legal concerns[24]about who would be at fault in an accident abound as regulators are just starting to address the myriad of liability issues that would emanate from self-driving car usage. A group of senators recently asked autonomous vehicle makers to clarify their position on such lawsuits.

Photo: REUTERS/Yves Herman In some states, progress is moving more slowly than expected. GM said in October 2017 that the company expected to test an autonomous ridesharing service on the streets of Manhattan by early 2018. However, more than six months after applying for a permit, the carmaker is still waiting for a final approval from the state.Following the Uber crash, regulators may be more wary of testing such vehicles in an uncontrolled, high-risk environment, and regulations will likely delay the technology's full deployment. Still, the effects of the AV revolution are already beginning to be felt in a multitude of industries. Let's take a look at the sectors that can expect the most impact from the rise of driverless cars. 1. Auto manufacturers No industry will be more impacted by self-driving than the automakers themselves. Already, traditional automakers are jockeying for position. General Motors has made several acquisitions to beef up its autonomous pipeline including Cruise Automation, an AV-tech start-up, and Strobe, a LiDAR manufacturer.Based on GM's plans to deploy a self-driving ridesharing serviceas soon as 2019[25], the Chevy maker seems to be making considerable progress in the AV race. Ford(NYSE:F[26]), meanwhile, recently said it would deploy AVs in a test in Miami,and the company plans to have fully autonomous vehicles in operation by 2021.However, based on thevaluations[27]\u2014 both Ford and General Motors commandprice-to-earnings ratios[28]around 6 \u2014for traditional automakers, investors seem to be taking a dim view of their prospects. Investors are awarding much richer valuations on younger companies like Tesla and Uber. Investors should note that several factors influence P/E ratios and in the case of Ford and GM, they are also low because offears that the auto cycle[29] is reaching its peak. No one knows exactly what effect self-driving cars will have on traditional automakers, and that will depend on the speed and the extent that consumers embrace AVs and how quickly traditional auto manufacturers can develop and incorporate the technology. However, the conventional wisdom is that auto manufacturers could be among the losers for a couple of key reasons:Fewer consumers will need to own cars since ridesharing will be so cheap and convenient. The carmakers could also be fighting for market share with more players as tech companies enter the market.That being said, tech companies such as Alphabet, have said it would focus on the technology itself and leave the car manufacturing to the experts. It has partnered with Chrysler to develop a ridesharing service that could hit streets as early as this year. Uber has partnered with a range of automakers includingVolvo,Toyota, andDaimler. Only Tesla has emerged as a legitimate competitor to the big three, and Apple is rumored to be developing its own electric car, which could evolve to have self-driving capabilities over time. With the proliferation of self-driving cars, fewer American city dwellers are likely to own their own vehicles as it will, in theory, be so easy to hail one from an autonomous ridesharing service. Despite this, the rate with which Americans will give up car ownership may be exaggerated as drivers \u2014 especially those in suburban and rural parts of the country \u2014 are used to the current model of car ownership and for many owning a car may be more of an emotional decision. In fact, the AV market could be an opportunity for automakers as it could expand the market for cars. Self-driving vehicles are likely to take share from other modes of transportation like trains, subways, buses, and even air travel, and it should grow the number of vehicle miles traveled. By alleviating traffic, parking, and the need for actually driving using AVs will become more attractive than other forms of transportation. That should be a boon for car-makers as they can either operate their own self-driving ridesharing fleets or sell vehicles to other operators if individual car ownership declines. Considering their ability to manufacture cars at scale, they will likely have an advantage over competitors like Uber in operating self-driving ridesharing services. 2. Auto insurance Auto insurance is big business. The American auto insurance market is worth $200 billion today based on annual sales, but if AVs are successful in significantly reducing the number of accidents, the need for auto insurance will decline. Currently, about 90 percent of accidents are estimated to be caused at least in part by human error, but with the elimination of a human element in the driving process, the burden for carrying insurance will be shifted to the fleet owner (in the event of ridesharing services) or manufacturer instead of the driver. Since those companies will have more negotiating power, many may be able to get lower rates or self-insure. In 2017, the average insurance cost for a medium sedan was $1,202, another factor that could accelerate adoption of driverless cars.The accounting firm KPMG predicted that the insurance market will shrink 70 percent by 2050, losing $137 billion of its value. Warren Buffett, whoseBerkshire Hathaway(NYSE:BRK-A[30])(NYSE:BRK-B[31])conglomerate owns the auto insurer GEICO as well as other insurance companies,acknowledgedthat self-driving cars would hurt the industry. Buffett toldCNBC, \"If they're safer, there's less in the way of insurance costs, [and] that brings down premiums significantly.\" Insurers likeProgressiveandAllstateare also likely to suffer as the accident rate declines. Since insurance prices are based in part on accident rates \u2014 as the money insurers collect is paid out to cover damages and claims from accidents \u2014 prices will fall as accident rates go down since insurance is a competitive market with a number of companies fighting for drivers' business. 3. Ridesharing/Taxis Ridesharing services like Uber and Lyft have already had a significant impact on urban transportation. The value of taxi medallions in major cities has plummeted as regulated taxis no longer have a monopoly now that consumers can hail rides with an app. Shares ofMedallion Financial, which invests in and owns taxi medallions, have fallen by nearly three-quarters since 2013, and the price of a New York taxi medallion has dropped from about $1 million in 2013 to less than $200,000 last year. With the rise of self-driving cars, the ridesharing industry isabout to be disrupted again[32]. Companies like Uber and Lyft have been aggressively working to develop a viable autonomous vehicle or to partner with carmakers that can do so as there are obvious benefits for the companies. In the current ridesharing business model, the driver (and their car) accounts for an estimated 75percent of the cost of the ride so eliminating the driver would make ridesharing significantly cheaper. That would likely expand the market as many rides could become less expensive than typical public transportation fare. Although Uber and Lyft are the current ridesharing leaders they may not be the winners in the driverless ridesharing market. Those companies' biggest strengths may be the thousands of drivers they employ as it takes time to build up such a base of contractors. However, with AVs ascendants, those drivers may be rendered obsolete. On the other hand, Uber and Lyft are jockeying for positions in the new self-driving car market with partnerships with automakers and by developing their own AV technology. Uber also acquired Otto, an AV tech company that makes retrofitting kits that allow conventional vehicles to become self-driving, signaling a potential opportunity for their contractors to turn their traditional vehicles into self-driving vehicles and use them to go and pick up rides and make money while they don't need them. For competitors wanting to access this market, there are other significant barriers to entry such as mapping technology, an app, and making consumers aware of your service. Brand recognition may be Uber and Lyfts' biggest advantage for now. In one key area, however, traditional automakers may have the edge: Pricing. Car manufacturers like GM can build their own vehicles and can operate their own ridesharing services at lower costs. If GM can provide a cheaper ride than Uber because it doesn't have to split its revenue with drivers/the vehicle owners, then consumers are sure to flock to its service. Either way, the ridesharing industry is about to get more competitive, and facing off against profit machines like GM and Ford with more access to capital won't be easy. However, for now, brand recognition and a contractor base in the tens of thousands are discernible advantages for the ridesharing companies. 4. Gas stations/Convenience stores A world full of self-driving vehicles could eventually mean a world where people no longer have to fill up their gas tanks themselves. Since autonomous vehicles will be able to operate themselves without any passengers, the cars will eventually be able to fill themselves up on breaks like late at night when no one needs them. That, along with the rise ofelectric-powered vehicles[33], which will force gas stations to add chargers, is likely to weigh on gas stations and convenience store chains that rely on customers stopping in to pick a coffee or sandwich when they're putting gas in their car. Because drivers will no longer be pumping gas themselves, gas stations won't be needed at major intersections and fueling and recharging will likely take a place in out of the way locations where real estate is less expensive. Some of the publicly traded gas station/convenience stores that are likely to suffer includeCasey's General Stores, which makes the vast majority of its gross profit from items like grocery and prepared food, but relies on traffic from people refueling. Similarly, truck-stop chains likeTravelPlazawill also face challenges as trucks become automated, meaning drivers no longer need to stop at roadside service centers for a hot meal or a shower. However, some observers believe the spread of AVs could be boon for convenience stores as long-distance trips will become more popular and replace air travel. Even if the nature of filling stations change, passengers will still need to stop to use the bathroom or to get something to eat or drink, so it remains to be seen if business at roadside convenience stores could increase. Warren Buffett finds himself on that side of the bet as he took a 38.1percent stake in Pilot/Flying J, which will turn into a majority stake five years from now. With the move, Buffettis signalingthat he believes the effects of the coming EV and AV revolutions have been exaggerated, saying at the time of the deal, \"We don't buy businesses to change them.\" 5. Hotels/Airlines Finally, the spread of self-driving cars is likely to have a significant impact on the broader travel and tourism industry, specifically airlines and hotels. Since autonomous vehicles should make transportation cheaper, faster, and easier, it will likely encourage more weekend trips to nearby destinations, allowing travelers to effortlessly zip to a city, beach, ski area, or another popular spot that's within a few hours. More travelers and increased tourism should be a boon for hotels and companies like Airbnb that also provide lodging. Even restaurants could benefit from more frequent travel. Years of consolidation in the hotel industry have essentially turned it into an oligopoly led byMarriott,Hilton, andIntercontinental Hotels Group, all of which could benefit from the rise of AVs as they have thousands of hotels in popular locales that should see an increase in demand as traveling gets easier. However, the rise of autonomous vehicles will likely be a negative for roadside motels, which sprung up specifically to accommodate travelers en route to a destination, rather than at the destination itself. Since AVs don't require anyone to drive them, travelers may just choose to sleep through the night in such a vehicle in order to get to their destination faster, rather than stopping at a motel to rest in a bed. Car-makers, for instance, believe that car interiors will have multiple modes, according to the passengers' need at the time, such as sleep mode that would allow the seats to recline, or meeting mode where the seats all face each other. As such needs become more specialized, it's also possible that cars/buses will be designed specifically for overnight trips, much in that way that sleeper cars exist on trains, further obviating the need for roadside motels. Similarly, autonomous vehicles will become convenient substitutes for short-haul trips on airlines. For instance, it would be easy enough to travel overnight in an AV from New York to Chicago, and AV passengers can avoid the hassles of air travel such as getting to and from the airport and getting through security. Airlines likeSouthwest, which only serves the domestic market could suffer as a result, or will be forced to improve their service to compete. A fundamental shift in travel Beyond these five, many other industries will be affected. For example, the need for parking spaces will be gradually relieved, which will also affect the way real estate is used; long-haul trucking will become more efficient which could put pressure on railroads;more cellular data and entertainment services likeNetflixwillbe consumed during car trips; package and food delivery will become more efficient and cheaper, accelerating the growth of restaurant delivery and e-commerce; driving schools will become obsolete; and the demand for auto parts could be transferred to tech companies rather than traditional parts-makers (though some believe increased wear-and-tear vehicle miles could boost traditional parts-makers). Like the internet, the driverless car revolution will remake vast swaths of the global economy in ways not yet foreseen, but for investors, the five spaces above are likely to see the greatest amount of upheaval and because of that, they will present the greatest opportunity.

As autonomous vehicle technology advances, commuters and others (especially in cities) are expected to no longer need their own cars and can rely on a fleet of driverless vehicles to ferry them to and from work, home, or wherever they need to go. Since the biggest cost today of ridesharing services like Uber is the driver, eliminating that will make such rides vastly cheaper, therefore making the comparative expense of owning a car untenable for many.</p><p>Among the industries that will be most clearly impacted are auto manufacturers and ridesharing services, but also insurance companies will bear a burden since car crashes are expected to decline. Gas stations, airlines, and hotels are all connected to the transportation industry and will be changed as well. Manufacturing costs for cars will increase due to the quantity and cost of the technology necessary in AVs, meaning that potentially car ownership will decline.</p><p>We'll examine how these and other industries will be affected by the proliferation of driverless technology, but first let's take a look at where driverless technology is today, (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fool.com/investing/2018/04/13/how-to-make-money-in-self-driving-cars.aspx\">https://www.fool.com/investing/2018/04/13/how-to-make-money-in-self-driving-cars.aspx</url>) its potential  and the challenges it faces, as well as the other key aspects investors should understand.</p><p>For the sake of our discussion, a driverless car is defined as a vehicle that can operate itself without human input through a network of sensors including cameras, radar, lasers, and other technologies.</p><p>A brief history of self-driving cars</p><p>To a degree, autonomous vehicle (AV) technology has existed in a diluted form for a while. Cruise control has been a standard option for decades, and other features like cameras to assist with parallel parking or blind spot detection have become common in new vehicles, making the driving experience more automated.</p><p>Today, autonomous driving has become a reality on controlled tracks and other such environments. A number of states have begun allowing AV testing on public roads. California, which is home to AV leaders like Alphabet ((<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fool.com/quote/nasdaq/alphabet-c-shares/goog\">https://www.fool.com/quote/nasdaq/alphabet-c-shares/goog</url>) NASDAQ:GOOG ) ((      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fool.com/quote/nasdaq/alphabet-a-shares/googl\">https://www.fool.com/quote/nasdaq/alphabet-a-shares/googl</url>) NASDAQ:GOOGL ),Tesla ((      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fool.com/quote/nasdaq/tesla/tsla\">https://www.fool.com/quote/nasdaq/tesla/tsla</url>) NASDAQ:TSLA ), and private ridesharing company Uber recently moved to allow AVs on its roads without a driver.</p><p>Driverless vehicles have also been tested in a number of states and cities including Arizona, where the weather is easy on driving, and Pittsburgh, which Uber chose due to its challenging terrain. However, autonomous vehicles have yet to make a full transition to everyday use in all types of weather and traffic situations where they would have to react to sudden surprises.</p><p>AVs use a combination of technologies such as computer vision, made up of a network of cameras that can detect objects to the front, back, and to the side of a car, radar, and (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fool.com/investing/2017/10/10/3-essential-technologies-for-the-next-10-years.aspx\">https://www.fool.com/investing/2017/10/10/3-essential-technologies-for-the-next-10-years.aspx</url>) LiDAR  - a system that works similarly to radar but uses light from a series of lasers to detect nearby objects.</p><p>The information received by the cameras and LiDAR gets overlaid with mapping technology to direct the car and plan the best route available. AVs can also predict the moves of other cars, enhancing safety. Autonomous vehicles can learn to predict behaviors of other automobiles and pedestrians by using (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fool.com/investing/2018/04/09/artificial-intelligence-is-driving-big-tech.aspx\">https://www.fool.com/investing/2018/04/09/artificial-intelligence-is-driving-big-tech.aspx</url>) artificial intelligence  and (      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fool.com/investing/2018/01/10/machine-learning-101.aspx\">https://www.fool.com/investing/2018/01/10/machine-learning-101.aspx</url>) machine learning . Through repeated observations and modeling, the software behind the autonomous vehicle can develop a data set that allows it to extrapolate the most likely moves of other vehicles on the road based on what it has recorded in the past. As more AVs take to the road, the technology will become even safer since they will be able to communicate with one another, and will not have to worry about the variance of human error.</p><p>The industry uses a (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fool.com/investing/2017/04/11/the-levels-of-self-driving-explained.aspx\">https://www.fool.com/investing/2017/04/11/the-levels-of-self-driving-explained.aspx</url>) five-level scale  to measure autonomous vehicle capabilities.</p><p>Level Zero - No Automation: The driver performs all tasks.</p><p>Level One - Driver Assistance: Vehicle assists with features like adaptive cruise control, which can slow down the car according to traffic, or lane keep assist, which keeps the car inside highway lanes. However, the driver still must be in control of the car.</p><p>Level Two - Partial Automation: At level two, the car can help control speed and steering, helping with spacing in between cars and centering in lanes. Some examples of level two automation include Tesla autopilot, Volvo Pilot Assist, and Audi Traffic Jam Assist.</p><p>Level Three - Conditional Automation: Representing the next forefront in AV technology, level three vehicles can operate themselves under ideal conditions such as limited access highways. A driver is still required to be behind the wheel of a level-three vehicle, but they can take their hands off of it.</p><p>Level Four - High Automation: At level four, vehicles can drive themselves without human interaction. Waymo, Alphabet's autonomous vehicle division, has developed and is now testing level-four vehicles on both closed-track environments and public roads that can drive themselves in most conditions, and has now logged more than 5 million miles, making it the leader. Uber, meanwhile, has racked up 2 million miles as of December 2017.</p><p>Level Five - Full Automation: At level five, a vehicle can drive itself on known and unknown roads and doesn't require any human input.

They also predicted that the passenger economy would be worth $7 trillion by 2050.</p><p>By remaking transportation and the way space is used - especially in cities - the effects of autonomous vehicles will be far-reaching, bearing consequences well beyond carmakers and the technology companies that are developing software for AVs. For instance, parking lots could be repurposed as parks, solar farms, retail spaces, apartments, or any of a number of ways that are more environmentally friendly and useful than a paved parking lot. Similarly, on-street parking can also be removed to create more room for traffic flow, bike lanes, sidewalks, or greenery.</p><p>Still, there are plenty of obstacles to a future where autonomous vehicles are the norm.

A group of senators recently asked autonomous vehicle makers to clarify their position on such lawsuits.</p><p>In some states, progress is moving more slowly than expected. GM said in October 2017 that the company expected to test an autonomous ridesharing service on the streets of Manhattan by early 2018. However, more than six months after applying for a permit, the carmaker is still waiting for a final approval from the state. Following the Uber crash, regulators may be more wary of testing such vehicles in an uncontrolled, high-risk environment, and regulations will likely delay the technology's full deployment.</p><p>Still, the effects of the AV revolution are already beginning to be felt in a multitude of industries. Let's take a look at the sectors that can expect the most impact from the rise of driverless cars.</p><p>1. Auto manufacturers</p><p>No industry will be more impacted by self-driving than the automakers themselves. Already, traditional automakers are jockeying for position. General Motors has made several acquisitions to beef up its autonomous pipeline including Cruise Automation, an AV-tech start-up, and Strobe, a LiDAR manufacturer. Based on GM's plans to deploy a self-driving ridesharing service (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fool.com/investing/2018/01/12/one-photo-that-proves-general-motors-is-a-self-dri.aspx\">https://www.fool.com/investing/2018/01/12/one-photo-that-proves-general-motors-is-a-self-dri.aspx</url>) as soon as 2019 , the Chevy maker seems to be making considerable progress in the AV race.</p><p>Ford ((<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fool.com/quote/nyse/ford/f\">https://www.fool.com/quote/nyse/ford/f</url>) NYSE:F ), meanwhile, recently said it would deploy AVs in a test in Miami, and the company plans to have fully autonomous vehicles in operation by 2021. However, based on the (      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fool.com/investing/2017/02/27/3-stock-valuation-metrics-every-investor-should-kn.aspx\">https://www.fool.com/investing/2017/02/27/3-stock-valuation-metrics-every-investor-should-kn.aspx</url>) valuations  - both Ford and General Motors command (      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fool.com/knowledge-center/how-to-calculate-the-value-of-stock-with-the-price.aspx\">https://www.fool.com/knowledge-center/how-to-calculate-the-value-of-stock-with-the-price.aspx</url>) price-to-earnings ratios  around 6 - for traditional automakers, investors seem to be taking a dim view of their prospects. Investors are awarding much richer valuations on younger companies like Tesla and Uber.</p><p>Investors should note that several factors influence P/E ratios and in the case of Ford and GM, they are also low because of (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fool.com/investing/2017/09/28/automakers-record-highs-are-coming-to-an-end.aspx\">https://www.fool.com/investing/2017/09/28/automakers-record-highs-are-coming-to-an-end.aspx</url>) fears that the auto cycle is reaching its peak.</p><p>No one knows exactly what effect self-driving cars will have on traditional automakers, and that will depend on the speed and the extent that consumers embrace AVs and how quickly traditional auto manufacturers can develop and incorporate the technology.</p><p>However, the conventional wisdom is that auto manufacturers could be among the losers for a couple of key reasons:</p><p>* Fewer consumers will need to own cars since ridesharing will be so cheap and convenient.</p><p>* The carmakers could also be fighting for market share with more players as tech companies enter the market.</p><p>That being said, tech companies such as Alphabet, have said it would focus on the technology itself and leave the car manufacturing to the experts. It has partnered with Chrysler to develop a ridesharing service that could hit streets as early as this year. Uber has partnered with a range of automakers including Volvo, Toyota, and Daimler.</p><p>Only Tesla has emerged as a legitimate competitor to the big three, and Apple is rumored to be developing its own electric car, which could evolve to have self-driving capabilities over time.  With the proliferation of self-driving cars, fewer American city dwellers are likely to own their own vehicles as it will, in theory, be so easy to hail one from an autonomous ridesharing service.</p><p>Despite this, the rate with which Americans will give up car ownership may be exaggerated as drivers - especially those in suburban and rural parts of the country - are used to the current model of car ownership and for many owning a car may be more of an emotional decision.</p><p>In fact, the AV market could be an opportunity for automakers as it could expand the market for cars. Self-driving vehicles are likely to take share from other modes of transportation like trains, subways, buses, and even air travel,  and it should grow the number of vehicle miles traveled.</p><p>By alleviating traffic, parking, and the need for actually driving using AVs will become more attractive than other forms of transportation. That should be a boon for car-makers as they can either operate their own self-driving ridesharing fleets or sell vehicles to other operators if individual car ownership declines. Considering their ability to manufacture cars at scale, they will likely have an advantage over competitors like Uber in operating self-driving ridesharing services.</p><p>2. Auto insurance</p><p>Auto insurance is big business. The American auto insurance market is worth $200 billion today based on annual sales, but if AVs are successful in significantly reducing the number of accidents, the need for auto insurance will decline.</p><p>Currently, about 90 percent of accidents are estimated to be caused at least in part by human error, but with the elimination of a human element in the driving process, the burden for carrying insurance will be shifted to the fleet owner (in the event of ridesharing services) or manufacturer instead of the driver. Since those companies will have more negotiating power, many may be able to get lower rates or self-insure. In 2017, the average insurance cost for a medium sedan was $1,202, another factor that could accelerate adoption of driverless cars. The accounting firm KPMG predicted that the insurance market will shrink 70 percent by 2050, losing $137 billion of its value.</p><p>Warren Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway ((<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fool.com/quote/nyse/berkshire-hathaway-a-shares/brk-a\">https://www.fool.com/quote/nyse/berkshire-hathaway-a-shares/brk-a</url>) NYSE:BRK-A ) ((      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fool.com/quote/nyse/berkshire-hathaway-b-shares/brk-b\">https://www.fool.com/quote/nyse/berkshire-hathaway-b-shares/brk-b</url>) NYSE:BRK-B ) conglomerate owns the auto insurer GEICO as well as other insurance companies, acknowledged that self-driving cars would hurt the industry. Buffett told CNBC, \"If they're safer, there's less in the way of insurance costs, [and] that brings down premiums significantly.\"</p><p>Insurers like Progressive and Allstate are also likely to suffer as the accident rate declines. Since insurance prices are based in part on accident rates - as the money insurers collect is paid out to cover damages and claims from accidents - prices will fall as accident rates go down since insurance is a competitive market with a number of companies fighting for drivers' business.</p><p>3. Ridesharing/Taxis</p><p>Ridesharing services like Uber and Lyft have already had a significant impact on urban transportation. The value of taxi medallions in major cities has plummeted as regulated taxis no longer have a monopoly now that consumers can hail rides with an app.</p><p>Shares of Medallion Financial, which invests in and owns taxi medallions, have fallen by nearly three-quarters since 2013, and the price of a New York taxi medallion has dropped from about $1 million in 2013 to less than $200,000 last year.</p><p>With the rise of self-driving cars, the ridesharing industry is (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fool.com/investing/2018/02/07/waymo-expands-its-fleet-to-launch-ride-hailing-ser.aspx\">https://www.fool.com/investing/2018/02/07/waymo-expands-its-fleet-to-launch-ride-hailing-ser.aspx</url>) about to be disrupted again . Companies like Uber and Lyft have been aggressively working to develop a viable autonomous vehicle or to partner with carmakers that can do so as there are obvious benefits for the companies.</p><p>In the current ridesharing business model, the driver (and their car) accounts for an estimated 75 percent of the cost of the ride so eliminating the driver would make ridesharing significantly cheaper. That would likely expand the market as many rides could become less expensive than typical public transportation fare.</p><p>Although Uber and Lyft are the current ridesharing leaders they may not be the winners in the driverless ridesharing market. Those companies' biggest strengths may be the thousands of drivers they employ as it takes time to build up such a base of contractors. However, with AVs ascendants, those drivers may be rendered obsolete.</p><p>On the other hand, Uber and Lyft are jockeying for positions in the new self-driving car market with partnerships with automakers and by developing their own AV technology. Uber also acquired Otto, an AV tech company that makes retrofitting kits that allow conventional vehicles to become self-driving, signaling a potential opportunity for their contractors to turn their traditional vehicles into self-driving vehicles and use them to go and pick up rides and make money while they don't need them.</p><p>For competitors wanting to access this market, there are other significant barriers to entry such as mapping technology, an app, and making consumers aware of your service. Brand recognition may be Uber and Lyfts' biggest advantage for now.</p><p>In one key area, however, traditional automakers may have the edge: Pricing. Car manufacturers like GM can build their own vehicles and can operate their own ridesharing services at lower costs. If GM can provide a cheaper ride than Uber because it doesn't have to split its revenue with drivers/the vehicle owners, then consumers are sure to flock to its service.</p><p>Either way, the ridesharing industry is about to get more competitive, and facing off against profit machines like GM and Ford with more access to capital won't be easy. However, for now, brand recognition and a contractor base in the tens of thousands are discernible advantages for the ridesharing companies.</p><p>4. Gas stations/Convenience stores</p><p> A world full of self-driving vehicles could eventually mean a world where people no longer have to fill up their gas tanks themselves. Since autonomous vehicles will be able to operate themselves without any passengers, the cars will eventually be able to fill themselves up on breaks like late at night when no one needs them. That, along with the rise of (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fool.com/investing/2018/01/11/the-3-best-electric-vehicle-stories-of-2017.aspx\">https://www.fool.com/investing/2018/01/11/the-3-best-electric-vehicle-stories-of-2017.aspx</url>) electric-powered vehicles , which will force gas stations to add chargers, is likely to weigh on gas stations and convenience store chains that rely on customers stopping in to pick a coffee or sandwich when they're putting gas in their car.</p><p>Because drivers will no longer be pumping gas themselves, gas stations won't be needed at major intersections and fueling and recharging will likely take a place in out of the way locations where real estate is less expensive.</p><p>Some of the publicly traded gas station/convenience stores that are likely to suffer include Casey's General Stores, which makes the vast majority of its gross profit from items like grocery and prepared food, but relies on traffic from people refueling. Similarly, truck-stop chains like TravelPlaza will also face challenges as trucks become automated, meaning drivers no longer need to stop at roadside service centers for a hot meal or a shower.</p><p>However, some observers believe the spread of AVs could be boon for convenience stores as long-distance trips will become more popular and replace air travel. Even if the nature of filling stations change, passengers will still need to stop to use the bathroom or to get something to eat or drink, so it remains to be seen if business at roadside convenience stores could increase.</p><p>Warren Buffett finds himself on that side of the bet as he took a 38.1 percent stake in Pilot/Flying J, which will turn into a majority stake five years from now. With the move, Buffett is signaling that he believes the effects of the coming EV and AV revolutions have been exaggerated, saying at the time of the deal, \"We don't buy businesses to change them.\"</p><p>5. Hotels/Airlines</p><p>Finally, the spread of self-driving cars is likely to have a significant impact on the broader travel and tourism industry, specifically airlines and hotels.</p><p>Since autonomous vehicles should make transportation cheaper, faster, and easier, it will likely encourage more weekend trips to nearby destinations, allowing travelers to effortlessly zip to a city, beach, ski area, or another popular spot that's within a few hours. More travelers and increased tourism should be a boon for hotels and companies like Airbnb that also provide lodging. Even restaurants could benefit from more frequent travel.</p><p>Years of consolidation in the hotel industry have essentially turned it into an oligopoly led by Marriott, Hilton, and Intercontinental Hotels Group, all of which could benefit from the rise of AVs as they have thousands of hotels in popular locales that should see an increase in demand as traveling gets easier.</p><p>However, the rise of autonomous vehicles will likely be a negative for roadside motels, which sprung up specifically to accommodate travelers en route to a destination, rather than at the destination itself. Since AVs don't require anyone to drive them, travelers may just choose to sleep through the night in such a vehicle in order to get to their destination faster, rather than stopping at a motel to rest in a bed. Car-makers, for instance, believe that car interiors will have multiple modes, according to the passengers' need at the time, such as sleep mode that would allow the seats to recline, or meeting mode where the seats all face each other. As such needs become more specialized, it's also possible that cars/buses will be designed specifically for overnight trips, much in that way that sleeper cars exist on trains, further obviating the need for roadside motels.</p><p>Similarly, autonomous vehicles will become convenient substitutes for short-haul trips on airlines. For instance, it would be easy enough to travel overnight in an AV from New York to Chicago, and AV passengers can avoid the hassles of air travel such as getting to and from the airport and getting through security. Airlines like Southwest, which only serves the domestic market could suffer as a result, or will be forced to improve their service to compete.</p><p>A fundamental shift in travel</p><p>Beyond these five, many other industries will be affected. For example, the need for parking spaces will be gradually relieved, which will also affect the way real estate is used; long-haul trucking will become more efficient which could put pressure on railroads; more cellular data and entertainment services like Netflix will be consumed during car trips; package and food delivery will become more efficient and cheaper, accelerating the growth of restaurant delivery and e-commerce; driving schools will become obsolete; and the demand for auto parts could be transferred to tech companies rather than traditional parts-makers (though some believe increased wear-and-tear vehicle miles could boost traditional parts-makers).</p><p>Like the internet, the driverless car revolution will remake vast swaths of the global economy in ways not yet foreseen, but for investors, the five spaces above are likely to see the greatest amount of upheaval and because of that, they will present the greatest opportunity.</p><p>Suzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

But for years, John Deere has been selling tractors that practically drive themselves for use on farms in America's heartland, where there are few pesky pedestrians or federal rules to get in the way.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">For a glimpse at the future, meet Jason Poole, a 34-year-old crop consultant from Kansas. After a long day of meetings this month and driving five hours across the state to watch his little girl's softball game, he was still able to run his John Deere tractor until 2 a.m., thanks to technology that left most of the driving to a computer.</p><p>The land is hilly on Poole's family farm, so he drives the first curved row manually and handles the turns himself to teach the layout to his tractor's guidance system. But after that, he takes his hands off the steering wheel and allows the tractor to finish.</p><p>\"We kind of laugh when we see news stories about self-driving cars, because we've had that for years,\" Poole said.</p><p>The advancements being rolled out on the farm could soon show up next door: Your neighbor can already replace his lawn mower with the John Deere equivalent of a Roomba robotic vacuum for his yard.</p><p>The self-driving technology being sold by John Deere and some of its competitors is less technically complex than the fully driverless cars that big tech companies and car manufacturers are working on.</p><p>For now, the tractors are still supposed to have a driver behind the wheel - even if they never touch it.</p><p>They've already started to transform farming in America and abroad: John Deere is selling auto-steering and other self- guidance tech in more than 100 countries, said Cory Reed, vice president of the company's Intelligent Solutions Group.</p><p>The systems come with their own risks, including concerns that they could be hacked. But because farm-equipment makers operate almost exclusively on private land, they've been able to bring products to market much more quickly than consumer automakers - and without the same level of regulatory scrutiny.</p><p>There are no federal rules specifically addressing self-driving tech for tractors, largely because farm equipment is designed for use in fields where it doesn't pose the same level of risk to other vehicles or people as a self-driving vehicle on a public road. The closest thing to national regulations are safety standards set by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, but the agency does not have any rules directly aimed at self-driving technology.</p><p>That lack of regulations is one reason that the future reached the farm first. But another is pure necessity: There's a labor crunch in rural America - young people move to the cities, leaving the average age of U.S. farmers at 58, according to the Agriculture Department. Similar forces are pushing self-driving tech into other industrial sectors at a pace that outstrips the consumer market. Earlier this year, the first self-driving semi-truck licensed to drive on public roads in the United States made its debut in Nevada with a splashy press show. Self-driving trucks are being rolled out for mining and oil operations in remote parts of the world.</p><p>The success of self-driving technology in agriculture could serve as a guidepost for carmakers who are trying to figure out how to move similar technologies onto U.S. streets.</p><p>Tractor makers started exploring the possibility of putting software in the driver's seat decades ago. At first, they used satellite technology to help farmers plot courses they could drive manually. About 15 years ago, John Deere started using similar systems to guide the tractors automatically, Reed said.</p><p>Crops are generally planted in one long row after another - and farmers want to make sure they use up all their land. Before auto- steering, that often meant a few feet would get reworked in every row. But with modern technology, that overlap can be reduced to less than an inch so it takes fewer passes to cover each field - saving farmers time and money.</p><p>John Deere's main competitor, Case IH, markets similar systems, as do lesser-known companies. Some are going even further than modifying existing tractor designs: The aptly named Autonomous Tractor Corp. designed a fully autonomous tractor prototype that looks like a golden, boxy tank, but without a seat for a driver.</p><p>The systems are pricey: Outfitting a new tractor with top-of- the-line auto-steering, navigation and guidance tech could cost upward of $20,000, Reed said. There are also activation and subscription fees if farmers want to use the company's satellite or radio signals.</p><p>There are risks to reliance on software. Poole said one neighbor using self-driving technology downloaded a software update that disabled his tractor for a week in the middle of planting season this spring. If a system is working, farmers will often hold off on updates rather than risk complications, he said.</p><p>Those gaps could raise added cybersecurity risks. John Deere takes this issue seriously, Reed said, and encrypts its systems to protect them from hackers.</p><p>Still, issues such as digital security fears, along with more traditional physical safety concerns, make it hard for consumer automakers to get their self-driving vehicles past various regulators and on to public roads. But tractor makers have shown that much of the technology needed to fulfill the promise of autonomous vehicles is here.</p><p>\"All of the things we're doing on the farm will find their way into the consumer market in the coming years,\" Reed said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Caption: Washington Post: This John Deere tractor in Illinois has an operator at the wheel, but it's being driven by satellite guidance to a level of precision unmatched by humans.</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FTWJGT-15062319898197</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FTWJGT2015</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5G95-T341-JCVR-R4N1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">322673</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2016-10-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"925\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2015 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2015 The Journal-Gazette</copyright><publicationName>Fort Wayne Journal Gazette</publicationName><aggregationName>ProQuest SuperText</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"06\" year=\"2015\"><dateText>June 23, 2015 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC000292K</classCode><className>DEERE &amp;

Or so we're told. But they still face an existential question: When is a self-driving car truly ready to drive on its own?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">That will ultimately be judged by regulators such as the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. But to prep for that ruling, automakers and tech companies are putting cars on roads and, perhaps more importantly, in simulated environments to fine-tune reactions to events seldom found in the real world.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A 16-year-old human can be tested on streets and highways near their hometown, and then be entrusted to drive nationwide. But a robotaxi's abilities don't generalize the same, requiring a more exhaustive test of scenarios specific to a city and even an intersection.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Most Americans already aren't comfortable with the idea of riding in a self-driving car. For the self-driving industry to earn the trust of the public and regulators, they'll need to ace the test. An industry projected to be worth $7 trillion is on the line. The tech and auto industries are counting on simulated tests done on computers to prove the cars are safe enough to entrust with our lives and those of our loved ones.</p><p>CNN Business spoke with simulation experts at 10 companies including automakers, big tech companies and startups that are entirely focused on simulation. They're spending millions to answer a big question: What should be on the test? </p><p>No simulation, no self-driving cars</p><p>Cruise, GM's self-driving team, runs 200,000 hours of simulated tests every day. Waymo, the self-driving arm of Google's parent company, has simulated more than 10 billion miles of driving.</p><p>Self-driving companies are embracing simulation testing because it's affordable, time-efficient and safe. The risk of on-road tests surfaced last year when an Uber test vehicle killed a pedestrian. Simulations allow companies to test situations that you wouldn't want to put a self-driving car in -- like a child running into its path from behind a parked car -- but nevertheless need to.</p><p>Zoox had a problem it wanted to solve. The Silicon Valley startup wanted its self-driving cars to better handle yellow left-turn signals, a rarity during on-road testing. So a team of artists made artificial examples of yellow left-turn signals, and loaded them into its simulated environments. Soon Zoox's software was better at recognizing left-turn signals in the real world, according to co-founder Jesse Levinson.</p><p>Lyft noticed earlier this year that its cars were slamming on the brakes when they were cut off by other cars. Engineers recreated the scenario of being cut-off in simulation. According to Luc Vincent, who leads autonomous driving efforts at Lyft, they were able to more quickly and cheaply tweak the software to soften the harsh braking.</p><p>Aurora, a self-driving startup that Amazon, Hyundai and Kia have invested in, does the bulk of its testing in simulation. When its cars drive on actual roads, they're generally being manually driven, so Aurora can later compare how its self-driving software varies from human drivers.</p><p>\"We tell our drivers, look we just want you to drive like an expert human,\" Aurora co-founder Sterling Anderson told CNN Business. </p><p>Simulation 101</p><p>The engineers who write new software for self-driving vehicles can run simulated tests from their desks to see if their software improves a car's driving, at least in the simulated environment. Some companies run regularly simulated tests every hour, and overnight. Improving how the car handles one task --- like right turns on red --- risks disrupting something else. </p><p>\"It's a bit like a whack-a-mole. You solve one problem, another might emerge,\" said Applied Intuition CEO Qasar Younis, whose Sunnyvale, California-based startup has raised more than $50 million to build simulation tools for self-driving cars. </p><p>A single intersection can have tens of thousands of scenarios, according to Younis. Factors include the weather, the car's tire pressure, potholes, how many people are in the car, what pedestrians are doing and how assertive the car is.</p><p>The world is complex and random, and vehicles need to be able to handle rare situations, like seeing a traffic light that's swinging in the wind at sundown.</p><p>\"The list is almost infinite,\" said Lyft's Vincent.</p><p>Applied Intuition and Aurora have used federal government crash reports to help them understand situations to test. Aptiv, the auto supply company, puts its vehicles through 40,000 scenarios. Most companies declined to say how many scenarios they're testing, but acknowledged they're adding new circumstances as they learn.</p><p>\"You never get to perfect,\" said Mike Wagner, CEO of Edge Case Research, a Pennsylvania company devoted to making automated systems safe. \"The goal is to be ethical as you're going from where we are today to where we want to be.\" </p><p>Simulation's shortcomings</p><p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk, whose company uses simulation, has been critical of the tool, saying it's comparable to grading one's own homework.</p><p>\"You don't know what you don't know,\" Musk cautioned at Tesla's autonomy day earlier this year. \"The world is very weird and has millions of [unusual] cases.\" </p><p>Bryan Reimer, research scientist in the MIT AgeLab and the associate director of the New England University Transportation Center at MIT, has called for public-private partnerships in self-driving vehicles, to make sure the private sector makes the right decisions on questions like what scenarios to test.</p><p>\"It's really, really difficult to make the test for [a self-driving vehicle] right now,\" Reimer said. \"Only the private sector will actually develop the data needed to know some of these answers. And we cannot allow this to end up in another Boeing-like situation,\" referring to two crashes of the 737 Max, which arose from faulty autopilot software that was lightly regulated.</p><p>The self-driving industry is so young that best practices haven't been established for simulation. Many companies have made hires from fields with a history of simulation, such as aeronautics.</p><p>Many people cautioned that not all simulators for self-driving cars are created equal.</p><p>A simulator might look like a high-definition video game, but that's not necessarily enough. It needs to have accurate physics and results that won't vary depending on when the test is run. One unsolved challenge is making sure the simulated humans --- drivers, pedestrians and cyclists --- act realistically. </p><p>Waymo uses data from the millions of miles it has driven on roads to train an artificial intelligence system to imitate actual drivers and pedestrians. It tests factors like how often the simulated human drivers and pedestrian crash into each, to help determine if they're realistic or not. </p><p>\"It's a budding field,\" said Drago Anguelov, Waymo's principal scientist. \"If you look at a lot of the simulated worlds it creates a lot of not-so-realistic worlds which ultimately don't test the thing you should be testing.\" </p><p>Uber, for example, recently was testing how its cars handled a scenario in which a pedestrian stands behind a parked car along a road. The simulated cars weren't slowing for the pedestrian as much as its real-world cars. An Uber team devoted to confirming simulation's accuracy found that the simulator was telling the simulated car the color of the traffic lights ahead. With green lights coming up, the car was more confident driving faster.</p><p>So Uber tweaked its simulator to make sure the cars wouldn't know the color of traffic lights ahead, unless they were so close they'd be seen in the real world. Then the simulated and real-world cars started behaving identically. </p><p>One challenge was solved, but more are sure to arise.</p><p>\"This is a generational type technological challenge,\" said Hugh Reynolds, who leads simulation at Uber.</p><p>TM &amp; \u00a9 2019 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

On the one hand, some became trillion dollar companies and their owners are now the richest people in history. On the other, the Cambridge Analytica scandal has stoked fears over user privacy, the impact on our democracy, and the platform's record on spotting and reacting to false or misleading information.</p><p>It is simply unremarkable that digital platforms have become a home for fake news and a medium through which to more effectively target and manipulate voters. This is because data accumulation and analysis to build tools of manipulation for profit is foundational to the business model of large digital platforms, something which anyone in or near the industry knows.</p><p>The code of conduct presented by tech firms to the EU is their latest attempt to manage a perception problem they fear is graduating from political backlash to policy response. In the UK, this summer saw Sajid Javid warn of tech firms' record on child safety and Jeremy Corbyn highlight the oversized role of platforms in our consumption of news.</p><p>A code of conduct gives the appearance of change while allowing the platform business model to remain untouched.</p><p>Ultimately, it is as ineffective as previous attempts to rein in the power of the tech giants, including fining Facebook a few minutes' revenue after the Cambridge Analytica scandal.</p><p>The wealth, power and reach of the tech giants into so many areas of our social and economic lives shows that a more radical approach is needed.</p><p>Structural reform to address the platform business model is needed, including rethinking the ownership and governance of data and the underlying, increasingly ubiquitous digital infrastructure of our economy and society.</p><p>Whereas today the digital economy is dominated large monopolies, we need to move towards a \"digital commonwealth\" where data is a collective resource that drives equitable innovation, and digital infrastructure is a public good.Charlie Parker, researcher in digital democracy for The Winston Churchill Memorial Trust, says it's a bad idea:</p><p>In an era of online misinformation and data scandals, the words \"big tech\" and \"trustworthiness\" are rarely used synonymously.</p><p>So it seems strange that EU bosses are so eager to trust social media and search engine giants with more responsibility over our digital democracy - threatening them with regulation if they fail to properly curate the content we see online every day.</p><p>Ahead of the European Union elections in June 2019, the EU has given Facebook, Google and Twitter a practically unachievable three-month deadline to fix the fake news problem.</p><p>Responding to the threat of restrictive new laws, the tech companies joined forces to propose a new code of conduct that will supposedly help people make informed decisions based on their online experiences.</p><p>Their plan: pump money into new technologies that develop \"indicators of trustworthiness\", make diverse views more visible and prioritise \"authentic information\".</p><p>But in doing this, they are likely to cause more harm than good with proposals that merely satisfy a knee jerk demand for change from politicians.</p><p>The effectiveness of the code of conduct will be assessed by EU officials at the end of the year, putting enormous pressure on tech firms to solve the fake new \"crisis\" fast.</p><p>Many initiatives that have already tried to tackle the spread of misinformation have so far been unsuccessful. Adding time pressure makes the already complex task much more difficult.</p><p>For example, algorithms designed to expose users to alternative opinions and break echo chambers can often have a \"backfire effect\" and actually reinforce an individual's world view - rather than change their mind.</p><p>It turns out that constantly clogging up a news feed with views that berate a user's core beliefs - selected by Silicon Valley - does little to enrich the battle of ideas. Nor is it going save Europe's democracy.</p><p>The EU drive to combat fake news might seem like a crackdown on unruly tech companies, but it could actually give them more muscle.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PHOTO: </emphasis></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://e3.365dm.com/18/09/640x380/skynews-social-media-apps_4412714.jpg?20180906020717\">Link to Image</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SKYNWS-11511880</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SKYNWS2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TCC-DM91-JBH1-C3JC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409844</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-09-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"722\"/><timeReceived>06:40 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 BSkyB All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Sky News</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"13207\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"09\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>September 29, 2018 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

And as the conversion to electric engines continues, local government policymakers and administrators will need to provide oversight on a considerable investment in charging stations and other wayside infrastructureall tied to the electrical grid and coordinated through government and regulatory agencies.</p><p>Will these changes to infrastructure be publicly or privately funded, and if through government revenues, where will the money come from? More importantly, how can local government agencies justify funding new infrastructure for a transformational technology that may compete with public transit and significantly reduce municipal revenues?</p><p>The Race Is On</p><p>The most obvious indication of something big brewing is the near-universal enthusiasm for electrification and self-driving technologies coming from the automobile manufacturers themselves.</p><p>There is Tesla, of course, but Ford says it will have a fully autonomous vehicle in commercial operation by 2021. GM's self-driving research and production armCruise Automationhas unveiled its latest version of a battery-powered Chevy Bolt, which has no manual controls and will be on the street without a driver next year.</p><p>All the world's major vehicle manufacturersHonda, Hyundai, Daimler, Renault-Nissan, Volkswagen, and Volvoare vying to gain the edge in self-driving technologies.</p><p>At the same time, it has become clear that the last century's gas-fueled combustion engine's days are numbered. In many countries, diesel engines are already being banned. By 2030, only electric and hybrid vehicles will be available for purchase in most Scandinavian and EU nations, India, and Korea.</p><p>Copenhagen already has an electric fleet of 400 (BMW) cars. China is now the world's biggest producer and market for electrified vehicles, producing 680,000 all-electric cars, buses, and trucks in 2017.</p><p>And although the United States has no federal policy mandating electrification, many states are already setting targets for electric car sales. General Motors has said that it will introduce at least 20 new electric vehicles by 2023.</p><p>Local governments are rightly concerned about the infrastructure implications of nearly every future vehicle needing access to recharging facilities.</p><p>Ride Hailing Is Here, Too</p><p>Bolstering this shift toward electrification and self-driving, of course, is the ride-hailing movement, which takes advantage of the growing expectation of on-demand transportation, and the increasing willingness of both the old and young to forgo vehicle ownership in favor of shared transportation services.</p><p>Uber has just agreed to buy 24,000 self-driving cars from Volvo in the next three years. Waymo (owned by Google's parent corporation, Alphabet) has agreed to buy thousands of minivans from FiatChrysler. And as an example of the cross-functional scramble for leadership in this area, even the car manufactures themselves are getting into the fray.</p><p>General Motors is rolling out plans for a fully autonomous ride-sharing service by 2019. Nissan is preparing to launch its own Easy Ride \"robot\" taxi service in Japan. Ford is planning a fully autonomous ride-hailing service by 2021.</p><p>And that's not to mention the logistics groupsAmazon, FedEx, UPS, and even the U.S. Post Officethat will soon flood the streets with (mostly electric) AV shuttles for curbside pickup and deliveries.</p><p>These companies know that as the \"sharing\" aspect of the AV economy kicks in, fleet ownership will quickly outpace private AV sales. That means that ride-hailing companies will soon dominate the autonomous vehicle market; and they will choose electric cars as they become increasingly cost effective and reliable.</p><p>This enormous investment in research and funding by private industry has led to early collaboration with cities, with pilots moving quickly out of the controlled testing campuses and onto real city streets where local governments have been eager to offer up their infrastructure as proving grounds: Austin, Boston, Phoenix/Chandler, Detroit, Las Vegas, Pittsburgh, Reno, San Antonio, San Francisco, San Jose, and Washington, D.C., are all actively piloting AV programs.</p><p>As the potential benefits of self-driving, electrification, and ride-hailing are becoming more obvious, and the potential threat to public transportation systems looms large, local administrators themselves are beginning to buy into electric AVs to augment their own public transit systems.</p><p>This can be in the form of the driverless bus fleets that are proliferating in the Bay Area, or a municipally owned fleet like that in Columbus, Ohio, where the city council has approved a lease-to-own option for 93 electric vehicles.</p><p>Planning Ahead</p><p>If you're in the administration of a large community, you've probably already started to plan for the AV economy. A November 2017 report from the National League of Cities found that nearly 40 percent of U.S. major cities are preparing for self-driving vehicles in their long-range transportation plans.</p><p>Unfortunately, self-driving cars and electrification are too often thought of only in the context of \"smart\" (and usually, large) cities. But what about people living in satellite counties, suburban municipalities, and small or rural towns? What role do they play in this AV transportation and economic restructuring?</p><p>It's important to appreciate that in many ways small towns are just as critical to the success of the AV transformation as large cities. That's not only because many of the services that these smaller communities need locallyshopping, seeing the doctor, or simply getting out of the house to visit friends and familycan be enhanced through AVs.</p><p>Equally important, because they often commute into larger cities, suburban and rural residents are the ones who are most likely to take advantage of shared, self-driving technologies, and to participate in first-mile/last-mile AV ride-sharing from public transit hubs.</p><p>Whatever the size of the community, though, without planning, administrators may face a serious asymmetry in terms of financial clout and contractual savvy when powerful transportation companies show up on the doorstep (or at the curb). That's why local governmentslarge or smallneed to be actively thinking through their policy goals now.</p><p>So what should administrators, managers, and planners be doing in order to prepare for this transformation to electrification and shared self-driving vehicles? Here are several areas to consider:</p><p>Addressing the built environment/infrastructure. One of the advantages, and necessary preconditions, of self-driving vehicles is that they can go anywhere on public roads that a normal car or truck can go. Equipped with a variety of sensors, cameras, and GPS, AVs are being developed as an all-purpose alternative to human drivers, operating safely on normal highways without the need for special equipment or dedicated lanes.</p><p>Of course, it isn't quite that straightforward. Self-driving vehicles still need well-maintained road construction and signage, and the better the infrastructure, the better they will work. More important, local governments still control the right-of-way access and are responsible for zoning and permitting.</p><p>Parking strategies may need to be revisited and parking garages repurposed. Providing safe and easy access for riders of hailed on demand vehicles may require changes to curb access and traffic flows.</p><p>A comprehensive but flexible pole policy will be necessary for mounting 5G sensors, while at the same time keeping telephone and lamp poles from becoming overburdened and ugly.</p><p>And because pedestrian traffic and bicycles will bring an autonomous vehicle to a standstill, it may be necessary to segregate AVs from pedestrian and bicycle zones to keep traffic flowing.</p><p>Policy considerations. Administrations also need to think about permitting, certifications, and speed limits, and will want to encourageor on the other hand, restrict and regulateAVs and ride-hailing, according to their community's best interest.</p><p>That means having a data-collection and data-sharing policy ready before ride-hailing AV groups arrive on your doorstep. Your community may want to develop pricing incentives that will discourage congestion, promote shared ridership, or develop special provisions for children, the elderly, the disabled, or lower-income groups.</p><p>With ride-hailing services already reducing public transit ridership by an average of 12 percent nationwide, transit agencies, cities, and ride-hailing groups will need early agreement on aspects of public and private coordination at transit hubs. Eventual synchronization of scheduling and payment systems will become necessary across multiple modes of transport.</p><p>Importantly, an evaluation framework for pilot projects and contracted services should be prepared well before the request for information process takes place so that administrators have time to decide how they will assess AV proposals.</p><p>Budgeting and manpower. Another important policy issue that looms large for local government professionals is how to compensate for lost revenues. Over time, the shift to the combination of AV and shared transportation will undoubtedly change the nature of the local budget.</p><p>After all, once fully realized, the sharing, AV economy may significantly reduceor even eliminatemany traditional revenue sources. Ride-sharing and roaming fleets of self-driving vehicles will not need to use parking meters or park in garages, and AVs will all but eliminate fees and fines for speeding, illegal parking, emissions-testing, and DUI and traffic violations. This will represent a significant loss of income for most jurisdictions.</p><p>And it's not just revenues that will be affected. The sharing, AV economy will also mean rethinking local staffing and resource priorities in a wide variety of areas. The police force, for example, will need to adapt to different duties and a smaller presence.</p><p>Today, 80 percent of the typical city police department is involved in some way with traffic control. On the other hand, communities may need to staff new inspector, engineering, IT, and data management roles.</p><p>Outreach and public discussion. Finally, the transformation to the AV economy will require an ongoing dialogue between elected officials and administrators, and possibly most important, administrators and the public.</p><p>After all, these changes can affect a lot of people in a lot of ways, including changes to local employment, as many traditional automotive-related jobs shrink in number or even disappear.</p><p>As more people turn to ride-hailing or shared-use vehicles, parking lots will gradually become available for apartments or retail space, affecting a community's social cohesion as well as local housing prices.</p><p>There may be public-safety concerns, and there will certainly be objections to changing methods of revenue collection.</p><p>Putting Your Community First</p><p>All of these infrastructure and policy decisions should be reflected in the city or county's comprehensive plan, which should be expanded to cover key aspects of transportation planning and infrastructure investment priorities around AV, sharing, and electrification.</p><p>Managers and policymakers should take advantage of the time still available to think through and agree on their community's principles and priorities. This should be done before the potentially disruptive effects of electrification, sharing, and self-driving vehicles begin to exercise control over all aspects of transportation and public policy in the future.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1122185646</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SNC-DW71-DYTH-G0MX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-02-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2123\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"06\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>June 27, 2018 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

An industry that had remained virtually unchanged for centuries has seen exceptional change in just a few years. As digital disruptions continue, the rate of change will only accelerate and, as a result, traditional lenders are digitalizing their operations and seeking opportunities beyond their traditional overbanked markets.\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Across the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), banks are investing in cross-border opportunities in order to increase their geographical footprint, boost efficiency, spur growth and bolster their bottom line. According to Jan Willem Sudmann, executive vice president and head of international banking, International Banking Group at Mashreq Bank, this move can be attributed to two underlying factors.\u00a0</p><p>The first is the rapid rate of innovation in the sector, which has enabled banks to eke out further efficiencies, as well as driving profitability and growth. This has opened a new window of opportunity in foreign countries, especially in emerging markets.\u00a0</p><p>The second is financial deregulation. As emerging markets lift restrictions on foreign direct investment (FDI), this presents a lucrative opportunity for banks to invest in local lenders. In the United Arab Emirates, for instance, a new law passed in 2018 boosted inward FDI. As a result, total FDI is expected to rise by 20% year-on-year in 2019, according to Ministry of Economy projections.\u00a0</p><p>Sudmann notes that banks across the region are broadening their investor base, in part due to the challenges they face \"\" including low oil prices and slowing economic growth. In fact, Dubai-based Mashreq Bank's cap on foreign ownership is set at 49%, one of the highest among all UAE lenders.</p><p>Expansion into a new market brings both additional revenue for banks and new value to the host market. \"It is our belief that today digitalization is one core area that can set a bank apart in a foreign market,\" says Sudmann. Expansion adds value to banks as well as markets themselves, which benefit from efficiencies in terms of new technologies, products and management techniques, he adds.Expansion beyond borders</p><p>Mashreq Bank is one of the UAE's most internationally active financial institutions, with a strong and growing presence across the GCC, Egypt and India; while several other banks are seeking to capitalize on key Asian markets such as Hong Kong, Singapore and Shanghai.\u00a0</p><p>Banks in Asia are also actively looking at cross-border M&amp;A as they strive to improve efficiencies and spur growth. Considering the above, even highly competitive and saturated markets such as India are of immense importance to Mashreq.\u00a0</p><p>For the host country, the entry of a foreign bank opens up new opportunities in terms of rising trade, growing salaries and new jobs. For banks, on the other hand, there is a new market and an option to tap into the potential opportunities \"\" everyone wins.\u00a0</p><p>However, banking challenges remain around expansion into new territories. Rules change from market to market and region to region. For instance, in certain countries the taxation system might be completely transparent and stable, while in others it might be opaque and continue to change depending on the outlook of the government.\u00a0</p><p>\"Entering a new market is not a decision that's taken lightly, it is backed by exhaustive research and deliberation. It is a substantial investment that is driven by various considerations, including benefits stemming from efficiency gains brought about by new technologies, products and management techniques, local legislation, partnering opportunities and the like,\" adds Sudmann.</p><p>So, what is the big differentiator for any bank expanding into a new market that would help them stand out from the local competition? The answer is simple: customer experience.Driving growth through digitalization</p><p>\"One of the keys to success when expanding into a new market lies in a bank's digital prowess. However, while digitalization is especially relevant when it comes to international endeavours, it is crucial to remember the core reason why we are doing it \"\" and that is to enhance the customer experience and provide a seamless banking journey,\" says Sudmann. \"This is what sets a bank apart in a foreign market, and not only does it gives them a competitive edge, but also generates additional efficiencies while cutting operational costs.\"\u00a0</p><p>The advent of big tech companies and fintechs add another layer of complication to this equation, pushing legacy banks to constantly innovate and improve. While this presents new challenges, it also brings with it opportunities, especially when it comes to fintechs. Banks such as Mashreq recognized this early on and have chosen to collaborate with fintechs rather than compete with them. Overall, this trend is expected to continue thanks to regulatory openness and the rise of fintech enablers.\u00a0</p><p>\"New challenger banks are pushing up and targeting young customers who may never have set foot in a physical branch,\" adds Sudmann. \"This is another factor that legacy banks need to consider in their international expansion strategies \"\" take Mashreq, where today 97% of all our retail banking transactions are done online.\"</p><p>Digitalization will continue to be the key growth driver for large banks such as Mashreq. As multiple financial institutions continue to expand into new markets, only those who understand the importance of digitalization and its associated customer benefits will thrive both today and tomorrow.\u00a0</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EUROMO-b1jjg4n2fdys78</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EUROMO2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XXB-7T11-JD1P-T4XN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">318063</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"925\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Euromoney Institutional Investor PLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Euromoney</publicationName><publicationDate month=\"12\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>December 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

Over the next decade, he believes that banks will move away from the traditional vertical integration approach and will instead separate out core infrastructure from the client relationship.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This trend is underscored by the move to open banking and open application programming interfaces (APIs), as embodied in the European Union's Payment Services Directive 2, for example. The directive will allow different organisations - including non-banks - to pull data from one another and create innovative services individually tailored to end users. This increased competition will force banks to innovate and refocus on core differentiators, encouraging them to outsource non-core functions to financial utilities.</p><p>A more competitive environment is not necessarily a threat to banks, says Mr la Cour. Unlike other industries where new entrants had a profoundly disruptive impact, for example Netflix's impact on the video rental market, he believes that banks are \"quite good\" at keeping up with developments and being agile. \"In my opinion, banks will increase their focus on the user experience and developing agile products, with less focus on legacy IT and core banking infrastructure,\" he says.</p><p>MOVING TO A UTILITY MODEL Saxo Payments promotes a \"network-based approach\" to driving digital transformation in banking, particularly in the cross-border payments space. It has introduced the Banking Circle, a utility of which any bank can be a member and, for example, benefit from access to clearing in various countries without using the correspondent banking network.</p><p>Many banks are looking to avoid correspondent banking because of the decadesold IT infrastructure and the complex compliance requirements - both of which mean that participation costs are high. In addition, many large global banks are retrenching from certain jurisdictions considered to be too risky and costly to operate in from a compliance perspective, which means regional banks have even less choice when it comes to correspondent banking partners. \"Through a utility, banks can rid themselves of the operational hassle and cost that is associated with a large correspondent bank network, which they may or may not have access to,\" he explains.</p><p>Such an industry utility is on the cards today because passing on these costs to their customers is not an option for most banks. Small and medium-sized enterprises and large corporates are demanding a much better response from their banks in terms of reducing costs. They are also expecting a better user experience, driven by new entrants operating in the retail space. Companies such as Revolut and TransferWise are now looking to deliver improved cross-border services for corporates that are based on the same user interface they deliver to consumers.</p><p>By providing the cross-border payments infrastructure, Banking Circle allows banks to concentrate on domestic flows, where they have a competitive edge, and frees up resources to develop agile products for the core business.</p><p>Saxo Payments' utility approach with Banking Circle mirrors what happened in the electricity and telecommunications industries in past decades, as outlined in its recent whitepaper, 'Reimagining global banking services in the connected digital marketplace'. \"Many of the players in these industries have undergone a vertical separation - moving from a 'do-it-all' to a 'do-only-what you-cando-well' approach,\" says the whitepaper. It continues, \"Learning from the electricity industry's move to the utility structure, the banking industry is now too reaping the benefits of outsourcing non-core functions to a third-party utility, enabling it to focus completely on owning, managing and growing the customer relationships.\"</p><p>FINTECH COLLABORATION Likewise, fintechs are specialising on discrete parts of the value chain, aided by the regulatory move to open banking. Banks are taking the right approach in engaging with fintechs, according to Mr la Cour. \"I think banks are doing exactly what they should be doing - keeping fintechs close, learning from them, and finding out what works and what doesn't.\"</p><p>He applauds the way banks are taking the best products and services, and embedding them in their own business. JPMorgan Chase's (JPMC) recent acquisition of online payment provider start-up, WePay, illustrates this strategy.</p><p>But while large banks such as JPMC have the scale to engage with the fintech community, smaller banks may not be able to spend as much time and resources sifting through the multitude of start-ups, and as a result may not be able to stay abreast of market innovation. \"Smaller banks will face even bigger future challenges, especially in the face of fintechs and 'big techs' such as Amazon and Facebook, because they will not be able to set up huge fintech programmes and invest millions of dollars,\" says Mr la Cour.</p><p>As such, smaller banks could benefit from a utility approach, possibly even more so than larger banks. \"They will be able to offer scale to their client base in core banking services without having a global presence. Additionally, they can even get flow back from working with a network utility because the utility's flow would be settled with that member bank in its domestic market,\" he explains. \"Moreover, these banks would not have to expend precious resources on something outside their core business.\"</p><p>Utilities also help banks become much more client-centric, he says. \"A utility like Banking Circle puts a bank in the position where it can focus only on its clients, while the utility supports them by offering a range of commodity services such as payments, lending and trade finance.\"</p><p>UNBUNDLING OR RE-BUNDLING? With the regulatory push to increase competition, the financial markets have opened up to new entrants for the first time in decades. In addition, the requirement to ring-fence retail banking from investment banking is forcing many larger banks to unbundle products and services. This has created an enabling environment for innovative fintechs and banks to offer niche products and services, according to Mr la Cour.</p><p>\"This unbundling will, in my opinion, lead to re-bundling at a later stage and banks will be able to deliver focused services to their client base in a much more agile way,\" he says. \"Banks will concentrate more on delivering tailored products and retaining the client relationship, while spending less on banking operations outside their core market.\"</p><p>As to the impact of this on the customerbank relationship, Mr la Cour says the effect will depend on the size of the bank. \"A larger bank might be able to own the client relationship as well as the core banking infrastructure. But a smaller bank that does not have scale will have to decide whether to focus on the core banking side or on maintaining the client relationship.\" He believes that a large majority will focus on the client relationship, because that is the profitable side of the business. Core banking services will, over the next decade, become commoditised. He argues that, in time, core banking services may be given away free, with a charge levied on additional value-added services. \"I'm convinced there'll be a trend towards banks offering a broad pallet of services in the digital age, with the focus on maintaining the client relationship,\" he says.</p><p>While the future of banking may be difficult to predict, Mr la Cour identifies existing trends that indicate what the landscape will look like. \"In a global digital market, where the most important element is maintaining the client relationship, we will see a much more fragmented banking market,\" he says.</p><p>\"This will include having traditional banks, those with banking licences, acting more like a fintech business. And conversely, fintechs will obtain bank licences - Klarna in Sweden is a good example of this trend already,\" he continues. \"Networks, platforms, traditional banks and newcomers will all be delivering financial services to consumers and corporates, which will benefit the end user in the end because of increased competition.\"</p><p>Sponsored by:</p><p>\"A UTILITY LIKE BANKING CIRCLE PUTS A BANK IN THE POSITION WHERE IT CAN FOCUS ONLY ON ITS CLIENTS, WHILE THE UTILITY SUPPORTS THEM BY OFFERING A RANGE OF COMMODITY SERVICES SUCH AS PAYMENTS, LENDING AND TRADE FINANCE\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Anders la Cour, co-founder and CEO of Saxo Payments</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BANKER-132254127</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BANKER2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RG4-BBV1-DY9P-N4GC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">234197</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-02-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1424\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Financial Times Business Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Banker</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"59210\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"12\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>December 1, 2017</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

'Early in my life, I spent a lot of my spare time building computers,' she says. 'This was back when computers were hand-built and getting to understand the components of computers themselves was a natural pathway into the IT industry.'However, it was the management side of IT where she particularly felt at home - progressing to executive and board level and delivering transformational IT projects and services to large clients around the world in the public and private sectors.Her interest was piqued by the factors that contributed to the success of IT project delivery. This led her to undertake a Doctorate of Business Administration in the centre for Project and Programme Management at Cranfield University. </p><p>But as she began the programme, she notes: 'I found I was moving into the area of governance - and it became even clearer to me than ever that governance is a, if not the, key determinant in project success.'There were other important factors like client engagement, the technologies you use, human capital, the skills and so on, but the common thread across everything was governance.'As she delved deeper into her research, a particular perspective of effective corporate governance began to form, one which was fundamentally people-centric, which she explains 'empowers your employees to be bigger and better to effect change across the organisation.'Today she runs MicroMax Consulting, which under the mission of 'driving growth through intelligent governance,' is looking to advise boards on the implementation of governance as a strategic enabler. As she explains: 'Governance is no longer the back office function that everybody tries to circumnavigate.' It is now front and centre of the business.What value do you think governance brings to an organisation?My perspective of governance is people-centric. Governance is about empowering people and utilising your human capital. That may seem like a no-brainer, but how do you do it? And how do you engender a culture within the organisation that is not disparate but is actually complementary to the thinking on governance.People generally talk about governance in terms of accountability. Particularly the accountability of the board; the rules of engagement around how the board should function. But we need to bring governance and accountability down to the individual - empowering people to give them a greater sense of ownership. \"When we tell people to comply, it goes against the natural state of the human brain\" One may have a large team, with each team member providing a different role. If we give them a greater awareness and a greater sense of ownership of their role, we are likely to gain a more committed workforce. Then that flows up to the team leader, and then again further up, and that whole thread of accountability - from the bottom to the board level - runs through the organisation.This way, people within the organisation do not shy away from challenge and responsibility. Rather, they take more pride in what they do.How does your vision of governance mesh with a more conventional understanding?When I talk about governance, I steer away from traditional governance, concerning compliance and regulation. This is certainly important, and especially for the highly-regulated industries there is a time and place for it, but it is not a panacea.When things go wrong, it is not uncommon to see more regulation being piled on. However, I do not believe that is the answer.My notion of governance says: we lighten our controls (but not jettison them), increase oversight, empower people and then put in the appropriate levels of internal and management controls and reporting. We are moving with the digital times, the language is all around negotiating, collaborating, emotional intelligence, empathy. It is more around commitment than compliance.When we tell people to comply, it goes against the natural state of the human brain, because in doing so, we are trying to put them in a straitjacket. But when we give people ownership, we gain their commitment. And commitment is a much stronger currency.Rather than blinkering our personnel, we need to show them the end result that we are trying to achieve, and then stop there. We allow them to infuse their own creativity and enjoy their jobs.When it is crunch time and we need people to come in over the weekends, for example, people will be much more committed to doing so because they are treated well and with respect. We are human beings first and when we put in a domineering style of governance, we begin to dull our capability.It should be people first and then the governance follows.And what about governance at the board level?When we talk about governance at the board level, we need to ensure that the corporate objectives align with our operational activities. Strategic alignment is a given - for an organisation to exist, function and perform, or even outperform its competitors, there must be harmony between strategic intent and governance. \"When you have an overly dense process, people do not respond to it.\" As I mentioned, corporate governance is all around accountability and ownership, leading the direction of the organisation and demonstrating behaviour. We need board sponsorship on projects. Successful projects are not necessarily those that have the best project managers, but those that have the best support network around them and backing by the board.It is all about that cohesion and alignment.What we sometimes forget is that we also need a feedback loop, because the projects also inform the overall strategy. If a project is misfiring and not delivering, then you need that information.Do you feel governance is too often hamstrung by complex structure and processes to respond as efficiently as possible to challenge?Governance by its nature is dense. Within organisations, there is a place for that classic definition of governance. There is a place for controls and a place for process. But what you find is that when you have an overly dense process, people do not respond to it.I recall once, when I joined a new organisation, I was going for a committee meeting. One of the team members brought me the documentation to support the meeting and it was a door-stop. And they said, 'oh, but this is just the start. We have more.' The meeting was in half an hour.I went to the meeting, listened twice as hard and made it through. And then I came back and told my team to rip up everything. There was too much information and detail, and it was a drag on the business.We could now start with a blank sheet that I could use to actually implement my thinking and philosophies. We ended up with a framework that was more around the appropriate levels of internal controls, management controls and greater human oversight, with consistent behaviours across the organisation, rather than copious amounts of paper.In the past, governance of IT has often been confined to IT departments and not really been considered by the board. Have you seen a change of perspective on this?An organisation may not necessarily be an IT organisation, but more likely than not, IT will be front and centre of the business function. Everyone uses it and it will be pervasive throughout the organisation. We are, after all, living in the digital world.In terms of reputational risk, all that needs to happen is for one thing to go wrong and it is on social media within minutes. \"With the use of endpoint devices, the boundaries of a company extends to every single device in an individual's home\" There is an issue that technological risk still is not as understood or as respected as other areas of risk. But the ground is changing, boards are taking note. We had the Equifax and TalkTalk hacks. There has been ransomware, such as WannaCry, and we think about identity theft and those kinds of problems. Technological risk is a major problem for the individual now and we as individuals take this personal awareness back into the organisation.We now have the technology-enabled and agile workforce. With the use of endpoint devices, the boundaries of a company extends to every single device in an individual's home.Gone are the days when IT was just about our infrastructure and defending our firewalls. So IT is certainly a concern for the top table.And again, the risk, and the defence, is now down to people. The behaviours we engender within the organisation extend outside the boundaries of our firm. Somebody could post something damaging to the company's reputation on Twitter. Or somebody unknowingly unleashes a bug by clicking a link on one computer, automatically cascading it across the entire network. According to statistics, almost 90% of IT breaches are narrowed down to human error.IT risk is the individual.If our governance engenders a culture of enabling people to think and take ownership for their actions, then that is our first point of security.Looking to company boards and directors, do you feel there is a skill shortage in this area?To some degree, this area is not yet fully understood by boards because the tide is changing so quickly. The conventional thinker is no longer the mover and shaker. It is the unconventional - the outliers who are challenging the status quo.The big tech companies and their founders started with very disruptive ideas and people are welcoming that now. Whereas if we look at the traditional board, that in itself is long past its sell-by-date. Companies are looking to find new talent - and this is why people are welcoming more diversity. \"There must be a measure of accountability and responsibility for the views we espouse\" When people talk about diversity, everybody think it is just about men versus women or the racial balance, but actually it is diversity of the mind as well.You look at top companies, where the predominant trend has been an Oxbridge background or similar. And in essence, that is fine. Those work environments may have some of the biggest and brightest thinkers.But the world is a lot bigger than that, and we can benefit from contrasting and complementary thinking. A savvy board chair listens and blends and infuses that diversity of thought together.There has to be a validity to the thinking that we bring though and how that is executed and taken onboard within that boardroom. There must be a measure of accountability and responsibility for the views we espouse.You also have a keen interest in mentoring. Can you tell me about your work with this and what companies can do to support emerging talent?I am passionate about mentoring. When one has been a beneficiary, one should give back, so I do have mentees of my own. In my career, I have had some excellent mentors, and they have come from a diverse mix of backgrounds.I have benefitted from their guidance and I have seen how mentoring can help people progress - not just in their careers but also in their personal lives.I have not walked my road alone.People have seen something in me and taken me under their wing and mentored me to the next position. Now it is incumbent upon me to then pass that on. But not just pass it on, but pass it on and then some, to the next generation of future leaders.It is not about a one-way relationship. As with governance, everybody thinks it is a one-way ticket, but it is not. It is a symbiotic relationship. Mentees keep one bright, agile and informed - they keep one cool.I was getting ready to give a talk in March this year, and I was putting my slides together for this talk - one of my mentees spent two hours on the phone giving me her suggestions to help jazz up my presentation. At the end, I had a slide deck that I knew was really engaging and to the point.Or when I was shooting my corporate video, one of my mentees flew over to help. And she does not hesitate to come to me when she wants advice at work.There is a give and a take, and we both grow from it. And the relationship is not just about this point in time. It is one that underpins life. We begin to form life-long friendships - whether on a professional basis or going beyond that to just common interests.You recently were listed at number nine on the 2018 Financial Times EMpower list of top US and UK ethnic minority executives. How did you feel about this recognition?That was quite a defining moment for me, and I did not really understand the enormity of it until it happened.It was only when the embargo on the results was lifted on the press release and I started to see the reaction of people, that I realised it was a really big deal.To be ranked, not just number nine overall but as the top tech professional, of course filled me with professional and personal pride as a black woman looking to inspire our future leaders. It made me feel that the things I had done - all the effort, hard work and support I received - had not been done in vain. It is the kind of thing that spurs one on to do bigger and better things.

Or is it? One of the curious things about the world of tech is the difference between the hype cycle and the actual implementation of life-changing advancements. If you were to read nothing but Wired or Hacker News in isolation you would swear the days of The Jetsons have already arrived. </p><p>But implementing the things that have been invented is often the more time consuming, tangled and laborious part of creation. Take drones, for instance. Seems we have been hearing about them for years, but you still can't get your Triple-Venti Soy No Foam Latte delivered by one tomorrow. Does that mean drones were a bust? Hardly. The world of drone technology is actually progressing rapidly, but the space has always had to deal with a heavily regulated backdrop. When brothers and tech veterans Tony and Paul Di Benedetto were looking for a dynamic tech sub-sector to enter they knew two things. First drones, with their myriad of possibilities and permutations, fit the bill. Second, they had better start by focusing on Ottawa and how the federal government was going to view the drone space, because that would ultimately play a big part in the business. Today, Drone Delivery Canada (CSE:FLT) is making the dream of drone delivery happen here and now. Cantech Letter sat down with CEO Tony Di Benedetto to talk about the challenges of founding the company and where it goes from here. Tony, can you tell us how Drone Delivery Canada got started?After we sold out last business back in 2013, Paul (my brother, CTO - Paul Di Benedetto) and I we were looking at where to focus our energies on. We have been tech entrepreneurs for some 20 years, and had always done well in the space - so, we wanted to find the next big tech niche and we looked at drones and their potential use for commercialization. We saw there was many applications for this tech, but what excited us the most was utilizing drones as a logistics application. We saw this as a disruptor to traditional logistics and if we could commercialize this application there would be a very large business opportunity for us. How did you approach entering such a highly regulated space?Before we did anything, we decided to spend a lot of time in Ottawa to really try and understand where and if there was a place from commercial drone operations in Canada. What we learned was our Canadian Federal Government was pro-technology and pro-innovation. Back in 2010, the Federal Government had created a drone UAV research program and had enlisted the smartest minds in Canada to help develop a drone strategy for Canada. The approach we took was to listen very carefully to what the regulators envisioned and we took these key inputs and commenced mapping out a platform to align our business strategy with what the regulators wanted to see and also where we saw this technology best being applied in Canada (Canada's North). Di Benedetto: 'With our technology, we can utilize drones to build a 'railway in the sky' connecting these communities and providing a cost effective just in time access to goods and services.'  It seems as though Drone Delivery Canada is embarking on a multi-phase rollout. What are the first steps and how do you see the company morphing over time?Our strategy is to start in the back yard (Canada's remote communities). We believe this is the right place where to start - big wide, open spaces, far and away from people. The backyard is our proving grounds and also a great place to commercialize. These remote communities lack infrastructure (roads) and with our technology, we can utilize drones to build a 'railway in the sky' connecting these communities and providing a cost effective just in time access to goods and services. Overtime we will then commence bringing the technology closer to suburban and urban areas. The technology needs to start somewhere - and we believe Northern Canada is the right place for that. Its all about learning how to walk before we run. Why is rolling out drone delivery in an urban environment so much more difficult?There are simply more objects in the way. Over time the technology definitely has a place in urban environments, but as I mentioned earlier - the backyard is the right place to start. Do you see a day in which cities will enjoy drone delivery?Absolutely. We are working with a few municipalities and they are looking at how to integrate drone delivery as a logistics solution into their future urban planning initiatives. Can you tell us about your pilot project with First Nations groups?We are working with Pontiac Group. Pontiac Group is a socioeconomic development group which is very entrenched in the First Nations communities. They will be leading our pilot program with the First Nations. The goal is to start in the Thunderbay area - but that is not finalized as of yet. Are there other usage cases for drones that could bring immediate improvement?Drones have a variety of applications - photography, surveying, agriculture, etc. In general, done right - drone technology has a number of benefits to a wide variety of industries. We like the logistics vertical -there are a number of big barriers to enter this space, but once successfully achieved the value proposition is very large. Di Benedetto 'Our strategy is not to focus on hardware. We see hardware as a commodity and it is very difficult to make money manufacturing drones with global competition.'  You have in the past mentioned that yours is a SaaS model. What do you mean by that?We are a technology enabler for our clients. Our platform is really all about software - Software-as-a-Service (SaaS). Our platform is deployed at our clients sites and we provide complete oversight on the platform offering a managed service. Our technology allows our clients to expand their logistics network allowing drones to enter their fleet. Our platform is highly scalable and flexible. Our strategy is not to focus on hardware. We see hardware as a commodity and it is very difficult to make money manufacturing drones with global competition. Our key value is the software platform which allows drone deliveries to happen and essentially is the key to having a robust platform with a commercial license to operate. What markets will you be tackling in the next 12-24 months and what size level are they?We are focused on the Canadian market and look to get our license anticipated in Q4 2017 and look to roll out our model in 2018.We look to first have commercial success in Canada, beginning in less populated areas and then move to more urbanized areas as the technology gets adopted. We also look to export the technology globally. Do you expect there will be a 'typical' order for you, or is everything different depending upon the customer?Every customer has their own unique needs. Our platform is highly scalable and flexible and we are working with multiple clients (government, corporate, services, retail) to develop a customized solution for their immediate and future requirements. What does your balance sheet look like?We have approximately $10M in our treasury with no debt. We are adequately financed to commercialization. What milestones should investors look for from Drone Delivery Canada over the next year?These include receiving our operator flight certificate, sign new customers and completing certain and various software systems that enable the drones to operate commercially in the Canadian skies.

They may sound like flying lawnmowers, but drones are becoming more prevalent within society, to the degree where they can no longer be ignored. CBS News reported, \"According to the Federal Aviation Administration, more than 650 pilots have reported seeing unmanned aircraft as of Aug. 9 this year, compared to a total of 238 such sightings for all of 2014.\" While ushering a new aerial perspective to both filmmakers and photographers, drones have also created safety risks, from disturbing the flight of commercial aircraft to obstructing the firefighting efforts of first-responders. This is especially pertinent in California, with the ongoing drought and yearly wildfire season. In an effort to combat these issues, the United States government has issued new laws and restrictions regarding drone use to help limit these accidents. But how is this legislation going to create a safer atmosphere for both drone owners and the community, and how will it affect everyone's privacy?</p><p>The new legislation requires that all drones be registered with the government. Much like car registration, drone registration will help ensure accountability and hopefully discourage illegal and unsafe flying practices. While drone registration will help to crack down on the infringement of privacy, these laws will require much more fine-tuning and calibration, just as drones do before flight. Situations such as how to hold owners accountable for flying their drones too close to commercial planes will only increase in urgency.\u00a0</p><p>Since the current registration process for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles is paper-based, the Department of Transportation is attempting to transition to an electronic registration system, as reported the U.S. Government Publishing Office. Most likely, laws stipulating the maximum altitude drones can fly (around 400 feet) and requirements that drones are kept within the controller's eyesight will also be established. More details will be released on Nov. 20 when the new UAV registration task force finalizes its recommendations to the Department of Transportation.\u00a0</p><p>Beyond registration, a method of identifying drones and their owners must be established, or else most drone offenses, like hit-and-runs, will never be brought to justice. This is especially true if drone operators simply whisk their drones away from the scene of the crime. In addition, various types of drones should have different license requirements and processes, much like the different licenses available for motor vehicles ranging from motorcycles to trucks.\u00a0</p><p>Furthermore, the widespread popularity of drones raises issues of privacy. Due to the altitude drones are able to reach and their wide field of view, the footage recorded from the drone may include individuals who do not wish to be recorded. As a byproduct of laws regulating where drones can be flown, most drone owners should be flying in desolate fields away from crowded cities, eliminating chances of an infringement of privacy. But there will always be those who purchase drones to spy on others. Additionally, they should ideally be flown on private property in which invasion of privacy is no longer an issue, or in public spaces where the expectation of privacy is very low.\u00a0</p><p>At this point, some people may be tired of technology experts constantly droning on and on about new rules and regulations, so let's move on to the real life applications of drones. Beyond taking cool aerial selfies to get likes on Facebook, drones have a multitude of applications, of which we've barely scratched the surface. Big tech companies, such as Amazon and Google, are discussing a new era of shipping materials using drone technology like Google's Project Wing, according to the Wall Street Journal. A researcher at UCSD's Calit 2, who is a member of Engineers for Exploration, said that drone technology is currently being used to help archaeologists scan for Mayan ruins and is also being used by biologists and conservationists to find harpy eagles. While it has taken around a century to develop autonomous cars, it has only taken a decade to develop drones with autonomous capabilities. Companies such as 3DR are making drones with pre-coded aerial maneuvers designed for users who want high-quality aerial footage without professional training.\u00a0</p><p>While many people will not go out and purchase drones in the near future, everyone should be mindful of integrating drones safely into our lives, especially as they continue to increase in popularity. Important problems, such as their interference with law enforcement, fire-fighting efforts and their potential invasions of privacy must not be underestimated. Perhaps in the near future, instead of looking for cars when crossing the road, we might look up at a sky full of drones and hear others complain about the hassle of registering their drones with long wait times and service even worse than at the DMV.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">UWIRE-1971513</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">UWIRE2015</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5HCW-G8M1-DY7P-T052-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">172244</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-12-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"823\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2015 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Guardian: University of California - San Diego</publicationName><aggregationName>University Wire</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"11\" year=\"2015\"><dateText>November 15, 2015 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.city\"><classificationItem><className>La Jolla</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.state\"><classificationItem><className>CA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Torts</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MDAwOEM2NTEzQkVDNEI4NzlGMEZERUEyRjQwODM4Njg7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"53\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QTY2QkM5NTY1MDE1NEJDNkFEODY0MDkxRjQzOTBFMDQ7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RDE3OTIzNEIzQjNCNDUwMzkyOEVEMEU1OEI0MkI5RDc</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Transportation Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTYzRTk5RDVBQkQ2NDcwQzk2NTU3ODQ5OEE3NDlBNzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MTA0MzBBMUI0MkVCNDIzNDkxNkY4MTU5REUxOTE0ODA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTYzRTk5RDVBQkQ2NDcwQzk2NTU3ODQ5OEE3NDlBNzk</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001020</classCode><className>LEGISLATION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>N926120GM</classCode><className>AVIATION ADMINISTRATION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>ST00007237</classCode><className>INVASION OF PRIVACY</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MEYyNUYzRjAzRTE3NDQyREFEMTc4RDg0RkQ2QkYyRkY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QzREMTA1OTgyODY3NDc2NjlFRjUzNDE5RTM4QjY4NzM</classCode><className>Invasion of Privacy</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST0008XAA</classCode><className>VISUAL ARTISTS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX000147</classCode><className>AVIATION TRANSPORTATION LAW</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NkEyRTREQTdBRjkzNDE5OTk4ODAzMEY5MDkzRjlGRTE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTYzRTk5RDVBQkQ2NDcwQzk2NTU3ODQ5OEE3NDlBNzk</classCode><className>Air Transportation</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>ST000DLZB</classCode><className>EMERGENCY SERVICES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>STX000631</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENTAL ACCIDENTS &amp;

Subscribers will see stories like this every day on our website (and in our daily emails) as an added value to your subscription.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">They have been used to shoot weddings, Hollywood movies and terrorists. But now drones, and their makers, are navigating a third path between hobbyists and warfare into the industrial world, threatening a shake-up of the burgeoning $6bn industry.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">New uses for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), to give drones their technical name, are emerging almost daily: delivering packages, pizzas and blood; surveying mines; pre-emptive firefighting; even collecting whale snot to help conserve the mammals.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"We are developing the UAV into a means of production,\" said Paul Xu, vice-president of DJI, at a conference in Shenzhen last month. His company has given China undisputed leadership in the sector, with its 70 per cent market share of non-military drones</p><p>However, if Shenzhen-based DJI, valued at $8bn-$10bn at its last funding round in 2015, is to keep that lead, it will need to adapt to new market dynamics.</p><p>The industry dismisses talk of \"peak\" consumer drone, but few expect that part of the business to maintain its heady growth rates. Outside China, casualties abound: in California, Lily Robotics shut up shop in January, while 3D Robotics switched its focus to software and Parrot, of France, cut jobs. New entrants are cut from an altogether different cloth, with industrial and tech groups, including Qualcomm, Intel and Boeing hovering over the space.</p><p>Regulators too are braced for change, as the industry lobbies for more openings. In a first step, the US Federal Aviation Administration, in effect, opened the skies to commercial drones a year ago, with limited safety rules covering the sector.</p><p>Since the FAA rule changes, said Michael Perry, director of strategic partnerships at DJI, the enterprise industry had been scaling up rapidly, encouraged by the more certain regulatory environment. \"Before we had conversations [with businesses] but then they said: 'How will my legal team deal with this?' The last thing we want is vagaries. People won't invest if they aren't sure.\"</p><p>DJI, the creation of Frank Wang, a radio-controlled helicopter enthusiast from Hangzhou who parlayed his boyhood hobby into a company with sales of $1.5bn, is now looking into areas ranging from agriculture to eliminating mosquitoes.</p><p>\"Personal drone vendors are now aggressively trying to position themselves in the commercial market,\" said Gerald Van Hoy, senior research analyst at Gartner, although the firm says the 3m drones it expects to be shipped this year will still be overwhelmingly for the consumer market. These figures are up 39 per cent on 2016 and should translate into revenues of $6bn.</p><p>The commercial market will take longer to materialise, he said. Drones for delivery, for example, will be \"mired in logistical issues\" and have less than 1 per cent of this new segment by 2020.</p><p>Mr Perry agrees. Logistics, he said, was \"five-10-15 years down the line\" and required three changes: regulations to clear the airspace; bigger payload capacity, endurance and ability to navigate obstacles; as well as the development of a pressing need to deliver by drone rather than other options now used.</p><p>Agriculture is attracting the most attention. Farmers are using drones to spray pesticide, analyse soil content and pinpoint pests, disease and humidity with thermal imaging. Agri-drones have become so widespread, said Andrew Uerkwitz, senior analyst at Oppenheimer, that one start-up declared: \"We're not even looking at agriculture because it's such a crowded space.\"</p><p>Farmers can also be less willing team players and resist sharing essential data picked up by drones, said Gan Jie, associate dean for technology innovation and entrepreneurship at Cheung Kong Graduate School of Business in Beijing and a director at DJI.</p><p>\"A lot of large agricultural companies are dominated by state-owned players and it is very hard to collaborate with them,\" she said.</p><p>\"The good thing is [the US is] a free market but, on the other hand, a lot of farm owners are thinking: 'Why should I collaborate with you? I can use you to spray [fertiliser] but why should I give you my data? This kind of data are a public good but everyone wants to be a free rider.\"</p><p>Ms Gan is not alone in seeing collaboration as the way forward, as more specific industry requirements call for specialisations. Mr Uerkwitz predicted a bifurcated market: DJI sticking with hardware - and growing its margins on the back of its increasing scale - while start-ups and others focus on providing the software to go on top.</p><p>That could lead to uneasy collaborations among the suppliers themselves, with hardware-centric DJI seeking partnerships with software specialists, fearful that the drone giant might be angling to swoop and gobble them up.</p><p>It is becoming a much tougher market, said Chris Anderson, whose 3D Robotics had quit making hardware. \"It's much harder to penetrate because it's not about drones but about the verticals: construction, agriculture and the rest; about data analysis, enterprise software, sales channels.</p><p>\"It's hard, but when you understand people are not buying [drones] because it's cool or a Christmas present, but because it's an essential tool for business, then you get sales of thousands of millions of units.\"</p><p>The new era will not just separate hardware and software but also test different business models, says Mr Uerkwitz, who notes that already some manufacturers are leasing their kit and services - for example, to French vineyard owners - rather than selling them outright.</p><p>\"I don't necessarily believe this is an industry where a farmer is going to own his own drone,\" he says. \"It could be there is a market for drones as a service.\"</p><p>Start-ups, meanwhile, continue to proliferate: after ratcheting up a record number of deals last year, the first quarter of 2017 was the busiest yet, with 32 investments totalling an aggregate $113m, according to CBInsights, a data consultancy. The leading areas were terrestrial imagery, infrastructure inspection and delivery.</p><p>China's big tech groups have, predictably, dabbled in drones too, but with limited success. Tencent worked with hardware maker Ying on a drone, a small project that appears to have sunk without trace. \"If you're trying to start a drone from scratch, there's so much to catch up on,\" said one industry figure, describing an 18-month development cycle.</p><p>GoPro, the action camera maker, learnt this to its cost: last November it was forced to recall its Karma drone, since relaunched, after some customers' aerial cameras dropped out of the sky soon after it was introduced.</p><p>In the meantime, regulations will continue to dictate how and where the industry moves next. Donald Trump, the US president, recently met US drone executives but many reckon the US is on the back foot.</p><p>The \"line of sight\" rule, which means the drone can fly only so long as you can see it, kills the whole point of surveying, for example, miles of power lines and immediately uploading the data garnered to the cloud, said Mr Uerkwitz.</p><p>\"The problem is that can't happen today,\" he said. \"You would need a guy in a van, getting out, flying his drone as far as he can see, then bringing it back, getting back in his van, drive again and repeat.\"</p><p>Instead, he said, companies were using the UK, Canada, France and even Africa as their testing grounds - a redrawing of the skies that many believe stands to disadvantage US drone companies.</p><p>Equally, Mr Uerkwitz added, more open skies could disrupt the outlook even more by attracting new industry entrants.</p><p>\"If regulations get fixed and [create] a real opportunity, a company like GE could easily scale up quickly to compete against anybody, whether software or hardware,\" he said.</p><p>Did you find this article useful?

It's one of a series of proposals outlined in an investigation into the safe use of unmanned aerial vehicles.&lt;nl/&gt;</p><p> In its\u00a0'Civilian Use of Drones in the EU'[2]\u00a0[PDF] report, the House of Lords EU Internal Market, Infrastructure and Employment sub-committee says drones could account for as many as 150,000 jobs in Europe by 2050.&lt;nl/&gt; The proposals for a register of drones would initially only cover commercial users, but would later be expanded to include individual consumers. The database would be designed to allow the authorities to trace individual flights and would be open to the public through a smartphone app.&lt;nl/&gt; The report also discusses the idea of adding an identity chip with the owner's details to every drone sold, which was suggested\u00a0by several of the expert witnesses it consulted, but stops short of making a firm recommendation.&lt;nl/&gt; The committee suggests that geofencing be used to prevent drones from being able to take off or fly over sensitive locations including prisons, airports and military bases. Last month, we wrote about NoFlyZone[3], an initiative to allow people to stop\u00a0flights over their homes.&lt;nl/&gt; The House of Lords proposals argue\u00a0that police should receive clearer guidance on current safety regulations and that a kitemark[4] should be established to indicate drones that have been passed as safe to use.&lt;nl/&gt; The ideas put forward by the committee are not likely to directly translate into law, but with big tech players including\u00a0Amazon[5] and Facebook[6] investing heavily in drone technology, we can definitely expect to see more legislation after this year's general election.&lt;nl/&gt;

A new project from scientists in the UK and India shows one possible use for this technology: identifying violent behavior in crowds with the help of camera-equipped drones.</p><p><br/> In a paper titled \"Eye in the Sky,\" the researchers describe their system. It uses a simple Parrot AR quadcopter (which costs around $200) to transmit video footage over a mobile internet connection for real-time analysis. An algorithm trained using deep learning estimates the poses of humans in the video and matches them to postures the researchers have designated as \"violent.\" For the purposes of the project, just five poses are included: strangling, punching, kicking, shooting, and stabbing.<br/> The scientists hope that systems like theirs will be used to detect crime in public spaces and at large events. Lead researcher Amarjot Singh of the University of Cambridge told The Verge that he was motivated by events like the Manchester Arena bombing in 2017. Singh said attacks like this could be prevented in future if surveillance cameras can automatically spot suspicious behavior, like someone leaving a bag unattended for a long period of time.<br/> However, the research needs to be taken with a pinch of salt, particularly with regard to its claims of accuracy. Singh and his colleagues report that their system was 94 percent accurate at identifying \"violent\" poses, but they note that the more people that appear in frame, the lower this figure. (It fell to 79 percent accuracy when looking at 10 individuals.)<br/> More importantly, though, these figures don't represent real-world usage. In order to train and test their AI, the researchers recorded their own video clips of volunteers pretending to attack one another. The volunteers are generously spaced apart and attack one another with exaggerated movements. Singh acknowledged that this isn't a perfect reflection of how the surveillance system might perform in the wild, but he said he has plans to test the drones during two upcoming music festivals in India. \"We have permission to fly over one music festival happening in a month and are seeking permission for the other,\" said Singh.<br/> Researchers working in this field often note there is a huge difference between staged tests and real-world use-cases. In the latter, the video footage is often blurry, the crowds are bigger, and people's actions are more subtle and more prone to be misinterpreted. This last point is particularly telling, as Singh and his colleagues don't produce any figures for the systems false positive rate - e.g., the frequency with which it identifies nonviolent behavior as violent. Think about how giving someone a high-five might be misinterpreted as a violent gesture, for example.<br/> But even if this particular system has not yet proved itself in the wild, it's a clear illustration of the direction contemporary research is going. Using AI to identify body poses is a common problem, with big tech companies like Facebook publishing significant research on the topic. And with the rise of cheap drones and fast mobile internet, it's easier than ever to capture and transmit live video footage. Putting these pieces together to create sophisticated surveillance isn't hard.<br/> The question is: how will this technology be used, and who will use it? Speaking to The Verge earlier this year about automated surveillance, a number of experts said these systems were ripe for abuse by law enforcement and authoritarian governments.<br/>Jay Stanley, a senior policy analyst at the ACLU, said this technology would have a chilling effect on civil society, as people rightly fear they're being constantly monitored and analyzed. \"We want people to not just be free, but to feel free. And that means that they don't have to worry about how an unknown, unseen audience may be interpreting or misinterpreting their every movement and utterance,\" said Stanley.<br/> Meredith Whittaker, a researcher who examines the social implications of AI, tweeted that Singh and his colleagues' paper showed there was a \"mounting ethical crisis\" in the field, with scientists failing to examine potential misuses of the technology they're helping build. Whittaker told The Verge that the paper's methodology was questionable and that the lack of time given over to the work's ethical implications was damning.<br/> Speaking to The Verge, Singh defended his work. He said despite these criticisms, it could have a positive effect on the word: stopping crime and terrorism. He suggested that new regulations might be needed so such technology isn't misused, but he admitted there was \"no good answer\" to the worrying scenarios experts like Whittaker and Stanley are predicting. \"Anything can be used for good. Anything can be used for bad,\" said Singh.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INDTEC-n10537231</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INDTEC2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SH4-4BF1-DYDW-749K-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">428674</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-06-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"818\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 FFC Information Solution Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Indian Technology news</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5981\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"06\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>June 7, 2018 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001659</classCode><className>SURVEILLANCE TECHNOLOGY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DKTF</classCode><className>SURVEILLANCE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000707</classCode><className>FESTIVALS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000116</classCode><className>ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001477</classCode><className>RESEARCH REPORTS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX001753</classCode><className>ARTS FESTIVALS &amp; EXHIBITIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST000DLKC</classCode><className>STABBINGS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>ST000D170</classCode><className>BOMBINGS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>STX001811</classCode><className>VOLUNTEERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000707</classCode><className>FESTIVALS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000116</classCode><className>ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX001753</classCode><className>ARTS FESTIVALS &amp; EXHIBITIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>STX002247</classCode><className>HELICOPTERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"59\"><classCode>GX142</classCode><className>NEW DELHI, INDIA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>GX476</classCode><className>MANCHESTER, ENGLAND</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>GC304</classCode><className>INDIA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>GC329</classCode><className>UNITED KINGDOM</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

You suddenly feel like having a pizza. You whip out your phone, tap open an app and order one. The doorbell rings. When you open the door, a box of pizza is waiting for you. Except that the pizza delivery guy is missing. Instead an unpretentious drone is holding your package.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This is already a reality in Iceland. Well, kind off. So long as you have sought your Icelandic neighbour's nod to allow drones to fly overhead, you can pick drone delivery for your online purchases. In Australia, Google's parent company Alphabet has secured permission from the local regulator to flag off its drone service. By 2021, Uber drones could drop off your lunch without any fuss. Soon your online orders could be ferried by drones. China's ecommerce giant Alibaba is delivering goods using drones along fixed delivery routes in Shanghai Jinshan Industrial Park.</p><p>While regulators have been previously hesitant about permitting drones to fly out of sight, some drone delivery services are now making short detours along fixed routes and beyond the sight of operators. The regulators are trying to strike a balance. Too many rules will kill a nascent industry, while too few will amount to recklessness. In UAE, hobbyists are allowed to fly their aerial toys within sight and in green zones so long as they are not carrying your lunch and are registered. Commercial drone operators that carry packages or take pictures have their own set of rules to abide by.</p><p>We think drones might deliver us from unintended problems that previous generation of technologies brought upon us - too much traffic, too much pollution, too little time. Think of the food delivery person who battles traffic hazards, pollution and heat to deliver your lunch on time. Drones can definitely pitch in. But we will have to wait a while before we see commercial drones at our doorstep in densely populated urban clusters. The economics of such flights don't make sense as yet. Add to that the tricky issue of sending these unmanned flying objects to your apartment. A drone hovering near your apartment window sounds plain wrong.</p><p>That said, I can already visualise a sky that is busy with drones flying low, delivering all sorts of products - from life-saving drugs to groceries. If cost reduction isn't a sufficient allure, safety of life and property certainly is.</p><p>My hometown in India is flooded. My aging relatives are marooned in their homes, waiting for essential supplies like drinking water that is only a few kilometres away. They don't have a sufficient number of boats. Had drones been put into service, we could have swiftly averted the crisis.</p><p>However, drones are not immune to humans who have violence or disruption on their minds. Sadly, drones used to disrupt public life are outnumbering those being used for human good. If they can be used to carry supplies and spares for troubled offshore ships, they can also be used for acts of terror. Rogue drones can simply carry gun parts into a country where they can be assembled and used to unleash bloodshed. No need to recruit unsuspecting youth to smuggle contraband drugs across borders or into prisons. Drones have it covered.</p><p>If they are being used by aircraft to inspect paint and structural damages, a single drone can demolish an aircraft. It can smash an aircraft's spinning fan blades to smithereens more efficiently than feathered creatures can. Many aircraft have reported a close shave with these little bundles of metal, sensors and lithium-ion batteries. The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has reported nearly 100 cases of drones threatening the safety of aircraft in the country.</p><p>It does not take much effort to shut down an airport with a few flying drones bought off Amazon. This is what the Extinction Rebellion, a climate-change pressure group were trying to do at the Heathrow airport and could have accomplished, had the cops not taken preemptive action. However, earlier on, the Gatwick airport was not so lucky. Drone sightings forced the airport to shut down for 36 hours just before Christmas.</p><p>The answer to these pesky drones is technology. So, drones are going to keep technologists busy for a very long time - to find an antidote for the very medicine they created. Geofencing is one of the ways to pre-programme drones from sauntering into restricted areas. But what about those that are especially programmed to enter prohibited areas? Radio jamming devices are gearing up to shut off communication between the drones and their ground control stations. We are in an infinite loop of technology fixing problems created by technology.</p><p>The skies of the future will be buzzing with drones flying at low altitudes. In that whirring multitude, will we be able to distinguish a well-meaning drone from a rouge one? Today, there is no easy answer. They are undoubtedly mirroring the mix of good and bad in humanity. A drone can solve many problems, but it cannot fix this deep-rooted contradiction in us. It serves both Jekyll and Hyde.</p><p>Shalini Verma is CEO of PIVOT technologies</p><p><br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">KHATIM-155292686</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">KHATIM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X5H-6TV1-JDJN-63YS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">338756</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"864\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Khaleej Times - Galadari Printing and Publishing Co.

The price, which was above the company's previously forecast range, gives the company a valuation of $9.2 billion.Even with strong investor demand, the price wasn't enough to allow the company's valuation to match the $10 billion it was valued at in its last private funding round. The company raised an estimated $563 million and insiders another $193 million in the offering.Dropbox priced its initial public offering on Thursday at $21 a share, which was above its previously expected range \u2014 but the price yielded a valuation that was still below what it was worth in its last funding round, according to The Wall Street Journal[1].  The cloud-storage company raised $563 million in the offering, assuming it stuck with its previously announced plan to sell about 26.8 million shares. </p><p>Early investors and insiders including CEO Drew Houston hauled in another $193 million, based on their previous plan to sell 9.2 million shares. Salesforce plans to buy a $100 million stake[2] in the company subsequent to the offering, but at the same price. The $21 price was above the $18 to $20 range Dropbox forecast in a regulatory document on Wednesday[3]. That range was above the initial $16 to $18 range the company proposed earlier in the month, indicating strong investor interest in the offering. That price gives the company a market capitalization of $9.2 billion, factoring in all of its outstanding shares, including unvested restricted stock units and shares that underly certain stock options. That's a bit shy of the $10 billion valuation the company had at the time of its last funding round in 2014. Dropbox is expected to begin trading Friday under the ticker symbol DBX. The company will have a dual-class stock structure that gives outsized power to certain insiders. Houston, for example, will hold about 24% of the company's voting power after the offering.NOW WATCH: The surprising reason why NASA hasn't sent humans to Mars yet[4]See Also: DocuSign has reportedly
