Indeed, they turned high-tech and social media into American brands.</p><p> The left was even more enthralled. It dropped its customary regulatory zeal, despite Silicon Valley's monopolizing, outsourcing, offshoring, censoring, and destroying of startup competition. After all, Big Tech was left-wing and generous. High-tech interests gave hundreds of millions of dollars to left-wing candidates, think tanks and causes.</p><p> Companies such as Facebook and Google were able to warp their own social media protocols and internet searches to insidiously favor progressive agendas and messaging.</p><p> If the left feared that the tech billionaires were becoming robber barons, they also delighted in the fact that they were at least left-wing robber barons.</p><p> Unlike the steel, oil and coal monopolies of the 19th century that out of grime and smoke created the sinews of a growing America, Silicon Valley gave us shiny, clean, green and fun pods, pads and phones.</p><p> As a result, social media, internet searches, texts, email and other computer communications were exempt from interstate regulatory oversight.

Regarding the high-tech leaders' efforts to rig their industries and strangle dissent, think of conniving Jay Gould or Jim Fisk rather than the wizard Thomas Edison.</p><p> With the election of populist Donald Trump, the Republican Party seems less wedded to the doctrines of economic libertarian Milton Friedman and more to the trust-busting zeal of Teddy Roosevelt.</p><p> The public so far has welcomed the unregulated freedom of Silicon Valley - as long as it was truly free. But now computer users are discovering that social media and web searches seem highly controlled and manipulated - by the whims of billionaires rather than federal regulators.</p><p> The public faces put on by West Coast tech leaders have not helped.</p><p> For years, high-tech grandees dressed all in hip black while prancing around the stage, enthralling stockholders as if they were rock stars performing with wireless mics. Some wore jeans, sneakers and T-shirts, making it seem like being worth $50 billion was hipster cool.</p><p> But the billionaire-as-everyman shtick has lost his groove, especially when such zillionaires lavish their pet political candidates with huge donations, seed lobbying groups and demand regulatory loopholes.</p><p> Ten years ago, a carefree Mark Zuckerberg seemed cool. Now, his T-shirt get-up seems phony and incongruous with his walled estates and unregulated profiteering.</p><p> Of course, Silicon Valley's critics should be wary.

They piled up astronomical profits while hypnotizing both left-wing and right-wing politicians.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Conservative administrations praised them as modern versions of 19th-century risk-takers such as Andrew Carnegie and John Rockefeller. Bill Gates, the late Steve Jobs and other tech giants were seen as supposedly creating national wealth in an unregulated, laissez-faire landscape that they had invented from nothing.</p><p>At a time when U.S. companies were increasingly unable to compete in the rough-and-tumble world arena, Apple, Microsoft and Facebook bulldozed their international competition. They turned high-tech and social media into American brands.</p><p>The left was even more enthralled. It dropped its customary regulatory zeal, despite Silicon Valley's monopolizing, outsourcing, offshoring, censoring, and destroying of start-up competition. After all, Big Tech was left-wing and generous. High-tech interests gave hundreds of millions of dollars to left-wing candidates, think tanks and causes.</p><p>Unlike the steel, oil and coal monopolies of the 19th century that out of grime and smoke created the sinews of a growing America, Silicon Valley gave us shiny, clean, green and fun pods, pads and phones.</p><p>As a result, social media, internet searches, texts, email and other computer communications were exempt from interstate regulatory oversight. Big Tech certainly was not subject to the rules that governed railroads, power companies, trucking industries, Wall Street, and television and radio.</p><p>But attitudes about hip high-tech corporations have now changed on  the left and right.</p><p>Liberals are under pressure from their progressive base to make Silicon Valley hire more minorities and women.</p><p>Progressives wonder why West Coast techies cannot unionize and sit down for tough bargaining with their progressive billionaire bosses.</p><p>Behind the veneer of a cool Apple logo or multicolored Google trademark are scores of multimillionaires who live 1-percenter lifestyles quite at odds with the soft socialism espoused by their corporate megaphones.</p><p>Conservatives got sick of Silicon Valley too. Instead of acting like laissez-faire capitalists, the entrenched captains of high-tech industry seem more like government colluders and manipulators. </p><p>With the election of populist Donald Trump, the Republican Party seems less wedded to the doctrines of economic libertarian Milton Friedman and more to the trust-busting zeal of Teddy Roosevelt.</p><p>The public has welcomed the unregulated freedom of Silicon Valley - as long as it was  free. But now computer users are discovering that social media and web searches seem highly controlled and manipulated - by the whims of billionaires rather than federal regulators.</p><p>The public faces put on by West Coast tech leaders have not helped.</p><p>Ten years ago, Mark Zuckerberg seemed cool. Now, his T-shirt get-up seems phony and incongruous with his walled estates and unregulated profiteering.</p><p>Now liberals and conservatives are  beginning to ask why internet communications cannot be subject to the same rules applied to radio and television. Why can't Silicon Valley monopolies be busted up in the same manner as the Bell Telephone octopus or the old Standard Oil trust? Why are high-tech profits hidden in offshore accounts? Why does texting while driving not earn a product liability suit?</p><p>Just because Silicon Valley is cool does not mean it could never become just another monopoly that got too greedy and turned off the left wing, the right wing and everybody in between.</p><p>Tribune Content Agency</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:authorvdh@gmail.com\">authorvdh@gmail.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MRNCLN-MC0060482409</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MRNCLL2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PKK-2521-DY37-F528-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">306887</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-12-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"631\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Capital Gazette Communications, Inc.

They piled up astronomical profits while hypnotizing both left-wing and right-wing politicians.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Conservative administrations praised them as modern versions of 19th-century risk-takers such as Andrew Carnegie and John D.

Bill Gates, the late Steve Jobs and other tech giants were seen as supposedly creating national wealth in an unregulated, laissez-faire landscape that they had invented from nothing.</p><p>At a time when American companies were increasingly unable to compete in the roughand-tumble world arena, Apple, Microsoft and Facebook bulldozed their international competition. Indeed, they turned high-tech and social media into American brands.</p><p>The left was even more enthralled. It dropped its customary regulatory zeal, despite Silicon Valley's monopolizing, outsourcing, offshoring, censoring, and destroying of startup competition. After all, Big Tech was left-wing and generous. High-tech interests gave hundreds of millions of dollars to leftwing candidates, think tanks and causes.</p><p>Companies such as Facebook and Google were able to warp their own social media protocols and Internet searches to insidiously favor progressive agendas and messaging.</p><p>If the left feared that the tech billionaires were becoming robber barons, they also delighted in the fact that they were at least leftwing robber barons.</p><p>Unlike the steel, oil and coal monopolies of the 19th century that out of grime and smoke created the sinews of a growing America, Silicon Valley gave us shiny, clean, green and fun pods, pads and phones.</p><p>As a result, social media, internet searches, texts, email and other computer communications were exempt from interstate regulatory oversight. Big Tech certainly was not subject to the rules that governed railroads, power companies, trucking industries, Wall Street, and television and radio.</p><p>But attitudes about hip high-tech corporations have now changed on both the left and right.</p><p>Liberals are under pressure from their progressive base to make Silicon Valley hire more minorities and women.</p><p>Progressives wonder why West Coast techies cannot unionize and sit down for tough bargaining with their progressive billionaire bosses.</p><p>Local community groups resent the tech giants driving up housing prices and zoning out the poor from cities such as Seattle and San Francisco.</p><p>Behind the veneer of a cool Apple logo or multicolored Google trademark are scores of multimillionaires who live one-percenter lifestyles quite at odds with the soft socialism espoused by their corporate megaphones.</p><p>Conservatives got sick of Silicon Valley, too.</p><p>Instead of acting like laissez-faire capitalists, the entrenched captains of high-tech industry seem more like government colluders and manipulators. Regarding the high-tech leaders' efforts to rig their industries and strangle dissent, think of conniving Jay Gould or Jim Fisk rather than the wizard Thomas Edison.</p><p>With the election of populist Donald Trump, the Republican Party seems less wedded to the doctrines of economic libertarian Milton Friedman and more to the trust-busting zeal of Teddy Roosevelt.</p><p>The public so far has welcomed the unregulated freedom of Silicon Valley - as long as it was truly free. But now computer users are discovering that social media and web searches seem highly controlled and manipulated - by the whims of billionaires rather than federal regulators.</p><p>The public faces put on by West Coast tech leaders have not helped.</p><p>For years, high-tech grandees dressed all in hip black while prancing around the stage, enthralling stockholders as if they were rock stars performing with wireless mics. Some wore jeans, sneakers and T-shirts, making it seem like being worth $50 billion was hipster cool.</p><p>But the billionaire-as-everyman shtick has lost his groove, especially when such zillionaires lavish their pet political candidates with huge donations, seed lobbying groups and demand regulatory loopholes.</p><p>Ten years ago, a carefree Mark Zuckerberg seemed cool. Now, his T-shirt get-up seems phony and incongruous with his walled estates and unregulated profiteering.</p><p>Of course, Silicon Valley's critics should be wary. They wonder whether the golden tech goose can be caged without being killed.</p><p>Both liberals and conservatives are just beginning to ask why internet communications cannot be subject to the same rules applied to radio and television.</p><p>Why can't Silicon Valley monopolies be busted up in the same manner as the Bell Telephone octopus or the old Standard Oil trust?</p><p>Why are high-tech profits hidden in offshore accounts?</p><p>Why is production outsourced to impoverished countries, sometimes in workplaces that are deplorable and cruel?</p><p>Why does texting while driving not earn a product liability suit?</p><p>Just because Silicon Valley is cool does not mean it could never become just another monopoly that got too greedy and turned off the left wing, the right wing and everybody in between.</p><p>Victor Davis Hanson is a classicist and historian at the Hoover Institution, Stanford University and the author, most recently, of \"The Father of Us All: War and History, Ancient and Modern\" You can reach him by emailing <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:author@victorhanson.com\">author@victorhanson.com</email></p><p>- Tribune News Service</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKOK-1674B883C460E920</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F28985DF53D10B8 NWBKOK2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PMC-MBY1-DXVP-V0TM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">401975</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-10-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"900\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 The Lawton Constitution<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

They piled up astronomical profits while hypnotizing both left-wing and right-wing politicians.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Conservative administrations praised them as modern versions of 19th-century risk-takers such as Andrew Carnegie and John D. Rockefeller. Bill Gates, the late Steve Jobs and other tech giants were seen as supposedly creating national wealth in an unregulated, laissez-faire landscape that they had invented from nothing.</p><p>At a time when American companies were increasingly unable to compete in the roughand-tumble world arena, Apple, Microsoft and Facebook bulldozed their international competition. Indeed, they turned high-tech and social media into American brands.</p><p>The left was even more enthralled. It dropped its customary regulatory zeal, despite Silicon Valley's monopolizing, outsourcing, offshoring, censoring, and destroying of startup competition. After all, Big Tech was left-wing and generous. High-tech interests gave hundreds of millions of dollars to leftwing candidates, think tanks and causes.</p><p>Companies such as Facebook and Google were able to warp their own social media protocols and Internet searches to insidiously favor progressive agendas and messaging.</p><p>If the left feared that the tech billionaires were becoming robber barons, they also delighted in the fact that they were at least leftwing robber barons.</p><p>Unlike the steel, oil and coal monopolies of the 19th century that out of grime and smoke created the sinews of a growing America, Silicon Valley gave us shiny, clean, green and fun pods, pads and phones.</p><p>As a result, social media, internet searches, texts, email and other computer communications were exempt from interstate regulatory oversight. Big Tech certainly was not subject to the rules that governed railroads, power companies, trucking industries, Wall Street, and television and radio.</p><p>But attitudes about hip high-tech corporations have now changed on both the left and right.</p><p>Liberals are under pressure from their progressive base to make Silicon Valley hire more minorities and women.</p><p>Progressives wonder why West Coast techies cannot unionize and sit down for tough bargaining with their progressive billionaire bosses.</p><p>Local community groups resent the tech giants driving up housing prices and zoning out the poor from cities such as Seattle and San Francisco.</p><p>Behind the veneer of a cool Apple logo or multicolored Google trademark are scores of multimillionaires who live one-percenter lifestyles quite at odds with the soft socialism espoused by their corporate megaphones.</p><p>Conservatives got sick of Silicon Valley, too.</p><p>Instead of acting like laissez-faire capitalists, the entrenched captains of high-tech industry seem more like government colluders and manipulators. Regarding the high-tech leaders' efforts to rig their industries and strangle dissent, think of conniving Jay Gould or Jim Fisk rather than the wizard Thomas Edison.</p><p>With the election of populist Donald Trump, the Republican Party seems less wedded to the doctrines of economic libertarian Milton Friedman and more to the trust-busting zeal of Teddy Roosevelt.</p><p>The public so far has welcomed the unregulated freedom of Silicon Valley - as long as it was truly free. But now computer users are discovering that social media and web searches seem highly controlled and manipulated - by the whims of billionaires rather than federal regulators.</p><p>The public faces put on by West Coast tech leaders have not helped.</p><p>For years, high-tech grandees dressed all in hip black while prancing around the stage, enthralling stockholders as if they were rock stars performing with wireless mics. Some wore jeans, sneakers and T-shirts, making it seem like being worth $50 billion was hipster cool.</p><p>But the billionaire-as-everyman shtick has lost his groove, especially when such zillionaires lavish their pet political candidates with huge donations, seed lobbying groups and demand regulatory loopholes.</p><p>Ten years ago, a carefree Mark Zuckerberg seemed cool. Now, his T-shirt get-up seems phony and incongruous with his walled estates and unregulated profiteering.</p><p>Of course, Silicon Valley's critics should be wary. They wonder whether the golden tech goose can be caged without being killed.</p><p>Both liberals and conservatives are just beginning to ask why internet communications cannot be subject to the same rules applied to radio and television.</p><p>Why can't Silicon Valley monopolies be busted up in the same manner as the Bell Telephone octopus or the old Standard Oil trust?</p><p>Why are high-tech profits hidden in offshore accounts?</p><p>Why is production outsourced to impoverished countries, sometimes in workplaces that are deplorable and cruel?</p><p>Why does texting while driving not earn a product liability suit?</p><p>Just because Silicon Valley is cool does not mean it could never become just another monopoly that got too greedy and turned off the left wing, the right wing and everybody in between.</p><p>Victor Davis Hanson is a classicist and historian at the Hoover Institution, Stanford University and the author, most recently, of \"The Father of Us All: War and History, Ancient and Modern\" You can reach him by emailing <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:author@victorhanson.com\">author@victorhanson.com</email></p><p>- Tribune News Service</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKOK-1674C56B2F0771A8</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F28985DF53D10B8 NWBKOK2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PMD-Y6T1-JBCN-42FC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">401975</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-10-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"900\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 The Lawton Constitution<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

They piled up astronomical profits while hypnotizing  both left-wing and right-wing politicians.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">   Conservative administrations praised them as modern versions of 19th-century risk-takers such as Andrew Carnegie and John D. Rockefeller. Bill Gates, the late Steve Jobs and other tech giants were seen as supposedly creating national wealth in an unregulated, laissez-faire landscape that they had invented from nothing.</p><p>   At a time when American companies were increasingly unable to compete in the rough-and-tumble world arena, Apple, Microsoft and Facebook bulldozed their international  competition. Indeed, they turned high-tech and social media into American brands.</p><p>   The left was even more enthralled. It dropped its customary  regulatory zeal, despite Silicon Valley\u2019s monopolizing,  outsourcing, offshoring, censoring, and destroying of startup competition. After all, Big Tech was left-wing and generous. High-tech interests gave hundreds of millions  of dollars to left-wing candidates, think tanks and causes.</p><p>   Companies such as Facebook and Google were able to warp their own social media protocols and Internet searches to insidiously favor progressive agendas and messaging.</p><p>   If the left feared that the tech billionaires were becoming  robber barons, they also delighted in the fact that they were at least left-wing robber barons.</p><p>   Unlike the steel, oil and coal monopolies of the 19th century  that out of grime and smoke created the sinews of a growing America, Silicon Valley gave us shiny, clean, green and fun pods, pads and phones.</p><p>   As a result, social media, internet searches, texts, email and other computer communications were exempt from interstate regulatory oversight. Big Tech certainly was not subject to the rules that governed railroads, power companies, trucking industries, Wall Street, and television  and radio.</p><p>   But attitudes about hip high-tech corporations have now changed on both the left and right.</p><p>   Liberals are under pressure from their progressive base to make Silicon Valley hire more minorities and women.</p><p>   Progressives wonder why West Coast techies cannot unionize and sit down for tough bargaining with their progressive billionaire bosses.</p><p>   Local community groups resent the tech giants driving up housing prices and zoning out the poor from cities such as Seattle and San Francisco.</p><p>   Behind the veneer of a cool Apple logo or multicolored Google trademark are scores of multimillionaires who live one-percenter lifestyles quite at odds with the soft socialism espoused by their corporate megaphones.</p><p>   Conservatives got sick of Silicon Valley, too.</p><p>   Instead of acting like laissez-faire capitalists, the entrenched captains of high-tech industry seem more like government colluders and manipulators. Regarding the high-tech leaders\u2019 efforts to rig their industries and strangle  dissent, think of conniving Jay Gould or Jim Fisk rather than the wizard Thomas Edison.</p><p>   With the election of populist Donald Trump, the Republican  Party seems less wedded to the doctrines of economic  libertarian Milton Friedman and more to the trustbusting  zeal of Teddy Roosevelt.</p><p>   The public so far has welcomed the unregulated freedom  of Silicon Valley  as long as it was truly free. But now computer users are discovering that social media and web searches seem highly controlled and manipulated  by the whims of billionaires rather than federal regulators.</p><p>   The public faces put on by West Coast tech leaders have not helped.</p><p>   For years, high-tech grandees dressed all in hip black while prancing around the stage, enthralling stockholders  as if they were rock stars performing with wireless mics. Some wore jeans, sneakers and T-shirts, making it seem like being worth $50 billion was hipster cool.</p><p>   But the billionaire-as-everyman shtick has lost his groove, especially when such zillionaires lavish their pet political candidates with huge donations, seed lobbying groups and demand regulatory loopholes.</p><p>   Ten years ago, a carefree Mark Zuckerberg seemed cool. Now, his T-shirt get-up seems phony and incongruous with his walled estates and unregulated profiteering.</p><p>   Of course, Silicon Valley\u2019s critics should be wary. They wonder whether the golden tech goose can be caged without  being killed.</p><p>   Both liberals and conservatives are just beginning to ask why internet communications cannot be subject to the same rules applied to radio and television.</p><p>   Why can\u2019t Silicon Valley monopolies be busted up in the same manner as the Bell Telephone octopus or the old Standard Oil trust?</p><p>   Why are high-tech profits hidden in offshore accounts?</p><p>   Why is production outsourced to impoverished countries,  sometimes in workplaces that are deplorable and cruel?</p><p>   Why does texting while driving not earn a product liability  suit?</p><p>   Just because Silicon Valley is cool does not mean it could never become just another monopoly that got too greedy and turned off the left wing, the right wing and everybody in between.</p><p>  (Victor Davis Hanson is a classicist and historian at the Hoover Institution, Stanford University, and the author of \"The Second World Wars: How the First Global Conflict Was Fought and Won,\" to appear in October from Basic Books.

It's been a big success, to the extent that it's planning a move from a 6,000-square-foot space to one more than 10 times that size.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Unfortunately, when New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio announced the move, he described the new facility as a \"tech hub.\" That was unfortunate because Civic Hall's prospective new neighbors heard that phrase as a signal that giant technology companies were about to move in, raising rents and forever altering the character of the area.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"The mayor thought he sounded visionary, but the reality is that term is pejorative,\" says Andrew Rasiej, Civic Hall's founder and CEO. \"People are generally aware that technology is not working in their favor.\"</p><p>Rasiej was eventually able to assuage his neighbors' concerns, meeting with some 80 different community groups over a period of eight months. But the fact that the idea of a tech hub inspired a fierce form of NIMBYism is a reminder that the technology industry now faces political and public relations problems that it's never had before.</p><p>Scare headlines about massive data breaches have become routine. Major tech companies are continuously forced to pay fines in the millions or billions of dollars for mishandling data or abusing trust. Some of the big firms are facing investigations by the U.S. Justice Department or state attorneys general. On Tuesday, the Federal Trade Commission announced it was expanding an antitrust investigation involving Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Microsoft and Alphabet, the parent company of Google.</p><p>Politicians from both the left and the right, including Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and GOP Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri, now call for greater regulation or even breakups of big tech firms. \"They have been very irresponsible... Their behavior is shameful,\" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said about Facebook last month. \"They don't care about truth.\" More recently, Facebook and Twitter refused Pelosi's requests to take down a misleadingly edited video of her at President Trump's State of the Union address.</p><p>Civic Hall is a successful nonprofit collaborative focused on providing tech-related opportunities to low-income residents in Manhattan. It inadvertently became a lightning rod for misplaced concerns that big commercial tech was bringing all its problems to the area and would change the good things the community had going.</p><p>States and cities alike are considering legislation to protect data privacy and regulate or ban the use of facial recognition. \"Privacy concerns cross party lines,\" says New Jersey state Rep. Andrew Zwicker. \"When I'm out talking to people, I'm hearing this over and over, especially all the headlines around facial recognition right now.\"</p><p>This represents a huge change in tone from just a few years ago, when politicians seemed to believe that tech could do no wrong. At the start of the century, Congress took a free-market approach to the Internet, blocking taxes on access and online purchases. Every mayor in America led cheers for tech hubs in their towns, bragging about being home to the next Silicon Prairie or Silicon Alley or Silicon Whatever.</p><p>\"The policy of the United States seemed to be what was good for the Internet is good for America,\" Bruce Mehlman, a former assistant secretary of commerce for technology policy, said at a National Press Club forum. \"Now, it's mixed.\"</p><p>It's possible that the so-called techlash was inevitable. What were once seen as scrappy, innovative companies creating a world-leading industry have become corporate behemoths, blamed -- in part, at least, in some quarters -- for everything from election interference and the death of privacy to the spread of hate speech, misinformation and \"fake news.\" Today, there's also a generalized, if often overstated, fear that the robots are going to take all the jobs.</p><p>No one is suggesting that the tech genie can or should be put back in the bottle. If anything, the pace of innovation and the use of technology are likely to accelerate. But the tech giants themselves recognize that they can no longer expect a free ride when it comes to regulation.</p><p>\"When companies become the most important players in terms of both market cap and ubiquity in our lives, it's going to raise policy questions and it should raise policy questions,\" Mehlman said.</p><p>Decline of Trust in Tech</p><p>In an era when faith in institutions keeps reaching new lows, people are still generally hopeful about technology. Surveys indicate that more people trust tech more than other industrial sectors such as manufacturing, let alone government or the media.</p><p>People like technology and the benefits it brings, but many now worry that tech companies value profits over privacy, while also growing nervous about artificial intelligence and robots posing a threat to their own livelihoods. The share of Americans who believe technology companies have a positive impact on society has plummeted from 71 percent in 2015 to 50 percent in 2019, according to the Pew Research Center.</p><p>\"Tech has moved from a niche concern to something central to all our lives,\" says Chris Calabrese, vice president for policy at the Center for Democracy and Technology, which advocates for digital rights. \"Once that happens, it becomes enmeshed in all the other issues in our lives.\"</p><p>Students at top universities whose recent forebears dreamed of landing a job in Silicon Valley now openly express moral qualms about working there. Publications such as Slate -- once owned by Microsoft -- run articles that rank tech companies according to the \"evil\" that they do. Workers at technology companies themselves complain about facing discrimination or protest their employers' stances in areas such as human rights, defense and environmental policies.</p><p>\"The hero of this next movie is a na\u00efve, misguided child who spreads Nazi propaganda and only has imaginary friends. His name is Mark Zuckerberg,\" Sacha Baron Cohen said at the Golden Globes last month, turning an introduction of a clip from \"Jojo Rabbit\" into a swipe at Facebook's CEO.</p><p>For the public at large, there was a \"Snowden moment\" following the revelations of massive federal collection and use of data by former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden, says Lee Rainie, Pew's director of Internet and technology research. That's been followed by several similar moments, including illegal data mining of Facebook users' personal data by Cambridge Analytica during the 2016 election.</p><p>\"One of the democratic implications is that misinformation is going to take us down, that the targeted ad system is just a formula for killing off all the best parts of democracy,\" Rainie says, summarizing public fears.</p><p>People now recognize that behaviors they thought were perfectly innocent, such as liking and sharing things on social media, are not only being monetized but could potentially be used against them. The increasingly poor perception of tech companies is also driven by the fact that some of them have become enormous and powerful. It wasn't many years ago that the tech companies were viewed as underdogs against telephone and cable giants in policy fights such as the net neutrality debate.</p><p>Now, it's the tech firms that are seen as the overbearing corporate titans. The five largest companies in the country, by market cap, are all tech companies. (Not coincidentally, it's the same list of companies that are facing increased FTC scrutiny.) Everyone loves an underdog. No one likes a monopoly.</p><p>Perhaps not too many people have real concerns about the vast majority of tech firms, even large ones such as Oracle or Hewlett-Packard. They are worried about companies that look like monopolies, notably Facebook, Google and Amazon.</p><p>\"Over time, the populace has seen how much power Facebook has, and so they're trusted less,\" says Lee Tien, a senior staff attorney at Electronic Frontier Foundation, a nonprofit law firm advocating digital rights. \"It is a part of American political and general commercial culture to really not like monopolies.\"</p><p>More Regulation Is Coming</p><p>Hardly a week goes by without Congress holding a hearing on tech issues such as antitrust, privacy, misinformation and misuse of data. Members of Congress -- buoyed by support from companies including Disney and IBM -- are drafting bills that would increase the liability of content platforms for what's posted on their sites.</p><p>\"There's been a lack of regulatory oversight for a long time,\" says Calabrese, the interim co-CEO of the Center for Democracy and Technology. \"For a long time, the attitude was, this Internet thing is great and we don't want to kill it with undue regulation. That was the right decision, but it has let some problems grow unchecked.\"</p><p>States are considering a slew of bills this year to address privacy concerns. How many will pass -- or what they will look like -- remains much in doubt. Getting the balance right between protecting consumers and not harming commerce will be difficult. Lawmakers remain wary of approaches that are aimed at the big boys but might harm smaller companies in the process.</p><p>But the tech giants themselves acknowledge that they're entering into a new period where more regulation is to be expected. Last month, both the president of Microsoft and the CEO of Google called for some form of regulation of artificial intelligence. Microsoft has supported regulation of facial recognition for a couple of years now.</p><p>\"You're starting to see a recognition that some form of regulatory oversight is not just inevitable but actually welcome,\" Calabrese says. \"There's a recognition that companies big and small benefit from some regulatory certainty: You can trust our data, because we wouldn't break the law.\"</p><p>If major tech companies recognize that they might need some seal of governmental approval to win back the public's trust, it's because they've done so much to earn the skepticism in the first place, suggests Rasiej, Civic Hall's CEO.</p><p>\"There used to be this idea in Silicon Valley that you should disrupt and break things,\" he says. \"It was done in such a way that the people who were most affected by those technologies were not able to voice their concerns.\"</p><p>Alan Greenblatt</p><p>Senior Staff Writer</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:agreenblatt@governing.com\">agreenblatt@governing.com</email></p><p>___ (c)2020 Governing Visit Governing at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.governing.com\">www.governing.com</url> Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MCTBUS-20200213-1GV-How-Silicon-Valley-Went-from-Technology-Hero-to-Bad-Guy-0213-202002131GV</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">Tribune Regional KR</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y6W-CK91-DYNS-338M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">169235</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1750\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Tribune Regional News</copyright><bodyText><p>Distributed by Tribune Content Agency</p></bodyText><publicationName>Tribune Regional News</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"02\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>February 13, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Luke Schneider and his friends had a bad experience\u00a0renting a car for a golf weekend. So Schneider started\u00a0Silvercar, a next-generation car rental company that takes the hassle out of renting a car at the airport. Last week, at the 2016 International CES, the big tech trade show in Las Vegas, Silvercar announced that it had turned on its concierge-like service for renting cars in Sin City. </p><p>It also announced that it had raised another $28 million from\u00a0car manufacturer Audi[1]\u00a0to expand into other cities. Las Vegas is the 12th market that Silvercar has moved into. Austin, Texas-based Silvercar uses valet-style greeters to meet you at the airport with your car. You no longer have to take a shuttle and wait in a long line at a car rental desk. You simply drive the greeter to a nearby location, and then you're on your way. The company offers just one kind of fully loaded car: a silver Audi A4s. Silvercar said it saw its business triple in 2015, an has opened in three new cities in the past six months. Started in 2012, it now has 150 employees and has raised a total of $60 million. I took a ride with Schneider in one of his silver Audis while I was at CES.\u00a0Here's an edited transcript of our conversation. <url normalizedValue=\"http://venturebeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/silvercar.jpg\">http://venturebeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/silvercar.jpg</url> Above: Silvercar is a new kind of rental car company. Image Credit: Silvercar Luke Schneider: The whole experience is app-based. That's what the iOS app looks like, as well as Android. Soon we'll have the mobile web one, too. You do it all on your phone. You pick the location that you want, make a reservation, and when you're done, it pops up with what to do upon your arrival. You scan a QR code in the car, and the next-generation hardware \u2014 which is beginning to launch now \u2014 uses Bluetooth low-energy between the phone and the car to validate your reservation and unlock it. You jump in and go. The technology makes the whole thing seamless. Your phone pairs with the car, so you can use hands-free audio and things like that. When you bring the car back, the car calls us, essentially: 'I'm back. Here's how much fuel is left. Here's where I am.' The customer is charged for the fuel they use, plus a flat five-dollar service fee. VB: I used to go to the Black Hat conferences, and every year there's a talk on how to hack Bluetooth. I wonder how you get around that. Schneider: We're about to call for a patent on it. It's essentially AES encryption, the same that's used in Wi-Fi, 128-bit, but it's keys that you download when you make your reservation, shortly before it starts. Then they expire if you don't use them. The only way someone could hack it is if they were somehow able to acquire both the private key and the public key and come through our backend servers to get through the car. If that happened, obviously we'd know about it long before anyone got in the car. Bluetooth is a funny thing. It's come a long way. iOS's stack has gotten a lot better. iOS and Bluetooth are a component of a bigger system \u2014 hardware that mounts in the car, a cloud server that's accessed by a GSM, and the mobile technology that customers use. We have a toolkit our own concierges use, which looks like this. VB: Do you always use the phone, or is there something on the dashboard as well? Schneider: We tap into the control network of the car, which is in the trunk here. We plug straight into it \u2014 takes about four minutes to light a car up on the grid. The whole reason behind Audi taking a lead in this round\u2026When you combine the web, wireless, and mobile pieces, you create a platform. That platform is extensible. The use case that it works with here is for airport car rental, but as people consume personal transportation more and more like they consume any other category, having that platform distributed throughout vehicles so that people can use them on demand becomes more important. This is a foundational technology for them to begin a deeper foray into mobility.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://venturebeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/DSCN0641.jpg\">http://venturebeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/DSCN0641.jpg</url> Above: Luke Schneider shows how easy it is to rent a car with Silvercar. Image Credit: Dean Takahashi VB: What's involved as far as the people who work with you, who have to drive back and forth to where you keep the cars? How do you try to make that work better than the rental car business? Schneider: The joke in the industry is that once you've seen one airport, you've seen one airport. They're all different. They have different regulations. Some have rental car centers where all the companies are together. Some don't. LAX, you take the Hertz bus to the Hertz location. What we try to do is twofold. One, we design the customer experience to minimize the time between when you head off the jetway and leave the lot. A lot happens in the car rental experience there \u2014 everything from transportation to the car, going to the counter, going to a floor in the garage, waiting in line for a check as you go out, whatever. That's where we start. In the first delivery model we bring the car to you and you scan it right there at the curb. We either have our guy jump on a shuttle back or we send a chase car if we have to. Second model is you get off the plane and get a notification from us \u2014 'Welcome to SFO. Tap here when you're ready to be picked up and we'll meet you here.' You do that and it dispatches our car to come and get you. You jump in and we take you to the lot and you scan the car there, if the airport requires us to do that. The third way we've just begun piloting \u2014 the new hardware allows us to do this - is probably the fastest way you can get out of the airport. I got out of SFO in exactly four and a half minutes. We'll stage your car in short-term parking. You get off the plane and it says 'Your car is in short-term parking outside terminal 2, level D, space 18.' Get off the plane, walk out the door, down into short-term parking, see your car, scan it, jump in, and head out. The toll passes we have work with the gates at SFO and most places so you don't have to pay to get out. You just exit the airport and you're on the [highway] 101 in minutes. The app detects what airport you're at and customizes the experience for SFO versus LAX or anywhere else. When we design customer experiences, that's half the battle. It's trying to figure out how to remove all the uncertainty and inconvenience. How we differ from conventional car rental companies is you do the whole thing on your phone. We help you wayfind through the airport to your car. It's not just, 'Good luck, follow the signs and it'll be out there.' That's kind of why the customer satisfaction for the service is so high. We have about five times the net promoter score as the rest of the industry. That's largely because we take the uncertainty out of it. You always know what you're going to get. Another big piece is you're not wandering around, waiting in lines, trying to fend off the agent who's upselling you. VB: Do you calculate the average time saved? Schneider: Yeah, but it's such a wide variance. You could get in at a bad time and there's a guy with an Eastern European driver's license they're trying to validate. Or you could be the first guy off the bus. You notice people just run to the counter now. There's Hertz Number One Gold and other competing services on the loyalty front where you go straight to your car, but you still don't know what kind of car you're going to get. If you're okay with whatever they give you it's fine, but then you have to wait in line to get out of the parking area again. If you don't like what you've got\u2014The guys who founded the company got a white minivan on their golfing vacation. They might have gone back to swap it out, but that's just added time. VB: Before this, was the net promoter score [from -100-100] for the rental car industry pretty low? Schneider: Yeah. Airport car rental averages about 18 on that scale. If you add in the off-airport stuff, it goes up to about 26. Half the industry is airport and half is off-airport. Ours averages somewhere between 85 and 90, and it has done for three years as we've tripled our business each year. I learned early about customer experience design. I always felt like net promoter score is the one thing you keep your eye on. It's created a loyal customer base. That's one of the amazing things about this company. Without a loyalty program, people still love coming back. VB: Are you any more or less labor-intensive than the rental car industry? Schneider: My guess is we're less. It's harder to pull those out of their public filings, the ones that are public. But generally speaking, yeah. Our ratios are a lot more favorable. We do so much more through technology. We don't have to staff counters, or have people constantly running back and forth. We don't have people with hip-mounted printers checking you back in when you pull into the return lot. The car does all that work. From an economics perspective, we look a lot better. The cool thing about it is, because we're focused on a particular segment - we're not competing in the $9.99 a day rental space, we're up in the full-size and premium range - we can make this business perform very well at a relatively small scale. VB: This particular market, was it easy or difficult to get started? Schneider: In Las Vegas? It was pretty simple. One of the big pivots we made in the early days was to streamline the way we select real estate and design the experience for the location. We can get a location launched in a matter of weeks. We just decide where we want to go and go do it. It's really a matter of where to go. That's the question. We listen to customers about that. Las Vegas was the most-requested new location. As a result, it got the nod. The value equation is what people are starting to look at. That's what we realized. The time you save is one thing. Number two, especially in the full-size segment, the difference in the car you get \u2014 This car has a Wi-Fi hotspot in it. You can do pretty much all your connectivity stuff through it. It has satellite radio, which is kind of nice. It's also got the in-dash. It uses embedded Google multimedia interface with Google maps. You get turn-by-turn directions if you want, or just overall view. The price at the pump for gas also makes a big difference \u2014 the convenience of not having to try and find a gas station in a place you're unfamiliar with. 1 2[2] View All[3] Continue Reading

Thought leaders within digitally mature economies have long cited voice as a proponent (and enabler) of changing consumer behaviour (h/t to Siri and Alexa), but the true potential of AI and voice technology feels untapped by Silicon Valley. Regional/local players have stolen a march on Silicon Valley by working to bridge the gap faster and improve Internet access/literacy in developing economies and digitally mature regions. Few regions have shifted to adopt and implement AI technology as widely as India. </p><p>The conditions created by the ruling BJP party have allowed Indian tech companies to flourish - albeit at the expense of creating tension with international trading partners. This new confidence in regulating tech spaces has created a walled garden around India's economy; allowing local players to flourish whilst their global competitors restructure and reshuffle to comply with new policies/regulations. Reliance Industries Limited (RIL) in particular has relished the opportunity of bringing the fight to Big Tech on home turf. India's richest man has used his USD 54.8bn fortune to make multiple acquisitions across voice, AI and logistics to build a platform capable of challenging the status quo. The move makes strategic sense - India's e-commerce appetite is second only to China and, in a country where organised retail is still a rarity, the opportunity is too big to ignore. Flipkart has responded to the topography of the Indian market by doubling down on its investments within the fields of AI and machine learning. AIForIndia, a sub-division personally championed by group chairman Sachin Bansal, is set up to introduce 'intelligence at scale', according to the tagline used at Flipkart's annual developer conference. Translating business problems to mathematical equations (and solutions to these equations). The ambition from the Indian decision makers is to use AI/machine learning to tackle bigger problems than order fraud and abandoned carts. A strategy document published by government think tank NITI Aayog in June 2018 outlines an ambitious blueprint for the AI in India - one where precision farming unlocks efficiencies within agriculture and machine learning models improve congestion on motorways and railroads. Add to this manifesto Bolo, a learning app powered by Google's voice recognition technology, and India's tech-enabled future seems bright. Also Read: The holy trinity of resources a founder should have[1] 4,257 miles away in Denmark, AI technology is being primed to foster inclusivity in different ways. In a world where female voices occupy the assistant space and male voices issue commands at subway stations and road crossings, Q, the genderless voice assistant first previewed at SXSW last month, makes a statement. Created as a collaboration between Virtue Nordic and Copenhagen Pride, Q approaches the challenge of traditional bias and gender cues with a simple solution: a heavily modified voice, vetted by thousands of survey participants, that sits within the 145Hz - 175Hz gender-neutral range. As Amazon and Google prepare voice activated enterprise solutions, Q could be a great step towards erasing old stereotypes of secretary typing pools and dispelling workplace discrimination for good. These contrasting examples show now things could be done. Put AI/voice in the hands of the right people (and in the right devices), and the opportunities to enable and educate are almost endless. Virtual assistants are already equipped with the capability to help us schedule meetings, set reminders and answer our questions faster. Chatbots have been busy filling the void of cheap call centre labour for years. So why is it that Silicon Valley has been so slow to support developing markets with tech solutions to their problems? Naysayers may point to the fact that voice search and virtual assistants is powered by the potential for ROI. Valid point, but educational services (like Google India's Bolo app) should be the first stage of a long term investment strategy for all new markets. Why? Because this type of technology offers companies the opportunity to harvest a resource worth its weight in gold: user data. Also Read:Running a thriving business as a digital nomad[2] What emerging markets lack in traditional infrastructure, they make up for in device penetration. Around a third of all African mobile users have smartphones, and Asia leads the way in mobile-first access to the Internet - phones have replaced the desktop computer as the milieu for Internet access in communities where you'd be hard pressed to find a tarmac road or reliable running water. And where access to 3G signal goes, smartphones swiftly follow - creating a generation of Internet users who've leapfrogged conventional computers to go straight to mobile. Combined with a global influx of 'smart', cheap to assemble devices, consumer electronics have built the foundations for change in many developing economies (the same technology reducing everyday 'friction' for affluent consumers could help register a citizen to vote or find a doctor in their area). With the right commercial outlook, the long term benefits of this strategy to providers are obvious. Get people using you technology, create a known audience and market to them through that same technology using the customer data you just harvested. Platforms like Duo Lingo may offer an example of how to execute based on this premise. The language learning platform offers free at point of use language education by crowd-sourcing translations for large sites, who in turn translate sections of their site from English as part of its online curriculum, and offers additional monetisation of users through targeted ads. The app's scope has since expanded to offer a teaching certificate (at a pricepoint that significantly undercuts more established competitors) and an ad-free subscription model - offering onlookers an insight as to how to adapt to a 'freemium' approach in order to accommodate a business model shifting to cater for customers from all socio-economic backgrounds. With AI/voice becoming more and more intuitive, the stage is set for developing economies to benefit from the technology making our own paths to purchase faster. Market conditions (high smartphone penetration, low access to desktop devices) are ideal, but questions linger over the incentive being presented to developers to harness this potential. Now, with tangible examples of how it can be used to its full potential under its belt, AI and voice look set to fulfil their status as Next Big Thing.\u2014 Photo byPiotr Cichosz[3]onUnsplash[4]  The post How smaller players are beating the big boys at voice technology[5] appeared first on e27[6].

Now, it has set its heart on expanding even further in Africa's fastest-growing markets, making a mark on some of the biggest investment banking deals and infrastructure projects on the continent while extending its reach in mass-market mobile banking. And while it is veering away from South Africa's slower-growth and more-developed financial market, it could soon pool global and African clients with Johannesburg-based Absa.One example is the \u00e2,\u00ac250 million bridge facility that Senegal needed in January, tying into Dakar infrastructure projects. The banks ready to deploy it neatly matched the three remaining full-service international wholesale banks with most importance to Africa. On the subsequent \u00e2,\u00ac1 billion 10-year and $1 billion 30-year deal, Senegal also named BNP Paribas, Deutsche Bankand Natixis as bookrunners. But on the bridge loan \"\" which refinanced previous facilities from Credit Suisseand Afreximbank \"\" there was just one eurozone bank, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, as well as one UK bank, Standard Chartered, and one American, Citi.Of those three, SocGen appears the most ambitious bank in Africa today, particularly given Citi's lack of a retail presence and Standard Chartered's long restructuring.As a French bank, SocGen has traditionally had a strong network in the Maghreb and the euro-pegged CFA franc zones. It owns Senegal's second-biggest lender, as well as Algeria's largest private bank, and Morocco's leading foreign-owned bank. It owns Cameroon's biggest bank, and the number one lender in C\u00c3\u00b4te d'Ivoire, where a \u00e2,\u00ac1.7 billion 12- and 30-year bond followed shortly after Senegal (again, with SocGen as bookrunner).But it wants to grow far beyond these francophone markets, including east Africa and the lusophone countries. The bank has opened in nine new African countries in the past 15 years. Since 2015, it has opened in one African country a year: Togo, Mozambique (where it bought the local Mauritius Commercial Bank unit) and most recently a representative office in Kenya. Angola and Nigeria, above all, are in its sights. This is all part of chief executive Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Oud\u00e9a's vision to focus the bank on Europe and on Europe's neighbours \"\" mainly Africa.Analysts of the bank's stock in London or Paris tend to pay little if any attention to its Africa business, and when they do, they are not always enthusiastic.\"Africa adds to the complexity of the bank and is a distraction to its management,\" grumbles Guillaume Tiberghien, banks analyst at Exane BNP Paribasin London.Yet, if Africa is small today in terms of the bank's group earnings, Oud\u00e9a sees a far greater longer-term opportunity.\"I think 20 or 30 years ahead when I have Africa in mind,\" he tells Euromoney Africa.In line with the UN's estimate last year, Oud\u00e9a cites a figure of 2.5 billion people in Africa by 2050, roughly double today's population, making it a much larger proportion of the world's total: \"No other continent will have such significant demographic trends.\"He talks of the possibility for dramatic commercial expansion by the bank and its clients in Africa, owing to this demographic surge, even if he also alludes to associated social and political dangers if Africa's economic growth is not fast enough.\"Africa might be the biggest opportunity and potentially the biggest challenge for the stability and the prosperity of Europe,\" he says.  CommitmentCrucially, Oud\u00e9a thinks his bank can manage the risks in Africa, and grasp the opportunity. The bank is slimming down in some countries outside France where it does not have critical mass. For example, it announced the sale of its banks in Albania and Bulgaria to Hungary's OTP in August. Yet Oud\u00e9a has put international retail and financial services \"\" managed by his former chief financial officer and potential successor Philippe Heim \"\" at the heart of his strategy, and has specifically picked Africa for growth within that unit. <table><tgroup cols=\"1\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_2\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"632\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">-</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Oud\u00e9a, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table>Africa, as a Paris-based equity analyst notes, offers an exceptional avenue for growth for a European bank like SocGen. It holds the promise of economic expansion, in sharp contrast to the prolonged deflation in the eurozone, where traditional retail banks like the one run by SocGen are languishing.While Europe and France have too many banks and too much debt, the majority of Africans do not even have bank accounts. African countries' financing needs are already large and urgent, and are rising rapidly, as governments must build the infrastructure and the factories for a growing population of consumers and workers.Africa generates about \u00e2,\u00ac1.5 billion, or less than 10% of SocGen's net banking income. However, SocGen expects its French retail division to produce an annual revenue increase of only 1% in its latest three-year plan, announced late last year. Oud\u00e9a charged Africa with producing an annual increase of at least 8% in that plan. In the first half of 2018 the Africa division comfortably surpassed that with an 11.5% increase.Barclays' exit in 2016 and 2017 from its former 16-country-strong African business is an important development, showing how SocGen's strategy differs from that of its competitors. Standard Chartered's operating income was $2.8 billion in 2017 in the Middle East and Africa, but it has tended to show lower revenues in the latter than the former.The distance to the other French banks is even clearer. None has put Africa at the core of their strategies of late. This year, BPCE agreed to sell its banks in Mauritius and Madagascar to its 5%-owned Moroccan partner BCP (it still owns banks in Cameroon, Congo and Tunisia). Cr\u00e9dit Agricole sold its five leading banks in west and central Africa to Morocco's Attijariwafa Bank in 2008.BNP Paribasmakes about half the revenues of SocGen in Africa and is focusing much more on developing non-French northern European markets in its 2020 plan. Africa is a long-term project to ensure the sustainability of our contribution to local economic development. We can play a key role in that process -Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Oud\u00e9a, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale SocGen is not immune to the temptation to exit when there is a suitable buyer. It sold its Egyptian bank for $2 billion to Qatar National Bank in 2012, in the wake of the Arab Spring and the eurozone crisis, and at a time when SocGen needed to bolster its capital. Some analysts think it could also pull back from the odd African market where it lacks scale.But conversations with senior bankers at SocGen suggest the flight of other European banks from Africa have made it only more determined to take a contrarian position.\"Africa is a differentiating factor for us,\" says Alexandre Maymat, SocGen's head of Africa who oversees the region from Paris. \"Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale is one of only two international banks that are still developing a strong universal banking strategy in Africa.\"Oud\u00e9a, crucially, also sees SocGen's commitment to Africa as part of its social and environmental responsibilities, marking it out in sustainable finance from other big banks. SocGen is indeed important to many of the countries in which it operates and conducts wholesale banking activities. \"Africa is a long-term project to ensure the sustainability of our contribution to local economic development,\" he says. \"We can play a key role in that process.\" GrowthSocGen already figures much more prominently in Africa than in other regions of the world in transaction banking, and it seems to be gaining market share. In Euromoney's cash management survey this year, it rose to second place (behind Citi) for corporates, and rose to the top three in financial institutions. However, SocGen's position is below banks with much smaller local African networks in Dealogic's Africa investment banking revenue ranking, even excluding South Africa.Even so, and despite the example set by Citi, which comes comfortably top of the Dealogic table, SocGen is convinced that its retail network will be an important support to its wholesale bank. Focusing more on retail in Africa could help it harness deposit funding for its wholesale activities on the continent, including infrastructure financing, according to Maymat. And it will diversify its revenue streams and bring revenues from the local consumer boom to the bank directly.The African involvement of SocGen's French corporate clients, of course, is nothing new. For example, sub-Saharan Africa remains Total's second-biggest market after Europe not just in terms of oil production but also petrol stations (the latter thanks to a long-standing downstream business in South Africa).Some French corporates are diversifying and stepping up their involvement in Africa, especially in areas such as food and retail (Danone, Carrefour), infrastructure and logistics (Bouygues, Bollor\u00e9), and telecoms (Orange). Africa's demographics are becoming the basis for its greater appeal to multinationals. The attendant rise of Africa's cities and their middle classes is bolstering home-grown African corporations: clients which SocGen hopes will similarly value its base and experience in Europe.RisksNowadays, despite these attractions, other international banks are shying away from Africa, in part because of perceptions of corruption and opaque corporate governance. Tighter European and US requirements in areas such as anti-money laundering mean that for some banks, the job of ensuring compliance is too onerous to be worthwhile, especially if the resulting revenues appear relatively meagre.Sometimes such risks are hard to avoid. For example, SocGen was caught up in a Paris court's recent investigation into whether Teodorin Obiang, the son of the president of Equatorial Guinea, bought French property with public funds. Although the court did not target SocGen, in 2015 Equatorial Guinea arrested three employees of its bank there, the country's largest, for allegedly having broken local banking secrecy laws by helping with the investigation.Reuters reported that when the court convicted Obiang in his absence last year, it then criticized SocGen and Banque de France for not doing more to make Obiang aware that this use of the money would not be acceptable in France.SocGen, which has had a presence in many African countries for decades, hopes that its deep knowledge of the region can help it to keep abreast of potential threats and dangers to its business.The bank continues to do chunky deals in countries which would be unfamiliar to most banks in France, let alone elsewhere in Europe. Its 2018 tombstones include coordinating a \u00e2,\u00ac215 million committed borrowing base for Addax Petroleum in Mauritania. SocGen has a universal-banking presence in the Islamic Republic, having entered the country in 2007. It has previously financed much of Mauritania's refined-oil imports.Cathia Lawson-Hall, SocGen's head of coverage and investment banking for Africa, thinks the African bank network gives it focus and insights that other international banks looking to finance African clients would lack. The top executives of its bank in C\u00c3\u00b4te d'Ivoire, for example, will naturally be in day-to-day contact with the finance ministry there, one of the continent's most active bond issuers. \"It helps us source the deal and to know what we should avoid and run away from,\" she says.SocGen is more aware than most banks that much of Africa suffers from relatively high political risk. The Sahel region, where it owns several banks, has been particularly unstable since the Arab Spring due to jihadist activity. East Africa is definitely an area we want to develop. We're already doing more business there -Cathia Lawson-Hall, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale Loose monetary policy in Europe and the US has kept international debt flowing since the 2014 oil price crash. But the frequent lack of economic diversification \"\" especially over-dependence on oil or another single commodity for government revenues and foreign currency earnings \"\" is a risk for some of the biggest African economies, especially Nigeria.The answer for SocGen is to balance the political and economic risks through geographical spread, and the business risk by splitting revenues between retail and corporate banking.SocGen has retail banks in all but two (Kenya and South Africa) of its 19 African countries, although those two are particularly important for its corporate and investment bank. It is not present at all locally in its other most important African countries for corporate and investment banking, Angola and Nigeria. This is because of the size of clients, such as Angola's public sector, and because of group single-country exposure limits, which are related to GDP and therefore easily reached in the smaller economies where it owns banks.To further highlight the benefits of diversification, Maymat points out that economic growth in Africa as a whole was its lowest in a decade in 2017. However, he says, more than half of African countries have achieved economic growth of more than 4%, stellar in European terms. Indeed, a majority of the world's 10 fastest-growing economies are in Africa. \"The oil exporters and South Africa have mainly driven Africa's poor growth performance in recent years,\" Maymat points out.C\u00c3\u00b4te d'Ivoire and Senegal both have GDP growth in the high single digits. The former is SocGen's biggest country earner in sub-Saharan Africa. Cameroon, Ghana and Madagascar are also among Africa's faster-growing economies, and SocGen's biggest sub-Saharan Africa earners.The Maghreb has slower growth, about 3%, but occupies a long-standing place in SocGen's network, and produces relatively high earnings. Morocco accounts for about a third of SocGen's Africa revenues, with an important retail portion.Oil-rich Algeria is the bank's next biggest African profit-driver. Algeria's dominant state-owned banks capture much of the lucrative oil and gas business inside the country. But national oil company Sonatrach is an important international client. SocGen advised Sonatrach this year on the acquisition of the Sicilian Augusta refinery from ExxonMobil, to help satisfy rising demand for petrol and diesel in Algeria.SocGen is Algeria's biggest private bank, which makes it a vital partner for non-financial foreign direct investors in the country. For example, since the 2014 oil-price drop, Algerian production facilities such as a new Lafarge cement plant and Renault car-assembly unit have become even more important due to stricter import controls. Financing them commands high margins. Pan-Africa ambitionsFrancophone countries are natural targets for SocGen's French corporate clients in Africa. But all the main economies of east Africa have growth exceeding 5%, and some have a more private-sector orientation than their Francophone peers, even if Ethiopia and Tanzania are growing fastest. That is why this year SocGen opened in Kenya (the country which was also one of the oldest and most important parts of Barclays' African network).Following clients is the starting point for SocGen's new Kenya base, as businesses active elsewhere in its network have targeted expansion in the country as an east African launchpad, including the big French corporations which are active on the continent. Danone bought a 40% stake in the country's biggest dairy producer, Brookside, in 2014, in a deal with the Kenyatta family (relatives of president Uhuru Kenyatta), which retains the majority.\"It's a window we have to get to know that part of Africa better,\" says Lawson-Hall of the new Kenya office. \"East Africa is definitely an area we want to develop. We're already doing more business there.\" <table><tgroup cols=\"1\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_3\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"632\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">-</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Cathia Lawson-Hall,</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table>She points to SocGen's involvement in a recent $750 million loan for the finance ministry, increasing SocGen's recognition in east Africa. Alongside ING, SocGen also led a $230 million loan this summer for Ethiopian Airlines, making use of SocGen's aircraft financing expertise.In Nigeria and Angola, the other two main countries where it lacks a presence, the bank is as yet undecided whether to buy a bank or open a rep office, or start from scratch. After the oil-price crash, both countries are still suffering low growth. Their banking sectors need to restructure \"\" especially Nigeria's smaller banks, and Angola's big state bank BPC \"\" although they are yet to set out a clear path to do so.But it is clear that SocGen is determined to enter both countries, one way or another.There are rumours that it is selling its custody business in South Africa to Absa, the recently rebranded former Barclays Africa. Euromoney understands this would not imply a Barclays-style retreat from Africa, rather an acknowledgement that it can gain more market share outside South Africa, given the difficulty of competing with local institutions such as Absa in the continent's biggest financial sector.SocGen is exploring a corporate and investment banking partnership with Absa. Absa has been looking for such partners, including Barclays potentially, to replace the global reach it previously enjoyed when Barclays owned it, and so the international partner has local African reach. Absa handed SocGen a UK securities-services mandate for its wealth and investment management business in September, when Absa launched its new London office.A wholesale banking referral agreement with Absa could dramatically quicken SocGen's pan-African roll-out, given Absa's formerly Barclays-owned banks in east and southern Africa (but without Angola).For SocGen, whether or not the Absa partnership happens, more of a pan-African spread would be an advantage when it comes to serving Africa's increasing regional homegrown corporate champions, according to Lawson-Hall. \"If they want to go to other African countries, we are there; if they want to do deals outside Africa, we are there too,\" she says. InnovationAs part of its African retail push, late last year SocGen appointed Val\u00e9rie-No\u00c3\u00ablle Kodjo Diop \"\" until 2016 head of BNP ParibasSouth Africa's branch \"\" to a newly created position as head of innovation and alternative banking models for the Africa region.\"The challenge is to reinvent the bank,\" says the former structured finance banker. \"The model of the bank before was more about accompanying big corporates. SocGen is good at that, but on the retail side we need to go further.\"The worry is that telecoms firms and, perhaps in the future, big tech firms could make new rivals, including in the longer-term project of bringing more people into the formal banking sector. In east Africa, Vodafone's M-Pesa has been the poster child for how developing countries can rapidly extend financial inclusion, if only in payments, without the sluggish and costly expansion of bank branches.Orange, too, has already rolled out a mobile-money payments product across much of west Africa. Following the launch of Orange Bank in France last year, according to the Financial Times, Orange has applied for a banking licence in the west African CFA zone in the hope it can roll out consumer banking alongside a so-far unnamed partner. <table><tgroup cols=\"1\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_4\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"632\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">-</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Val\u00e9rie-No\u00c3\u00ablle Kodjo Diop,</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table>Under Kodjo Diop's purview, SocGen is targeting mobile phones \"\" which are much more widespread in Africa than bank accounts \"\" to provide an alternative way of nurturing Africa's retail market.Last year, partly thanks to a favourable regulatory environment, it launched Yup in C\u00c3\u00b4te d'Ivoire and Senegal, shortly before other west and central African markets including Cameroon and Ghana, and with a target of a million wallets by 2020.Yup is based on the agency model, deploying terminals in petrol stations and general stores and the like, so customers with even the most basic mobile phones can register and use it, not just those using the smart-phone app. The core-banking system and payments technology comes from French fintech Tagpay \"\" in which SocGen increased its investment by \u00e2,\u00ac2 million to reach a 19.23% stake this July \"\" and can work with any mobile provider.As in Europe, banks and other providers seem willing to lose money in the short term in the war for market share in this new frontier of finance. But SocGen thinks Yup will give a better boost to financial inclusion than other mobile-money providers, as it can do so in a manner more relevant to a wider banking proposition, so the product is not just used for transfers of cash that are ultimately stored under the mattress.\"Yup has a different operating model to address the needs of people previously outside the banking system,\" says Kodjo Diop. \"It is part of the bank, but it's not in opposition to the main brand. These are two different set-ups to address different clients.\"SocGen is better suited to the regulatory requirements of African mobile banking, as opposed to simple transfers, due to its experience as a regulated deposit-taking institution, Kodjo Diop adds. Stricter know-your-client processes will come more naturally to a bank, for example.\"Compliance will be a relative advantage for us and it's more of a challenge for the telecoms firms,\" she says. There is even scope for telecoms firms to outsource their financial products to SocGen, via Tagpay. Yup has a different operating model to address the needs of people previously outside the banking system-Val\u00e9rie-No\u00c3\u00ablle Kodjo Diop,Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale Yup already offers cash transfers, deposits and withdrawals. Credit and savings products, including payday advances, as well as international transfers, will follow. Yup can help with SocGen's wholesale clients too, offering them a cheap, cashless way to pay wages. Workers then use it to pay their water and electricity bills, top up phone credit and pay merchants.Inspired by Open Banking rules in Europe, Kodjo Diop sees Yup's future as a platform for banking and non-banking products, such as health insurance. Its innovation hub in Dakar, based in co-working premises called Jokkolabs, is already developing ways for Yup to offer these products.In C\u00c3\u00b4te d'Ivoire, Yup has even helped spread access to electricity deep into the country, via pre-payments for solar batteries, manufactured by France's EDF. It is planning to do the same in Ghana, allowing remote villagers access to power for things richer urban dwellers might take for granted, such as fridges and televisions. Bankable projectsAcross Africa, SocGen sees access to electricity \"\" and infrastructure more generally \"\" as a vital area in which it can add value in its host nations, especially on the wholesale side. As with spreading solar batteries and financial inclusion via its mobile-money platform, it all plays into SocGen's wider idea of reaping rewards from serving Africa's growing and urbanising population. <table><tgroup cols=\"1\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_5\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"632\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">-</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Alexandre Maymat,</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table>One of the main challenges for its infrastructure financing team is finding bankable projects. The regulatory framework for public-private partnerships is yet to be fully developed, says Maymat, while lower oil prices have hampered the capacity of some sovereigns to provide financial backing.Partly as a result, export credit agency-financing is a major part of SocGen's wholesale activity in Africa, and the importance of jurisdictional specifics to this business means it has sub-regional ECA specialists across the continent. One example this year is its leadership of a \u00e2,\u00ac165 million buyer credit and tied commercial loan alongside Bpifrance to upgrade the electricity network in Cameroon's biggest city, Douala.\"Access to electricity is key,\" says Maymat. \"Without better electricity infrastructure, it will be very difficult for African countries to develop their agriculture sectors, because of the lack of power for storage facilities. That's true also for the development of industry.\"SocGen's other ECA-backed deals this year include a similar \u00e2,\u00ac67 million Bpifrance-supported deal for the modernization of Angola's meteorological system. This coincides with a warming of official Angolan-French links after Angola's new president, Jo\u00c3\u00a3o Louren\u00c3\u00a7o, visited Paris in May. SocGen was also involved in a \u00e2,\u00ac109 million financing in Angola with Spain's CESCE for train maintenance this year.Weak government finances and legislative frameworks, however, also mean more demand for private-sector methods to meet the infrastructure challenge. With creaky national distribution networks, local entrepreneurs and multinationals often have to turn to building their own off-grid electricity generation capacity.\"The development of Africa won't be the same as Asia's growth,\" Maymat underlines. He does not see a Chinese-style frenzy of power-station construction, but rather a popping up of small and medium-sized projects focused on individual cities and factories. The building of captive electricity generation is therefore important if companies are to grow in size and sophistication. Local trading capacitySocGen sees a role for itself in Africa, not just for international clients, but also because it can bring in skills learnt from developed markets to Africa's own rising corporate champions. To do so, it is reinforcing coverage links between its African banks and teams based in Paris and elsewhere, while developing local product capacity.The departments of its corporate and investment bank in Paris that are most relevant to African clients all have bankers solely focused on Africa, including three people in debt capital markets, and five for natural resources and infrastructure.The job of Lawson-Hall and her team is to plug these teams into African governments, corporates and financial institutions, and not just in the countries where SocGen is present or owns banks. This includes the head of the new Kenya office, George Mutua, previously head of global corporate for east Africa at Standard Chartered. Lawson-Hall also calls on two coverage bankers in South Africa, in addition to its London-based team, for names like Investec, for which it co-arranged a \u00e2,\u00ac450 million senior unsecured term loan this year.Lawson-Hall herself speaks with the kind of native-level English that Maymat and Oud\u00e9a lack, although she is also French. She has travelled often enough to Nigeria to claim, \"I know the country almost as if I were Nigerian.\"The development of a local corporate client base has also encouraged SocGen to set up joint ventures between local African banks and its global structured financing unit: first in Casablanca for north Africa in 2013, then in Abidjan, in 2015. The latter team will double in size to 10 people this year as it becomes a structured finance hub for sub-Saharan Africa. This is a way to offer SocGen's globally competitive structuring capacity to infrastructure and natural resources projects that it might deem too small to be profitable elsewhere. Payment arrears restructurings to government are another part of these local hubs' roles.It has also established or thoroughly rewired local trading floors in Africa, with a particular bent towards hedging currencies and commodities. Typical clients might include an electricity producer seeking to hedge dollar or euro exposures, or a cement manufacturer seeking to protect against its exposure to the oil price in its purchases of fuel for its own electricity generation.The bank itself is often heavily involved in commodities trading with Africa. This year it was the sole mandated lead arranger and lender in a \u00e2,\u00ac65 million one-year pre-export finance facility for Burkina Faso's national cotton company, Sofitex.SocGen opened a new trading room in Abidjan in 2017, serving the west African CFA zone. That followed modernization of older trading rooms in Ghana and Morocco, and the establishment of a first trading operation in Algeria, both around 2015. The Casablanca operation, also serving Morocco's relatively developed local bond market, has shared management between the 57%-owned local bank and SocGen's Paris markets division.This local trading capacity is a major differentiator to rivals. Other international groups will have equally good access to euros and dollars, but trading west African currency is harder in Paris, due to the distance from the local investor community.Maymat says he is impressed with how quickly these investments in local markets rooms returned a profit for the group, with net banking income growing 20% in Casablanca and 35% in Abidjan: \"The potential demand was much higher than we forecast.\" The Africanization of SocGen Africa</p><p>Alexandre Maymat and his family were initially apprehensive about moving from a comfortable job in France, to Cameroon in 2009 for him to run Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale's bank there. It turned out to be an exceptionally good move for the alumnus of the \u00c3%ocole Polytechnique in Paris, an institution from which he graduated only a few years after SocGen's group chief executive, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Oud\u00e9a.</p><p>\"We fell in love with Africa,\" says Maymat. The continent's climate stood in particularly favourable contrast to a previous posting, in cold and drizzly Brussels, where he worked for the EU's Economic and Financial Committee before going into banking at SocGen in the early 1990s.</p><p>SocGen owns Cameroon's biggest bank, with about a quarter of the retail and corporate market. Maymat's move there happened while Europe was still suffering from the fallout of the 2008 crash. The promotion to African regional head \"\" also overseeing SocGen's banks in Lebanon and in France's overseas departments and territories, which includes R\u00e9union \"\" came not long afterwards, in 2012.</p><p>\"It's a fascinating continent, so dynamic and confident about the future, such an entrepreneurial culture. You're developing the sector in which you operate. There's so much to be done in African banking.\"</p><p>Maymat describes \"a new generation of young managers coming back from Europe and the US\". Even so, he says there are \"still too many\" French chief executives of its own banks in Africa. French bankers still oversee the majority of the banks it owns in Africa, he admits.</p><p>The proportion of expatriates in senior positions in Africa has fallen by about a third in the past five years, as the group has overhauled the boards of its local banks in Africa \"\" something Maymat thinks must go further. \"We are changing the order of things,\" he says. The development of homegrown African banks is part of the impetus: \"African managers will leave if they can't reach the top.\"</p><p>In July, Maymat appointed a new tier of sub-regional heads, most of whom are from the region, in conjunction with a project to centralize the regional IT systems in Abidjan and Casablanca. These are George Wega (Cameroonian) for west Africa; Sionle Yeo (Ivorian) for east and central Africa; Ahmed El Yacoubi (Moroccan) for Morocco; Eric Wormser (French) for Algeria, Lebanon and Tunisia; and Walid Chaouch (Tunisian) for the overseas departments and territories.</p><p>\"African people have a better understanding than Europeans about the way the banking sector is evolving, and better penetration of the local business community,\" acknowledges Maymat. \"The time when we only focused on big international clients is over. That's a less profitable business due to competition, so it's important to be strongly linked to the local business community.\" </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EUROMO-b1b61mjlc5vb8f</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EUROMO2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TJ9-36C1-JD1P-T0M5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">318063</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"5219\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Euromoney Institutional Investor PLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Euromoney</publicationName><publicationDate month=\"10\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>October 2018</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC00083FD</classCode><className>SOCIETE GENERALE SA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC0002275</classCode><className>CITIGROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC0002M0M</classCode><className>BNP PARIBAS SA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0001X99</classCode><className>CREDIT SUISSE GROUP AG</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0001YMR</classCode><className>DEUTSCHE BANK AG</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0009TCH</classCode><className>NATIXIS SA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0007HLM</classCode><className>MAURITIUS COMMERCIAL BANK LTD</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS522110 COMMERCIAL BANKING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS523110 INVESTMENT BANKING &amp;

Discovery of mobile devices, social media and other online applications raises novel issues with respect to the ways in which information is obtained and preserved. Additionally, technology-assisted review (TAR) has evolved to a point where litigants recognize its benefits in the document review process, and courts are more broadly accepting its use. Finally, global privacy concerns \u2014 and in some jurisdictions, accompanying privacy laws \u2014 will test how discovery in U.S. litigation can be reconciled with data protection requirements. </p><p>To effectively, and ethically, engage in e-discovery, practitioners must stay apprised of cutting-edge technology in this area and the associated changing legal landscape.Mobile Devices, Social Media and Text Message AppsRelevant information previously could be found in hard-copy documents physically located at a party's office or in emails and electronic documents located on a party's computers. Today, however, the exponential growth in the methods people use to communicate means that relevant electronically stored information (ESI) often resides in entirely new forms, such as on social media and text messaging apps that are hosted by third-party platforms. In addition, these communications may be made using personal devices owned by employees, who are not often parties to the litigation. A key question, therefore, is whether a corporate defendant is in possession, custody or control of relevant information stored in employees' accounts and personal devices, and thus has certain obligations with respect to preserving, and ultimate discovery of, this ESI in litigation. While courts recognize that organizations do not always have control over data in employee devices or accounts, the inquiry is fact-specific and the legal standard varies by jurisdiction. As an initial matter, the contents of users' private communications on social media generally cannot be obtained by subpoena from third-party providers such as Facebook or Twitter because the Stored Communications Act prohibits disclosure. Moreover, there may be limited access to ESI located on employees' personal devices, or those devices may be lost, destroyed or replaced. As soon as litigation is anticipated, counsel should determine both whether relevant ESI may be found in these mediums and the contours of access to this information. For example, an organization's policy regarding the use of personal devices or social media for business purposes is a relevant consideration. However, even organizations with a bring-your-own-device (BYOD) policy that allows employees to use their personal devices to conduct company business may not have access to the data in those devices absent a 'legal right' to obtain it. This may be established if employees consent or acknowledge the employer's control over business information on personal devices, company policy states that business communications 'remain the sole property' of the employer or potentially if the company pays for the data plan. Companies that have control over data on personal devices or accounts need to work with their employees to take reasonable steps to preserve ESI that is relevant, unique and proportional to the needs of the case, but employers should not be required to force or pressure employees for information. And even when companies lack control, they nonetheless have an interest in preserving relevant evidence and should inform employees of their duty to preserve as a nonparty who may be subject to subpoena.TARThe document review process also is rapidly changing as both courts and litigants become more familiar with, and accepting of, TAR \u2014 courts first began formally approving its use in 2012 \u2014 and as that technology continues to evolve. While many litigants still rely on traditional methods such as keyword searches using Boolean logic to identify potentially responsive ESI \u2014 which document reviewers then manually review \u2014 TAR continues to gain traction, particularly in complex matters with large volumes of data or in matters with especially tight discovery deadlines. The first generation of TAR, also referred to as predictive coding or TAR 1.0, uses a sampling of documents coded by attorneys to train a computer to extrapolate concepts across the remaining documents and predict whether each document in the remaining review population is responsive to the defined criteria. More recent iterations of TAR, or TAR 2.0, forego the sampling method and instead apply an 'active learning' model that uses intelligence gained from an ongoing attorney review to continuously assess the relevance of the remaining review population and reorder it to prioritize the most likely responsive documents. Under this approach, the producing party may choose to discontinue further review at a point when the likelihood of identifying additional responsive documents is statistically low. This new generation of TAR allows parties to more quickly identify the truly key documents in both outgoing and incoming productions while also realizing the benefits of having reviewed all documents ultimately produced. Under either method, the application of TAR can significantly reduce the number of documents requiring manual attorney review. Courts, too, have recognized the benefits of TAR and increasingly allow \u2014 if not encourage \u2014 litigants to consider such tools. Beyond cutting costs and increasing efficiency, courts have focused on the defensibility of the results as well as how counsel cooperate in this process. Moreover, courts have cited various studies concluding that TAR results are at least as accurate, if not more, than manual review. Indeed, several jurisdictions \u2014 including the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, New York, Illinois and Arizona \u2014 have adopted rules, pilot programs and model templates that encourage parties to discuss the use of TAR in negotiating discovery plans.Privacy and Data ProtectionTraditionally, U.S. litigation has favored broad civil discovery, permitting litigants a wide berth to explore the factual underpinnings of their cases. As a result, despite recent amendments to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure that also require discovery to be 'proportional to the needs of the case,' large volumes of both business and personal data may be swept up in production. The U.S. legal system typically addresses any resulting privacy concerns with confidentiality agreements or protective orders \u2014 and in limited instances redactions \u2014 but this approach may still result in some personal information that may not otherwise be relevant to the case being reviewed and produced. The European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which became effective on May 25, 2018, is a significant testing ground for how U.S. discovery can be reconciled with data protection requirements. Although not aimed at discovery in U.S. litigation, the GDPR impacts cross-border discovery sought in U.S. litigation because its requirements could reach parties that are foreign organizations, or domestic entities with a presence abroad, that have business operations (such as a branch office or sales representative) located in the European Economic Area (EEA). Given the global economy, this scenario is increasingly common. The GDPR addresses individuals' 'fundamental ... right to the protection of personal data.' It covers the personal data of individuals in the EEA (data subjects) and any processing of personal data either by organizations directly (data controllers) or by those acting under written instructions of data controllers. This is the case even if the entity is not located in the EEA but instead merely targets data subjects in certain circumstances. The GDPR defines personal data far more broadly than what typically is understood as personal information in the U.S. This includes identifying details of individuals that may be contained in such mundane places as the signature block of an email, a type of ESI that would be produced in many cases. The GDPR's requirements govern the processing of personal data, which must be done 'lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner' and in accordance with the data minimization principle, which requires that processing be 'adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purpose' for which the data is processed. Processing itself may encompass, at a minimum, collection, review, deletion, production and cross-border transfer of personal data. Additionally, the GDPR calls for heightened transparency and notice requirements, as well as potentially significant administrative fines for violation. As a result, its application to data involved in U.S. litigation is more than mere theory. U.S. practitioners engaging in cross-border discovery and practitioners who may handle data covered by the GDPR would be well-advised to understand the intricacies and practical implications of this comprehensive regulation. In addition, a number of other jurisdictions also have passed data protection laws that may impact the processing and transfer of covered data, including Brazil, China and Canada. Though the U.S. does not have a federal framework, California became the first state to enact comprehensive data protection legislation in June 2018, and several other states have now proposed or enacted various data and privacy protection laws. (See 'Exploring the New California Consumer Privacy Act's Unusual Class Action Cure Provision.') Moreover, privacy bills circulating in Congress are aimed at creating federal standards for online privacy and advocating greater transparency from big-tech companies toward consumers on what data is collected and how it is used. If any of them become law, they could impact the preservation, collection and production of personal information for e-discovery purposes.

There was a time when I knew exactly what would happen next. I'd hand over my card, the cashier would swipe it, a little receipt would curl out of a machine, I'd sign it, and I'd crumple the bottom copy into a pocket. Easy.</p><p><br/>Now all kinds of things can happen. I might stick my card directly into a point-of-sale (POS) system. Maybe I swipe; maybe the cashier does. Perhaps a screen is swiveled at me. I could enter my PIN on a little purpose-built machine; I could sign with my finger on a screen; I could not have to sign or enter a PIN at all. I could tap my phone on a terminal to pay. Usually, there's a chip reader for my no-longer-new chip card. When I put the card in one of the machines, sometimes it takes four seconds; other times, I have time to pull out my phone and stare at it, which means I forget about the card until the reader begins to beep at me, at which point I pull it out, mildly flustered, as if I'd caused too much ice to pour out of a soda fountain. Ah! Okay. Sorry.<br/>The act of paying for stuff is undergoing a great transformation. The networks of machines and code that let you move your imaginary money from your bank account to a merchant are changing-the gadget that takes your card, the computer that tracks a restaurant or store's inventory, the cards themselves (or their dematerialized abstractions inside your phone). But all this newness must remain compatible with systems that were designed 50 years ago, at the dawn of the credit-card age. This combination of old and new systems, janky and hacky and functional, is the <url normalizedValue=\"https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-shock-of-the-old-9780195322835?cc=us&amp;amp;lang=en&amp;amp;\">standard state of affairs for technology</url>, despite the many myths about how the world changes in vast leaps and revolutions.<br/>If some areas of financial technology, or       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fintech.asp\">Fintech</url>, promise a new elegance, the point of sale serves as a reminder of the viscosity of the everyday technologies on which most Americans rely. If you want to divine the future of transportation, you'd probably learn more thinking about the bus than the rocket. If you want to know how money is gonna change in the future, you need to look at the cash register as much as the blockchain.<br/>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/05/future-payment-systems/370902/?utm_source=feed\">The future of money-like things</url><br/>But the most powerful and ambitious companies in the world have tremendous incentive to take interest in the cash register. It's there where the two great data streams of the modern world flow together: what people do on their phones and what they buy in the physical world. In the first stream, the tech one, the rule is that data becomes money, after it is fed into machine-learning systems       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.blog.google/technology/ads/machine-learning-hands-advertisers/\">tuned to show you better ads</url>. In the other, the data is money. If these two streams fully merged, a company could have a perfect ledger of what you saw and then everything you bought. The ads would get better, so you'd buy more stuff, and in buying more stuff, you'd make the ads better. Online, Facebook (and others) can already track all kinds of activity. But about       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://ycharts.com/indicators/ecommerce_sales_as_percent_retail_sales\">90 percent of purchases</url> are still made IRL. Imagine the vast sums of money that could be made if every transaction became part of the ledger. Unsurprisingly, the big tech companies want a piece of this action-as do the banks, as do many start-ups and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://medium.com/@JJThaeler/is-ncr-divesting-aloha-pos-maybe-they-should-4090e4612c0\">established, niche players</url>.<br/>So Americans are living through what Bill Maurer, the director of the       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.imtfi.uci.edu/\">Institute for Money, Technology, and Financial Inclusion</url> at the University of California, Irvine calls the \"      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambrian_explosion\">Cambrian explosion</url> in payments.\" The \"point of sale\"-once a poky machine or just a person with a calculator or a pencil-is now a computer like everything else, tied deeply into the operations of the restaurant or store. The labor of making a payment could fall to the cashier, as in the old days, or to me, the customer, but we're both accessing a complex, evolved system of reckoning between banks and their attached remoras, feeding on whatever money ends up in the water.<br/>For your average fast-casual restaurant or mom-and-pop store, new point-of-sale systems promise easier bookkeeping, strategic business insights, and the kind of synoptic view of operations that is irresistible to managers. But to get all those analytics, those efficiencies, requires becoming part of the Silicon Valley world, with all the potential and pitfalls that entails. Players such as Square and Toast are fully technology companies, thinking about payments as a \"stack\" of different pieces of hardware and software, and they want to capture more of those layers than the banks and hardware makers of yore. Apple and Google and Amazon see locking people into their ecosystems and accumulating payment data to be as valuable as any transaction fees that can be wrung out of consumers.<br/>Which is why the biggest trends in technology-platformization, data hunger, iteration, venture-capital-backed disruption, hype-have made their way to payments. Point-of-sale systems used to change slowly, with restaurants upgrading over years or even decades. Now they can be an app on an iPad with a new UX as often as engineers can push the updates.<br/>A butcher customer using a point-of-sale machine (Marco Bello / Reuters)<br/>Even the literal way that the machines plug into one another has changed. A credit-card reader almost always used to be a standalone brick of a machine, a       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verifone\">Verifone</url> or an       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingenico\">Ingenico</url> perched on a countertop. Maybe it was tied to a point-of-sale system. Maybe it sat there alone, next to an electronic cash register or someone with a big-buttoned calculator. The Squares of the world seek to internalize all the components of a transaction into a sleek screen mounted on some futuristic enclosure. The legacy companies such as       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://cbsnorthstar.com/\">Northstar</url>and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://cayan.com/\">Cayan</url> have tried to keep pace, and new systems are proliferating as quickly as salespeople can harangue merchants into upgrading.<br/>In payments, everything is categorically more convenient than in previous decades and yet also sort of broken in new ways, which I guess makes them pretty much like everything else that has been touched by technology in recent years. The last time things changed this much, Richard Nixon was president.<br/><br/>Take out your credit card, the piece of plastic. Run your finger over its embossed characters: your name, the expiration date. The embossing is a holdover from the earliest days of charge cards, an early-20th-century invention that was generally issued by a retailer, say a department store, and looked basically like a dog tag with raised figures enumerating your account. Stick one in an imprinter, with some carbon-copy paper, and it could create a receipt for a customer as well as one for the store. When the merchant brought the receipts to the bank, they got funds deposited in their account. It was simple, but laborious.<br/>In the mid-century, banks came to take over issuing credit cards. To know if a customer's account could be drawn on to make a purchase, the merchant had to call the bank. I mean this literally: They had to pick up the phone and dial, according to David L. Stearns's       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://books.google.com/books/about/Electronic_Value_Exchange.html?id=k2tTTBOImXMC\">history of the development of payment systems</url>. And the cards only worked within one bank's system, which meant that every bank had to sign up the merchants who would accept their card. Banking was much more tightly regulated back then too, so in some states, there were only local banks. If you left the zip code, your card wouldn't work. One 1950 charge card only worked \"in a two-block radius\" of its issuing bank.<br/>California was a little looser with its banking regulations, which made it possible for Bank of America to scale up the highly successful BankAmericard throughout the populous state. It used its many retail locations to sign up merchants and sent cards to people's homes unsolicited. What they lost in fraud and unpaid bills, they made up for by taking a hefty cut from merchants for the ability to accept cards.<br/>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2011/04/this-is-your-brain-on-credit-cards/73342/?utm_source=feed\">This is your brain on credit cards</url><br/>By the mid-1960s, other banks began to launch widely used credit cards. But what would happen if the bank issuing the card was different from the merchant's bank? There wasn't a way to exchange those funds. And what about traveling to different cities, let alone states or countries? The banks knew they needed a way to authorize transactions and exchange money with each other. So they developed new systems of cooperation, which became known as Visa and Mastercard. The card networks allowed someone whose bank was in San Francisco to use their card in Los Angeles or Louisiana or La Paz. This is so basic to how money works now that it seems like it always existed. It is such an ordinary miracle, like photosynthesis, that it's only when you slow down to explain it, as if to an alien or a child, that it becomes striking, even amazing.<br/>The prophet of this new system was Dee Hock, then a local banker whose branch had become a licensee of the BankAmericard. Hock became a central figure in knitting together the banks, not just technically, but through the organization he helped create, Visa.<br/>Hock believed that Visa was the embodiment of a new type of decentralized organization, one that would help usher in what he called the \"chaordic age.\" He realized,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.deewhock.com/#biography\">he wrote</url>, that \"everything was changing with accelerating speed\" and the world needed a new kind of institution on the same level as the \"nation-state, corporation, and university.\" The answer, as he saw it, was in the \"chaord,\" \"the behavior of which harmoniously blends characteristics of both chaos and order.\"<br/>To create the \"chaordic organization,\" core notions and oppositions would have to be discarded, Hock contended. \"What if the very concept of separability (mind/body-cause/effect-mankind/nature-competition/cooperation-public/ private-man/woman-you/me) is a grand delusion of Western civilization, epitomized by the industrial age; useful in certain scienti\u00ef\u00acc ways of knowing but fundamentally \u00ef\u00ac\u201aawed with respect to understanding and wisdom?\" Hock wrote.<br/>Hock was not a philosopher, a countercultural icon like Stewart Brand, or some theorist at the       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.santafe.edu/\">Santa Fe Institute</url> (      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/27333/trillion-dollar-vision-dee-hock\">although he did speak there</url>). He was the first CEO of Visa, which he called a \"transcendental organization linking together in wholly new ways an unimaginable complex of diverse institutions and individuals.\" It did this by emptying out the old idea of money as \"hard\" currency, bills and paper checks and gold, subbing in a new definition of money: \"alphanumeric data in the form of arranged energy,\" bits in a computer. And using this idea, Visa built a new standard for computers to talk about money-      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#isstd:iso:8583:-1:en\">now known as ISO 8583</url>. Like       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Protocol\">Internet Protocol</url> or       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://press.princeton.edu/titles/10724.html\">containerization</url>, this low-level agreement on how to move things around the modern world came to organize vast swaths of economic activity. Put all three of these late 1960s innovations together and you have the infrastructure of globalization.<br/>\"Visa provides an infrastructure ... in which multiple competing financial institutions can cooperate, just enough, to provide a service that none could have realistically provided alone,\" Stearns wrote. \"In short, Visa makes money move.\"<br/>Visa wasn't the only such organization. A different consortium of financial institutions banded together into Master Charge, which became Mastercard. Then those systems learned to work together (perhaps too well, according to retailers who have       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-visa-mastercard-settlement-idUSKCN0ZG21E\">long-running antitrust litigation against the companies</url>).<br/>But there was one other key step in creating the modern point-of-sale system. Flip your card over now. Take a look at the magnetic stripe toward the top. It's what made your card machine-readable. The system was       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/hardware/the-long-life-and-imminent-death-of-the-magstripe-card\">developed by IBM in the late 1960s</url>, and according to       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/hardware/the-long-life-and-imminent-death-of-the-magstripe-card/the-magstripe-era-ends\">one of its architects</url>, \"The original information standards-the way the data is physically laid out on the mag stripe-has survived every migration of transaction media, from mag-stripe cards to smart cards, from smart cards to smartphones.\"<br/>The stripe itself is not unlike the tape in the cassettes you put in a boom box. But instead of encoding music in a form that can be played back from your shoulder, that little strip of iron oxide contains your account number. Swiping it through a reader plays it back. That's why Square's original card reader was designed attached to the headphone jack: The whole device merely sent the signal from the audio read head to the mic input, and then the app could take it from there. (Some beautiful nerds       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKSDs8XgOLA\">took advantage of this capability</url> and converted the Square reader into a kind of instrument.)<br/>\"The payment card is merely an access device, a means for identifying the cardholder to the vast electronic financial network that lies behind it,\" Stearns wrote in an essay in       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/paid\">Paid: Tales of Dongles, Checks, and Other Money Stuff</url>. Your card is a fob for walking into the vast digital storehouse where the \"alphanumeric data\" formerly known as money is kept.<br/><br/>From the very beginning, American credit cards have been relatively insecure. If Square can build a dirt-cheap way to read your credit card, so can fraudsters who built devices called \"      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/all-about-skimmers/\">skimmers</url>\" which can steal the data off cards, reencode it onto a new one, and, voila, someone is swiping their way around with your account. You might think your signature is a security measure, but it's       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/08/business/credit-card-signatures.html\">basically theater</url>. The only real security in the system is on the network level, where banks process transaction data to look for \"suspicious activity.\"<br/>Chip-card technology-      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://squareup.com/townsquare/why-are-chip-cards-more-secure-than-magnetic-stripe-cards\">known as EMV in the industry</url>-is more secure. The data can't be easily skimmed from the chip, as it stores important information in an encrypted format. For these reasons, it's been standard in Europe for more than two decades. But not in the United States.<br/>Paying with a chip card (Michalis Karagiannis / Reuters)<br/>Some of that was timing. One, if you installed a brand-new system in the 1970s, you probably didn't want to buy all new hardware in the 1980s. Two, swiping is super fast and super easy. \"Swiping is a really good experience,\" said Jesse Dorogusker, the head of hardware at Square. \"It sets a really high bar for convenience and speed.\" Even if Square can spend the development resources to get its chip-card processing down to three seconds, other systems might take much longer-try counting, you might get to 10 or even 12 sometimes. \"It makes for an inconsistent ecosystem,\" Dorogusker said. Three, IBM, the developer of the mag-stripe card, was in the database business, so promoting more back-end data processing seemed like a good idea to them.<br/>And so, authorization and fraud detection took place in the bank's mainframes, while the reader and the card were basically dumb access devices hooked up to a network. This was convenient for customers, but if you were a merchant, not only did you need a special account with a bank that allowed you to transact with cards, but you also had to deal with the whole front-end to that system. As Lana Swartz, a       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://llaannaa.com/index.html\">media-studies professor</url> at the University of Virginia and the co-editor of Paid, said to me, in the era before anyone was on the internet, accepting cards required \"putting a modem in your shop, maintaining this dial-up thing, maintaining swipe equipment, dealing with errors.\"<br/>This gave rise to the POS industry as we now know it. The banks were not going to develop and service the ecosystem of hardware and modems necessary to accept credit cards, and so a whole constellation of businesses rose up to offer these services to mom-and-pop players. Over decades,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.pymnts.com/in-depth/2014/showdown-at-the-pos-ingenico-versus-verifone/\">Ingenico (mostly in Europe) and Verifone (mostly in the U.S.)</url> came to dominate the actual payment hardware, and different point-of-sale hardware and software systems took over different niches. Then middlemen called Independent Sales Organizations, or ISOs, popped up to simplify the complexity of this world for someone who just wanted to sell futons or run a hamburger shop. They created whole packages of card-processing machines, POS systems, and accounts, which they'd roll up into a \"solution\" for individual merchants, and they also become responsible for assuming the risk of bad transactions. In other words, the ISOs are the complex, sometimes essential, sometimes shady layer between your corner bodega and the world of global finance.<br/>The point of sale, to this day, is shaped by what these companies offer. Philip Parker, who runs cardpaymentoptions.com, has dedicated the last decade of his life to figuring out what a merchant should do, faced with these realities. When he was in college, he got hired by an ISO, and when he started going into stores, he'd get run out by merchants angry at the last ISO guy who screwed them. \"These business owners would be yelling at me, 'I've already been burned by you guys one time!'\" Parker told me. Basically, if you got laid off from the used-car-sales lot, this industry might be your next gig.<br/>Parker has now reviewed dozens of different card-payment systems from all kinds of different companies. There is huge variability in the fees that merchants have to pay, he told me, not just based on their systems but the cards that customers use. According to Cayan, a provider of point-of-sale equipment,      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://cayan.com/credit-card-processing\">there are</url> \"more than 700\" different rates for different cards, transaction types, retail environments, and other factors. \"My belief is that the confusion and complication are there on purpose because it allows these financial institutions and ISOs to make more money and charge more without anyone understanding what's happening,\" Parker said.<br/>It's dizzying. The contracts ISOs have merchants sign also slow down the speed at which restaurants upgrade their equipment. They can get locked into multiyear leases on the one hand, and on the other it can be such a hassle to get the point-of-sale equipment set up that once it's working, they don't want to mess with anything.<br/>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2017/11/future-retail/546119/?utm_source=feed\">The future of online retail is offline</url><br/>Josh Bays, a San Francisco resident, has worked in retail and restaurants for the past decade. One place he works uses Square. The other uses a legacy system that runs off Windows 95. \"It runs about as slow as you'd expect,\" Bays told me. \"It's a four-hour ordeal to add potato salad to the menu.\"<br/>But the owners don't want to change that system out for something new and potentially better. \"They know it will continue to work for as long as the hardware does,\" Bays said. Whereas with a new system, they'll be on the hook for a lease. \"It's kind of analogous to how Adobe doesn't sell Photoshop anymore. They sell a license,\" he said. \"You never actually own anything.\"<br/>Even the chip readers, which would presumably reduce fraud, don't always seem worth the investment to small-business owners. \"There is nowhere I've ever worked where the management says, 'I want to invest in infrastructure,'\" Bays said. So they do it when they have to or when they finally get around to it.<br/>The point of sale at Macy's (Andrew Kelly / Reuters)<br/>There are now       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://financesonline.com/20-best-pos-systems-for-restaurants-comparison-of-solutions/\">dozens of point-of-sale systems</url> offering different kinds of payment integrations and experiences. At their best, they integrate a whole restaurant's or store's business. They make it possible to take online orders and simplify accounting. They can keep track of important customers and offer them incentives. At worst, they present unwanted complexity, new problems, and the disruption of systems that worked.<br/>\"It's all kind of a complete mess,\" said Maurer, the anthropologist. \"There are so many different systems. So many different POS manufacturers each promising different services. So many different payment systems and protocols.\"<br/>It's not just outside scholars who have taken this position. The Aite Group, a financial-services research firm, found       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.aitegroup.com/report/evolution-point-sale-terminal-survival-smartest\">in a 2017 report</url> that the POS is moving from \"a highly concentrated industry\" into one that's wilder, a \"new reality of an open ecosystem facilitating innovation and competition.\"<br/>Even the legacy industry-standard POS system for restaurants, NCR's Aloha, would like to be known as something more. \"The way we've been talking about Aloha in the last few years is as a platform of sale,\" said Jon Lawrence, a senior director at NCR. \"It's more than a play on words: If you think about what Facebook has done, or Uber or Airbnb, these are software platforms that have helped transform industries.\"<br/>This is a crazy world that requires hundreds of thousands of small businesses to work through hundreds of vendors to reach thousands of banks. Every company is trying to extract some bits (of data, of money) from every single transaction, building fortunes out of pennies. That's why Google Pay and Apple Pay didn't take off like Facebook or Uber. There are just too many human hands reaching for pockets that need to get on board.<br/>And it's into this environment that Silicon Valley companies-and other VC-backed start-ups like Boston's Toast-have plunged. Square could hack the technology of the credit-card reader, but the greater system's complexity affords no elegant solution.<br/>So, the next time you're waiting for the chip-card reader to beep at you, consider that money has been data for a long time, arranged energy, but like every other part of the world that software is digesting, the gap between the mega-trend and the lived reality is where the money is made.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ATLNOL-whensoftwareatethepointofsale565919</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ATLNOL2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SWS-8CS1-JCG7-V2PR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">414070</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-07-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3520\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Atlantic Monthly Group, Inc.

Those first incantations of the sweeping \"smart city,\" so technologically utopian and Tomorrowland-ish in design? The concept and solutions were pitched by tech titans like IBM and Cisco, cost obscene amounts of money, and promised equally outlandish levels of innovation.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It was a drive -- as idealistic as it was expedient -- to spark a new industry that infused cities with data, analytics, sensors and clean energy. Two-and-a-half decades later, the smart city market has evolved. Its solutions are more pragmatic and its benefits more potent. Evidence brims in Singapore, where officials boast that they can predict traffic congestion an hour in advance with 90 percent accuracy. Similarly, in Chicago, the city has embraced analytics to estimate rodent infestations and prioritize restaurant inspections. These of course are a few standouts, but as many know, the movement is highly diverse and runs its fingers through cities and across continents.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And yet what's not as well-known is what's happened in the last few years. The industry appears to be undergoing another metamorphosis, one that takes the ingenuity inspired by its beginnings and reimagines it with the help of do-it-yourself entrepreneurs.</p><p>Homegrown Remedies</p><p>Yes, startups have found their way into the smart city stream. Author Anthony Townsend captured a glimpse of the shift in his 2013 book Smart Cities.</p><p>\"Unlike the mainframes of IBM's heyday, computing is no longer in the hands of big companies and governments ...\" Townsend writes. \"All over the world, a motley assortment of activists, entrepreneurs and civic hackers are tinkering their ways toward a different kind of utopia.\"</p><p>That push has mobilized entrepreneurs who've taken today's tech -- easier to manage and cheaply available -- and fastened it to an assembly of government infrastructure. Townsend lists the smartphone, the cloud, low-cost broadband, open data and open-source technologies as the prominent enablers. Like its gadgetry, the definition of smart city tech has also undergone change.</p><p>Shaun Abrahamson, founder of the smart city startup investment group Urban.us, is a thought leader in the new ideology. His definition, which parallels Townsend's, includes traits characteristic of industries like civic tech, govtech, the Internet of Things and the peer-to-peer sharing economy. Sheer growth has impelled an escape from the yesteryear brochures promoting big data and sensors.</p><p>Asked for a definition, Abrahamson centered his interpretation on tech that enhances quality of life. With the possible exception of health care, finance and education -- systems large enough to merit their own categories, Abrahamson explains smart cities by highlighting investment areas at Urban.us. Specific areas are packaged as follows:</p><p>Mobility and Logistics: How cities move people and things to, from and within cities.</p><p>Built Environment: The public and private spaces in which citizens work and live.</p><p>Utilities: Critical resources including water, waste and energy.</p><p>Service Delivery: How local governments provide services ranging from public works to law enforcement.</p><p>\"What seems to be unique about our perspective is that we don't only focus on what is sold to local government, but also products and services offered to businesses and consumers,\" Abrahamson said.</p><p>Elaborating, he held up the issues of climate change and greenhouse gas emissions for inspection. Cities can attempt to make significant dents with policy. They can regulate emissions in transportation and control HVAC efficiency in buildings. However, sizable breakthroughs often come from businesses and citizens. Essentially the idea he underscores is that those who consume the most control the most. One example of the concept in greenhouse gas emissions would be transportation network companies like Lyft and Uber. Atypical of the smart city branding, these companies nevertheless stand at a point of impact. By taking cars off the roads, their tech may have greater effect on emissions than the hallmark energy regulating sensors or big data solutions.</p><p>\"Their actions have a larger overall effect on improving city life. So we think it's essential to include products sold to businesses and consumers,\" Abrahamson said.</p><p>Within his amplified definition, Abrahamson said former startups to first break into the smart city movement were successes like Uber, Palantir, Nest, Waze, Opower and the neighborhood social media provider Nextdoor.</p><p>The Startups</p><p>There probably hasn't been a better visual for the scene since the last Smart City Startup Summit last spring. Under a Miami heat, Urban.us drew a mishmash of 100 promising startups to the city's Wynwood Art District for discourse and demos. Notable Investors like Google Ventures, Omidyar Network and BMW Ventures were out to scout prospects, all while crowds swarmed and startups coaxed with business cards and brochures. It was a pandemonium of a pleasant sort, with tech ranging from smart benches and filtered water stations to transit mapping apps and video traffic analytics.</p><p>At a booth of his own stood Curtis Tongue, co-founder of Ohmconnect, a startup launched in 2013 that partners with utilities and energy markets to award cash to energy-conscious consumers. Like so many of the startups that day, Ohmconnect arrived to pitch its niche offerings. Tongue and co-founder Matt Duesterberg showcased an app that allows utility providers to reduce dependence on what energy aficionados call \"peaker plants,\" dirty and expensive reserve power plants utility providers jump to during peak usage periods. Utilities loathe them for their exasperating costs that crank wholesale prices up from around $40 per MWh to a sizzling $1,000 per MWh. Environmentally the plants are similarly ghastly, doubling or tripling the average plant's carbon dioxide emissions.</p><p>To solve this problem, the app crunches individual consumer data and alerts users via text when they're on dirty power; the savings -- minus a small commission -- is then paid back annually to consumers. This amounts to about $50 to $150, cash that can be kept or donated to charitable causes. The service even automates decreased usage when coupled with smart thermostats like Nest that adjust remotely.</p><p>\"The most exciting part is that not only are our users making a positive environmental impact, but also they are putting the value they've generated to positive social impacts as well,\" Tongue said, noting how some groups are on track to raise more than $10,000 for local schools.</p><p>As with a swath of smart city startups, the zeal to mingle entrepreneurialism with urban environmentalism has required a swivel of strategy. Government contracts are too complex and slow to command exclusivity and this -- as Abrahamson observes -- turns most entrepreneurs to consumers.</p><p>Of business models, the field is a relative Easter egg basket. Ohmconnect draws revenue through commissions from consumers. The smart irrigation startup Rachio sells irrigation controllers via distributors like Amazon or Home Depot. The housing retrofitter Blocpower earns from utilities paying for energy conservation, and Radiator Labs markets its smart radiator thermostats to building managers and consumers alike.</p><p>\"It's not clear that there are dominant business models, as much as an interesting mix of who pays, and what they pay for,\" Abrahamson said.</p><p>Investment and Growth</p><p>From green energy to green bills, investment opportunities are sprouting beyond philanthropic causes. A report published in February from Navigant Research forecasts the global smart city technology market will rocket from its $8.8 billion annual valuation in 2014 to $27.5 billion by 2023.</p><p>Population is a chief contributor to the growth. Townsend's research indicates that in 2009, city populations officially eclipsed their rural counterparts. The milestone marks the advent of a new era in urbanization, with city populations forecast to increase from 3.5 billion today to 6.5 billion people in 2050 and 10 billion by 2100.</p><p>In comparative terms, what this looks like in developing nations -- where most of the influx is happening -- is construction of a Chicago-sized city each year in India, and in China, officials calculate building 20 new cities yearly through 2020 just to accommodate rural migrants, tallied at about 12 million per year. Technology, Townsend said, is where governments go to and what big tech companies see as an Industrial Revolution-sized opportunity.</p><p>In the rush, smart city startups aren't assumed to be competition disruptors. Abrahamson doubts any shakeup as top sellers. Rather startups, he said, are more likely to see investment from the corporate world or other mutually beneficial partnerships. Currently Navigant identifies the top five vendors in the space as IBM in first, followed by Cisco, Schneider Electric, Siemens and Microsoft.</p><p>\"Most of the largest IT firms interested in smart cities have a variety of mechanisms to partner with and invest in startups,\" Abrahamson said. \"This usually means Series B or C Stage funding  -- and that's after these companies are a few years old and have significant customer traction.\"</p><p>What's been different in the last few years is a trend of early interest by big tech companies and venture firms. Abrahamson has noticed prospecting venture firms taking interest in startups as early as a Series A funding round or during seed funding.</p><p>\"More often this is about investment [analysis] and gaining an earlier understanding of emerging trends and key players ...,\" Abrahamson said. \"I expect we will see more distribution partnerships as well as mergers and acquisitions activity as the startup ecosystem becomes an important part of the product pipeline for some of the best-known smart city vendors.\"</p><p>A sampling of a few corporate venture firms vying to invest are Google Ventures, Motorola Ventures and BMW Ventures. Others, piqued but still cautiously probing, are Verizon, Telefonica, Cisco and IBM, which have all launched contests or accelerators as barometers for investment.</p><p>Jason Shueh  --  Staff Writer</p><p>Jason Shueh is a staff writer for Government Technology magazine.

While equity is still broadly appealing, with the S&amp;#38;P 500 still within striking distance of its all-time high, the typical market leaders have yet to mount a convincing comeback from September's bout of heavy selling, and the rest of the market is feeling the pressure. Although the ongoing global pandemic has played a key part in impacting the market at large, that crisis has been given a new dimension with the potential uncertainty represented by the upcoming national election. Not only will the final results of the absentee and mail-in voting process likely take weeks or even months to derive, but the potential of a contested election means the results will also occupy the Federal government from acting on other pressing issues like enacting further business stimulus or orchestrating its response to COVID-19. This uncertainty has made the performance of the market and individual equities extremely difficult to anticipate. Using artificial intelligence and predictive analysis tools, trading platform VantagePoint will be analyzing this unpredictability among several stocks in an upcoming live demonstration of its software[1]. Prior to this virtual demo, and with only weeks until the actual election day, let's take a look at some of the key market constituents that are currently feeling the impact of the 2020 election cycle what might be in store for them in terms of further volatility or opportunity.Big Tech's Big RiskPerhaps the most telling indicator of the market's current atmosphere of unknowing, major tech and internet components like Apple Inc.</p><p>(NASDAQ: AAPL[2]), Facebook, Inc. (NASDAQ: FB[3]) and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN[4]) have wavered through recent weeks after a dramatic post-earnings spike. Although the perspective among market analysts and commentators is that the tech segment was letting off steam following its path to precipitous new highs, the segment has so far been unable to recapture the same enthusiasm it saw through the summer. Despite being unable to break out of this trough, these stocks have fluctuated wildly from one day to the next, with Apple seeing daily swings of 3% and Amazon experiencing 5% in the waning days of September. Learn how predictive A.I. can help you time the market, reserve your spot now[5] While it's not impossible to imagine big tech finding new life in the weeks leading up to the election, the industry has been a big target for potential scrutiny and controversy in the public sphere given the array of political issues that have surrounded the major players in recent years. Foreign election meddling and data collection threw a pall over Facebook share in the aftermath of the 2016 elections, and questions of anti-consumer and anti-competitive behavior within the tech sphere have only become more prevalent, particularly among the Democratic party which is seen as potentially making big gains in November according to consensus polling data. Threats of regulating or breaking up tech giants like Facebook, Amazon or Google parent company Alphabet, Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOG[6]) (NASDAQ: GOOGL[7]) have been floating around Washington D.C. for months. Although the actual implementation of any regulation would likely be slow in coming should Democrats have a strong showing, that alone might be enough to spook Wall Street in the weeks surrounding the election.Looking For LeadersBecause of the volatility that has persisted in the tech segment and the uncertainty that lies ahead, the broad market has been bereft of decisive leadership through September. The pharmaceutical and biotech space was previously another area of strength in the market through the summer months as a result of the ongoing race for a safe and effective vaccine for COVID-19. However, the healthcare sector has been muted through September, with mixed unclear messages about the progress trials from Moderna Inc. (NASDAQ: MRNA[8]) and Johnson &amp;#38; Johnson (NYSE: JNJ[9]). With potential news of the Pfizer, Inc. (NYSE: PFE[10]) vaccine trials expected just days before the election[11], the sector could see either political party latch onto the news and spur greater speculation in the sector. Sign up to see what industry-leading forecasting technology can do for your portfolio[12] But even though the market is struggling to find direction as the election looms, there are isolated segments of the market that have been resilient to volatility impacting higher-profile industries. Delivery companies in the transportation sector like FedEx Corporation (NYSE: FDX[13]) and UPS, Inc. (NYSE: UPS[14]) have surged due to rising shipping rates, while retail stocks like Walmart Inc. (NYSE: WMT[15]) and The Kroger Co. (NYSE: KR[16]) benefit from consistent consumer trends. What these industries have in common is that they are largely agnostic in relation to the threat of a contentious or contested election, and traders have so far put their faith in their continued resilience. While the coming weeks and months will likely provide further surprises for these industries and the market at large, traders may be able to find opportunity in the confusion by looking to overlooked areas of the market and leveraging technology to cut through the daily market noise.  2020 Benzinga.com.

Facebook said there was no intentional systemic effort to suppress conservative stories, but admitted contractors could have acted on their own biases.</p><p>The following year, Google engineer James Damore wrote a letter criticizing the company's \"politically correct monoculture\" and argued gender gaps in the industry were a result of biological differences.

The HBO show \"Silicon Valley\" recently poked fun at tech's liberalism with an episode that replaced the experience of coming out as gay with coming out as Christian in the Bay Area. In the Trump era, Silicon Valley is being accused of not reflecting or being welcome to conservative values or thought, like Hollywood before it.</p><p>But many of these companies have made efforts both publicly and privately to reach out to conservatives.

In late November, Angus attended a hearing in British Parliament in which representatives from nine countries took turns interrogating a Facebook vice president about the company\u2019s proliferating scandals (an empty chair sat before a Mark Zuckerberg nameplate, marking the chief executive\u2019s absence).</p><p>For Angus, fake news and data-based manipulation \u2014 exemplified by the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/17/us/politics/cambridge-analytica-trump-campaign.html\">shadowy work of Cambridge Analytica</url>, whose voter-profiling scheme is often cited as an important factor in Donald Trump\u2019s 2016 victory \u2014 were mere symptoms of a larger malady. \u201cThe problem is Facebook,\u201d he       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJZ6CBTuIyk\">declared</url>. \u201cThe problem is the unprecedented economic control of every form of social discourse and communication.\u201d It was one of Angus\u2019s colleagues, the Canadian member of Parliament Bob Zimmer, who       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://parliamentlive.tv/Event/Index/3a4aa6e1-058c-4c88-9648-b94b26ebcef5\">ma</url>y be the one who gave the problem a name: \u201cSurveillance capitalism,\u201d he said, with its vast concentrations of data and influence over human life, required new laws and new forms of regulation.</p><p>Both Angus and Zimmer were right, but before we can establish a firm legislative or regulatory agenda, we have to learn what surveillance capitalism is, as we come to terms with the novel form of economic and social power represented by Facebook, Google and a handful of other tech behemoths privy to our every click and utterance. Enter, as a critical guide, <url normalizedValue=\"https://shoshanazuboff.com/\">Shoshana Zuboff</url>, who has emerged as the leading explicator of surveillance capitalism. A Harvard Business School professor emerita with decades of experience studying issues of labor and power in the digital economy, Zuboff in 2015 published a paper, \u201c      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2594754\">Big Other: Surveillance Capitalism and the Prospects of an Information Civilization</url>,\u201d which has since become an essential source for anyone looking to reckon seriously with what she described as a distinct, emerging economic logic. Now she has followed up that paper with a doorstop of a book, an intensively researched, engagingly written chronicle of surveillance capitalism\u2019s origins and its deleterious prospects for our society.</p><p>According to Zuboff, surveillance capitalism distinguishes itself from its industrial forebear as \u201ca new economic order that claims human experience as a free source of raw material.\u201d We are the resource to be mined; the billion-dollar profits of Facebook and Google are built on a general accounting of our lives and everyday behavior. But surveillance capitalism is also many other things: \u201ca parasitic economic logic \u2026 a rogue mutation of capitalism \u2026 a new collective order based on total certainty\u201d and \u201can overthrow of the people\u2019s sovereignty.\u201d All this may sound a little heady, like perhaps an overseasoned stew of po-mo economic jargon, but Zuboff will have you asking for another helping long before the book\u2019s end.</p><p>Surveillance capitalism depends on the constant gathering of \u201cbehavioral surplus,\u201d or the data exhaust that we produce as part of the normal course of web browsing, app use and digital consumption. All of it is potentially revealing, allowing companies to make sophisticated inferences about who we are, what we want and what we\u2019re likely to do. As the economist <url normalizedValue=\"http://people.ischool.berkeley.edu/~hal/\">Hal Varian</url> noted in 2002, \u201cEvery action a user performs is considered a signal to be analyzed and fed back into the system.\u201d That means that there is potentially no end to a surveillance capitalist\u2019s extractive appetite, which is why \u2014 in the name of more efficient services and relevant ads \u2014 companies are constantly pursuing new, more granular data streams in our homes, workplaces and bodies. Unlike oil, to which it\u2019s often compared, personal data is potentially limitless, but its extraction and consumption may be just as toxic, as we\u2019re only beginning to understand.</p><p>Under the regime of surveillance capitalism, it is not enough simply to gather information about what people do. Eventually, you have to influence behavior, beyond the simple suasion practiced by targeted ads. It\u2019s not about showing someone the right ad; you have to show it at the right place and time, with the language and imagery calibrated for precise effect. You have to lead people through the physical world, making them show up at the sponsored pop-up store or vote for the preferred candidate. Armed with a veritable real-time feed of a user\u2019s thoughts and feelings, companies are beginning to practice just this kind of coercion, which is why you might see makeup ads before a Friday evening out or why inducements from a personal injury lawyer might pop up on your phone as you sit in a hospital waiting room. When we want things \u2014 health information, travel schedules, a date \u2014 is also when we are most vulnerable, when intimate data yield themselves for corporate capture. \u201cThe result,\u201d as Zuboff notes, \u201cis a perverse amalgam of empowerment inextricably layered with diminishment.\u201d We seem ever more exposed to and dependent on surveillance capitalists, our benevolent info-lords, but their operations are defined by opacity, corporate secrecy and the scrim of technological authority.</p><p>In the face of all this, Zuboff sees a disastrous overturning of the traditional capitalist order. We are being pushed \u201ctoward a society in which capitalism does not function as a means to inclusive economic or political institutions.\u201d With statements like these, Zuboff threatens to lose those readers who don\u2019t share her regard for a bygone halcyon era of industrial capitalism that produced what she calls \u201ctraditional reciprocities,\u201d defined by straightforward exchanges of money for goods and services, which in turn bound people together in ostensibly healthy social, economic and political arrangements. Zuboff\u2019s analysis would benefit from more emphasis on the role of deregulation, the declining power of organized labor and the gradual financialization of the economy. With its ability to create boutique investment products that are several degrees removed from any tangible asset, it\u2019s finance that seems like the most obvious ideological forebear of surveillance capitalism, which uses digitalization to render more of life as tradable commodities.</p><p>But Zuboff\u2019s capacious book has room for minority opinions and other forms of dissent. \u201cThe Age of Surveillance Capitalism\u201d may lack a straightforward political program \u2014 Zuboff comes across as a liberal, albeit not one who slots neatly on the left-right axis \u2014 but it is loaded with useful economic, technological and anthropological analysis. (In this political vacuum, I\u2019d recommend the work of <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.pdf-18.com/speaker/trebor-scholz/\">Trebor Scholz</url>, a New School professor who has made a winning case for what he calls platform co-ops \u2014 nonprofit, worker-owned tech platforms that would lack the perverse incentives of surveillance capitalism.)</p><p>We should, after all, avoid a belief in tidy solutions. Works of technology criticism are often expected to provide a few hundred pages of doomsaying before providing a concise final chapter in which the Gordian knot of our problems is neatly and improbably cut. \u201cThe Age of Surveillance Capitalism,\u201d with its near-700-page footprint, is thankfully not that kind of book. Light on prescriptivist notions, Zuboff does propose a \u201cright to sanctuary,\u201d based on universalist, if ever more threatened, humanitarian principles, like the right to asylum. But she\u2019s after something bigger, providing a scaffolding of critical thinking from which to examine the great crises of the digital age. Through her we learn that our friends to the north were indeed correct: Facebook is the problem (along with Google, Microsoft, Amazon, et al.). This is the rare book that we should trust to lead us down the long hard road of understanding.</p><p>Jacob Silverman is the author of \u201cTerms of Service: Social Media and the Price of Constant Connection.\u201d </p><p>PHOTO:  (PHOTOGRAPH BY Igor Bastidas FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES)</p><h>Related Articles</h><p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/27/technology/facebook-british-hearing-mark-zuckerberg-no-show.html\">A Hot Seat for Facebook, an Empty Chair for Zuckerberg and a Vow to Share Secret Files</url></p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/01/world/canada/jagmeet-singh-canada-politics.html\">Sikh Becomes Canada\u2019s First Nonwhite Political Party Leader</url></p></bodyText></listItem></list></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NYT-100000006269375</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NYT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5V78-1GF1-JBG3-63J4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">6742</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-01-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1395\"/><timeReceived>06:51 EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The New York Times Company All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The New York Times <br/></publicationName><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"01\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>January 18, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Review</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

A Camping World executive is even quoted calling Salesforce's software \"magic.\" But behind the scenes in recent weeks, the Silicon Valley tech giant has delivered a different message to gun-selling retailers such as Camping World: Stop selling military-style rifles, or stop using our software. The pressure Salesforce is exerting on those retailers \u2014 barring them from using its technology to market products, manage customer service operations and fulfill orders \u2014 puts them in a difficult position. </p><p>Camping World, for example, spends more than $1 million a year on Salesforce's e-commerce software, according to one analyst estimate. Switching to another provider now could cost the company double that to migrate data, reconfigure systems and retrain employees. The change in Salesforce's acceptable-use policy shows how a technology giant that is mostly unknown to the public is trying to influence what retailers in America sell and alter the dynamics of a charged social issue. While Salesforce is hardly a household name, it is a dominant provider of software and services that help businesses manage their customers. With roughly 40,000 employees and a market value of nearly $120 billion, it has become a behemoth in San Francisco. Its branded skyscraper also towers over the city as the tallest building and a major landmark. But its decision to force its position on guns on retailers did not sit well with some industry advocates. These types of rules are \"corporate-policy virtue signaling\" and discriminate against gun owners, whose rights are protected by the Second Amendment, said Mark Oliva, public affairs director of the National Shooting Sports Foundation, a firearms trade group. \"It is a very chilling effect when a company as large as Salesforce puts out a policy like this,\" Oliva said. \"A policy like this is not surprising from a company based in that part of the country.\" Salesforce's new policy bars customers that sell a range of firearms \u2014 including automatic and semi-automatic \u2014 from using its e-commerce technology. The policy also precludes customers from selling some firearm parts, such as \"magazines capable of accepting more than 10 rounds\" and \"multi-burst trigger devices.\" The change affects \"a small number of existing customers when their current contracts expire,\" as well as all new customers, Salesforce spokeswoman Gina Sheibley said. She declined to name specific customers, but Camping World's Gander Outdoor unit sells a variety of semi-automatic firearms and high-capacity magazines. Camping World executives didn't respond to multiple requests for comment. Gun sales have become a political flash point for retailers in the aftermath of shootings such as the one this month in Colorado. This year, Dick's Sporting Goods said it would pull guns and ammunition off the shelves of 125 of its 720 stores, a move that the company acknowledged in a March securities filing led to \"an accelerated decline\" in its hunting business. Walmart ended the sales of military-style firearms in 2015, and last year it raised the minimum age for purchasing firearms and ammunition from 18 to 21. Even companies that have no gun-related business are taking a stand. Levi Strauss &amp; Co. pledged more than $1 million in September to support nonprofits and youth activists working to end gun violence. Two months later, Toms Shoes pledged $5 million to similar organizations. When tech giants enter the broader debate, the consequences are magnified because of the critical services they provide behind the scenes to customers. Consumers often don't realize they're interacting with other companies when they place an item in their shopping cart or chat with a customer service representative. But Salesforce and other big tech companies wield significant influence because of that reliance on their software. This type of activism has also led to criticism of tech companies overstepping their bounds. Facebook, Google and Twitter have all faced increased scrutiny of censorship of what they deem hate speech or dangerous individuals. Web-security provider Cloudflare faced criticism in 2017 that it denied free-speech rights after pulling its protection from a neo-Nazi website involved in organizing the white-supremacist rally in Charlottesville. Salesforce's new policy could prove controversial in conservative states, said Stifel Nicolaus analyst Tom Roderick, who provided the estimates of Camping World's spending on the company's e-commerce software. \"Does this become a hot-button issue in states where people like their assault rifles?\" Roderick said. It's not Salesforce's first experience with social activism. The company also provides technology that helps power the U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency's border activities and agent recruiting, something that drew increasing scrutiny as the agency implemented Trump administration policies that included separating families at the U.S.-Mexico border. Last summer, roughly 650 Salesforce employees signed a letter to co-chief executive Marc Benioff raising concerns about the agency's use of its products, first reported by Bloomberg News. The company hired an executive in December to run its new Office of Ethical and Humane Use to guide development and sales of its products. It's unclear whether the new executive helped develop the firearm policy. Benioff has been among the most outspoken CEOs regarding social and political issues, including a tweet last year a day after the mass shooting at a high school in Parkland, Fla., left 17 people dead. \"The AR-15 is the most popular rifle in America. Ban it,\" he wrote. A month later, he pledged $1 million to March for Our Lives, a group pushing for gun-control legislation. At the 2018 World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Benioff suggested social media companies such as Facebook should be regulated like Big Tobacco because of their similarly addictive natures. He also publicly campaigned against a controversial Indiana law, the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, in 2015, arguing it could lead to discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. Salesforce, which had 1,400 employees in Indianapolis at the time, threatened to \"dramatically reduce\" the company's investments in the state, before the legislature eventually amended the law. Benioff declined to comment on the company's new policy regarding gun sales. Salesforce isn't the only provider of e-commerce software to take a stand on gun sales. Shopify, which powers over 800,000 online shopping sites, also amended its acceptable-use policy last year to bar customers from using its technology to sell weapons such as automatic and semi-automatic firearms.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CHDLY-0001065918</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CHDLY2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W89-5RJ1-JBRC-V0HN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">163823</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1148\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Paddock Publications, Inc.</copyright><publicationName>Chicago Daily Herald</publicationName><edition>WEB EditionNC1 EditionNC2 EditionMF12 EditionNC3 EditionNM1 EditionNC EditionNC14 EditionMC1 EditionMC3 EditionMD1 EditionML2 EditionNL1 EditionNC14C EditionNC4 EditionCLFM EditioneBlast Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"31\" month=\"05\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>May 31, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009DIT</classCode><className>SALESFORCE.COM INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0006BNZ</classCode><className>NATIONAL SHOOTING SPORTS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS511210 SOFTWARE PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>SIC7372 PREPACKAGED SOFTWARE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><className>SIC2721 PERIODICALS: PUBLISHING, OR PUBLISHING &amp;

The case concerned web publishers embedding a Google-powered search engine on their site, and being prevented from letting third parties place search adverts at the top of search results. Margrethe Vestager, the EU's competition commissioner, said this 'denied other companies the possibility to compete on the merits and to innovate - and consumers the benefits of competition'. It takes the EC's total antitrust fines against Google to \u20ac8.2 billion in two years, following previous findings[2] in June 2017 and July 2018, respectively about Google unfairly advantaging its Shopping service and Google Chrome browser. </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/265864/original/file-20190326-36248-atgf2u.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0...5...o=format...000...=cliphttps://thenextweb.com/syndication/2019/04/15/how-tech-giants-can-strangle-transformative-tech-at-birth-and-how-to-stop-them/#Elizabeth\">https://images.theconversation.com/files/265864/original/file-20190326-36248-atgf2u.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0...5...o=format...000...=cliphttps://thenextweb.com/syndication/2019/04/15/how-tech-giants-can-strangle-transformative-tech-at-birth-and-how-to-stop-them/#Elizabeth</url> Warren: break-up call. Kelly Bell The European Union is not the only one gunning for big tech. UK chancellor Philip Hammond has hinted about[3] tightening digital competition policy following an independent report which raised concerns that the sector was anti-competitive. And US presidential hopeful Elizabeth Warren wants[4] the likes of Google, Amazon and Facebook broken up[5] to unleash a new wave of digital innovation. In an echo of the EC's Google findings, Warren cites various examples of these companies using their market dominance against smaller rivals - Amazon creating[6] own-brand versions of goods being sold on its platform, for instance. I broadly agree with this growing movement. Yet my main concern hasn't come into focus - even though it's arguably the biggest threat these companies pose to the future. They are standing in the way of the next big digital revolution, and need to be reined in before it's too late.The smart futureThe first computing revolution started in the 1950s as mainframe computers slowly entered the workplace and began to automate basic back-office functions like payroll and accounts. The second revolution, in the 1980s-2000s, centred on the PC and the migration of computers to the desktop and then to our homes. Third came the mobile revolution, which put those computers in our pockets so we could take them wherever we went. The next shift has started already. In our homes, smart assistants like Amazon Echo and Google Home are steadily colonizing personal spaces, along with the likes of smart lighting and security systems. Smart home devices shifted[7] some 640m units last year, and will be doing twice that by 2023. Over the same period, we can also expect something like 50% growth in unit sales of wearable devices like fitness trackers and smart clothing - a huge market for Apple[8] - to approaching 300m a year. As for the workplace, an equivalent flurry of sensor technology, underpinned by AI, is now transforming factories and production lines. Sometimes known as industry 4.0, the sector is forecast to[9] double to over US$150 billion by 2023, and over[10] a trillion dollars by the early 2030s.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/265865/original/file-20190326-36252-wk26h6.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0...5...o=format...000...=cliphttps://thenextweb.com/syndication/2019/04/15/how-tech-giants-can-strangle-transformative-tech-at-birth-and-how-to-stop-them/#From\">https://images.theconversation.com/files/265865/original/file-20190326-36252-wk26h6.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0...5...o=format...000...=cliphttps://thenextweb.com/syndication/2019/04/15/how-tech-giants-can-strangle-transformative-tech-at-birth-and-how-to-stop-them/#From</url> despair to wear. Kaspars GrinwaldsHand in hand with this will be an explosion in smart services. Tech companies will increasingly seek to improve our lives by crunching sensor data from all this hardware, as well as from all the activities that we do on our phones. Alongside the tech giants, numerous start-ups are staking out territory in this frontier. In the US, a company called Notion[11] has raised US$16m towards smart home sensors to alert owners via a phone app about water leaks, intrusions and temperature fluctuations. British start-up McLear has launched[12] a smart ring which can electronically unlock doors and authenticate payments in retail outlets. If you look on start-up databases like Beauhurst[13] or Crunchbase[14], you come across thousands of similar companies. But if there is a rapidly growing ecosystem, there is a competitive imbalance. Just like Notion, many smart devices rely on smartphone apps as the interface through which users control them. With almost 3 billion smartphones in use globally, almost[15] three quarters are Android devices, controlled by Google, and one quarter are iOS, controlled by Apple. Apps distributed via these two gatekeepers' app stores must comply with their regulations. In many cases, the giants themselves will be competing in the same marketplace. We already knew that Apple was betting heavily on health-related wearables services, for instance; the Apple credit card[16] announcement shows it also has finance in its sights. Similarly, Amazon last year spent[17] US$1 billion on smart doorbell maker Ring. Type 'smart doorbell' into Amazon's search box and, perhaps not surprisingly, its own products show up first. As innocent as this might be, one can imagine the temptation for such companies to give preference to their own devices and services when presenting search results.There will be bloodYet search is actually something of a side issue in all of this. Between them, Amazon, Facebook, Google and Apple hold detailed data on the interests, health, social connections and purchasing habits of billions of people. This data will be an essential input for the AI systems that will power the coming generation of smart services. This, therefore, is the greater threat to competition and innovation.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/265866/original/file-20190326-36252-1y91lll.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0...5...o=format...000...=cliphttps://thenextweb.com/syndication/2019/04/15/how-tech-giants-can-strangle-transformative-tech-at-birth-and-how-to-stop-them/#Oil\">https://images.theconversation.com/files/265866/original/file-20190326-36252-1y91lll.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0...5...o=format...000...=cliphttps://thenextweb.com/syndication/2019/04/15/how-tech-giants-can-strangle-transformative-tech-at-birth-and-how-to-stop-them/#Oil</url> be darned.

Whether the answer is to break up some tech giants, force them to open up their data assets to new entrants, prevent them buying start-ups in this sector, or allow users more control over their personal data, this is a debate we should have urgently. Calls[20] in the UK for big tech to make its mapping data freely available are almost certainly the shape of things to come. The open nature of the internet over the past 20 years created an environment where innovation could flourish. It is vital that this continues, but legacy monopolies from the previous revolution threaten to slow the process down. Unless digital data is liberalized, smart services could still fall a long way short of their potential. As we saw with the electric car[21] throughout the 20th century, vested interests are more than capable of impeding progress to keep their own business activities alive and well.

The case concerned web publishers embedding a Google-powered search engine on their site, and being prevented from letting third parties place search adverts at the top of search results.</p><p><br/> Margrethe Vestager, the EU's competition commissioner, said this \"denied other companies the possibility to compete on the merits and to innovate - and consumers the benefits of competition\". It takes the EC's total antitrust fines against Google to (EURO)8.2 billion in two years, following previous findings in June 2017 and July 2018, respectively about Google unfairly advantaging its Shopping service and Google Chrome browser.<br/> Elizabeth Warren: break-up call. Kelly Bell<br/> TNW Conference is coming up in Amsterdam<br/> You should definitely be there See why<br/> The European Union is not the only one gunning for big tech. UK chancellor Philip Hammond has hinted about tightening digital competition policy following an independent report which raised concerns that the sector was anti-competitive. And US presidential hopeful Elizabeth Warren wants the likes of Google, Amazon and Facebook broken up to unleash a new wave of digital innovation. In an echo of the EC's Google findings, Warren cites various examples of these companies using their market dominance against smaller rivals - Amazon creating own-brand versions of goods being sold on its platform, for instance.<br/> I broadly agree with this growing movement. Yet my main concern hasn't come into focus - even though it's arguably the biggest threat these companies pose to the future. They are standing in the way of the next big digital revolution, and need to be reined in before it's too late. The smart future<br/> The first computing revolution started in the 1950s as mainframe computers slowly entered the workplace and began to automate basic back-office functions like payroll and accounts. The second revolution, in the 1980s-2000s, centred on the PC and the migration of computers to the desktop and then to our homes. Third came the mobile revolution, which put those computers in our pockets so we could take them wherever we went.<br/> The next shift has started already. In our homes, smart assistants like Amazon Echo and Google Home are steadily colonizing personal spaces, along with the likes of smart lighting and security systems. Smart home devices shifted some 640m units last year, and will be doing twice that by 2023.<br/> Over the same period, we can also expect something like 50% growth in unit sales of wearable devices like fitness trackers and smart clothing - a huge market for Apple - to approaching 300m a year. As for the workplace, an equivalent flurry of sensor technology, underpinned by AI, is now transforming factories and production lines. Sometimes known as industry 4.0, the sector is forecast to double to over US$150 billion by 2023, and over a trillion dollars by the early 2030s.<br/> From despair to wear. Kaspars Grinwalds<br/> Hand in hand with this will be an explosion in smart services. Tech companies will increasingly seek to improve our lives by crunching sensor data from all this hardware, as well as from all the activities that we do on our phones. Alongside the tech giants, numerous start-ups are staking out territory in this frontier.<br/> In the US, a company called Notion has raised US$16m towards smart home sensors to alert owners via a phone app about water leaks, intrusions and temperature fluctuations. British start-up McLear has launched a smart ring which can electronically unlock doors and authenticate payments in retail outlets. If you look on start-up databases like Beauhurst or Crunchbase, you come across thousands of similar companies.<br/> But if there is a rapidly growing ecosystem, there is a competitive imbalance. Just like Notion, many smart devices rely on smartphone apps as the interface through which users control them. With almost 3 billion smartphones in use globally, almost three quarters are Android devices, controlled by Google, and one quarter are iOS, controlled by Apple.<br/> Apps distributed via these two gatekeepers' app stores must comply with their regulations. In many cases, the giants themselves will be competing in the same marketplace. We already knew that Apple was betting heavily on health-related wearables services, for instance; the Apple credit card announcement shows it also has finance in its sights.<br/> Similarly, Amazon last year spent US$1 billion on smart doorbell maker Ring. Type \"smart doorbell\" into Amazon's search box and, perhaps not surprisingly, its own products show up first. As innocent as this might be, one can imagine the temptation for such companies to give preference to their own devices and services when presenting search results. There will be blood<br/> Yet search is actually something of a side issue in all of this. Between them, Amazon, Facebook, Google and Apple hold detailed data on the interests, health, social connections and purchasing habits of billions of people. This data will be an essential input for the AI systems that will power the coming generation of smart services. This, therefore, is the greater threat to competition and innovation.<br/> Oil be darned. Wikimedia<br/> If \"data is the new oil\", as many have argued, then the US break-up of Standard Oil in 1911 into 34 companies because of its dominance on oil production and supply is something we should be studying closely. Whether the answer is to break up some tech giants, force them to open up their data assets to new entrants, prevent them buying start-ups in this sector, or allow users more control over their personal data, this is a debate we should have urgently. Calls in the UK for big tech to make its mapping data freely available are almost certainly the shape of things to come.<br/> The open nature of the internet over the past 20 years created an environment where innovation could flourish. It is vital that this continues, but legacy monopolies from the previous revolution threaten to slow the process down. Unless digital data is liberalized, smart services could still fall a long way short of their potential. As we saw with the electric car throughout the 20th century, vested interests are more than capable of impeding progress to keep their own business activities alive and well.The Conversation<br/> This article is republished from The Conversation by Martin De Saulles, Principal Lecturer, Centre for Digital Media Culture, University of Brighton under a Creative Commons license.

But the future, perhaps not surprisingly, has been digital.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"We find the audiences that our clients want. Whether the platform is owned by Canadians or Americans, it doesn't matter,\" says Lyrette whose company, Zenith Canada, counts such clients as entertainment giant 20th Century Fox, multinational cosmetic company Coty, and Canada Post.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"The end result is what matters.\"</p><p>For the Toronto-based Zenith, digital marketing now makes up about 40 per cent of all requests, with the rest split among radio, TV and print. That's up significantly from what it was only a few years ago, and the trend is increasing, Lyrette says.</p><p>Within the digital space, Google and Facebook command the overwhelming share of advertising dollarsat about 72 per cent. The rest is divided up amongst other media.</p><p>That includes legacy publishers like magazines and newspapers, who fight for a shrinking piece of the pie.</p><p>In 2018, the amount Canadian marketers spent on digital advertising was estimated to be $7.7 billion.</p><p>There are myriad reasons for the dominance of big tech companies in the advertising world, including better capitalization, analytics, technology, superior targeting and return on investment, even as legacy publishers struggle to catch up.</p><p>Some critics argue tech companies have been given a free ride on outdated tax regulations that have caused a crisis in Canada's media industry.</p><p>Canada's tax code was not written for the digital age. And one small but significant change could help to level the playing field between tech giants and domestic publishers.</p><p>Ads purchased on foreign-owned websites are tax deductible under the federal Income Tax Act. That loophole should be closed, critics say, because it encourages local businesses to buy into foreign platforms.</p><p>\"I think the common thread we've had so far is that when given a choice between standing up for Canada's interests or doing basically nothing, the government has gone with the latter,\" says Daniel Bernhard, executive director of the media watchdog group Friends of Canadian Broadcasting. \"Silicon Valley has basically done whatever they wanted. We haven't applied our rules when they are involved and that's become really expensive to all Canadians.\"</p><p>Section 19 of the Income Tax Act was created to help Canadian publishers gain a foothold against their more established foreign competition in order to support domestic news coverage. That legislation was made in the print era. Domestic advertisers couldn't deduct the cost of their advertising in Time's print edition, but they could if they advertised in Time's Canadian competitor Maclean's. However, the restriction doesn't apply to websites.</p><p>\"Essentially, you get a situation where you aren't able to deduct your advertising if you advertise in the print edition of the New York Times, but you get to do that in the online edition, which is completely ludicrous,\" Bernhard says.</p><p>A 2016 study by Bernhard's group found that tax deductibility wouldn't necessarily solve the problem, but it might redirect anywhere from 5 per cent to 10 per cent of annual ad spending to Canadian websites.</p><p>\"It certainly wouldn't be enough to totally change the balance, but it would be a substantial move,\" says Bruce Neve, president of independently owned media-buying company True Media Canada. \"It would be interesting to see what the results would be like if it were really a level playing field.\"</p><p>According to the 2016 study, tax deductibility could bring in an additional $250 million to $450 million in revenue to Canadian coffers. And that number would be even higher today. So far, despite intensive lobbying, the federal government hasn't budged on the original interpretation of Section 19.</p><p>\"Closing the loophole would be a clear message that the government of Canada values Canadian content and Canadian content producers, that they're not scared of Facebook and Google,\" says John Hinds, president and CEO of News Media Canada, which represents daily, weekly and community newspapers across the country. \"Nobody's asking for a free lunch. We just want them to apply the rules to account for the fact we are living in a digital age.\"</p><p>The question is, should Canadian consumers care where they see their advertising? Should advertisers care where they advertise?</p><p>\"One issue is that advertising pays for 90 per cent of the journalism that tells readers more about their backyard, while the internet companies don't have an obligation to tell Canadian stories, they don't have to put anything back,\" says Howard Law, director media sector for Unifor, the country's largest media union, which represents local broadcast workers at CTV and Citytv and newspapers such as the Globe and Mail and the Toronto Star.</p><p>Facebook did not respond to queries from the Star. However, Google Canada spokesperson Aaron Brindle stressed his platform shares a \"common mission\" with Canadian publishers.</p><p>\"The fate of Google and the publishing industry are inextricably linked,\" Brindle says in a statement to the Star. \"An open press and healthy news industry plays a critical role in our democracy.\"</p><p>Billions of clicks a month are driven to publishers' websites for free, representing an opportunity for them to grow and monetize an audience, Google argues. Globally, the company shared more than $13 billion with publishers in 2018.</p><p>\"By sharing revenue, driving traffic and supporting innovation, we see ourselves as partners to the news industry,\" Brindle says.</p><p>Not all publishers agree with the concept of making it more expensive for Canadians to advertise on foreign platforms.</p><p>Jeff Elgie, publisher of Village Media Inc., a collection of hyperlocal community news websites in Ontario, says that would be a \"huge mistake.\" He says Canadians would be \"effectively disadvantaged\" against anyone outside our borders when it comes to buying advertising.</p><p>\"The U.S. company selling widget 'X' to Canadians, buying ads through Google or Facebook to target Canadians, is going to be able to deduct those expenses, while the Canadian company attempting to do the same thing is not,\" Elgie says. \"Does the media industry really want to have a narrative that suggests that because they want these channels penalized, that every other business in Canada has to be penalized as well?\"</p><p>But critics and government watchdogs say more can be done to make sure digital companies pay their fair share.</p><p>On a separate but significant tax issue, the Canadian auditor general found this month that the Canadian sales tax system has \"not kept pace with the rapidly evolving digital marketplace.\"</p><p>Because they failed to collect the GST on companies such as Netflix, Google and Facebook, Canada lost $169 million in 2017 on digital products and services sold nationally, according to the auditor general. That's because companies that don't have a substantial physical presence in Canada do not have to collect taxes. It's up to the consumer to remit those taxes to the government, but that happens rarely, if ever.</p><p>Despite the reluctance of the federal government, Quebec and Saskatchewan, meanwhile, have been collecting provincial sales taxes from digital companies since the beginning of the year.</p><p>Facebook has said they would voluntarily collect and remit sales taxes to Ottawa. They are expected to do that sometime in the second half of the year. But Google so far has not followed suit, leaving it up to regulators.</p><p>\"Should the federal government create legislation to require the collection of value-added taxes on digital sales, we would comply with that legislation,\" Google's Brindle says. \"Quebec passed legislation that requires the collection of Quebec Sales Tax. We comply with that legislation.\"</p><p>Unifor's Law, meanwhile, says the Canadian government could consider a specific digital content tax similar to some European Union countries that are implementing taxes of anywhere from 2 per cent to a suggested 6 per cent of revenues.</p><p>That situation is similar to the plight of Canadian broadcasters who have noted that competitors such as Netflix don't have to contribute a percentage of their profits into entities such as the Canadian Media Fund. If they did, those funds would go into making Canadian television content. Similarly, some of the proceeds of that digital content tax could be diverted into creating local news.</p><p>\"A content tax could make sense. (Foreign digital platforms) make no significant contribution to journalism, but they vacuum up the advertising dollars,\" Law says.</p><p>Even though she has to be dispassionate about where she places her clients' budgets, media buyer Lyrette says she understands the importance of supporting local media. But she's not in the charity business. Clients want to go where they feel they can get the most eyeballs on a cost effective basis.</p><p>\"In some ways, it is the beginning of the end. If you're not supporting your own local community, that media community will eventually go away,\" Lyrette says. \"It's still important to have a local market otherwise your community won't be reflected in it. It's a pretty basic question. But it's also a competitive landscape.\"</p><p>The Trudeau government meanwhile, is paying close attention to the issues of privacy, hate speech and electoral interference. On Thursday, the prime minister announced a \"Digital Charter\" to rein in the industry, including financial penalties for companies that break the rules.</p><p>But so far it hasn't looked at what Hinds says is the underlying issue: The health of the industry.</p><p>\"There are a lot of words around fake news and hate speech. But they have not addressed the business side of the equation. To combat all that, you have to have a healthy industry of credible, legitimate players,\" Hinds says. \"You have to fix that issue first if you are to have any long-term sustainability. What's hopeful is that the rest of the world is engaged in that discussion. And hopefully Canadians will catch on, too.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TSTAR-2019052054444665</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TSTAR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W53-5C11-JBTY-W014-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8286</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1703\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Toronto Star Newspapers Limited</copyright><publicationName>The Toronto Star</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"05\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>May 20, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>NEWSPAPER</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>COLUMN</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

European regulators have fined Google for favoring its own services and products in search results, and a Google-funded think tank, New America, appears to have fired some of its scholars after one of them praised this fine.             </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">                We're going to speak now with a journalist who had her own experience in this vein several years ago. Kashmir Hill is writing about it now because it seems to show the way a tech giant like Google appears to game the system. Welcome.             </p><p>KASHMIR HILL:                 Hi, Ari.             </p><p>ARI SHAPIRO:                 Briefly describe what this experience was that you had several years ago.             </p><p>KASHMIR HILL:                 So this happened six years ago in 2011. I was a reporter at Forbes at the time. I got pulled into a meeting with Google salespeople where they were talking about Google Plus, which was then a new social network. And they told Forbes that they needed to put the plus-one buttons on Forbes' pages, or it would hurt them in search results because plus-one buttons were going to be a signal in search.             </p><p>ARI SHAPIRO:                 So basically if Forbes did not promote the Google Plus social network, Forbes articles would not appear as prominently in search results.             </p><p>KASHMIR HILL:                 They wouldn't phrase it that way. They would say if you didn't have the plus-one buttons, you know, on your articles, you would be at a disadvantage in search rankings.             </p><p>ARI SHAPIRO:                 And so you published this, and what happened?             </p><p>KASHMIR HILL:                 Well, first I went to Google's public relations team, and they confirmed that it was going to be a signal in search. And then I published an article about it. And Google flipped out after the article was published and went to Forbes and said that meeting was a business meeting; it was covered by a non-disclosure agreement, and you need to take this article down right away.             </p><p>ARI SHAPIRO:                 This sounds sort of like a source arguing that something was off the record when it was your understanding that it was on the record, which is not unusual. But what seems more unusual is what happened to the article after you did decide to take it down.             </p><p>KASHMIR HILL:                 Right. So Google said this was a problem for the business relationship between Forbes and Google and talked to many of my higher ups. And you know, they put a lot of pressure on me to unpublish the article. So I did, and it completely disappeared. It even disappeared from search results very soon after it was unpublished, which was unusual at the time from what I've seen with articles that we had unpublished in the past.             </p><p>ARI SHAPIRO:                 You asked Google whether they had anything to do with this. What did they tell you?             </p><p>KASHMIR HILL:                 So Google still feels that that article was inappropriate given that it was based on this confidential business meeting. And they said they had nothing to do with the removal from search results.             </p><p>ARI SHAPIRO:                 Do you believe them?             </p><p>KASHMIR HILL:                 (Laughter) What's hard about the story is this is something that happened six years ago. But it is - it's something that's always troubled me because of how quickly the article completely disappeared. The thing is - about tech companies is - we don't know. We don't get to see inside their companies, their algorithms. So I don't know what happened. I only know it from what I saw, though it was scraped by another site, so it's still available.             </p><p>ARI SHAPIRO:                 Google presents itself as a storehouse of knowledge. And I guess the question that your story raises is, how much is Google deciding what we should and should not know?             </p><p>KASHMIR HILL:                 (Laughter) I mean Google has a lot of power over access to information. And you know, what was at issue in my story and at issue with the New America Foundation incident is that a lot of people are saying Google is using its dominance in one industry in order to enter another industry. So the story I wrote was about how they were using their search power to push their social network. And part of the problem with New America is that there was this soft pressure on New America Foundation to silence critics of Google's monopoly power. And so what my story and what New America's story have in common was that, you know, it's not always an ultimatum that Google puts forth. But just because it's so powerful, just a little nudge has a lot of weight behind it.             </p><p>ARI SHAPIRO:                 That's journalist Kashmir Hill, who now writes for Gizmodo. Thanks for your time.             </p><p>KASHMIR HILL:                 Thanks, Ari.             </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NPRATC-201709062120</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NPRATC2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PF4-9PW1-JBJH-334B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">429236</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"844\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 National Public Radio (R) All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>NPR All Things Considered</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"09\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>September 6, 2017 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

In this interview, Dan Levin, COO of online file-sharing and cloud-based content-management service Box, discusses with McKinsey's Barr Seitz some of the ways companies are managing-and profiting from-the changes. What follows is an edited transcript of their conversation.</p><h>The three big tech trends</h><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> We're now carrying around in our pockets incredibly capable computers that can run sophisticated apps and do a lot of heavy computational work, even though they're very small. So that's the first piece.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> The second piece is the integration into those devices of connectivity and other capabilities, especially connectivity. The fact that a cellphone uses a cellular data network to talk to the World Wide Web, and thus is connected to the outside world, is huge. But the advent of other peripherals that can be built into or easily added onto these teeny little devices is also huge.</p><p> The third thing is that cloud-delivered enterprise applications that can be accessed over the web and don't require access to a VPN1 or a firewall have just radically improved accessibility of these technologies from mobile devices. So you put those three things together, and they're driving a huge amount of change.</p><h> The emergence of 'knowledge' workers</h><p> I think work is evolving from being a place to being a mind-set. It's evolving from something I do during a fixed period of time to something that I do almost all the time, from something that was separate from my life to something that, for many of us, is integral to our life.</p><p> I also think that work is going from something that's physical to something that's about information, creation, and utilization. There are hundreds of millions of people around the world-people who are repairing aircraft engines, people who are working in retail stores-who are now knowledge workers. Technology is enabling them to work in a much more interesting way than they used to.</p><p> A quick example is guys on job sites in the Bakken oil field in North Dakota. It used to be that if something broke at a wellhead and the manual for it wasn't handy, it could take weeks to find somebody who knew how to fix it, get the documentation you needed,  et cetera. Now these guys can pull up the information on every piece of equipment at the wellhead instantly, using a mobile device over a cellular network. On the one hand, it's more productive because the well gets back into productivity quicker, but it's also better for the employee-nobody wants to sit around waiting for the manual to show up, especially at -30 degrees in North Dakota.</p><h> How companies are using tech</h><p> We have data that suggest that especially for mobile knowledge-worker populations, the productivity increase can be very significant, on the order of 10 percent or 20 percent.</p><p> Here's one excellent example. One of the largest companies that rents construction equipment in the US moved from a paper-based process to an iPad-based process for their salespeople. In the old world, those salespeople spent four days in the yard renting equipment, and every Friday in the office keypunching all the paper they'd collected over the course of the week. In the new world, they literally saved that entire day every week by using forms on iPads to enter all the information electronically, rather than keypunching it after the fact.</p><h> The importance of change management</h><p> These new-world technologies are pretty easy and inexpensive to deploy. So the challenge is a mind-set challenge, an awareness challenge, a use-case identification challenge, a change-management problem. The companies that are good at change management tend to do really well.</p><p> Change management is pretty well understood. In this context, it's got a couple of discrete pieces. There's a piece around top-down sponsorship that's really about making everybody comfortable that this is OK, that it's sanctioned, that it's secure, that it's reliable, that we're going to use it to solve real business problems-it's not just a toy.</p><p>There's a piece around awareness, helping every employee understand that this capability is available to them. Of course, it's much easier if you have an enterprise license agreement with any vendor of this kind of technology, so you don't have to worry about paying extra if too many people use it.</p><p> And then it's really use-case identification. What kind of business problems can we solve with this? How will we prioritize the ones to go after? Are they very broad, horizontal use cases that are just related to sharing information with a vendor or with our colleagues in Tokyo? Or are they more narrowly focused use cases around the automation of a business process or some regulatory compliance burden?</p><h> Technology in business partnerships</h><p> Partnerships come in roughly two flavors: short term and long term. Short-term partnerships, or transactions, might relate to mergers and acquisition, or to the production of a particular movie, to the creation of a joint venture, something like that. That kind of problem is brilliantly solved by cloud-based solutions in general, and by Box in particular, because the ability to set up and tear down quickly and easily and securely and reliably is very important, especially if these things are short-lived, a couple of months, say.</p><p> On-premises technologies are horrible in those situations because it takes heavy lifting to get started, and then you're going to tear it down in three months. But Box is also a very good platform to facilitate what I would call longer-term collaboration-for example, a marketing team working with an advertising agency, a legal team working with an outside law firm, an automobile manufacturer working with a parts supplier. In those cases, you've got a document-based collaboration problem that needs a tool that works easily across organizations and through the corporate firewall, particularly if there are three or four or more companies involved in a given project, which is very common in film production, for example.</p><p> Cloud-based tools like Box are brilliant in those kinds of situations because it's much easier to deal with authentication-provisioning and de-provisioning of users, et cetera, even in a fairly complicated environment like that.</p><h>About the authors</h><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Dan Levin</emphasis> is the president and COO of Box.

And the leading technology companies know it. It's why they are now hemorrhaging resources in an attempt to course-correct on the recruiting and talent cultivation fronts - hoping to prime their pipelines with candidates that are equally qualified and quota-fulfilling. For example, Googlecharacterizes its plan as ongoing and has pledged $150 million this year to diversity initiatives. To date, Google's diversity training workshops, which began last year, have been attended by more than half of Google's nearly 49,000 employees.</p><p>Other big tech efforts have been more sluggish. Facebookacknowledged that it had work to do, revealing that 69 percent of its workforce at the time was male and more than 90 percent of employees were white or Asian. One year after making a public declaration to build a workforce that better reflects Facebook's 1.4 billion users, a recent report shows the company added just seven African-American employees, including an African-American diversity chief Maxine Williams. Within the last few months, Facebookhas started a program In a handful of divisions that requires the applicant pool for a job to include at least one minority before someone can be hired. If the efforts expand Facebook's workforce to include more African Americans, Latinos and women within those divisions, it will be scaled across the entire company. The program has been likened to the \"Rooney Rule,\" a regulation Imposed by the National Football League requiring teams to interview minority candidates for head coaching and other senior football operation jobs.</p><p>The Rooney Rule - which was enacted in 2003 - has proven successful: 22 percent of NFL coaches are now African American, up from 6 percent before the regulation was put into effect.</p><p>Amidst the fray of the big tech diversity double down talk, The Los Angeles Times' most compelling diversity hire this year was when it brought on a reporter in June who will be specializing in covering the social media phenomenon that is sometimes referred to as #BlackTwitter. An African American himself, Dexter Thomas's first piece effectively downplayed the perceived cohesiveness of Black Twitter: but a recent headline - \"Flow Black is Bernle 5anders?\" - hints at his, and the newspaper's, flawed premise - the trivializing of black life even while it positively impacts The Los Angeles Times' bottom line via increased traffic and page views.</p><p>Though the need to \"study\" Black Twitter has come across as some sort of mis-dlrected anthropology foray, It signaled a proactive shift of intentions on th\u00eb part of institutions trying to \"understand\" via technology the fiscal providence of engaging black people en masse whether as consumers or employees. Technology seems to be doing this a lot these days, at least re-openlng the door for expanded conversations on why black lives matter on the street, In the community, in the workplace. That Black Twitter emerged In a \"post-diversity\" environment with <person><nameText>President Obama's </nameText></person>ascendancy as the high water mark, and that It warrants attention and coverage from mainstream institutions may indicate its influence, if trending can be deemed as such.</p><p>There's perhaps more grit in the implications of the acquisition of black-scribed The Root by Latino-leaning Univislon before its IPO. One of the first orders of business post acquisition was to censor and dissolve the partnership between the network and current presidential GOP candidate Donald Trump In response to his statements characterizing select immigrants. In an unprecendented move, it became the first black and brown multi-media company joining forces to defend Its readership and viewership (predominantly comprised of people of color) rather than continue a monetary relationship with Donald Trump.</p><p>It's now the ubiquity of black-tinged conversations pedastalled by technology platforms that are reifying diversity conversations. So the case for diversity today is moreso a culling of a set of correlations - with the global population demographics shifting in favor of darker hues by 2030, and whites becoming an official minority In this country by 2075, if one does not recognize the social and bottom line impact of how blacks are maneuvering in technology, one Is either at risk or already Irrelevant.</p><p>The ominipresence of black voices online combined with the revival of diversity In technology conversations has created a perfect storm of sorts; reviving general workplace diversity conversations in its wake. It's still the same conversation, just now, it is becoming more specialized and niche - starting with the most robust Industry, technology. And since technology is both an economic and social force of its own as well as a constant In any industry, it follows, as more people of color get trained from early to do the work, the more you will see in positions of consequence.</p><p>Technology is seemingly the way in and up.</p><p>But there's still the nagging sense that companies - even with knowledge of African Americans outpacing other groups' technology usage in tow - are just doing the bare minimum. For example, Kerrie Peralno, chief diversity officer at American Express, says American Express understands that social media is especially important in attracting, hiring and developing a diverse pool of talent. \"To address that need, American Express recently launched a new careers website. The number of jobs searched has doubled and the site is enabled for social syndication to allow visitors to share job postings via Facebook, Twitter and MySpace, and others. Users may also opt in to receive RSS feeds via iGoogle and My Yahoo. This change allows visitors to share and retain information unlike ever before.\"</p><p>The consumer data Isn't enough to justify black hires. When it is time to recruit, is there a qualified black workforce present? And how would we know?</p><p>Tiffany Mikell, co-founder of BlackStarMedia, an incubator for entrepreneurial technologists of color, believes the current moment to be ripe for ensuring the quality of the black workforce. The conversation, she believes, should take a totally new direction, moving away from novel hires and limp corporate diversity initiatives to a more nuanced conversation that #BlackTwitter coverage could take cues from.</p><p>\"When the 'diversity in tech' conversation initially increased momentum, it was inspiring to witness and participate in as so much of my life's work and focus was centered on this very issue. I've been working in technology as a developer for almost 10 years and when I started my career at a Big 4 consulting firm, I was the only black woman on my entry level team of 30.\"</p><p>In her first technology role, she was on teams building enterprise applications for consumer goods conglomerates that generated billions of dollar annually.</p><p>\"Although diversity in tech conversations have driven my work for the last several years, I now believe we've reached a point where that conversation has become stagnant and narrow. Many feel that the focus on pipeline STEM education or major company job placement is key to growing a diverse entrepreneurial and workforce but missing in these conversations is the relevance of culturally specific learning, methods of curating inclusive workspaces, practical ways to navigate the psychological toll of being an underrepresented person, and attention to the value of supporting economic ecosystems that financially and structurally support POC communities.\"</p><p>Coding While Black founder Dominic M. Liddell speaks to this often and is actively building a well-oiled infrastructure - much like technology based Black Founders - to support blacks who are engaging the workplace from a technological standpoint.</p><p>\"I've been frustrated by those who feel that 'race is no longer an issue.' Rather than be visible as a black coder, they'd rather blend in and not be \"othered.\" I agree with the sentiment of not wanting to be singled out because of skin color, but I also think we need more role models and mentors. Being visible as black coders helps to change the image that we are just consumers of technology.\"</p><p>\"It also seems that lately the discussion of tech-heros only includes individuals working in technology support roles,\" adds Mikell. \"When and where do we ever highlight the work or contributions of actual software engineers of color?\"</p><p>r Liddell himself recently learned of Jesse Russell, who played a major role in developing cell phone and 4G technology. \"And Frank Greene, who is considered one of the first black technologists and developed high-speed semiconductor,\" he adds.</p><p>\"And when we do highlight developers of color, we shouldn't uphold learning how to program as the ultimate path to success without also developing and supporting the spaces and platforms that showcase the viability of a long-term career in tech,\" Mikell continues. \"Amplifying the voices and work of individuals of color who are currently navigating the industry as technologists and STEM entrepreneurs, is one way to address this issue.\"</p><p>Mikell also suggests that not enough people are having these honest conversations publicly about what life is currently like for technologists and what can be done collectively to improve that reality. \"By avoiding such candid conversations and focusing solely on how to get more POC working at companies like Facebook, we are doing a disservice to established and aspiring technologists by contributing to misguided 'tech education movements.\"</p><p>The next step, then, is seemingly inward - even as black people are the trending topic du jour.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Photographs</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ENW-3818156011</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">58694ENW</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5H1F-1DC1-DYR7-82F4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11341</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-12-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1991\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2015 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2015 Atlanta Tribune: The Magazine</copyright><publicationName>The Atlanta Tribune</publicationName><volume>Vol. 29</volume><issueNumber>No. 6</issueNumber><aggregationName>Ethnic NewsWatch</aggregationName><publicationDate month=\"09\" year=\"2015\"><dateText>September 2015</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Other</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Aggregate News Sources</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Feature</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"64\"><classCode>CC0009SVI</classCode><className>LOS ANGELES TIMES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"59\"><className>NATIONAL FOOTBALL LEAGUE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

And the leading technology companies know it. It's why they are now hemorrhaging resources in an attempt to course-correct on the recruiting and talent cultivation fronts - hoping to prime their pipelines with candidates that are equally qualified and quota-fulfilling. For example, Google characterizes its plan as ongoing and has pledged $150 million this year to diversity initiatives. To date, Google's diversity training workshops, which began last year, have been attended by more than half of Google's nearly 49,000 employees.</p><p>Other big tech efforts have been more sluggish. Facebook acknowledged that it had work to do, revealing that 69 percent of its workforce at the time was male and more than 90 percent of employees were white or Asian. One year after making a public declaration to build a workforce that better reflects Facebook's 1.4 billion users, a recent report shows the company added just seven African-American employees, including an African-American diversity chief Maxine Williams.

If the efforts expand Facebook's workforce to include more African Americans, Latinos and women within those divisions, it will be scaled across the entire company. The program has been likened to the \"Rooney Rule,\" a regulation Imposed by the National Football League requiring teams to interview minority candidates for head coaching and other senior football operation jobs.</p><p>The Rooney Rule - which was enacted in 2003 - has proven successful: 22 percent of NFL coaches are now African American, up from 6 percent before the regulation was put into effect.</p><p>Amidst the fray of the big tech diversity double down talk, The Los Angeles Times' most compelling diversity hire this year was when it brought on a reporter in June who will be specializing in covering the social media phenomenon that is sometimes referred to as #BlackTwitter. An African American himself, Dexter Thomas's first piece effectively downplayed the perceived cohesiveness of Black Twitter: but a recent headline - \"Flow Black is Bernle 5anders?\" - hints at his, and the newspaper's, flawed premise - the trivializing of black life even while it positively impacts The Los Angeles Times' bottom line via increased traffic and page views.</p><p>Though the need to \"study\" Black Twitter has come across as some sort of mis-dlrected anthropology foray, It signaled a proactive shift of intentions on th\u00eb part of institutions trying to \"understand\" via technology the fiscal providence of engaging black people en masse whether as consumers or employees. Technology seems to be doing this a lot these days, at least re-openlng the door for expanded conversations on why black lives matter on the street, In the community, in the workplace. That Black Twitter emerged In a \"post-diversity\" environment with President Obama's ascendancy as the high water mark, and that It warrants attention and coverage from mainstream institutions may indicate its influence, if trending can be deemed as such.</p><p>There's perhaps more grit in the implications of the acquisition of black-scribed The Root by Latino-leaning Univislon before its IPO. One of the first orders of business post acquisition was to censor and dissolve the partnership between the network and current presidential GOP candidate Donald Trump In response to his statements characterizing select immigrants. In an unprecendented move, it became the first black and brown multi-media company joining forces to defend Its readership and viewership (predominantly comprised of people of color) rather than continue a monetary relationship with Donald Trump.</p><p>It's now the ubiquity of black-tinged conversations pedastalled by technology platforms that are reifying diversity conversations. So the case for diversity today is moreso a culling of a set of correlations - with the global population demographics shifting in favor of darker hues by 2030, and whites becoming an official minority In this country by 2075, if one does not recognize the social and bottom line impact of how blacks are maneuvering in technology, one Is either at risk or already Irrelevant.</p><p>The ominipresence of black voices online combined with the revival of diversity In technology conversations has created a perfect storm of sorts; reviving general workplace diversity conversations in its wake. It's still the same conversation, just now, it is becoming more specialized and niche - starting with the most robust Industry, technology. And since technology is both an economic and social force of its own as well as a constant In any industry, it follows, as more people of color get trained from early to do the work, the more you will see in positions of consequence.</p><p>Technology is seemingly the way in and up.</p><p>But there's still the nagging sense that companies - even with knowledge of African Americans outpacing other groups' technology usage in tow - are just doing the bare minimum. For example, Kerrie Peralno, chief diversity officer at American Express, says American Express understands that social media is especially important in attracting, hiring and developing a diverse pool of talent. \"To address that need, American Express recently launched a new careers website. The number of jobs searched has doubled and the site is enabled for social syndication to allow visitors to share job postings via Facebook, Twitter and MySpace, and others. Users may also opt in to receive RSS feeds via iGoogle and My Yahoo. This change allows visitors to share and retain information unlike ever before.\"</p><p>The consumer data Isn't enough to justify black hires. When it is time to recruit, is there a qualified black workforce present? And how would we know?</p><p>Tiffany Mikell, co-founder of BlackStarMedia, an incubator for entrepreneurial technologists of color, believes the current moment to be ripe for ensuring the quality of the black workforce. The conversation, she believes, should take a totally new direction, moving away from novel hires and limp corporate diversity initiatives to a more nuanced conversation that #BlackTwitter coverage could take cues from.</p><p>\"When the 'diversity in tech' conversation initially increased momentum, it was inspiring to witness and participate in as so much of my life's work and focus was centered on this very issue. I've been working in technology as a developer for almost 10 years and when I started my career at a Big 4 consulting firm, I was the only black woman on my entry level team of 30.\"</p><p>In her first technology role, she was on teams building enterprise applications for consumer goods conglomerates that generated billions of dollar annually.</p><p>\"Although diversity in tech conversations have driven my work for the last several years, I now believe we've reached a point where that conversation has become stagnant and narrow. Many feel that the focus on pipeline STEM education or major company job placement is key to growing a diverse entrepreneurial and workforce but missing in these conversations is the relevance of culturally specific learning, methods of curating inclusive workspaces, practical ways to navigate the psychological toll of being an underrepresented person, and attention to the value of supporting economic ecosystems that financially and structurally support POC communities.\"</p><p>Coding While Black founder Dominic M. Liddell speaks to this often and is actively building a well-oiled infrastructure - much like technology based Black Founders - to support blacks who are engaging the workplace from a technological standpoint.</p><p>\"I've been frustrated by those who feel that 'race is no longer an issue.' Rather than be visible as a black coder, they'd rather blend in and not be \"othered.\" I agree with the sentiment of not wanting to be singled out because of skin color, but I also think we need more role models and mentors. Being visible as black coders helps to change the image that we are just consumers of technology.\"</p><p>\"It also seems that lately the discussion of tech-heros only includes individuals working in technology support roles,\" adds Mikell. \"When and where do we ever highlight the work or contributions of actual software engineers of color?\"</p><p>r Liddell himself recently learned of Jesse Russell, who played a major role in developing cell phone and 4G technology. \"And Frank Greene, who is considered one of the first black technologists and developed high-speed semiconductor,\" he adds.</p><p>\"And when we do highlight developers of color, we shouldn't uphold learning how to program as the ultimate path to success without also developing and supporting the spaces and platforms that showcase the viability of a long-term career in tech,\" Mikell continues. \"Amplifying the voices and work of individuals of color who are currently navigating the industry as technologists and STEM entrepreneurs, is one way to address this issue.\"</p><p>Mikell also suggests that not enough people are having these honest conversations publicly about what life is currently like for technologists and what can be done collectively to improve that reality. \"By avoiding such candid conversations and focusing solely on how to get more POC working at companies like Facebook, we are doing a disservice to established and aspiring technologists by contributing to misguided 'tech education movements.\"</p><p>The next step, then, is seemingly inward - even as black people are the trending topic du jour.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Photographs</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ATLTRB-3818156011</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ATLTRB2015</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5H12-WFM1-JD2T-F3KX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">314531</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2015-09-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1991\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2015 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2015 Atlanta Tribune: The Magazine</copyright><publicationName>The Atlanta Tribune (Georgia)</publicationName><issn>ISSN: 1064-3877</issn><volume>Vol. 29</volume><issueNumber>No. 6</issueNumber><publicationDate month=\"09\" year=\"2015\"><dateText>September 2015</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

It was only through the discovery by Sir Issac Newton and the dedication of scientists over many centuries that we are able to understand it today.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Like ocean tides, the future of finance may be hard to fathom at the beginning. Yet it offers many opportunities and risks. Perhaps most importantly, it also underscores the heavy responsibility and ownership that we collectively bear to build a financial system that is safe, reliable and truly serves the needs of the people.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The world around us is shifting dramatically. To understand this shift, we should pay attention to five megatrends.</p><p>The first is the shift in global economic order with the rise of Asia, including the rising prominence of ASEAN. The gravity of the global economy is moving to the East. Being the sixth largest economy and home to around 650 million people, there is an abundance of opportunity, hope and dynamism in this region. The financial sector will no doubt, be a key player in further catalysing the growth of ASEAN countries.</p><p>The second is the risks brought about by climate change. Tackling climate change may be one of the biggest challenges for humanity in building a sustainable and prosperous future. It could lead to devastating, wide ranging and irreversible damage to our economy, society and the way we live. Economic losses in itself could be very significant, as high as $20 trillion. Insured losses from effects of climate change have already increased five-fold in the past 30 years.</p><p>The third is the rising income inequality that can threaten the fabric of our society. Consider this. The top one per cent of the population has captured twice the global income growth of the bottom 50 per cent since 1980. Worse still, inequality has persisted despite large transfers of public to private wealth in many countries.</p><p>The fourth is the rising populism and protectionist policies. This can be seen in inward looking policies and anti-establishment views that have become more entrenched in parts of the world. Slow growth, lack of economic mobility and erosion of trust in public and private institutions are among the factors that are likely to have contributed to this. Like undercurrents before a storm, these trends have far reaching implications for political, economic and social systems.</p><p>Last but not least, the fifth shift is the advancement of technology. This has and will continue to dramatically alter the way we behave, interact and transact. Much has been said about the benefits, but an increasing reliance on technology presents risks that we cannot ignore. This includes issues of data privacy, discrimination or biases and also displacement of certain segments within society. In the digital age, higher order risks of cyber-attacks and operational disruptions are magnified in ways that we have yet to fully comprehend.</p><p>These five megatrends and finance are deeply intertwined. While undoubtedly finance has helped to power the economic rise of ASEAN, its role in contributing to an increase in climate risk and inequality cannot be denied.</p><p>Therefore, as we consider the future of finance, we need to contemplate not only how these megatrends may impact finance, but how finance itself can respond to and shape these trends in more positive ways moving forward. In my mind, this calls for a financial system that is relevant, safe and socially responsible.</p><p>Finance must be relevant to the needs of the economy. This means that it must offer suitable, cost-effective and quality financial products and services for all segments of society. It must also respond to the changing demographics and structure of the economy. For example, as we move towards becoming a digital economy, the financial sector must accord adequate support to innovative SMEs, such as those involved in e-commerce.</p><p>Equally important, we must remember that this imperative is not only for banks, but extends to the other parts of the financial sector. Non-banks such as venture capital and private equity firms, as well as alternative financiers such as factoring and leasing companies, have an equal stake in this and should also play a more active role in financing the needs of businesses. The need to bridge the gaps between 20th century finance and the 21st century economy is both compelling and urgent for the whole financial sector as conditions remain challenging for the economy domestically and abroad. This is also certainly not the only time that we will face such challenges.</p><p>To be safe, finance must not sow the seeds of its own destruction and not serve as an amplifier of risk to the economy. The ability of finance to mobilise capital, create leverage and distribute risk allows it to be a powerful force for good. But excessive and unbridled risk taking creates instability which is harmful not only for the particular firm, but the economy and society at large.</p><p>There is also a greater need for finance to be socially responsible. Financial institutions can and must assert the much needed leadership in a world where the continued neglect of equitable development and a rapidly deteriorating environment is displacing communities, raising social and political tensions, and putting future generations at grave risk. Finance still holds the trust of society and substantial influence over economic agents. But this is a privilege earned, and demands that financial institutions behave ethically, and act in the best interest of the communities they serve.</p><p>There is no question that technology will lie at the very heart of these imperatives for the financial system. This has been true for decades, only the order of its impact is now, arguably much greater.</p><p>After all, the world's first ATM in 1967 transformed the relationship between people and money and making finance more accessible. Today, fintech signals the next phase in the transformation of finance.</p><p>Fintech holds enormous potential to enhance competition, increase productivity, address unfulfilled consumer demand and fundamentally change the way institutions provide financial services \u2013 in ways we may not even have fully discovered.</p><p>Similarly for Islamic finance, adoption of technology could present significant opportunities to reduce the cost of financial intermediation and expand access. For example, distributed ledger technology could enable automated execution of contracts through the use of digital protocols, or smart contracts, which can simplify complex Shari'ah contractual processes.</p><p>In addition, fintech initiatives to integrate social finance tools, such as Waqf, Sadakah and Zakat, to offer more affordable financial and protection solutions, will be instrumental to serve those who are currently financially underserved or excluded.</p><p>The integration of social finance into Islamic financial services encourages wealth distribution among society to achieve greater balance between wealth creation and wealth sharing.</p><p>Ultimately, fintech in Malaysia should be harnessed to offer inclusive, sustainable and relevant financial products and services to serve the needs of all. This however means that we need to be cognisant of the potential risks associated with technology.</p><p>This will be especially important as fintech and big tech firms become more prominent in the financial system. Such firms could pose system- wide vulnerabilities that can amplify shocks to the financial system and cause financial and economic instability. Increasing reliance and concentration on third party service providers, including those located offshore, to support critical functions, could also increase operational vulnerabilities in more unpredictable ways</p><p>The demands of society for speed, convenience and cost efficiency are at a point where substantial tensions already exist between pressures on financial institutions to accelerate the adoption of technology, and our capacity to manage those risks effectively. These tensions will only increase going forward.</p><p>Managing these tensions at an optimal level will be critical. It will call for changes to how financial institutions internally oversee and manage technology risks, both within and across their business activities, invest in hard and soft infrastructure and having much deeper collaboration across institutions and agencies.</p><p>Socially responsible finance will also require institutions to carefully consider how technological innovations may create new forms of financial exclusion or raise difficult ethical questions. Clear guidance on acceptable conduct by staff and relevant parties will be needed. This in turn, will require financial institutions to reflect on their core values and risk appetite.</p><p>In short, managing technology risks is not just an operational matter. It is a strategic one with high stakes for individual institutions, as well as the industry and the economy more broadly. Our response should be commensurate with these stakes.</p><p>Beyond measures taken at an institutional level, there is a pressing need for the financial industry, and indeed even the nation, to provide an enabling and secure framework for technological innovation; and educate and empower the public to take advantage of innovations. For example, the need to formulate a cohesive, coherent and comprehensive national strategy on cyber security is an urgent need. We can only play our intended role to support the broader economy if we are attentive to both strategic and operational considerations of risk.</p><p>Bank Negara Malaysia is committed to play a facilitative role to enable innovation to flourish. Like financial institutions, we need to balance the significant benefits of financial innovation with its risks. We are also mindful that the calls we make in regulating and supervising the industry can themselves sometimes, restrain innovation.</p><p>Our responses to new financial technologies will continue to be primarily concerned with the risks that they pose to financial stability and consumer protection. In finding the right balance in our overall regulatory and supervisory posture, we will continue to consult widely with the industry and experts in the field. A key priority for the Bank is to ensure that our regulatory and supervisory system is appropriately calibrated to encourage innovation, but also has the agility to shift gears when required to respond to new risks. This recognises that innovation without stability ultimately destroys value, confidence and undermines our future.</p><p>What does this mean in practice? There are at least three things, which are each a reflection of our ongoing efforts to build an enabling, yet safe environment for innovation:</p><p>First, building interoperable infrastructures. This will start with open and fair access to a shared payment infrastructure for banks and non-banks alike. It is also important to recognise the need for other digital public infrastructures as key enablers to harness the full potential of fintech. These include having a national digital identity system, framework for open API and open banking, clear cloud policy and nationwide broadband connectivity.</p><p>Second, further differentiating our regulatory and supervisory approach to capture new sources and transmission of risks while allowing room for experimentation and for firms to develop economies of scale. An important objective will be minimising regulatory arbitrage, which can lead to risks building up in parts of the financial system that may be subject to differentiated regulations. We anticipate that this will call for a much more dynamic approach to regulation and supervision as well as better communication of regulatory developments going forward.</p><p>Third, strengthening platforms for collaboration. In this regard, the Bank, together with the financial industry, is in the process of establishing a Financial Threat Intelligence Platform. The platform will collate, analyse and disseminate real time information on cyber threats and trends to strengthen the detective capabilities of the industry against such threats. We expect to operationalise the platform before the year end. I am also pleased to announce the establishment of a dedicated innovation lab, right here in Sasana Kijang. The lab will provide a collaborative environment for the purpose of creating, elaborating, and prototyping innovative solutions to clearly defined problem statements.</p><p>Recall that ocean tides present us with both opportunities and risks. The fact that humanity today is better able to understand, predict and master ocean tides should give us encouragement for the future of finance. The goal of a relevant, safe and socially responsible financial system can be attained by focusing our energies toward this shared goal in which we all have a critical stake. Much like a \"rising tide that lifts all boats\", the actions and choices that we make within the financial system do not just affect the provision of financial services, but have important implications for the well-being of society and our economic prospects as a nation. We owe this not only to ourselves and others at this point in time, but especially to our future generations.</p><p>Tackling climate change may be one of the biggest challenges for humanity in building a sustainable and prosperous future. It could lead to devastating, wide ranging and irreversible damage to our economy, society and the way we live.</p><p>\u2013 DATUK NOR SHAMSIAH MOHD YUNUS, Governor, Bank Negara Malaysia</p><p>In the digital age, higher order risks of cyber-attacks and operational disruptions are magnified in ways that we have yet to fully comprehend.</p><p>\u2013 DATUK NOR SHAMSIAH MOHD YUNUS, Governor, Bank Negara Malaysia</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ISBUFI-152073731</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ISBUFI2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WW3-2SW1-F11P-X4N3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">357162</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-08-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2303\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 CPI Financial.

Did you know you can support The Nation by drinking wine?Last month, Gizmodo reported that Google had downgraded its unofficial motto[3], 'Don't be evil,' in its code of conduct, deleting several instances of the phrase in a document that is meant to guide its employees' work. The tweak spoke to an uneasy ethical debate now echoing in the corridors of Silicon Valley as tech giants do big business with military and law enforcement, handing the keys of digital innovation to the Pentagon and Homeland Security. Ad Policy[4] Just last week, Microsoft employees brought into sharp focus the overlap between Silicon Valley's leading lights and the Trump administration's cruelest abuses, when they released an open letter calling on their company[5] to cease work as a contractor for Immigration and Customs Enforcement. According to the workers, Microsoft had a $19.4 million contract to help ICE develop its surveillance operations with data-processing and artificial-intelligence technology. Despite the company's claims that it did not directly partner with ICE on enforcement operations, the rebelling workers objected to[6] any link to the agency that is ripping apart immigrant families and imprisoning refugees: 'As the people who build the technologies that Microsoft profits from, we refuse to be complicit. We are part of a growing movement, comprised of many across the industry who recognize the grave responsibility that those creating powerful technology have to ensure what they build is used for good, and not for harm.' Google executives got a similar disruption earlier this year when employees learned of its partnership with the Pentagon on 'Project Maven,' an effort to weaponize artificial intelligence. Google's contract for the project, which involved 'using machine learning to identify vehicles and other objects in drone footage,' according to Gizmodo[7], was folded into a broader set of corporate-federal 'partnerships' aimed at enhancing agencies' cloud-computing systems. The project was set to yield as much as $250 million (though Google initially claimed it would be just $9 million), and more crucially, would come with high-level security clearances[8] that would lay the groundwork for future collaborations with military projects.Immigration It's unclear when exactly Google began cooperating on the project, but when Google staffers discovered the lucrative backdoor contract, the company had a mutiny on its hands. Outraged Google workers took their fight public with a petition that garnered about 4,000 signatures[9], demanding that Google halt military-related projects and issue comprehensive safeguards against the potential abuses of machine learning by nefarious state or corporate actors: 'We cannot outsource the moral responsibility of our technologies to third parties. This contract puts Google's reputation at risk and stands in direct opposition to our core values.'A separate public petition[10] by the Tech Workers Coalition, an emergent labor-advocacy group in Silicon Valley, declared: 'Many of us signing this petition are faced with ethical decisions in the design and development of technology on a daily basis. We cannot ignore the moral responsibility of our work.'Current Issue <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thenation.com/issue/july-16-23-2018-issue/\">https://www.thenation.com/issue/july-16-23-2018-issue/</url> Within weeks, Google announced that it planned not to renew[11] the Project Maven contract[12] when it is set to expire in 2019, and soon issued revised internal ethical guidelines, citing 'internationally recognized' human-rights standards as general guidelines. But as Wired reported[13], the company seemed later to backtrack, couching its prohibition against Pentagon collusion in boilerplate language about 'not developing AI for use in weapons,' but remaining open to 'work with governments and the military in many other areas.' Following the fallout over Microsoft's ICE contract, CEO Satya Nadella also tried to publicly distance[14] himself[15] by denouncing Trump's immigration measures. But Google and Microsoft are hardly outliers in partnering with creepy government security ventures. Amazon markets its facial-recognition software as a law-enforcement tool[16]\u2014raising alarms about potential racial biases and privacy encroachment[17] in police surveillance technology. Hewlett Packard Enterprise and Motorola[18] have also scored hefty contracts to enhance ICE's surveillance and data-gathering systems. For all their user-friendly branding as lifestyle boosters and hubs for world-changing scientific breakthroughs, Big Tech's Orwellian ties to military and security agencies highlight Silicon Valley's potential to increase the government's reach into our networked lives. For the Google workers, their employer didn't get a pass simply because it coded an algorithm instead of pulling a trigger: Ultimately, they argued, 'the technology is being built for the military, and once it's delivered it could easily be used to assist in these tasks.' The Tech Workers Coalition continues to demand deeper reforms, including the establishment of an independent oversight system and a code of 'binding ethical standards' for tech frontiers such as AI technology, and has demanded that all the major platforms and service providers that dominate the public and private sector 'stay out of the business of war,' including IBM, Microsoft, and Amazon. But there remains no firm legal firewall between tech that serves communities and tech that controls and exploits the public sphere. Across both policing and military sectors, the national-security apparatus in the post-9/11 era is increasingly invested in 'information security.' Big Data and machine learning are supercharging federal surveillance capacity. Criminal-justice institutions are piloting controversial 'predictive policing' programs[19] that seek to profile potential criminals through demographic mapping. And the same companies that are fueling FBI fishing operations[20] are also mining our social-media feeds[21], with virtually no systematic regulation[22] of the porous interface between the security state and our online lives. So who writes the rules for transparency, ethics and human rights for a globalized, digital citizenry? One starting point for an open discussion about ethics in technology is the Toronto Declaration[23], a kind of living constitution for tech ethics that was created at the digital-activist convention RightsCon in Toronto[24] this year. The manifesto outlines guiding principles for machine learning and artificial-intelligence producers on civil liberties, equality in access, and public transparency, including a commitment to 'promote, protect and respect human rights' and to develop binding government policies and civil-society measures to hold corporations accountable to international human-rights standards.Although the Toronto Declaration focuses on preventing discrimination in consumer-facing technology, the same principles could be applied to corporate partnerships with government, particularly the agencies tasked with executing justice or war. According to Drew Mitnick, an advocate with Access Now: 'human rights law requires transparency from both sides.' Citing Apple's recent clash with the FBI over hacking iPhone data encryption, he added that both companies and the government currently have outsize leeway to control the murky interactions between government security and privacy protection, without real public oversight. 'So within the application of AI or machine learning, certainly there's an obligation on both companies and government to be transparent.' Who enforces that obligation, though, is a question of what kind of social contract is established at the intersection of civil society, Big Tech, and the state. Part of that may come through legislation or global accords, but the Microsoft and Google workers' campaigns illustrate how solutions might come from within the tech workforce itself, as it encodes a new ethical framework[25] in the form of a labor contract. A glimpse into what that worker-driven social contract might look like was highlighted in the wake of the Project Maven crisis. At the Silicon Valley feeder campus of Stanford University, students declared a preemptive strike[26] against technological evil: Technology and engineering students pledged not to interview with Google unless and until the company set a concrete policy against any collusion with the government on military-related projects. The group that issued the letter, Stanford Solidarity Network[27], explained via e-mail that its move was a way of showing the power of workers, even if they have yet to enter the workforce:Big Tech 'Our effort to withhold labor as leverage is in part based on the recognition that the development of AI requires highly trained workers who are not in high supply. Using that power to collectively shape the tech industry that we would like to participate in is at the heart of our student movement. We recognize the huge influence that these technologies have on the future of the world and we want to be able to determine what our role is in that future.' As the line between digital democracy and technological exploitation continues to blur, it might be up to workers and consumers to draft their own Information Age Bill of Rights. Whether they're coding the programs, feeding the machines as users, or deploying their platforms in the functions of government, the infinite uses and abuses of our data demands that tech workers fight to reclaim the digital commons they themselves built, and put it back in the hands of the people.

The tweak spoke to an uneasy ethical debate now echoing in the corridors of Silicon Valley as tech giants do big business with military and law enforcement, handing the keys of digital innovation to the Pentagon and Homeland Security.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Just last week, Microsoft employees brought into sharp focus the overlap between Silicon Valley's leading lights and the Trump administration's cruelest abuses, when they released <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/19/technology/tech-companies-immigration-border.html\">an open letter calling on their company</url> to cease work as a contractor for Immigration and Customs Enforcement. According to the workers, Microsoft had a $19.4 million contract to help ICE develop its surveillance operations with data-processing and artificial-intelligence technology.</p><p>Despite the company's claims that it did not directly partner with ICE on enforcement operations, the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/tech-companies-quietly-work-ice-border-crisis-continues-n885176\">rebelling workers objected to</url> any link to the agency that is ripping apart immigrant families and imprisoning refugees: \"As the people who build the technologies that Microsoft profits from, we refuse to be complicit. We are part of a growing movement, comprised of many across the industry who recognize the grave responsibility that those creating powerful technology have to ensure what they build is used for good, and not for harm.\"</p><p>Google executives got a similar disruption earlier this year when employees learned of its partnership with the Pentagon on \"Project Maven,\" an effort to weaponize artificial intelligence. Google's contract for the project, which involved \"using machine learning to identify vehicles and other objects in drone footage,\" <url normalizedValue=\"https://gizmodo.com/google-plans-not-to-renew-its-contract-for-project-mave-1826488620\">according to Gizmodo</url>, was folded into a broader set of corporate-federal \"partnerships\" aimed at enhancing agencies' cloud-computing systems. The project was set to yield as much as $250 million (though Google initially claimed the contract would be just $9 million), and more crucially, would come with       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://blog.google/products/google-cloud/extending-gcp-security-us-government-customers-through-fedramp-authorization/\">high-level security clearances</url> that would lay the groundwork for future collaborations with military projects.</p><p>It's unclear when exactly Google began cooperating on the project, but when Google staffers discovered the lucrative backdoor contract, the company had a mutiny on its hands.</p><p>Outraged Google workers took their fight public with a <url normalizedValue=\"https://static01.nyt.com/files/2018/technology/googleletter.pdf\">petition that garnered about 4,000 signatures</url>, demanding that Google halt military-related projects and issue comprehensive safeguards against the potential abuses of machine learning by nefarious state or corporate actors: \"We cannot outsource the moral responsibility of our technologies to third parties.... This contract puts Google's reputation at risk and stands in direct opposition to our core values.\"</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.coworker.org/petitions/tech-should-not-be-in-the-business-of-war\">A separate public petition</url> by the Tech Workers Coalition, an emergent labor-advocacy group in Silicon Valley, declared: \"Many of us signing this petition are faced with ethical decisions in the design and development of technology on a daily basis. We cannot ignore the moral responsibility of our work.\"</p><p>Within weeks, <url normalizedValue=\"https://gizmodo.com/google-plans-not-to-renew-its-contract-for-project-mave-1826488620\">Google announced that it planned not to renew</url>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://gizmodo.com/google-plans-not-to-renew-its-contract-for-project-mave-1826488620\">the Project Maven contract</url> when it is set to expire in 2019, and soon issued revised internal ethical guidelines, citing \"internationally recognized\" human-rights standards as general guidelines. But       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wired.com/story/google-sets-limits-on-its-use-of-ai-but-allows-defense-work/\">as Wired reported</url>, the company seemed later to backtrack, couching its prohibition against Pentagon collusion in boilerplate language about \"not developing AI for use in weapons,\" but remaining open to \"work with governments and the military in many other areas.\" Following the fallout over Microsoft's ICE contract, CEO Satya Nadella also tried to       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/my-views-us-immigration-policy-satya-nadella/?published=t\">publicly distance</url>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/my-views-us-immigration-policy-satya-nadella/?published=t\">himself</url> by denouncing Trump's immigration measures.</p><p>But Google and Microsoft are hardly outliers in partnering with creepy government security ventures. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/19/technology/tech-companies-immigration-border.html\">Amazon markets its facial-recognition software as a law-enforcement tool</url>-raising alarms about       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.aclu.org/blog/privacy-technology/surveillance-technologies/amazon-teams-government-deploy-dangerous-new\">potential racial biases and privacy encroachment</url> in police surveillance technology.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/tech/Tech-Companies-ICE-Border-Crisis-486119901.html\">Hewlett Packard Enterprise and Motorola</url> have also scored hefty contracts to enhance ICE's surveillance and data-gathering systems. For all their user-friendly branding as lifestyle boosters and hubs for world-changing scientific breakthroughs, Big Tech's Orwellian ties to military and security agencies highlight Silicon Valley's potential to increase the government's reach into our networked lives.</p><p>For the Google workers, their employer didn't get a pass simply because it coded an algorithm instead of pulling a trigger: Ultimately, they argued, \"the technology is being built for the military, and once it's delivered it could easily be used to assist in these tasks.\"</p><p>The Tech Workers Coalition continues to demand deeper reforms, including the establishment of an independent oversight system and a code of \"binding ethical standards\" for tech frontiers such as AI technology, and has demanded that all the major platforms and service providers that dominate the public and private sector \"stay out of the business of war,\" including IBM, Microsoft, and Amazon.</p><p>But there remains no firm legal firewall between tech that serves communities and tech that controls and exploits the public sphere. Across both policing and military sectors, the national-security apparatus in the post-9/11 era is increasingly invested in \"information security.\" Big Data and machine learning are supercharging federal surveillance capacity. Criminal-justice institutions are <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/26/17285058/predictive-policing-predpol-pentagon-ai-racial-bias\">piloting controversial \"predictive policing\" programs</url> that seek to profile potential criminals through demographic mapping. And the same companies that are       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://gizmodo.com/facebook-says-government-requests-for-user-data-rose-21-1821396547\">fueling FBI fishing operations</url> are also       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/28/all-the-data-facebook-google-has-on-you-privacy\">mining our social-media feeds</url>, with       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/19/opinion/facebook-cambridge-analytica.html\">virtually no systematic regulation</url> of the porous interface between the security state and our online lives. So who writes the rules for transparency, ethics and human rights for a globalized, digital citizenry?</p><p>One starting point for an open discussion about ethics in technology is the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/16/17361356/toronto-declaration-machine-learning-algorithmic-discrimination-rightscon\">Toronto Declaration</url>, a kind of living constitution for tech ethics that was created at the       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.rightscon.org/\">digital-activist convention RightsCon in Toronto</url> this year. The manifesto outlines guiding principles for machine learning and artificial-intelligence producers on civil liberties, equality in access, and public transparency, including a commitment to \"promote, protect and respect human rights\" and to develop binding government policies and civil-society measures to hold corporations accountable to international human-rights standards.</p><p>Although the Toronto Declaration focuses on preventing discrimination in consumer-facing technology, the same principles could be applied to corporate partnerships with government, particularly the agencies tasked with executing justice or war. According to Drew Mitnick, an advocate with Access Now: \"human rights law requires transparency from both sides.\" Citing Apple's recent clash with the FBI over hacking iPhone data encryption, he added that both companies and the government currently have outsize leeway to control the murky interactions between government security and privacy protection, without real public oversight. \"So within the application of AI or machine learning, certainly there's an obligation on both companies and government to be transparent.\"</p><p>Who enforces that obligation, though, is a question of what kind of social contract is established at the intersection of civil society, Big Tech, and the state. Part of that may come through legislation or global accords, but the Microsoft and Google workers' campaigns illustrate how solutions might come from within the tech workforce itself, as it <url normalizedValue=\"https://medium.com/tech-workers-coalition/tech-workers-platform-workers-and-workers-inquiry-92fbc6369647\">encodes a new ethical framework</url> in the form of a labor contract.</p><p>A glimpse into what that worker-driven social contract might look like was highlighted in the wake of the Project Maven crisis. At the Silicon Valley feeder campus of Stanford University, <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/solidarityntwrk/status/1003681951192977408\">students declared a preemptive strike</url> against technological evil: Technology and engineering students pledged not to interview with Google unless and until the company set a concrete policy against any collusion with the government on military-related projects. The group that issued the letter,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.stanforddaily.com/2018/06/05/amid-drone-program-controversy-students-boycott-google-internships/\">Stanford Solidarity Network</url>, explained via e-mail that its move was a way of showing the power of workers, even if they have yet to enter the workforce:</p><p>\"Our effort to withhold labor as leverage is in part based on the recognition that the development of AI requires highly trained workers who are not in high supply. Using that power to collectively shape the tech industry that we would like to participate in is at the heart of our student movement. We recognize the huge influence that these technologies have on the future of the world and we want to be able to determine what our role is in that future.\"</p><p>As the line between digital democracy and technological exploitation continues to blur, it might be up to workers and consumers to draft their own Information Age Bill of Rights. Whether they're coding the programs, feeding the machines as users, or deploying their platforms in the functions of government, the infinite uses and abuses of our data demands that tech workers fight to reclaim the digital commons they themselves built, and put it back in the hands of the people.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NATMAG-285292</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NATMAG2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VYJ-BBD1-DXR3-21V2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">465017</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1574\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Nation Company, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Nation Magazine</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"7718\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"06\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>June 27, 2018 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>N921100MM</classCode><className>US FEDERAL GOVERNMENT</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MkM1MTYwRDE0NkJBNEVFMEIxQjM3RUE2NDRFQUFEODY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA</classCode><className>Federal Government</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST00097CP</classCode><className>DEFENSE DEPARTMENTS</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MTFBQjNDMzE0RjU1NEVDREJERTlFQUU2OTkzN0VCMjk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RUZFQjE4NzUwODAyNDUzMzgxQzIxMUNBMTg2RTc5MTI</classCode><className>US Department of Defense</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000654</classCode><className>ETHICS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009FJK</classCode><className>NEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DEHO</classCode><className>TECHNICIANS &amp;

And before its obtainment, the default setting should go against the collection or use of data.</p><p>Second, the ACCC recommended that consumers be granted a \"direct right\" to bring individual or class actions against tech firms for privacy breaches.</p><p>If the review's recommendations were implemented in full, the right may also extend to new protections afforded to consumers.</p><p>This includes an entitlement to have personal information erased off a platform (in the absence of overriding contractual or public interests reasons) and the creation of statutory torts for serious privacy invasions that are not covered by the Privacy Act.</p><p>Third, the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC) would be charged with developing an enforceable code of practice for all digital platforms.</p><p>OAIC flagged on Friday the protection of children's data, especially from targeted advertising and online profiling, for inclusion in such a code.</p><p>Information Commissioner and Privacy Commissioner Angelene Falk welcomed the ACCC's recommendations as a \"significant step forwards in protecting our privacy rights while supporting [economic] growth\".</p><p>Fourth, the competition regulator urged the government to undertake broader reform in Australia's privacy, contract, and unfair trading laws.</p><p>Under the first of these, the Privacy Act could be expanded to include exempted entities like small businesses and political parties, and types of data like inferred or de-identified information.</p><p>ACCC chairman Rod Sims said these actions would be \"vital in dealing with the problems associated with digital platforms' market power and the accumulation of consumers' data\".</p><p>Australia Privacy Foundation chair David Vaile said the ACCC's report was commendable, but that questions remained over definition and enforcement.</p><p>Mr Vaile said technology firms must not be allowed to skirt the intent of the law through \"contract fundamentalism\" - a reliance on technicalities and loopholes.</p><p>\"Lawyers may say you've clicked those things ... [but] the reality is that most consumers are clueless, and don't understand the significance at the time,\" he said.</p><p>This would require clear and comprehensive definitions - for example, the right to have personal information erased should encompass metadata as well as \"certain, surface parts of the data\".</p><p>And it would require schemes to protect consumers' right to bring a suit against technology firms without being buried in legal costs, he said.</p><p>Mr Vaile said he feared that the ACCC report may fall short of the \"historic challenge\" that technology firms posed to consumers and to broader society. \"I query whether the recommendations acknowledge or identify that scale of risk,\" he said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFRONL-1520160198</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFRONL2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WNB-XRH1-JBJ7-N2R3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">429670</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"606\"/><timeReceived>05:01 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

Pariah to unlikely hero Chris Jordan's resolve crackles down the telephone from a car somewhere near Newcastle. Close to 80 of the 800 Australian names in the Panama Papers appear in the Australian Crime Commission's database for serious and organised crime, he       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.afr.com/news/policy/tax/the-panama-papers-oecd-emergency-meeting-as-crime-links-emerge-20160412-go4l98\">reveals for the first time</url>.\"And let me tell you, they're not there for not paying parking fines, these are serious criminals,\" he said.It's April 11, seven days after the       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://data.afr.com/pages/panamapapers/pm.html\">leak of documents</url> from Panama law firm Mossack Fonseca, led by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, and it's difficult to imagine any of Australian Tax Commissioner Jordan's predecessors having this conversation.\"He cuts right to the point, that's why we love him,\" a regulator in another agency comments the following day. </p><p>\"It's also a learning curve for some.\"In person Jordan is affable and engaged. In a series of interviews in the past two years it's clear that, while he doesn't really enjoy the media process, he's getting much better at it. He's feisty and he's indefatigable.Three and a half years after he left his senior role at KPMG to lead the Australian Tax Office, Jordan has transformed much of the way the it works. Just as importantly he has changed the way the ATO is perceived. Clear sign It's easy to miss the scale of this change - and the change in institutional power it denotes.The clearest sign came in April last year when Jordan was called before the Senate inquiry into corporate tax avoidance led by Labor senator Sam Dastyari. The script of such inquiries - really, any encounter between politicians and the tax office - usually writes itself. Because who likes the taxman?The inquiry had been set up by the Greens after a Tax Justice Network report highlighted how many companies had no taxable income. And while senators would target multinationals such as Apple and Google, the real target was always likely to be the ATO and why it was failing.Jordan<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.afr.com/news/policy/tax/sam-dastyari-slams-tax-office-for-withholding-documents-20150407-1mfyc3\">clashed with Dastyari</url> from the start. Dastyari wanted Jordan to breach ATO secrecy rules to reveal names of big mining companies redacted from ATO documents and Jordan refused.\"I didn't think this was a precedent I wanted to have,\" Jordan said later.Yet within days the political position had been completely reversed, with Jordan following up on his promise that, while he would not disclose taxpayer information, he would respond when he believed companies had       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.afr.com/news/policy/tax/tax-offices-chris-jordan-to-call-out-false-records-by-apple-microsoft-google-20150408-1mgmhi\">misled the inquiry</url>.Jordan told the inquiry that claims by BHP Billiton, Rio Tinto, Apple, Microsoft and Google that they were not profit shifting       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.afr.com/news/policy/tax/atos-chris-jordan-contests-bhp-rio-apple-microsoft-google-on-tax-20150422-1mqglk\">should not be taken at face valu</url>e, revealing Rio paid more than $100 million to settle a tax bill while BHP subsequently revealed a $522 million tax bill. Jordan emerged from the inquiry as the man of the moment, not a whipping boy but rather an unlikely hero, in terms of public perception.Since then politicians from both sides have sought his viewpoint, as he has expressed increasing resolve to pursue tax avoidance.He is the government's point man on anything from multinationals to foreign property investors. These are conversations that five years ago might have been led by the head of Treasury. And as Jordan's predecessor, Michael D'Ascenzo, is on the Foreign Investment Review Board, the tax office's input into government policy and regulation is increasing. Momentum player When Jordan became commissioner in January 2013 he inherited an organisation under pressure to cut costs as falling commodity prices eroded the revenue base, just as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development launched a historic attempt to rein in multinational tax avoidance (called Base Erosion Profit Shifting).Jordan is a momentum player, a master of the front-foot response to a crisis. But he concedes that addressing the ATO's cost base was essential before anything else could be attempted.By 2019 ATO staffing will be 23 per cent down from its peak in 2009, while its costs as a proportion of gross revenue collected are being slashed from 0.87 per cent in 2010 to 0.5 per cent in 2019.In the last budget, the ATO received $679 million over four years to target tax avoidance by multinational companies and high-wealth individuals (it expects to raise $3.7 billion from this). But at the end of the project, general funding will be down 23.5 per cent from 2014 in real terms.Jordan also took a hard look at the legal cases the ATO was fighting and made some tough calls to settle many of them, while pursuing others - such as the successful Chevron transfer pricing case.Jordan's success at Dastyari's tax inquiry wasn't a one-off. In October 2013, 10 months into the job, Jordan attended a meeting of the OECD's Forum on Tax Administration (FTA) and proposed an international collaboration to       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.afr.com/technology/china-australia-take-on-tech-giants-over-tax-20140505-iu08w\">target big tech companies</url>, including Apple and Google.Jordan led a six-country investigation that set up new protocols to share information - a project that US officials opposed after lobbying by US tech companies. Australia was halfway through a tax amnesty program, Project Do It, in October 2014 when the ICIJ revealed LuxLeaks - the leak of hundreds of secret tax deals by the Luxembourg government.Jordan immediately wrote to tax commissioners around the world to organise a coordinated response to the revelations. Panama Papers When the Panama Papers story broke on April 2 this year, Jordan was immediately on the front foot, revealing that       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.afr.com/news/policy/tax/tax-office-targets-800-australians-in-global-tax-haven-probe-20160329-gnt9ko\">more than 800 Australians</url> on earlier Mossack Fonseca lists were under investigation.Four days later he used his position as chairman of the FTA's working body, the Joint International Tax Shelter Information and Collaboration Network,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.afr.com/news/policy/tax/the-panama-papers-ato-calls-emergency-oecd-meeting-over-mossack-fonseca-files-20160408-go1yvr\">to call a meeting</url> of tax officials from 35 countries to share information and coordinate a response to the Mossack Fonseca documents.That's how he came to be giving an interview on April 11 about the links of Panama Papers-named Australians to serious crime. The task force that was set up in Paris the next day was a scaled-up version of his earlier model to target tech companies.Before the Senate Estimates Committee in February, Jordan gave his extraordinarily blunt \"enough is enough\" speech.\"The excuses we sometimes hear from these companies are, frankly, over the top,\" he said, appearing to refer to tech companies and other big corporates.\"Their clear tactic is to delay and obstruct. They game the system ... These companies have pushed the envelope on reasonableness. They play games. They string us along. They believe we can be stooged. However, enough is enough and no more of this.\"It's a message that resonates across both sides of politics, feeding into a worldwide public response against multinational companies that pay no tax.\"I will not stand by and admire the problem,\" Jordan told a hastily reconvened tax inquiry last month.In this age of regulators, Jordan is not just on to it. He's disappearing around the corner.Like Leadership with the Financial Review on       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.facebook.com/AFRLeadership/\">Facebook</url>.

Close to 80 of the 800 Australian names in the Panama Papers appear in the Australian Crime Commission's database for serious and organised crime, he <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.afr.com/news/policy/tax/the-panama-papers-oecd-emergency-meeting-as-crime-links-emerge-20160412-go4l98\">reveals for the first time</url>.</p><p>\"And let me tell you, they're not there for not paying parking fines, these are serious criminals,\" he said.</p><p>It's April 11, seven days after the <url normalizedValue=\"http://data.afr.com/pages/panamapapers/pm.html\">leak of documents</url> from Panama law firm Mossack Fonseca, led by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, and it's difficult to imagine any of Australian Tax Commissioner Jordan's predecessors having this conversation.</p><p>\"He cuts right to the point, that's why we love him,\" a regulator in another agency comments the following day. \"It's also a learning curve for some.\"</p><p>In person Jordan is affable and engaged. In a series of interviews in the past two years it's clear that, while he doesn't really enjoy the media process, he's getting much better at it. He's feisty and he's indefatigable.</p><p>Three and a half years after he left his senior role at KPMG to lead the Australian Tax Office, Jordan has transformed much of the way the it works. Just as importantly he has changed the way the ATO is perceived.</p><h>Clear sign</h><p/><p>It's easy to miss the scale of this change - and the change in institutional power it denotes.</p><p>The clearest sign came in April last year when Jordan was called before the Senate inquiry into corporate tax avoidance led by Labor senator Sam Dastyari. The script of such inquiries - really, any encounter between politicians and the tax office - usually writes itself. Because who likes the taxman?</p><p>The inquiry had been set up by the Greens after a Tax Justice Network report highlighted how many companies had no taxable income. And while senators would target multinationals such as Apple and Google, the real target was always likely to be the ATO and why it was failing.</p><p>Jordan<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.afr.com/news/policy/tax/sam-dastyari-slams-tax-office-for-withholding-documents-20150407-1mfyc3\">clashed with Dastyari</url> from the start. Dastyari wanted Jordan to breach ATO secrecy rules to reveal names of big mining companies redacted from ATO documents and Jordan refused.</p><p>\"I didn't think this was a precedent I wanted to have,\" Jordan said later.</p><p>Yet within days the political position had been completely reversed, with Jordan following up on his promise that, while he would not disclose taxpayer information, he would respond when he believed companies had <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.afr.com/news/policy/tax/tax-offices-chris-jordan-to-call-out-false-records-by-apple-microsoft-google-20150408-1mgmhi\">misled the inquiry</url>.</p><p>Jordan told the inquiry that claims by BHP Billiton, Rio Tinto, Apple, Microsoft and Google that they were not profit shifting <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.afr.com/news/policy/tax/atos-chris-jordan-contests-bhp-rio-apple-microsoft-google-on-tax-20150422-1mqglk\">should not be taken at face valu</url>e, revealing Rio paid more than $100 million to settle a tax bill while BHP subsequently revealed a $522 million tax bill. Jordan emerged from the inquiry as the man of the moment, not a whipping boy but rather an unlikely hero, in terms of public perception.</p><p>Since then politicians from both sides have sought his viewpoint, as he has expressed increasing resolve to pursue tax avoidance.</p><p>He is the government's point man on anything from multinationals to foreign property investors. These are conversations that five years ago might have been led by the head of Treasury. And as Jordan's predecessor, Michael D'Ascenzo, is on the Foreign Investment Review Board, the tax office's input into government policy and regulation is increasing.</p><h>Momentum player</h><p/><p>When Jordan became commissioner in January 2013 he inherited an organisation under pressure to cut costs as falling commodity prices eroded the revenue base, just as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development launched a historic attempt to rein in multinational tax avoidance (called Base Erosion Profit Shifting).</p><p>Jordan is a momentum player, a master of the front-foot response to a crisis. But he concedes that addressing the ATO's cost base was essential before anything else could be attempted.</p><p>By 2019 ATO staffing will be 23 per cent down from its peak in 2009, while its costs as a proportion of gross revenue collected are being slashed from 0.87 per cent in 2010 to 0.5 per cent in 2019.</p><p>In the last budget, the ATO received $679 million over four years to target tax avoidance by multinational companies and high-wealth individuals (it expects to raise $3.7 billion from this). But at the end of the project, general funding will be down 23.5 per cent from 2014 in real terms.</p><p>Jordan also took a hard look at the legal cases the ATO was fighting and made some tough calls to settle many of them, while pursuing others - such as the successful Chevron transfer pricing case.</p><p>Jordan's success at Dastyari's tax inquiry wasn't a one-off. In October 2013, 10 months into the job, Jordan attended a meeting of the OECD's Forum on Tax Administration (FTA) and proposed an international collaboration to <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.afr.com/technology/china-australia-take-on-tech-giants-over-tax-20140505-iu08w\">target big tech companies</url>, including Apple and Google.</p><p>Jordan led a six-country investigation that set up new protocols to share information - a project that US officials opposed after lobbying by US tech companies. Australia was halfway through a tax amnesty program, Project Do It, in October 2014 when the ICIJ revealed LuxLeaks - the leak of hundreds of secret tax deals by the Luxembourg government.</p><p>Jordan immediately wrote to tax commissioners around the world to organise a coordinated response to the revelations.</p><h>Panama Papers</h><p/><p>When the Panama Papers story broke on April 2 this year, Jordan was immediately on the front foot, revealing that <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.afr.com/news/policy/tax/tax-office-targets-800-australians-in-global-tax-haven-probe-20160329-gnt9ko\">more than 800 Australians</url> on earlier Mossack Fonseca lists were under investigation.</p><p>Four days later he used his position as chairman of the FTA's working body, the Joint International Tax Shelter Information and Collaboration Network, <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.afr.com/news/policy/tax/the-panama-papers-ato-calls-emergency-oecd-meeting-over-mossack-fonseca-files-20160408-go1yvr\">to call a meeting</url> of tax officials from 35 countries to share information and coordinate a response to the Mossack Fonseca documents.</p><p>That's how he came to be giving an interview on April 11 about the links of Panama Papers-named Australians to serious crime. The task force that was set up in Paris the next day was a scaled-up version of his earlier model to target tech companies.</p><p>Before the Senate Estimates Committee in February, Jordan gave his extraordinarily blunt \"enough is enough\" speech.</p><p>\"The excuses we sometimes hear from these companies are, frankly, over the top,\" he said, appearing to refer to tech companies and other big corporates.</p><p>\"Their clear tactic is to delay and obstruct. They game the system ... These companies have pushed the envelope on reasonableness. They play games. They string us along. They believe we can be stooged. However, enough is enough and no more of this.\"</p><p>It's a message that resonates across both sides of politics, feeding into a worldwide public response against multinational companies that pay no tax.</p><p>\"I will not stand by and admire the problem,\" Jordan told a hastily reconvened tax inquiry last month.</p><p>In this age of regulators, Jordan is not just on to it. He's disappearing around the corner.</p><p>Like Leadership with the Financial Review on <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.facebook.com/AFRLeadership/\">Facebook</url>.

Fears about \"politically arbitrary\" challenges to deals have reportedly been  of some tech giants.</p><p>The fact that a federal judge emphatically rejected the DOJ's suit doesn't necessarily mean tech giant will soon make 10 and 11-figure bids for companies that they were previously nervous about pursuing. However, just as the Trump Administration's arrival encouraged T-Mobile US  to roll the dice on a Sprint deal that still isn't guaranteed approval, the AT&amp;T/Time Warner ruling might just make companies like Apple  , Alphabet/Google  and Amazon.com  , who collectively have been restrained in their M&amp;A activity as of late, decide the risk/reward is favorable for going after a large company operating in an adjacent field.</p><p>Netflix  , meanwhile, will likely be pleased if the ruling paves the way for Comcast  , rather than Disney  , to acquire the bulk of Fox Networks's  assets. Following the ruling,  that a bidding war between Comcast and Disney will soon break out for Fox, which last fall struck a deal to sell most of its assets to Disney.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Apple, Alphabet, Amazon and Comcast are holdings in Jim Cramer's </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">. Want to be alerted before Jim Cramer buys or sells AAPL, GOOGL, AMZN or CMCSA? </emphasis><br/><br/> A successful bid by Comcast would admittedly make it easier for the telecom giant to bundle streaming services featuring content from Fox and the company's NBCUniversal unit -- this could include Hulu, which NBCUniversal and Fox collectively own 60% of -- with its pay-TV, broadband and/or mobile services. However, that's arguably less of a threat to Netflixthan  adding family-friendly Fox material to its upcoming streaming service and leveraging Fox's many international assets to strengthen its overseas streaming footprint.</p><p>Markets certainly don't seem worried about an AT&amp;T/Time Warner tie-up's impact on Netflix. After slipping in after-hours trading in the wake of the court ruling, possibly due to concerns about AT&amp;T's efforts to bundle Time Warner's content with its telecom and pay-TV services, Netflixis up more than 4% in Wednesday trading and making new highs. A $100 Goldman Sachs  seems to be helping.</p><p>To the extent that the bundling of HBO and possibly other Time Warner content assets can act as a selling point for AT&amp;T services, Verizon  and T-Mobile might not be thrilled with the ruling. However, AT&amp;T<url normalizedValue=\"http://about.att.com/story/unlimited_wireless_plan_hbo.html\">has been bundling</url>HBO with unlimited wireless plans since April 2017, and has been offering free and discounted access to HBO to subscribers of its DirecTV Now online TV service since November 2016. In spite of these moves, Verizon and T-Mobile have been outperforming AT&amp;T in terms of wireless postpaid phone subscriber adds.</p><p>Moreover, AT&amp;T's management will have its hand full in the near-term integrating Time Warner. And between Time Warner's debt load and the fact that slightly over half of the payout to Time Warner shareholders consists of cash, the deal stands to bring AT&amp;T's total debt balance above $200 billion. Consequently, it wouldn't be surprising to see Ma Bell restrain its telecom capital spending over the next few years -- AT&amp;T's capex is set to rise by  in 2018 to roughly $25 billion -- as it tries to pare its debt load.</p><p>All of that could leave Verizon and T-Mobile well-positioned to take more mobile share from AT&amp;T. It's worth noting here that as AT&amp;T gets set to digest a media giant, Verizon is just a few days removed from announcing that former Ericsson<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"/>chief Hans Vestberg will soon be its CEO. That move  as a sign that Verizon plans to prioritize telecom/network investments relative to its online media efforts, which at best have yielded mixed results to date.</p><p>Overall, the AT&amp;T/Time Warner ruling feels like more of a positive than a negative for big tech, and perhaps also big telecom. Some of the concerns about the competitive threat posed by an AT&amp;T/Time Warner combo appear a little overblown, and some of the positive implications of the DOJ suit's rejection for tech and telecom firms haven't gotten enough attention.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TSC-14621048</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TSC2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SJJ-6RT1-JCHV-V3XH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">220623</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-12-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"753\"/><timeReceived>1:30 PM EDT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 TheStreet.com, Inc.

But the most likely outcome as it stands now is that the nation will yet again ask a baby boomer to fix what the baby boom broke. And it's a lot to fix.</p><p>\"We have Social Security. We have the national debt. We have what's called 'deferred maintenance' in infrastructure. And of course we have the climate,\" Bruce Gibney, author of \"A Generation of Sociopaths,\" said in the first episode of \"Baby Bust,\" the new POLITICO Money podcast series on the political and financial legacy of the baby boom generation. \"I think the main impediment right now is the death grip the boomers have had over the political system.\"</p><p>What went wrong</p><p>That death grip could hold at least another four and perhaps eight years in the White House.</p><p>Gibney and other critics of the baby boom generation argue that the huge cohort that came of age in the prosperous years after World War II spent much of their time in power cutting their own taxes, ensuring that giant entitlement programs are protected - at least for themselves - and doing little to protect the environment or invest in American infrastructure or address the mounting student loan crisis.</p><p>It wasn't entirely their fault, students of the generation say. Boomers just grew up at a time when everything was fairly awesome and people assumed they would stay that way.</p><p>The baby boomers \"grew up in an era when there was something close to full employment almost all the time. Wages were going up with productivity, and productivity was going up very fast. Incomes were growing at the rate of 2 percent a year, something that we haven't seen since,\" said Ruy Teixeira, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress and himself a boomer. \"The baby boom happened to get older at the same time that America adopted an economic model that was actually pretty counter-productive, which did not actually produce rising wages and incomes for people at a very good clip, that enhanced inequality.\"</p><p>A bipartisan generational critique</p><p>The first boomer president, Bill Clinton, did raise taxes in the early 1990s and briefly created government surpluses after all the charts and warnings and televised lectures from Ross Perot. But he also suffered an ugly impeachment over personal misbehavior and efforts to cover it up.</p><p>And progressives blame him for expanding the penal state, cutting capital gains taxes for the rich and engaging in petty personal feuds with then-House Speaker Newt Gingrich - another boomer - leading to government shutdowns and the dawn of the kind of scorched earth, Forever War politics that now dominate Washington.</p><p>President George W. Bush, far from addressing government funding problems, engaged in a short-lived movement to privatize Social Security and added an expensive prescription drug program to Medicare whose main beneficiary was older Americans. His presidency was then largely consumed by the massive and costly post-9/11 war on terror, leaving concerns about climate, entitlements and infrastructure spending aside.</p><p>President Barack Obama - technically a late-era boomer but more Gen X by personal temperament - attempted to strike a \"grand bargain\" with tea party-led Republicans and then-House Speaker John Boehner to address long-term entitlement sustainability and spending issues along with significant tax hikes.</p><p>But it all fell apart when progressives balked at entitlement overhauls and Republicans at tax hikes. The brief bipartisan moment when it seemed like some real change might happen vanished as quickly as it appeared.</p><p>The rise of Trump</p><p>Following Obama - whom many Gen Xers claim as one of their own - boomers helped elect another boomer, Donald Trump, partly on his promises to restore manufacturing greatness while also not touching any entitlements for those at or nearing retirement.</p><p>Trump essentially junked the entire approach of the tea party movement in favor of far greater spending on the military - along with Democratic priorities to secure the Pentagon money - and signed a $2 trillion tax cut that slashed rates for corporations and rich people with a little thrown in for everyone else. Under Trump's watch, the annual deficit has grown close to $1 trillion and the national debt to over $22 trillion.</p><p>The GOP has essentially returned to the ethos of former vice president Dick Cheney - that deficits don't matter - after they spent the Obama presidency threatening shutdowns and debt defaults over out-of-control spending. Critics of Trump's fiscal approach argue the tax cut was the last gasp of the baby boom attempting to direct money to itself.</p><p>\"The tax cut that was passed [in 2017] is the best example,\" said author and attorney Steven Brill, also a baby boomer. \"Most of the money the corporations have saved through that tax cut have gone to buybacks of stocks, which make the shareholders richer.\"</p><p>Trump also pledged to pull the U.S. out of the Paris climate agreement aimed at sharply reducing emissions and rolled back many environmental regulations of the Obama White House.</p><p>Through all of this, presidents and Congresses of both parties, largely governed by baby boomers, did little to address what engineers suggest are nearly $5 trillion in infrastructure updates needed in the U.S. as rising powers like China pour massive resources into such projects. Calling every week \"infrastructure week\" has become a running joke in political circles.</p><p>Baby boomers in power, according to their critics, have done a fairly good job of ensuring that Social Security and Medicare will be protected for those at or near retirement - including tens of millions of boomers - but much less to ensure they will be fully funded for later retirees including Gen X, millennials and Gen Z.</p><p>Social Security and Medicare might not be going broke. But the outlook isn't great.</p><p>\"As long as people are working there will be at least money coming into Social Security,\" said Nancy Altman, chair of the board of directors of the Pension Rights Center. \"Even if Congress did nothing whatsoever, people would get three-quarters of their scheduled benefits, which is not good enough, but it isn't nothing.\"</p><p>Boomers defended </p><p>Many baby boomers defend the generation's contributions, citing advances in gender equality, the protest movement against the Vietnam war and the civil rights movement (even though most landmark civil and voting rights laws were passed when the median boomer was around 12 years old).</p><p>Some also argue that it's not fair to look at political failures through a purely generational lens, arguing that plenty of boomers (including Warren and Sanders) have long argued for more forward-thinking, less self-interested policies but failed to win enough power to enact them. And they say there is still a legacy the baby boom can leave to Gen X, millennials and Gen Z as those generations finally take over political power.</p><p>\"Typical Xer, you're saying, 'Yeah, they gave us diet foods and yoga,'\" said Neil Howe, managing director of demography at Hedgeye and a leading theorist on generational cycles. \"I think boomers gave younger generations a language of communitarianism and whole-ism that they are going to use when it comes time to bind this country back together again.\"</p><p>The boomer Democrats </p><p>The current crop of Democratic candidates is dominated by boomers and near-boomers including Biden, Warren and Sanders who are one, two and three in nearly every national and state poll. Biden has largely based his campaign around taking another shot at the Obama approach that sought to address major structural problems like climate change, entitlements and debt through coalition-building, both domestically and in international accords like the Paris treaty and the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a giant trade deal meant in part to counter China's rise as a global economic and military power.</p><p>Obama's biggest legacy, the Affordable Care Act, was more of an incremental approach to driving down costs and making care more accessible. Biden has defended the law but is struggling to beat back challenges from the left that what is needed is not incrementalism but radical change including wealth taxes, \"Medicare for All,\" student loan forgiveness and free college. Entire industries, including big tech and Wall Street, need to be busted up and reformed, according to the Warren and Sanders view of the world.</p><p>For progressives and economists who believe deficits and debt really don't matter at all, this is a welcome change in political direction. And Warren and Sanders both have widespread support from many younger voters.</p><p>But Warren has now found herself in something of a political quagmire as she promises to explain how she would pay for government-funded health care for all with estimates of the cost at around $3 trillion a year without boosting taxes on the middle class.</p><p>The millennial Democrat </p><p>Into all this comes Buttigieg, running as a millennial alternative to all the older candidates as well as more of a centrist who wants to take on structural problems left by the boomers but not in ways that send deficits and debt into the stratosphere.</p><p>\"You have a different sense of urgency around these issues if you're expecting in your lifetime to be dealing with them personally,\" Buttigieg said on the podcast. \"So by 2054, when I get to the current age of the current president, the shape of the world then, both environmentally, economically and beyond, that's not a theoretical question; it's a personal one that I have to prepare for just as a human being.\"</p><p>Buttigieg added that, \"There's just no way we can get very far into the next few decades on this tax policy without a fiscal time bomb going off.\"</p><p>And as for the baby boom legacy? \"I think a lot of wrong decisions get made out of just a kind of political or moral laziness that says that certain consequences, because they're going to hit down the road, aren't consequences for the politicians who are dealing with them, especially politicians who work one election cycle at a time,\" Buttigieg said.</p><p>What about Gen X?</p><p>Generation X, those born between 1965 and 1980, may never find themselves with a president to call their own, even if they lay claim to Obama, who was born in 1961.

But the most likely outcome as it stands now is that the nation will yet again ask a baby boomer to fix what the baby boom broke. And it's a lot to fix.</p><p>\"We have Social Security. We have the national debt. We have what's called 'deferred maintenance' in infrastructure. And of course we have the climate,\" Bruce Gibney, author of \"A Generation of Sociopaths,\" said in the first episode of \"Baby Bust,\" the new POLITICO Money podcast series on the political and financial legacy of the baby boom generation. \"I think the main impediment right now is the death grip the boomers have had over the political system.\"</p><p>What went wrong</p><p>That death grip could hold at least another four and perhaps eight years in the White House.</p><p>Gibney and other critics of the baby boom generation argue that the huge cohort that came of age in the prosperous years after World War II spent much of their time in power cutting their own taxes, ensuring that giant entitlement programs are protected - at least for themselves - and doing little to protect the environment or invest in American infrastructure or address the mounting student loan crisis.</p><p>It wasn't entirely their fault, students of the generation say. Boomers just grew up at a time when everything was fairly awesome and people assumed they would stay that way.</p><p>The baby boomers \"grew up in an era when there was something close to full employment almost all the time. Wages were going up with productivity, and productivity was going up very fast. Incomes were growing at the rate of 2 percent a year, something that we haven't seen since,\" said Ruy Teixeira, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress and himself a boomer. \"The baby boom happened to get older at the same time that America adopted an economic model that was actually pretty counter-productive, which did not actually produce rising wages and incomes for people at a very good clip, that enhanced inequality.\"</p><p>A bipartisan generational critique</p><p>The first boomer president, Bill Clinton, did raise taxes in the early 1990s and briefly created government surpluses after all the charts and warnings and televised lectures from Ross Perot. But he also suffered an ugly impeachment over personal misbehavior and efforts to cover it up.</p><p>And progressives blame him for expanding the penal state, cutting capital gains taxes for the rich and engaging in petty personal feuds with then-House Speaker Newt Gingrich - another boomer - leading to government shutdowns and the dawn of the kind of scorched earth, Forever War politics that now dominate Washington.</p><p>President George W. Bush, far from addressing government funding problems, engaged in a short-lived movement to privatize Social Security and added an expensive prescription drug program to Medicare whose main beneficiary was older Americans. His presidency was then largely consumed by the massive and costly post-9/11 war on terror, leaving concerns about climate, entitlements and infrastructure spending aside.</p><p>Barack Obama - technically a late-era boomer but more Gen X by personal temperament - attempted to strike a \"grand bargain\" with tea party-led Republicans and then-House Speaker John Boehner to address long-term entitlement sustainability and spending issues along with significant tax hikes.</p><p>But it all fell apart when progressives balked at entitlement overhauls and Republicans at tax hikes. The brief bipartisan moment when it seemed like some real change might happen vanished as quickly as it appeared.</p><p>The rise of Trump</p><p>Following Obama - whom many Gen Xers claim as one of their own - boomers helped elect another boomer, Donald Trump, partly on his promises to restore manufacturing greatness while also not touching any entitlements for those at or nearing retirement.</p><p>Trump essentially junked the entire approach of the tea party movement in favor of far greater spending on the military - along with Democratic priorities to secure the Pentagon money - and signed a $2 trillion tax cut that slashed rates for corporations and rich people with a little thrown in for everyone else. Under Trump's watch, the annual deficit has grown close to $1 trillion and the national debt to over $22 trillion.</p><p>The GOP has essentially returned to the ethos of former vice president Dick Cheney - that deficits don't matter - after they spent the Obama presidency threatening shutdowns and debt defaults over out-of-control spending. Critics of Trump's fiscal approach argue the tax cut was the last gasp of the baby boom attempting to direct money to itself.</p><p>\"The tax cut that was passed [in 2017] is the best example,\" said author and attorney Steven Brill, also a baby boomer. \"Most of the money the corporations have saved through that tax cut have gone to buybacks of stocks, which make the shareholders richer.\"</p><p>Trump also pledged to pull the U.S. out of the Paris climate agreement aimed at sharply reducing emissions and rolled back many environmental regulations of the Obama White House.</p><p>Through all of this, presidents and Congresses of both parties, largely governed by baby boomers, did little to address what engineers suggest are nearly $5 trillion in infrastructure updates needed in the U.S. as rising powers like China pour massive resources into such projects. Calling every week \"infrastructure week\" has become a running joke in political circles.</p><p>Baby boomers in power, according to their critics, have done a fairly good job of ensuring that Social Security and Medicare will be protected for those at or near retirement - including tens of millions of boomers - but much less to ensure they will be fully funded for later retirees including Gen X, millennials and Gen Z.</p><p>Social Security and Medicare might not be going broke. But the outlook isn't great.</p><p>\"As long as people are working there will be at least money coming into Social Security,\" said Nancy Altman, chair of the board of directors of the Pension Rights Center. \"Even if Congress did nothing whatsoever, people would get three-quarters of their scheduled benefits, which is not good enough, but it isn't nothing.\"</p><p>Boomers defended </p><p>Many baby boomers defend the generation's contributions, citing advances in gender equality, the protest movement against the Vietnam war and the civil rights movement (even though most landmark civil and voting rights laws were passed when the median boomer was around 12 years old).</p><p>Some also argue that it's not fair to look at political failures through a purely generational lens, arguing that plenty of boomers (including Warren and Sanders) have long argued for more forward-thinking, less self-interested policies but failed to win enough power to enact them. And they say there is still a legacy the baby boom can leave to Gen X, millennials and Gen Z as those generations finally take over political power.</p><p>\"Typical Xer, you're saying, 'Yeah, they gave us diet foods and yoga,'\" said Neil Howe, managing director of demography at Hedgeye and a leading theorist on generational cycles. \"I think boomers gave younger generations a language of communitarianism and whole-ism that they are going to use when it comes time to bind this country back together again.\"</p><p>The boomer Democrats </p><p>The current crop of Democratic candidates is dominated by boomers and near-boomers including Biden, Warren and Sanders who are one, two and three in nearly every national and state poll. Biden has largely based his campaign around taking another shot at the Obama approach that sought to address major structural problems like climate change, entitlements and debt through coalition-building, both domestically and in international accords like the Paris treaty and the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a giant trade deal meant in part to counter China's rise as a global economic and military power.</p><p>Obama's biggest legacy, the Affordable Care Act, was more of an incremental approach to driving down costs and making care more accessible. Biden has defended the law but is struggling to beat back challenges from the left that what is needed is not incrementalism but radical change including wealth taxes, \"Medicare for All,\" student loan forgiveness and free college. Entire industries, including big tech and Wall Street, need to be busted up and reformed, according to the Warren and Sanders view of the world.</p><p>For progressives and economists who believe deficits and debt really don't matter at all, this is a welcome change in political direction. And Warren and Sanders both have widespread support from many younger voters.</p><p>But Warren has now found herself in something of a political quagmire as she promises to explain how she would pay for government-funded health care for all with estimates of the cost at around $3 trillion a year without boosting taxes on the middle class.</p><p>The millennial Democrat </p><p>Into all this comes Buttigieg, running as a millennial alternative to all the older candidates as well as more of a centrist who wants to take on structural problems left by the boomers but not in ways that send deficits and debt into the stratosphere.</p><p>\"You have a different sense of urgency around these issues if you're expecting in your lifetime to be dealing with them personally,\" Buttigieg said on the podcast. \"So by 2054, when I get to the current age of the current president, the shape of the world then, both environmentally, economically and beyond, that's not a theoretical question; it's a personal one that I have to prepare for just as a human being.\"</p><p>Buttigieg added that, \"There's just no way we can get very far into the next few decades on this tax policy without a fiscal time bomb going off.\"</p><p>And as for the baby boom legacy? \"I think a lot of wrong decisions get made out of just a kind of political or moral laziness that says that certain consequences, because they're going to hit down the road, aren't consequences for the politicians who are dealing with them, especially politicians who work one election cycle at a time,\" Buttigieg said.</p><p>What about Gen X?</p><p>Generation X, those born between 1965 and 1980, may never find themselves with a president to call their own, even if they lay claim to Obama, who was born in 1961. But that doesn't mean the generation won't have a significant role to play in future elections and political debates that increasingly pit baby boomers bent on protecting their investments and entitlements against millennials and members of Gen Z seeking to significantly alter the structure of taxation and federal benefits.</p><p>The role may wind up being quintessential Gen X, attempting to referee between much bigger generations to find some kind of compromise where everyone can win.</p><p>\"I guess we're going to have to choose, in some of these presidential elections, if it pits a baby boomer against a millennial with very different ideas, and I think there is significant political weight to Gen X and how those decisions are ultimately made, right?\" said Amy Walter, a Gen Xer and national editor of the Cook Political Report.</p><p>\"Like, we're not meaningless in terms of which way we go in the coming presidential elections of the next four, eight, 12 - even longer than that. There is some significant political importance to how Gen X decides on a lot of these things.\"</p><p>Article originally published on POLITICO Magazine</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">POLTCO-058022</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">POLTCO2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XBY-TYX1-F118-919J-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">334576</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2015\"/><timeReceived>10:59 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Capitol News Company, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Politico.com</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 25, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><classCode>STX000152</classCode><className>BABY BOOMERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DF5U</classCode><className>US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2016</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DNV7</classCode><className>US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2020</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001812</classCode><className>VOTERS &amp;

They fell nearly 19%, from $217 to $176, in less than 24 hours. That move wiped more than $120 billion off the company's market value - more than the entire market value of General Electric.It was bad for Facebook shareholders, sure. But if you don't own shares, then you might think that it's not your problem. As the great TV personality John McLaughlin used to say, 'Wrong!'Here's what you might not realize: You can be wiped out by falling tech stocks even if you don't own the companies outrightLeading the BullFacebook, along with its Big Tech brethren, has had an outsized effect on the returns of the broader stock market.The often-cited FAANGs - Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, and Google's parent company Alphabet - have a combined market cap of $3.4 trillion. Apple alone is now worth $1 trillion. If you add in Microsoft's $840 billion market cap, you get six companies worth over $4.3 trillion. What's more, the FAANGs, along with Microsoft, account for almost all of the gains in the S...00 for the year      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-cE0n_WezyVQ/W3F--8KKLeI/AAAAAAAAJbQ/9d5LvvkZbuIrM3MUXgMh_2o2ozH1vZHiwCLcBGAs/s1600/20180811-bbd-01.png\">https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-cE0n_WezyVQ/W3F--8KKLeI/AAAAAAAAJbQ/9d5LvvkZbuIrM3MUXgMh_2o2ozH1vZHiwCLcBGAs/s1600/20180811-bbd-01.png</url> That's all well and good when Big Tech firms are growing profits fast. For the past 10 years, there was nowhere to go but up. Low rates from quantitative easing (QE) made the stock market a lot more attractive than bonds, and high rates of growth made the tech stocks a lot more attractive than value and quality ones.But the Facebook earnings call might as well have been a bell. When profit growth at these companies falls, their share prices take a tumble. The bigger you get, the harder it is to grow at double-digit rates (nearly impossible). That's what Facebook told analysts. And when it did, it showed that falling tech stocks drag the rest of the market down with them.By the way, it's not exactly a revelation that falling market leaders drag the market lower. It's happened before. It happens nearly every time at the top of the market. For example, between January 1995 and March 2000, the dot-com stocks helped drive the tech-heavy Nasdaq index up 553%.Boom! New era! New economy! Pets.com!But when the dot-com bubble popped in March 2000, the Nasdaq plunged 78% over the next 31 months. Tech darlings Intel and Microsoft shed $90 billion and $80 billion, respectively, in market value in a single day. And the broader S...00 plunged 49% in 31 months.That's what I mean when I say crashing tech stocks can wipe you out even if you don't own them directly. And yes, I know that buy-and-hold investors will tell you that if you simply close your eyes, hold your nose, and take a deep breath, periodic drawdowns of 50% in your portfolio are worth the stress.What they won't tell you is that we're in the later stages of the third consecutive bubble in financial asset prices. The first was the dot-com bubble. Then came the housing bubble. And now, since 2009 and QE, we have this bubble in everything, led at the front by techs.All bubbles pop. So will this one. And the biggest and best overpriced tech stocks will crash. How can I be so sure? Because there are three specific threats facing Big Tech. One way or another, the music is about to stop.The First ThreatThe first threat to Big Tech is what we saw happen with Facebook a few weeks ago.For years, Facebook has delivered growing numbers; new users were spending more time on Facebook, and then on WhatsApp and Instagram after those companies were acquired. The advertising dollars poured in.Of course, that's what you want with a growth stock. The company is growing earnings at a rate significantly higher than more traditional stocks in the S...00. Investors are willing to pay more for current earnings and forgo dividend payments because they see higher earnings ahead. Consider it a premium that you pay for above-average earnings growth.Since 2012, Facebook grew its earnings per share from about $0.12 to $1.74. That's a compound annual growth rate of 56%. Investors poured money into Facebook because they expected that sort of growth rate to continue. And it did for awhile.Before the stock cratered in July, Facebook was trading at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of nearly 34. That's about 127% higher than the average P/E ratio for the S...00, which is 15.But during its second-quarter earnings call, Facebook forecasted decelerating revenue growth for the remainder of the year. Investors took that to mean that Facebook is no longer a growth stock. Therefore, it no longer deserved a growth premium. And everyone hit the sell button.The same thing could happen to any of the FAANGs[1] if Wall Street analysts see falling growth ahead. And because they're all so big, delivering the same rates of growth is now much harder. Amazon, with its growing cloud-computing business and its expanding reach in retail, might be able to keep the train running. But Google? Netflix? Microsoft? Apple? Where will the new customers come from? China? Or will growth come from spectacular breakthroughs and more innovation?Maybe it will. But it's in the nature of technology that large, powerful incumbents are at risk of massive disruption from smaller companies. So far, Big Tech has avoided that risk by buying up the competition before it can compete.Many of the Big Techs could face their day of reckoning from blockchain technology. If you look beyond bitcoin, blockchain is the real force of creative destruction that should keep the Silicon Valley robber barons up at night.That's threat one. But there's moreThe Antitrust ArgumentEarlier this year, The Wall Street Journal ran an article titled, 'The Antitrust Case Against Facebook, Google and Amazon.' The argument laid out there is one that I expect will become more popular among politicians, especially as we get closer to the midterm elections: Break up the Big Techs.The Big Tech companies have become powerful monopolies in their respective industries. It may not be harming consumers yet, but it is stifling competition and innovation. What do I mean?Google drives 89% of internet searches. One-third of people search Amazon first when looking for a specific product online. And Facebook has about 2.3 billion monthly active users That's around a third of the world's population.That sort of dominance, driven by the network effect, makes competition impossible. Who can compete with 2 billion users? Who's going to break Google's death grip on the search box?You could argue that these companies deserve their market positions. They make products that people find useful. If someone wants to beat them, go for it. That's how the free market works.But a monopoly situation is no longer a free market. And politicians on both sides of the aisle smell blood in the water with techs. I guarantee you that these companies will be at the center of the political debate during this year's midterm elections. Politicians are already coming after them.Democratic New York attorney general candidate Zephyr Teachout promised to break up Google and Facebook under federal antitrust laws if she's elected in November. And recently, Senator Mark Warner - also a Democrat - published a policy paper suggesting 20 ways to crack down on Big Tech including promoting competition in the tech space.Even if these companies never get broken up, regulators can still hit them with heavy fines. Google's been fined over $7 billion in the last two years by the competition regulator in the European Union. Even for a cashed-up company, that's a lot of cash.What's the impact on investors? All of this uncertainty in the political sphere will act as an air brake for Big Tech. The chance of more fines or a regulatory push to break up the Big Techs on antitrust grounds adds an element of risk to the stocks that hasn't existed during this bull market.It also adds an element of uncertainty. Uncertainty is a fact of life. But for investors, it's annoying. It makes it harder to project future earnings, and therefore, harder to figure out what a stock is worth today.Then, there's threat number three Walk AwayThe last one is the simplest to understand. Folks could finally get sick of the products that these companies provide - especially when they realize the internet has become a massive surveillance machine, dominated by a few big companies that were either funded by the Intelligence Community or are now happy to do its bidding and spy on Americans, while trying to modify their behavior through algorithms.There's already a lot of resentment toward Big Tech in general, and Facebook, specifically. You may not have to pay to use Facebook, but you give the company something much more valuable in return for its services: your personal data.We've always known that Facebook harvests vast amounts of our personal data. You'd have to be living under a rock not to know that the company hawks this data to advertisers and political campaign managers to help them modify our behavior - to get us to buy stuff or vote for someone.And judging by Facebook's more than two-billion-strong user base, people have been okay with that trade-off. But what the Cambridge Analytica scandal - as well as Facebook's 'fake news problem' - showed is that our data is being used for reasons other than connecting us with products we may want to buy.The same data and algorithms that serve you targeted ads are also being used to manipulate - or 'nudge' - you toward voting for a particular candidate or cause. Or, worse, your data is being used to identify you as a particular 'threat vector': a terrorist; a loner; or even a lover of cash, limited government, and individual liberty.Human beings resent being manipulated. We understand that being watched all the time and being not-so-subtly nudged to behave in a certain way, or to hold the 'right' views and be compliant with authority, is the opposite of being free. It's becoming subservient to a giant surveillance machine controlled by people who think they know better than you on how to live your life.Here's a prediction: The tech backlash will pose a problem to the business model of these Big Tech companies. Definancialize Your LifeReaders of The Bill Bonner Letter will know this argument too well. But I'll repeat it here for Diary readers. This is too important for you to ignore Protecting the wealth you already have is more important right now than putting your entire nest egg on the line in the stock market for another 10%, or even 20%, gain on the index. In the context of a 70% decline in Big Tech stocks (and a 50% decline in the overall market), is another 20% really worth it?Part of what I've told readers of The Letter to do is to look at 'definancializing' your life. That means taking some of your wealth out of the financial system. That system, especially the stock market, is far more vulnerable than most realize.Put at least some of your wealth into tangible assets that you can physically own. We discussed this in detail last year in a report on asset allocation. Our strategy leaves some of your money in stocks (after all, we can't predict the future). But it's a lot less than most traditional 60/40 models (60% of your investable assets in stocks, 40% in bonds).In fact, we recommend you own almost no bonds. If there's one market that's even more dangerous than stocks right now, it's bonds. Instead, we recommend an allocation to real estate, cash, and precious metals.Diversifying your investments won't protect you from everything that's coming down the tracks for the U.S. stock market. It's hard to hedge a bear. Owning stocks means taking risks. But diversifying into real assets will help protect you - and your wealth - from the worst of what I see coming.Courtesy of Dan Denning, Bonner ...rtners[2](More articles by Bonner here[3])The views and opinions expressed herein arethe author's own, and do not necessarily reflect those ofEconMatters[4].

Ranging in length from four to eight pages, the statements give us our best look yet at how Tim Cook, Sundar Pichai, Jeff Bezos, and Mark Zuckerberg plan to defend their companies from this latest wave of antitrust scrutiny, and accusations that some of their actions harm consumers and stifle competition.</p><p><br/>There are a lot of similarities between the four statements which you can read in their entirety here:<br/><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Apple's Tim Cook</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Google's Sundar Pichai</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Amazon's Jeff Bezos</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg</p></bodyText></listItem></list>For example, they all make appeals to American patriotism (\"The rest of the world would love even the tiniest sip of the elixir we have here in the U.S,\" Bezos claims), and talk about the benefits their products offer to consumers, as well as small businesses. All four insist that, contrary to popular belief, they do in fact face intense competition, and that their success is far from guaranteed.<br/>Related<br/>Big Tech is going on trialHere are the major arguments the CEOs make in their opening statements:<br/>All: We face intense competitionOne of the major points each CEO makes at length is how much competition they each face, despite their apparent dominance. Jeff Bezos, for example, points out that Amazon's business accounts for less than 4 percent of the overall retail market in the US, and that it's increasingly facing competition from more established competitors like Walmart and Target, which offer services that Amazon can't compete with.<br/>\"Walmart's online sales grew 74% in the first quarter. And customers are increasingly flocking to services invented by other stores that Amazon still can't match at the scale of other large companies, like curbside pickup and in-store returns.\"<br/>Here's Apple's Tim Cook, talking about the competition it faces from Android manufacturers:<br/>\"The smartphone market is fiercely competitive, and companies like Samsung, LG, Huawei and Google have built very successful smartphone businesses offering different approaches.<br/>Apple does not have a dominant market share in any market where we do business. That is not just true for iPhone; it is true for any product category.\"<br/>Sundar Pichai's defense of the competition Google faces is especially interesting, considering the monopoly it's widely considered to have in online search.<br/>\"People have more ways to search for information than ever before - and increasingly this is happening outside the context of only a search engine. Often the answer is just a click or an app away: You can ask Alexa a question from your kitchen; read your news on Twitter; ask friends for information via WhatsApp; and get recommendations on Snapchat or Pinterest. When searching for products online, you may be visiting Amazon, eBay, Walmart, or any one of a number of e-commerce providers, where most online shopping queries happen.\"<br/>Pichai also notes that Google faces competition in the digital ad market, though without specifically mentioning Facebook. Zuckerberg, too, claims that Facebook faces competition, including from international competitions \"that have access to markets that we aren't in.\"<br/>All: Our products are useful and lovedFundamentally, all four CEOs write that the products their companies offer are useful (and certainly not harmful) not only to consumers, but to other businesses.<br/>\u00a0<br/>Tim Cook, for example, points out that the iPhone has a 99 percent satisfaction rating in customer surveys, and that the company invests in developer tools that are \"not only powerful, but so simple to use that students in elementary schools can and do make apps.\"<br/>For Sundar Pichai, Google's benefits are felt by customers who get access to free services like Search, Gmail, Maps, and Photos, and he also argues that Android has allowed cheap smartphones to come to market. He argues that small business owners have been able to use Google's services to offer online services and stay afloat during the pandemic.<br/>Bezos says that Amazon marketplace has \"helped many thousands of sellers grow their businesses on Amazon,\" and that the company tries to offer new services to customers before they even know they want it.<br/>\"We are internally driven to improve our services, add benefits and features, invent new products, lower prices, and speed up shipping times-before we have to. No customer ever asked Amazon to create the Prime membership program, but it sure turns out they wanted it. And I could give you many such examples.\"<br/>Finally, Zuckerberg notes that Facebook's services help \"millions of businesses connect with customers\" as well as helping customers to keep in contact with each other.<br/>But as well as these more general defenses, each CEO takes time to defend its company against specific criticisms that have been leveled at them by their critics.<br/>Amazon: We create jobsFor Amazon, a key recent criticism has been the treatment of its workers, which has intensified recently as the company grapples with the COVID-19 pandemic. But Bezos argues that Amazon pays its workers well, and that it invests a lot of money in training them.<br/>\"The trust customers put in us every day has allowed Amazon to create more jobs in the United States over the past decade than any other company - hundreds of thousands of jobs across 42 states. Amazon employees make a minimum of $15 an hour, more than double the federal minimum wage (which we have urged Congress to increase).\"<br/>Bezos also says Amazon is spending over $700 million on training its employees, and that its investments have created almost 700,000 indirect jobs in areas like construction.<br/>Apple: Our App Store policies are fairApple knows that its App Store policies are going to be heavily scrutinized, but it argues that its guidelines are applied equally to all developers, and that they \"ensure a high-quality, reliable and secure user experience.\"<br/>In particular Apple has come under fire for the 30 percent commission it charges for purchases made through apps distributed through the App Store. However, Tim Cook argues that these commissions are lower than its competitors, as well as the services that existed prior to the App Store.<br/>\"After beginning with 500 app, today the App Store hosts more than 1.7 million - only 60 of which are Apple software. Clearly, if Apple is a gatekeeper, what we have done is open the gate wider. We want to get every app we can on the Store, not keep them off.\"<br/>Facebook: We didn't acquire competitors, we made them competitorsOne of the more interesting sections of Zuckerberg's opening comments is where he defends his company's acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp, two acquisitions that some critics claim allowed Facebook to swallow its burgeoning competitors and consolidate the market. Zuckerberg, however, says that the image-sharing and messaging service only became dominant because they had access to Facebook's vast resources.<br/>\"Following its acquisition, Instagram was able to get help stabilizing infrastructure and controlling runaway spam. It also benefited from the ability to plug into Facebook's self-serve ads system, sales team and existing advertiser relationships to drive monetization, and was able to build products including IG Direct and IG Video that used Facebook's technology and infrastructure. Before it was acquired, WhatsApp was a paid app with a reputation for secure communications; together we built on that by introducing end-to-end encryption and making it free to use. Since its acquisition, WhatsApp has also been able to develop products such as voice and video calling that were built on Facebook's technology stack.<br/>\"These benefits came about as a result of our acquisition of those companies, and would not have happened had we not made those acquisitions.\"<br/>As well as talking about Facebook's acquisition of Instagram and WhatsApp, Zuckerberg's opening remarks contain yet another call for more regulation for Facebook.<br/>Google: Our investments are keeping American tech competitiveFinally, as America reckons with China's increasing prominence in the international tech landscape, Google's Sundar Pichai says that its Google's investments that will allow the US to maintain its lead.<br/>\"Every year, we are among the world's biggest investors in research and development. At the end of 2019, our R&amp;D spend had increased almost 10 times over 10 years, from $2.8 billion to $26 billion. We've invested over $90 billion over the last 5 Years.<br/>Through these investments, our teams of engineers are helping America solidify its position as the global leader in emerging technologies like artificial intelligence, self-driving cars, and quantum computing. For example, last fall, our team of researchers based here in the U.S. was the first to reach a quantum computing milestone, a discovery that could eventually lead to new breakthroughs in medicine and more efficient batteries.\"<br/>The four CEOs will testify in front of congress later today.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INDTEC-M1279063</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INDTEC2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60G9-7NB1-DYDW-717C-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">428674</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1508\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 FFC Information Solution Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Indian Technology news</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5981\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 30, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><classCode>CC0002LAF</classCode><className>WAL-MART STORES INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><className>NAICS423430 COMPUTER &amp;

Residential lock downs and city closures and quarantine across Chinanow effect 760 million people[2], or just over half the population of the nation. Spreadingfaster than the disease itself are racist attacks against Chinese nationals[3]around the world, but the reality is that this disease is indiscriminate in nature and just as likely to effect non-Chinese. Major global conferences and events likeMobile World Congress have been cancelled[4]in the face of fears over the spread of the virus, there's even fearsthe Olympics may be cancelled[5]unless the spread of the virus is brought under control.So yeah, let's get down to the bank branch to sign that credit card application!</p><p> In China we've already seenthe largest banks shutter thousands of branches[6]due to the coronavirus. In the face of this disease, it's clear that if a pandemic does eventuate, that many people will be stranded due to the lack of digital support by major elements of the financial system. When cash is a vector for the disease, and retail stores and branches are closed, most of the world's population will be adversely affected. In recent times we've seen New York, San Francisco, London and other citiesforcing retailers to accept cash[7]due to the increased popularity of cashless payments. Such a move is clearly a stop gap, but in the face of this possible pandemic, exactly the opposite needs to occur. In fact, there's very strong argument that even PIN and Signature authentication is no longer viable, because it may also encourage disease transmission via POS terminals contact. A survey taken in January 2018 confirmed thataround 40% of Americans still get paid via paper check (cheque) or money order[8]in the United States, and obviously still rely heavily on cash for everyday purchases. Today aroundtwo thirds of the world's cheques[9]are written in the United States, but globally there is not a single country where cheque usage is not in decline. In most countries cash usage is also in decline (See: IMF Working Paper 2019 \"Cash Use Across Countries and the Demand for Central Bank Digital Currenc[10]y\".) If the coronavirus hits countries like the US and India, as hard as it has hit China, for example, we can expect a months-long crisis to result in the early failure of even more banks as they remain unable to process simple account openings and credit applications without face-to-face KYC. While the coronavirus should not be a singular factor in stimulating digital transformation, it will likely expose those organizations who have been laggards on the digital stage. The first we'll see of this is likely earnings guidance in Q2, but those reliant on branch networks will be hit much harder than the likes of JP Morgan Chase, Capital One, DBS, RBS and others who have been pursuing digital transformation for some years. For banks who can't even open an account without a wet signature, the effects will be far more acute. But that's not the only thing banks have to worry about right now. Fintech Mergers and Acquisitions Abound Intuit announced this week it is acquiring the Fintech unicornCredit Karma for $7.1Bn in cash and stock[11]. This comes off the back of the acquisition of Radius Bank by another Fintech unicorn, Lending Club. Along with the acquisition of Plaid by Visa earlier in January. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/sasan-goodarzi_today-is-a-momentous-day-moments-ago-we-activity-6637843458788851712-L4A-\">https://www.linkedin.com/posts/sasan-goodarzi_today-is-a-momentous-day-moments-ago-we-activity-6637843458788851712-L4A-</url> Video - Intuit and Credit Karma Announcement on Merger The question of whether Fintech has made an impact on the financial services market is well and truly over. The emerging ecosystem is one that combines the best of fintech IP and technologies, along with the regulatory structures of the incumbent system. While some fintechs have played the regulatory game in seeking out charters, others appear to be simply thinking about mergers and acqusitions as a way to combine the leading technology and user experience advantages of fintechs with traditional players. Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Citi have all pursued partnerships with big tech players like Apple, Amazon and Google, hoping that these distribution deals win out in combined market share. Figure 1. The Emerging Financial Services Ecosystem (2020-2030) In this environment we can already see the top financial services brands of the 2020s emerging, and increasingly there is a massive technology bias to that trajectory. With the largest privately owned fintech in the world, Ant Financial,reportedly eyeing an IPO worth north of $200 Billion[12], this would put Ant Financial in the top 6 financial services companies in the world, beating out Citigroup, HSBC, UBS and Commonwealth Bank just to name a few. Regardless, the market has already started to shift towards players that are set to dominate the financial services ecosystem over the next couple of decades, and those dependent on physical interactions are simply not making the cut. This will only get more acute for banks over the coming quarters and years. The Message is Simple - Digital or Done If it wasn't COVID-19, the shift to dominantly digital financial services was already inevitable. The coronavirus has simply accelerated the obsolescence of physical KYC and distribution in a world that is committed to a digital future. Insisting stores still take cash is not the answer, mandating standards that require banks and FIs to move to digital inclusion clearly is. Writing cheques (or checks) because that's the way we've always done it, isn't a viable argument - you're just part of an archaic system that is failing. Cash will remain optional for a long time to come, but as William Gibson said, we won't have to ban cash, it's just that nobody will ever use it anymore. In any case, by 2030 things will be very different: The most common value store won't be a bank account, it will be a mobile wallet Consumers will use the digital layer for financial services more in one day, than they use human-driven services (branch/call centre) in banking in a year The largest \"banks\" in the world will be fintechs, techfins or hybrids through mergers, not the players that dominate market cap tables today. At least two name brand universal banks will likely be victims of this shift and be gone by the 2030s KYC and IDV will be digital based on digital identity schemas either mandated by regulators or driven by market forces, all identity will require some form of biometrics. Identity theft will drive paper application forms into extinction. I'll make it even simpler. If you are reliant on paper KYC or face-to-face interactions you will be consolidated out of existence or to the absolute margins.

The long-serving former Google boss, now free to speak his mind, said what many others in Silicon Valley may have been thinking when he declared last month that coronavirus should make us more \"grateful\" to tech giants.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Imagine having the same reality of this pandemic without these tools,\" he told a live-streamed audience. \"The benefit of these corporations, which we love to malign... is profound and I hope people will remember that when this thing is finally over.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">He sounded like he was laying the ideology groundwork for a new era of tech supremacy - and perhaps he was.</p><p>The recent round of robust financial results from <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2020/04/29/3-billion-people-now-use-facebooks-apps-usage-soars-lockdown/\">Facebook</url>,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2020/04/29/3-billion-people-now-use-facebooks-apps-usage-soars-lockdown/\">Amazon</url>,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2020/04/29/3-billion-people-now-use-facebooks-apps-usage-soars-lockdown/\">Microsoft</url>,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2020/04/29/3-billion-people-now-use-facebooks-apps-usage-soars-lockdown/\">Apple</url>,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2020/04/29/3-billion-people-now-use-facebooks-apps-usage-soars-lockdown/\">Netflix</url> and Google's parent company       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2020/04/29/3-billion-people-now-use-facebooks-apps-usage-soars-lockdown/\">Alphabet</url> were firm evidence that despite temporary turbulence, Big Tech is likely to emerge from the pandemic richer, more powerful and more dominant than ever.</p><p>Insulated from destruction by its digital nature and relied on by citizens and governments, it is pushing into sensitive markets such as healthcare and education, where its ambitions had long been resisted.</p><p>Wall Street agrees: the tech-rich Nasdaq 100 index is up by 6pc since the start of the year, despite the crash, while the Russell 2000 index, comprising smaller US companies, is down by 21pc. Just five Big Tech stocks now constitute more than 20pc of the value of the whole S&amp; P500 - more than at the peak of the dotcom bubble.</p><p>\"To sum it up: the strong will get stronger,\" says Sir Martin Sorrell, veteran advertising magnate who turned WPP from an obscure shopping basket maker into the world's biggest ad group before being pushed out in 2018. His new, internet-focused company S4 Capital is also poised to benefit from what he describes as a forced leap forward in technological adoption driven by the digital equivalent of the old oil industry's mighty \"seven sisters\". </p><p>\"We're seeing clients switch money into digital media,\" Sir Martin elaborates. \"If you just think about the data [tech firms] are accumulating, they will have a huge benefit.... I think there will be a fairly quick recovery, although I'm probably in a minority in saying that, and ultimately these platforms will benefit extraordinarily.\"</p><p>Currently, Sir Martin estimates that about 45-50pc of global ad spending goes through digital channels, which he had expected to rise to 55pc by the end of 2022. But now he has upgraded that prediction to 57.5pc by 2022 and more than two thirds by 2025. He also believes the crisis will \"accelerate the pathway\" for Google, Apple, Microsoft or Amazon to reach market capitalisations of $2tn.</p><p>A similar dynamic is visible in retail. Data from CommerceNext, a professional network for retail marketers, does show that smaller merchants are seeing customers switch to e-commerce. But Scott Silverman, the network's co-founder, warns that almost none are making enough to compensate for the loss of their physical shops. Amazon, by contrast, was already profitable even before switching boosted its sales of household goods by hundreds or thousands of percent.</p><p>Another important factor is tech giants' huge cash reserves. Historically, investors have often criticised cash-rich companies for hoarding money that should be reinvested or paid out to shareholders. Comparable behemoths in other industries are rarely so flush: Walmart, whose 2019 revenue was close to Google's at $142bn, held $9.5bn in January, while Royal Dutch Shell, whose $352bn turnover far exceeded Amazon's $296bn, held around $18bn.</p><p>Yet most Big Tech firms have enough cash on hand to last two or more years with zero revenue (with the partial exception of Amazon, which has months).</p><p>According to Alec Dafferner, a partner at the UK-based tech investment bank GP Bullhound, backers were \"understanding\" as long as firms kept growing. While oil companies, for example, are no longer getting much bigger and must reward shareholders through dividends and buybacks, data companies still double their stock prices every few years.</p><p>\"They like to reserve cash for growth, because they [think] both offensively and defensively about competitive threats,\" Dafferner says. \"Everything can change in ten years, so they have to keep investing.\"</p><p>Because of this financial cushion, tech giants can dominate simply by surviving. Call it the Rudyard Kipling strategy: if they can stay afloat while all around them are going bust (and blaming it on them), they will win. Even cash-poor tech firms such as Airbnb and Twitter enjoy the confidence of deep-pocketed Silicon Valley investors with a long-term belief in their revolutions. </p><p>Yet cash also unlocks other crisis opportunities. \"For nearly all small and medium-sized businesses [SMEs], the pandemic represents significant negative impact on cash flows,\" says Reece Tomlinson, chief executive of the global SME advisory firm RWTGrowth.</p><p>He paints a bleak and mismatched picture: Big Tech firms can get more for their cash due to higher bargaining power and tend to have low ongoing costs, whereas start-ups' vary wildly. The result, he argues, will be increased \"hostile takeovers\" of small public companies and unrefusable offers to privately held ones.</p><p>\"Some SMEs will be in very dire predicaments and may have no choice but to take very unattractive offers in order to save the company and likely the owners from going insolvent.\"</p><p>Many such deals will be be waved through by regulators. The British Competition and Markets Authority <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2020/04/29/3-billion-people-now-use-facebooks-apps-usage-soars-lockdown/\">dropped its opposition</url> to Amazon's investment in Deliveroo once bankruptcy became a risk, and the EU's competition chief Margrethe Vestager       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2020/04/29/3-billion-people-now-use-facebooks-apps-usage-soars-lockdown/\">admitted in a recent interview</url> with The Sunday Telegraph that the crisis will force officials to look more kindly on mergers.</p><p>Even our minds may be more digitised after this is over. Scott Silverman believes that \"new consumer behaviours are being created\" as millions get their first, but not their last, taste of online shopping.</p><p>Ashkan Soltani, a US regulator turned privacy activist, suspects that after an initial joyous rebound, many people will find their threshold for leaving the house to meet friends or have business meetings has been permanently raised.</p><p>What, likewise, will this strange cyber-life do to our already screen-addled brains? What new habits will become ingrained for some at an early age?</p><p>Governments, already intervening in the economy to an unprecedented degree, are likely to resist. Amazon's role as a delivery lifeline did not stop US legislators <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2020/04/29/3-billion-people-now-use-facebooks-apps-usage-soars-lockdown/\">summoning Jeff Bezos</url> last week to testify about allegations of monopoly abuse. On the other side, Facebook has just poached a key Ofcom official working on the British Government's new Duty of Care regulations, causing MPs to complain of a \"revolving door\".</p><p>So will normal hostilities soon resumed? Bruce Mehlman, a top Washington DC tech lobbyist who has been <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2020/04/29/3-billion-people-now-use-facebooks-apps-usage-soars-lockdown/\">analysing the long-term consequences of the pandemic</url>, thinks so. \"The good news for the big players is that they are presently the heroes of the story,\" he says. \"But Winston Churchill won the war and lost the peace...</p><p>\"As long as governments' exclusive focus is on survival and recovery, I don't think there will be aggressive efforts to disrupt their business. But we will survive and we will recover, and then all the same questions will return with a vengeance.\"</p><p>Sir Martin, though, believes that tech giants have been \"behaving in a very responsible way\" so far. He says they understand that their new dominance will create new pressure to be prudent in future and hopes they continue doing good. \"I'm on the side of the gods!\" he jokes. So it may soon prove.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TLGRWB-62620835</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TLGRWB2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YTJ-6M61-F021-60S4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">389195</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1278\"/><timeReceived>2:00 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>telegraph.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"1845\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"05\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>May 3, 2020 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper;

Tech has long viewed the healthcare sector as an over-regulated backwater resistant to digital transformation. Clinical medical technology remains a highly specialized sub-industry, but Big Tech was already moving[1] into personal fitness and medical record-keeping before the crisis. Now, big companies are rushing to use their networks and devices to help solve immediate problems \u2014 as with Apple's and Google's surprise alliance[2] to provide contact tracing tech via their rival smartphone platforms. </p><p>Longer-term, they're seeing opportunities in applying AI techniques to everything from personal wellness to disease control. Distance learning and the digital divide. With schooling at all levels transformed for now into a remote experience, inequities in online access have moved from a long-term ethical concern to an immediate problem[3]. Rural communities don't always have the connections they need. Lower-income cities and neighborhoods lack the devices they need, for both instructors and students. Network bandwidth and resilience. The shelter-in-place era has stressed networks in new and unplanned-for ways. So far they've held up well[4]. 5G, the next generation of wireless service, may be in less immediate demand[5] as long as so many people are staying home.The WiFi band that serves most home use and can get congested in crowded cities is headed for a turf upgrade from the FCC[6]. Misinformation and media polarization. Critics were already blaming big tech platforms for polarizing U.S. politics and spreading election-warping lies. Now we're worried about bad information online that could cost people their lives \u2014 whether through discounting the threat of the coronavirus itself, or through buying into dubious or dangerous remedies. So far, the platforms' efforts to clean up medical misinformation have been far more effective than their attempts to police political misinformation and misleading ads. Meanwhile, these agenda items have lost some urgency:Antitrust investigations and enforcement. The virus could slow but isn't scuttling[7] efforts by the Justice Department, the Federal Trade Commission, Congress and the states to investigate monopolistic practices by Big Tech. Realistically, however, these projects will receive less press attention, less policymaker effort, and less public support in the new era.Talk in Congress and the Justice Department about revising or revoking the rule that limits tech platforms' liability for user-posted content[8] also looks less likely to turn into action. Consumer privacy. Despite a cavalcade of data breaches and privacy-protection violations, the American public seems to remain ambivalent about the tradeoffs between protecting their personal information and supporting free, ad-supported internet services, telling survey takers[9] that they care about the issue[10] but rarely modifying their behavior. Relatively tough privacy laws are in place now in both California and the EU, but Congress' effort to pass national rules[11] now looks dead in the water until next year at the earliest.A downturn in the ad market[12] could further accelerate online ad overload and intrusive marketing practices, as revenue-starved publishers approve deals they'd previously have turned down. Screen overload. Before the coronavirus, many Americans feared that too much time in front of screens[13] was rotting our brains and atrophying our bodies. Nothing about the current crisis actually offers a logical excuse for abandoning those fears. But practically speaking, the demands of remote work, remote schooling[14], and stay-at-home edicts mean that, like it or not, our screens mediate more of our lives than ever before.

Here's Silicon Valley's new food chain:Big Tech's giant apex predators will strengthen their dominance while facing new threats. Google, Amazon, Apple and Facebook have fat war chests, hordes of data and armies of engineers.They had all that before COVID-19's onslaught, but now they have one more precious asset. </p><p>Overnight, the American public has come to see their services as lifelines rather than luxuries. That may seriously dim enthusiasm for regulators and lawmakers to try to break these companies up. But it raises the odds that the government will favor treating them like public utilities. In the middle ranks of the industry, where freshly IPOed newcomers on the way up pass middle-aged firms on their way down, chaos and carnage loom. Companies' fates will largely depend on how exposed their business models are to virus-era risks.Those tied to real-world interactions, live events and in-person contact will struggle. See: Airbnb[1], Uber[2] and anything to do with travel and entertainment.Those that enable online replacements for in-person interaction will thrive. See: Zoom[3], food deliverers[4] and some gaming providers and streaming outfits[5]. Backend infrastructure plays will thrive if their tech is unique and useful enough.Companies that already went public will face brutal judgment from a new, bottom-line-conscious market. Those that missed the IPO window will race to become cashflow-positive.Successful operations will find happy endings in acquisitions, while money losers and slow adapters will wither or get bought in fire sales. Tech's teeming underbrush of small startups will grow less crowded and more diverse. Small companies that made business plans in the pre-coronavirus days have ripped them up[6].Those who can will pivot to some new plan[7] that makes sense in the new world. Those who can't will shut down.Investors who've experienced previous downturns will use this time to place longer-term bets on new technologies.Nimble newcomers will exploit freshly revealed market niches, drawing on a large population of newly available talent and sipping from the surplus of loose cash that's looking for higher returns. The bottom line: The scale, reach and power of tech's giants looks less like a danger and more like a public good[8] at this pivotal moment. Amazon has become a delivery lifeline for many homebound families and individuals.Apple's and Google's devices and Facebook's social networks keep us in touch when we can't see one another in person. Entertainment from Netflix, Google's YouTube, Amazon and other streaming players keeps us from going nuts as we shelter in place. All this will give these companies a freer hand to pursue new markets, buy up potential competitors and fend off regulators than they had before.Yes, but: In the new world, they'll face new dangers to their preeminence.Read the rest of this report: The tech world's post-virus agenda[9]New threats to Big Tech[10]The coronavirus spins tech's great wheel again[11] [ 1]: <url

Their target?</p><p> The monetization[3] of the web and its contrasting effects on two childlike video-game characters, best friends Ralph and Vanellope. In a bid to save Vanellope's arcade racing game, the BFFs venture into the internet to buy a new steering wheel on eBay (where else?), only to lose their way in a sea of distractions. We've all been there.\"To put these [two] naive characters who don't even know what money is on to the internet allowed us to shine a light on the fact that... it's hard to avoid commerce [online],\" said Johnston. \"Without being terribly barbed in our satire, it was something we were interested in commenting on.\"Play Video[4] To do so, Johnston and co-director Rich Moore brought the internet to life. Their world wide web is a sprawling metropolis with a skyline dominated by Google and Facebook's big-tech skyscrapers (eBay, meanwhile, appears as a mega-mall). It's a place where visitors ride self-flying[5] shuttles to their next purchase... or discovery. On the ground, netizens -- think email delivery men and security guards -- go about their jobs, while pop-ups and spam with sallow-faced personas jostle for attention. A bespectacled search engine wearing a mortarboard completes everyone's sentences. And a sassy female algorithm is the movie's moral compass.It's enough to make a full-grown adult's head spin. But as the film hurtles toward its King Kong-channeling climax, you have to wonder: Are kids in on the joke?\"The one thing children and adults can relate to is the idea that friendships change,\" said Johnston. \"And friendships go through difficult times.\" A theme that's at the heart of arguably the most-beloved CGI cartoon of all time, Toy Story[6].Here the internet helps it to take on new meaning. On the one hand, it amplifies Ralph's insecurities, but for Vanellope, it helps realize her \"one true dream.\" Which just happens to be competing in a GTA Online[7] clone called Slaughter Race. (Talk about subverting gender roles.) If only Ralph would quit holding her back.\"Insecurity as a literal monster was the big idea of the movie,\" said Johnston. \"We wanted Ralph's insecurity and the toxic nature of that to be the antagonist of the film. Knowing that the internet can be a place where trolls and bullies... can prey on insecure people, it felt like a good thing to put Ralph through and a good conflict for our movie.\"It also sets up the most poignant moment in the film: When Ralph, basking in his newfound viral success on YouTube[8] rival BuzzTube, stumbles upon the abusive comments left on his videos. It's an all-too-real scene that confronts the duplicitous nature of the web.\"Social media can be a place where insecure adults could end up getting their feelings hurt,\" said Moore. \"And I could see where this could be something bad for children.\" He continued: \"But it does need to be a place where you can feel safe to let a young person use it. [The internet] is a great tool that should be open to anyone.\"I think like any invention, we will see it regulated in some way, so we don't have to worry about young people, or even very sensitive adults, being hurt like they are now.\"DisneyWhen we're constantly reminded of its failings[9], it's easy to be cynical about the internet. Hollywood, meanwhile, has historically[10] resorted to scaremongering[11] in its depictions[12] of tech. In contrast, Ralph is a breath of fresh air. It doesn't shy away from the web's shadowy allure -- Ralph even ends up in its slimy underbelly, the Dark Net -- nor does it pontificate about its shortcomings. All the while, it never loses sight of its primary audience. No matter how hard you squint, you won't see a MindGeek[13] tower nestled among its conurbations. This is a children's film after all. And for all its introspection, there's also a ton of belly laughs at the expense of its fish-out-of-water protagonists.\"We didn't want to paint the internet as one thing, black or white. We didn't want to say that the internet is a utopian place or a horrible dystopia, either,\" said Moore. \"Not only does it have some bad areas we explored with Ralph, but for Vanellope, it becomes a place that actually really opens her eyes to what it is that she'd always dreamed of, and what she'd always wanted.\"Had she not gone to the internet, Vanellope would not have learned about her future and where she really belonged. I think the real internet is something that can open up a young person's eyes to what it is that they want to do.\" This article originally appeared on Engadget at <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.engadget.com/2019/02/12/ralph-breaks-the-internet-interview/?ncid=txtlnkusaolp00000603\">https://www.engadget.com/2019/02/12/ralph-breaks-the-internet-interview/?ncid=txtlnkusaolp00000603</url> [ 1]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.engadget.com/2018/02/28/wreck-it-ralph-2-teaser-trailer/\">https://www.engadget.com/2018/02/28/wreck-it-ralph-2-teaser-trailer/</url> [ 2]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.engadget.com/2012/06/25/wreck-it-ralph-game-about-the-movie-about-games-coming-only-to-n/\">https://www.engadget.com/2012/06/25/wreck-it-ralph-game-about-the-movie-about-games-coming-only-to-n/</url> [ 3]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.engadget.com/2019/01/16/pew-research-facebook-advertising/\">https://www.engadget.com/2019/01/16/pew-research-facebook-advertising/</url> [ 4]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/_BcYBFC6zfY\">https://www.youtube.com/embed/_BcYBFC6zfY</url> [ 5]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.engadget.com/2019/01/23/boeing-autonomous-flying-taxi-completes-flight/\">https://www.engadget.com/2019/01/23/boeing-autonomous-flying-taxi-completes-flight/</url> [ 6]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.engadget.com/2017/07/15/toy-story-in-kingdom-hearts-3/\">https://www.engadget.com/2017/07/15/toy-story-in-kingdom-hearts-3/</url> [ 7]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.engadget.com/2017/08/03/gta-online-take-two-earnings/\">https://www.engadget.com/2017/08/03/gta-online-take-two-earnings/</url> [ 8]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.engadget.com/2018/12/13/youtube-rewind-2018-most-disliked-bieber-baby/\">https://www.engadget.com/2018/12/13/youtube-rewind-2018-most-disliked-bieber-baby/</url> [ 9]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.engadget.com/2018/11/02/dear-tech-stop-doing-business-with-nazis/\">https://www.engadget.com/2018/11/02/dear-tech-stop-doing-business-with-nazis/</url> [ 10]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.engadget.com/2016/03/25/2001-a-space-odyssey-as-569-gifs-tests-fair-use-limits/\">https://www.engadget.com/2016/03/25/2001-a-space-odyssey-as-569-gifs-tests-fair-use-limits/</url> [ 11]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.engadget.com/2016/08/20/pop-cultures-many-takes-on-artificial-intelligence/\">https://www.engadget.com/2016/08/20/pop-cultures-many-takes-on-artificial-intelligence/</url> [ 12]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.engadget.com/2019/02/08/childs-play-trailer-chucky-killer-robot/\">https://www.engadget.com/2019/02/08/childs-play-trailer-chucky-killer-robot/</url> [ 13]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.engadget.com/2017/11/23/pornhub-mindgeek-age-verification-ageid-digital-economy-uk-online-porn/\">https://www.engadget.com/2017/11/23/pornhub-mindgeek-age-verification-ageid-digital-economy-uk-online-porn/</url></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-AOLB1032841549984861671251764500248</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AOLB-5150</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VDG-5KR1-F03R-N39W-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1061\"/><timeReceived>3:21 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Engadget HD</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"02\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>February 12, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Major players like the European Union, China, and Russia have all put forth comprehensive strategies to do just that, crafting their own alternative visions for cyberspace. The internet has become a battlefield in the struggle for digital sovereignty, and a cohesive strategy is absolutely necessary to come out on top. But Congress isn't making oneit's too distracted by its attacks on \"Big Tech.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">So Europe has stepped into the gap.</p><p>After years of being a laggard in innovation, now the EU is defining the rules of cyberspace by promoting its own tech firms and closing the door on U.S. innovation. Last year, the EU enacted the most far-reaching and onerous privacy regulation in the world, called the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and launched several major antitrust probes into American tech giants, attempting to curb their prominence in European markets. In early November, the EU announced it was constructing a state-backed European cloud infrastructure called Gaia-X. It's an initiative that'll enable domestic technology companies to end their dependence on the American and Chinese firms that currently manage the global cloud infrastructure, with European leaders arguing that strong domestic technology infrastructure is essential to providing its citizens more control over their data.</p><p>In an increasingly multipolar world, technology strategy plays an integral role in maintaining international power. And that's why the GDPR has become the de facto standard for market economiestheir heavy-handed regulatory standards are so clear that they now have the greatest global impact. Indeed, setting the rules of the game allows a nation to place the goalposts for technology firms beyond its borders.</p><p>But that's what American firms should be doing because the U.S. vision for the digital future would be infinitely more free than whatever the rest of the world might be able to offer. Unfortunately, they're too busy explaining to Congress why they're not traitorsin hearing after hearing, Congress has accused American tech giants of wielding excessive market power and subverting democracy. With its constant skepticism of the benefits of social media and attacks on Big Tech, it's pretty obvious that the American government doesn't trust its own companies. Why, then, should the rest of the world? No wonder the EU is erecting walls to keep U.S. companies off its property.</p><p>The EU isn't the first to try something like this. For years, Russia and China have been cooperating on the development of cyberinfrastructure that's less dependent on the United States. In early November of this year, Russia's sovereign internet law came into effect, creating something akin to China's Great Firewall and increasing the capacity of the Russian state to censor online material. Suddenly, American firms became much easier to block from Russian markets. And on December 8, the Financial Times reported that China had ordered the removal of all foreign technologies in state offices, a move that will likely spur the development of a larger domestic industry.</p><p>Compared to Russia and China, the European Union is late to the game in realizing the key political role played by collaborating with their own tech innovators. But now, of course, it's catching up. Combined with competition policy campaigns to benefit domestic firms at the expense of American ones, the EU is presenting the largest digital policy challenge to the United States from a market economy.</p><p>Europe did something similar in the 1960s when it formed Airbus, one of today's largest airline manufacturers. Europe gave the company room to breathe from regulation and insulation from foreign competitors through strategic consolidation and public-private partnerships. The company grew so strong that it ate away at the market share of American firms and built itself up to compete on the global stage. This strategy has worked before. It's likely to work again.</p><p>In order to protect what was good about the open internet, U.S. policymakers should take a cue from these other world players and work alongside them with their own innovators. As it stands, there's no alternative to the GDPR (even Congress regularly cites it approvingly). Building a good Option B would make it clear that the American vision is differentand better. An American tech vision must champion the good that innovators have contributed and seek to support them as friends instead of denigrating them as enemies. Unlike Europe, it must acknowledge that technologists understand their products better than regulators. And it must see the internet as something global, not national.</p><p>America is still the world's tech leader, but it cannot take its leadership for granted. There are other players entering the race, and they're presenting challenges to the open internet America created. If the United States wants to keep its place in the lead, it'll have to learn to play nice with everyone on its team.</p><p>Ryan Khurana is the Executive Director of the Institute for Advancing Prosperity and a Technology Policy Fellow at Young Voices.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1123432428</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y19-X461-DYTH-G040-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"872\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 16, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

But every time we do any of these things, we put a piece of ourselves on the information grid where big companies fight to access it, all for the noble purpose of 'serving us better.' Of course, they also try to capture the information for leverage against each other, because that's what brings in profits, thus kind of defeating the purpose.But whatever be the current situation, it's true that the information age is evolving, so the rules designed to protect our interest also need to evolve. The European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which was accepted on May 25, 2016 to go into effect on May 25, 2018 was framed for this purpose. </p><p>GDPR essentially defines and strengthens the rights that data subjects residing in the European Union have regarding personal data relating to them and attempts to unify data protection laws across Europe, regardless of where that data is processed.On the face of it, the regulation makes a reality tech companies' worst fears:Personal data: The definition of personal data has been expanded to any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person. So IP addresses, application user IDs, Global Positioning System (GPS) data, cookies, media access control (MAC) addresses, unique mobile device identifiers (UDID) and International Mobile Equipment IDs (IMEI) among other things are now included in the definition.Sensitive personal data: The current law from 1995 treats health records, religious affiliations, racial/ethnic origin, political opinion, trade union membership, physical/mental health, sexual preferences and offenses/convictions as sensitive personal data. GDPR adds genetic and biometric data to the list. Organizations can only request this kind of data in the framework of legal procedures and only if they safeguard the individual's vital interests.Explicit consent: No information can be collected from any individual for whatever purpose without their explicit consent regarding the nature of data being collected and the purpose for which it will be used. The data is also required to be removed on request if it was collected to facilitate the provision of services that are no longer required. Individuals and organizations also have the right to be forgotten, so people can have their information scrubbed from the public domain if they so choose.Access to data: The earlier rules required companies to furnish the information they held on consumers after payment of fees. Requesting data has now become free. Companies will have to tell their patrons/users what personal data is held on them, also where, for what purpose and how it is being processed.Privacy by design: Systems should be designed in a way that companies only hold and process data when absolutely necessary, they shouldn't be storing data incidental to the services they offer for processing later on, so privacy must exist by default. Moreover, their systems should have controls and mechanisms for the protection of data held and/or processed.Breach notification: Hackers are getting smarter by the day, leading to data breaches at retailers, media and technology companies. Since these businesses have huge data pools, each breach could affect millions of people. At times, companies (like Yahoo) haven't informed users when their data was compromised, thus increasing the risk of identity theft and making users wary. GDPR mandates that a person has to be informed within 72 hours when his/her data has been breached.Data protection officers: Data processing companies with over 250 employees are required to appoint a data protection officer (DPO), who will be responsible for the management and protection of data within the company and the systems processing it. The DPO will be somebody conversant with data protection law, will be the point of contact for regulatory enquiry or data requests and will report to the highest level of management. So both data controllers (entities that decide the purpose and manner in which personal data is used, or will be used) and processors (persons or groups that process data on behalf of the controller, including the functions of obtaining, recording, adapting or holding of personal data) may need to employ a DPO. Data portability: Companies are required to move personal data pertaining to any individual to another company/controller/online platform if so directed by the individual concerned. For this purpose, they may receive a copy of their personal data in a commonly used machine-readable format for transfer from one controller to another or have the data transferred directly to another controller.Huge fines: With the GDPR implementation, companies will be liable to pay huge fines for noncompliance with any of the above. For smaller offenses, a company may be fined up to \u20ac10 million or 2% of its global turnover, whichever is greater. More serious or continuing noncompliance can lead to fines of up to \u20ac20 million or 4% of global turnover, again whichever is greater.Effect on Technology CompaniesThe GDPR might seem like a bad deal for big technology companies, but in fact, having well-defined rules that are up to speed with new technological trends like cloud-based delivery of services, IoT, machine learning and social networks actually helps them to frame company policies and build adequate systems around them. Since they don't have the monetary constraints that smaller companies do, they are better equipped to be in compliance when the GDPR becomes enforceable. Alphabet's GOOGL[1] Google, MicrosoftMSFT[2] and Amazon AMZN[3] have already said that their Cloud, Azure and AWS services, respectively are on track to be in compliance when the rules go into effect.But the GDPR gets trickier when individuals are involved, with advertising technology companies impacted the most. Not all of them are directly connected with the user, so obtaining permissions can be difficult. Also, targeted advertising involves several processes such as collecting user data, holding, matching, analyzing and on the basis of these operations, offering some products and services to users. So profiling is important for targeted advertising in a way that data mining for machine learning purposes may not be.Advertisers generally use unique mobile device identifiers (much like cookies) to determine if they have already served an ad to a specific user, to retarget them and also to determine the frequency at which they should be targeted. The identifier tracks the user's behavior across apps and the web, becoming central to the profiling process. The problem arises when an app obtains permission to use data that is linked to the device ID because it may also be linked to a database that contains other information on the same device ID. Thus a simple online purchase can result in sensitive information becoming identifiable with a person's name, address or phone number.Companies like Google and Facebook, that collect user data for targeted advertising, are required to obtain explicit permissions. Since they have direct connections with users, they are in a position to ask for them. If the permissions can be linked to benefits, users may be more willing to share.The GDPR says, 'A purpose that is vague or general, such as for instance 'improving users' experience,' 'marketing purposes' or 'future research' will - without further detail - usually not meet the criteria of being 'specific.'' So the companies can no longer ask for broad and sweeping permissions covering all their services. They have to offer either an opt-in for the tracking, or give users the details related to their data along with a chance to opt out. This is a blessing because at least some users some of the time, don't read through permissions or may not be inclined to act to opt out of something.Technology companies building apps that are widely in use or those operating an app ecosystem like AppleAAPL[4], Amazon or Google, may be required to check data flows to ensure that no permission passes inadvertently. Particularly because apps generally don't have any restrictions on sharing information between each other, a flaw that can be exploited by malicious apps to steal information or break into a device.ConclusionThere are two aspects to privacy that the GDPR attempts to address. The first is with respect to ownership of personal data that remains with data subjects (whether individuals or organizations), so anybody wishing to use this data is required to obtain necessary permissions. The second is with respect to responsible use of the data by implementing adequate security measures to prevent data or identity theft after explicit permission has been obtained.While adhering to the new rules will be both difficult and expensive, it appears that the larger technology companies will play an even greater role in the data flow process, necessarily remaining as gate keepers to the web. That's because they possess the kind of resources that will be required for the most sophisticated security systems and are also in direct contact with the end customer.Wall Street's Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

Now porn is a ballooning industry - and maybe a harmful one -with no real opponents. What happened?</p></bodyText></highlight></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Year Was 1976. Republicans were reeling from Watergate. Christian conservatives were defecting to the Democratic Party. And Jerry Falwell, the Virginia preacher with a booming Baptist congregation and a popular radio show, decided he could no longer sit on the sidelines as he saw American culture succumbing to the creeping forces of secularism. The precipitating event was an interview given by Jimmy Carter, in which the Democratic presidential nominee admitted to having \"looked on a lot of women with lust,\" and \"committed adultery in my heart many times.\" Carter had never acted on such temptation, he implied, but the admission kept him humble: \"Christ says, don't consider yourself better than someone else because one guy screws a whole bunch of women while the other guy is loyal to his wife.\"</p><p>The doctrine itself was not objectionable. But the language-and more crucially, the venue-was intolerable for Falwell. The interview had run in Playboy magazine, alongside nude photographs of Miss November and articles such as \"The Vatican Sex Manual\" and \"Prurient Puritans.\" In his televised Sunday sermons, Falwell began railing against Carter's courtship of the randy men's magazine and its 5 million readers. When Carter's team tried to block one of his antagonistic sermons from being broadcast shortly before Election Day, claiming it violated the Federal Communications Commission's Fairness Doctrine, Falwell raised the stakes. He assembled a group of leading fundamentalist ministers at the National Press Club in Washington and accused Carter of \"muzzling a preacher of the gospel from preaching his moral convictions.\" The press conference, which cemented Falwell's status as an ascendant political heavyweight, would be looked back on as the inception of the Moral Majority.</p><p>It was the height of the porn wars. More than abortion or homosexuality, the rising tide of pornography in America was, in the 1970s, becoming central to conservative Americans' perception of a civilization in decline. For faith leaders, it was an easily exploitable issue; for Falwell, it was a crusade. He fought to remove adult content from convenience stores. He went to court to battle Hustler and Penthouse. And he never forgave Carter-who ended up winning the White House in 1976, carrying the evangelical vote along the way-for his original sin of talking to Hugh Hefner's publication. \"Giving an interview to Playboy magazine was lending the credence and the dignity of the highest office in the land to a salacious, vulgar magazine that did not even deserve the time of his day,\" Falwell said in 1981.</p><p>Forty years after that D.C. press conference, a very different scene unfolded. This one took place in New York and starred Jerry Falwell Jr., inheritor of the family business. Hours earlier, the younger Falwell had introduced the GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump to a massive gathering of Christian leaders, calling him \"God's man,\" anointed to lead the nation in turbulent times. The summit was successful beyond anyone's expectation. As they celebrated back at Trump Tower, Falwell sought to document the occasion with a photo. The future president stood in the middle, flanked by Falwell Jr. and his wife, Becki. Thumbs went up. The camera snapped. Falwell tweeted the photo to his 60,000 followers. There was just one hiccup: Lurking over Becki Falwell's left shoulder, framed in gold, was a cover of Playboy, graced by a bow-tied Trump and a smiling brunette covered only by his tuxedo jacket.</p><p>The photo sparked a frenzy. Nothing, it seemed, could so neatly encapsulate the religious right's backsliding as Falwell Jr. giving a thumbs-up in front of the very magazine his father had singled out as symbolic of America's moral decay-while standing shoulder to shoulder with a man who had appeared in a softcore porno flick and who reportedly, as Jimmy Carter might have put it, screwed a bunch of women outside of marriage, including a Playboy model and hardcore adult-film actress.</p><p>And it highlighted something else just as striking: the total abandonment of pornography as a battleground in America's culture war.</p><p>***</p><p>From the 1960s through the turn of the century, pornography played a dominant role in the American political argument-its morality and legality, its restrictions and regulations, its implications and unintended consequences. It was treated as a matter of urgency not just by the religious right, which decried the hypersexualizing of society, but by the radical left, which denounced the objectifying of women. Liberal feminists and conservative evangelicals found themselves unexpectedly allied in vilifying the adult entertainment industry. After decades of intensifying conflict, Ronald Reagan convened a Presidential Commission on Pornography in 1985; two years later, Reagan held a press conference to announce his administration's plan to combat illegal obscenity-and issue a warning to the porn professionals: \"Your industry's days are numbered.\"</p><p>Instead, the industry exploded. Today, pornography in America is a societal phenomenon and an economic behemoth. As of late 2018, according to Alexa.com, five of the 50 most trafficked websites in the United States. belong to the adult industry. The biggest site, Pornhub, typically ranks around No. 15, in the neighborhood of titans like Netflix and ESPN. In 2017 alone, Pornhub hosted 28.5 billion visits, an average of 81 million per day, the overwhelming majority based in America. All told, visitors to Pornhub last year searched 50,000 times per minute and 800 times per second. And that's one website-merely the brightest star in a boundless constellation of explicit content.</p><p>We know that the ubiquity of porn is a problem: Even as experts debate the science of addiction and the link between consumption and destructive behavior, there is surefire sociological evidence of its exacerbating influence on those most susceptible-people predisposed to violence, for instance, or misogyny or child abuse. There is also consensus that it has, in plenty of cases, contributed to abusive relationships and the fracturing of families. And that's just where adults are concerned. Millions of kids today are watching porn, a freedom afforded to the smartphone generation, leaving parents, educators and clinicians increasingly anxious. If ever there were a national dialogue needed about porn-if ever there were a moment for some opportunistic politician to make a cause of it-the time would be now.</p><p>Instead, the battlefield has been deserted. When a group of conservatives met last year with Attorney General Jeff Sessions, they hoped to convince him of the need for a return to rigorous Reagan-era prosecution of obscenity. Sessions, a staunch social conservative and longtime Sunday school teacher, shook his head. \"There's not enough resources to combat child pornography,\" Sessions said, according to attendees, \"much less to enforce obscenity laws.\"</p><p>With the internet offering an ever-expanding breadth of content, and smartphones and laptops replacing squalid movie houses and black-curtained storefronts, resistance to porn is beginning to feel futile.</p><p>\"Is this a winnable war? I don't know,\" says Donna Rice Hughes, a longtime anti-porn activist whose organization, Enough Is Enough, encourages a safer internet for kids. \"In these cultural battles, the oxygen gets sucked out of the room after so many losses. Today, you've got extreme porn as the new normal-not just for adults, but for our kids. So it's a demoralization due to so many losses and so much collateral damage.\" Hughes adds, \"When you have a nonprofit like mine, donors want to see progress. And to be honest, we haven't seen any.\"</p><p>The political class has largely gone silent. Over a decade spent covering Republican politics, I struggle to recall instances of politicians calling attention to pornography. The lone exception: Diane Black, a congresswoman running this year for governor of Tennessee, blamed the rise in school shootings on adolescent porn habits. She was widely ridiculed and ultimately lost the GOP primary. Her comment was a cautionary tale. Black had attacked a multibillion-dollar industry-one trafficked by many of her constituents-and the only dent made was to her own reputation.</p><p>America is an exception in this sense. Many governments around the world aggressively police erotic content; even the liberal nation of Iceland has toyed with a sweeping ban on pornography. A controversial British law requiring internet users to be registered and age-verified before accessing adult websites is expected to be implemented by year's end. There is no prospect for such action on this side of the Atlantic, in part because the First Amendment's protections are so strong, but also because political appetite is so weak. In lieu of legislative intervention, advocacy groups work the edges of the issue, pressuring companies such as McDonald's, Subway, Starbucks and Panera Bread to install filters on their free Wi-Fi networks. This, at least philosophically, represents a conservative's dream: civic society stepping up to address a problem government cannot solve. But these efforts can go only so far. It has become evident over the past half-century that in this particular theater of the culture war, high-level government action is a prerequisite for victory. Without it, defeat has become certain.</p><p>What happened? The pervasiveness of porn is a reminder that politics historically hasn't been much of a bulwark against the most primitive human desires-money, power, sex and, in this instance, a combination of the three. But it's also a window into the mentality on the right, which has surrendered the fight on many social issues as America has moved left. Even with Trump in the White House and five conservatives on the Supreme Court, there is no reversing the cultural tides that have swept away the Moral Majority's footprint on supporting traditional marriage and prayer in public schools. The difference is that some on the right still pay lip service to those lost causes. When it comes to porn-more accessible, more acceptable and less scrutinized than at any time during its history-they don't even bother anymore.</p><p>***</p><p>No archaeologist can explore a society without unearthing the remains of what we might now call pornography-from prehistoric sketches of nude women on Ice Age cave walls to the bounty of explicit images and sculptures left behind by the Greeks and Romans. In 1524, with the printing press still less than a century old, the Italian engraver Marcantonio Raimondi published a book depicting 16 positions of sexual intercourse, copies of which spread throughout Europe. Raimondi was arrested and jailed by Pope Clement VII-the first known collision between porn and politics.</p><p>One challenge faced by enforcers like Clement is that erotica has a nose for the underground. When British author John Cleland published his libidinous novel, Memoirs of a Woman of Pleasure-better known as Fanny Hill-in 1748, he was imprisoned and charged with \"corrupting the King's subjects.\" Cleland agreed to cease publication, but it was too late: The material had already been pirated, and replicas quickly proliferated around the Western Hemisphere. When a Massachusetts printer was shut down for distributing Fanny Hill in 1821, he took the case to the state Supreme Court-and lost. Yet the cultural momentum was inexorable. The daguerreotype, a forerunner to the modern photograph, was introduced in 1839; as with the dawn of the internet a century and a half later, one of its primary functions was to reproduce and distribute sexual images.</p><p>American legislators tried to head off the problem with the Comstock Act of 1873, which banned mailing of \"obscene,\" \"lewd,\" or \"lascivious\" materials, but new laws couldn't keep pace with technology. First, it was halftone printing, which cheaply reproduced black-and-white images; then moving pictures, the earliest of which experimented with capturing nude women, igniting a black market of illegally filmed productions that grew steadily from the 1920s through World War II. American policymakers took an out-of-sight, out-of-mind approach, hoping to keep the smut quarantined to brothels and private parties; British authorities, fearing they had lost control, introduced the \"X\" rating in 1951. That same year, Modern Man published its first issue, which featured photos of nude women. Soon enough, the taboo became mainstream: Playboy hit newsstands in 1953 featuring Marilyn Monroe in the buff. The issue sold every one of its roughly 50,000 copies in a matter of weeks. Hugh Hefner had made soft-core pornography a popular commercial enterprise for the first time in the United States.</p><p>Government opposition was strong. Hefner spent two years battling the U.S. postmaster general, who refused to deliver copies of the magazine because of its offensive content. In 1957, Samuel Roth, a New York publisher and distributor of adult materials, was tried and convicted of violating the Comstock Act. His case, Roth v. United States, went all the way to the Supreme Court, which ruled 6-3 that \"obscenity\" was not protected under the First Amendment-and gave the government power to prohibit material \"utterly without redeeming social importance.\" The threat posed by this ruling to a rapidly professionalizing industry was fleeting, however. By 1960, Playboy's circulation topped 1 million. It tripled by 1965 and topped 5 million by 1970, besting both Time and Newsweek.</p><p>Legislators had, in previous decades, looked the other way. But given the confluence of developments in the 1960s-an upsurge of explicit films, books and magazines; advances in the industry's equipment and distribution; as well as court rulings that chipped away at existing obscenity laws and strengthened individual privacy laws-politicians could no longer ignore porn. In 1967, Congress authorized Lyndon B. Johnson to form a Presidential Commission on Obscenity and Pornography. In a preview of the deep political and cultural schisms that would open around the issue, the commission released two reports: the majority of members, liberals appointed by Johnson, downplayed the societal risks and actually suggested easing obscenity laws, while the minority of members, including a prominent conservative Catholic priest appointed by Richard Nixon after his 1968 victory, warned of grave implications and recommended vigorously enforcing those same laws.</p><p>The commission's dueling reports dropped in 1970, prompting Nixon to deliver fire-and-brimstone remarks calling for a wholesale ban on obscene material and declaring, \"So long as I am in the White House, there will be no relaxation of the national effort to control and eliminate smut from our national life.\" Instead, the 1970s would come to be known as \"The Golden Age of Porn.\" The profitability of high-production-quality films like \"Deep Throat\" was evidence of an accelerating sexual revolution. And there was a legal watershed in the form of Miller v. California, the 1973 Supreme Court ruling that, on the 100th anniversary of the Comstock Act, redefined obscenity with a three-part test that invoked state law, artistic merit and \"contemporary community standards.\" Technically it was-and still is-possible to outlaw pornography. But in practice the ruling meant that publishers and producers enjoyed such broad First Amendment protections that obscenity cases became nearly impossible to prosecute.</p><p>The implications were enormous and immediate: By decade's end, the top adult film stars were household names; Hustler was making Playboy look prudish by comparison; hundreds of X-rated movie theatres were opening nationwide; and for anyone worried about being spotted at an adult cinema, the VCR was starting to make home viewing a reality.</p><p>It was in this climate that serious, organized political opposition took root. It was led in part by conservative religious and political figures, most prominently Falwell and Paul Weyrich of The Heritage Foundation, men who pioneeringly understood the value of uniting faith leaders, defense hawks and wonky fiscal warriors under a banner that would become known as the conservative movement. In this particular fight, they were joined by some unlikely allies, most notably feminist leaders such as Gloria Steinem, Andrea Dworkin and Catharine MacKinnon, who were working-ultimately unsuccessfully-to pass local ordinances giving more tools to push back against pornography. (The star of Deep Throat, Linda Lovelace, ultimately became a born-again Christian and an anti-porn advocate.)</p><p>Reagan smartly harnessed the energy of this opposition, meeting with activists and promising action, but he did little in his first term to address the issue. \"Pornography\" appeared for the first time in the Republican Party's platform during Reagan's reelection campaign in 1984. The next year, he convened a new presidential commission on porn, this one headed by Edwin Meese, the archconservative attorney general. Meese wanted to ensure this would not be a repeat of the Johnson-era academic exercise. He used the commission to build an Untouchables-style \"obscenity strike force\" that aimed to put the fear of the federal government into the porn industry, threatening retailers who legally sold soft-core magazines in a show of brute political force. (Hefner, a fan of free speech and fully nude pool parties, dubbed it \"Sexual McCarthyism.\")</p><p>When it landed, the 1,960-page Meese Report surprised exactly no one: It concluded that pornography was a threat to society and recommended harsher enforcement of obscenity laws. In a particularly memorable passage, the report said the link between porn consumption and violence \"requires assumptions not found exclusively in the experimental evidence,\" yet concluded, \"We see no reason, however, not to make these assumptions ... that are plainly justified by our own common sense.\" The commission came under immediate criticism for its lack of scholarly rigor; academics whose work was cited by Meese protested the report's misapplication of their data, and even National Review concluded that the commission \"has to some extent found the conclusion it was looking for.\" That the report's findings were by and large empirically unsupported mattered not. Its recommendations allowed the Justice Department to execute what Reagan's supporters were agitating for: a crackdown on porn.</p><p>Over the next five years, the federal government put obscenity on the back foot. The trick, legally speaking, was exploiting the \"community standards\" described in Miller, allowing the feds to strategically target pornography producers who were marketing content in conservative parts of the country. At the same time, Meese rewrote Justice Department guidelines to allow for simultaneous obscenity prosecutions in multiple jurisdictions. This tactic worked: Indictments piled up and the adult industry's momentum slowed down. Congress got in on the action as well, banning \"dial-a-porn\" phone services and exploring a tightening of telecommunications laws to stem the tide of adult content. Emboldened, the GOP's 1992 platform called for \"a national crusade against pornography\" and endorsed sweeping government intervention. Anti-porn activists believed, for the first time, that they were actually winning.</p><p>\"And then everything shifted, thanks to two factors,\" says Patrick Trueman, who led the DOJ's obscenity strike force. \"The rise of the internet and Bill Clinton's presidency.\"</p><p>***</p><p>Nobody disputes that obscenity prosecutions dropped off dramatically during the Clinton years-as much as 70 percent, according to Reagan-era DOJ officials. And everyone agrees that the advent of the World Wide Web sparked pornography's historic propagation. The blame game boils down to the chicken or the egg: Did the explosion of internet porn make obscenity prosecutions pointless, or did the lax enforcement invite the explosion of internet porn? Whatever the answer, it's clear that the 1990s, a time of peace and prosperity and a whiff of libertinism, marked the start of this modern era of mass porn consumption.</p><p>With Meese and his anti-porn vice squad no longer running the DOJ, the industry itself grew more aggressive. \"Nobody had gotten popped for a long time, so people were pushing and pushing and pushing. More gangbangs, more harder content, more teen-themed videos, and people felt pretty safe in doing just about anything they wanted to do,\" Max Hardcore, a former erotic film star and producer, told the Villanova Sports &amp; Entertainment Law Journal in 2007, adding: \"Clinton was good for the industry, good for the economy, and he didn't get us involved in any quagmire wars.\"</p><p>Sensitive to the perception of being soft on porn, the Clinton administration boasted of focusing its energy and resources on the narrower issue of child endangerment-foreshadowing the approach taken by the opposition today. But even that low-hanging political fruit proved difficult to pick. The Communications Decency Act of 1996, which criminalized the distribution of offensive material to minors, was dismantled by the Supreme Court a year later. In response, a bipartisan group of legislators worked with the Clinton White House to craft the Child Online Protection Act, which focused more specifically on restricting minors' access to commercial material. But repeated court challenges led to a permanent injunction. The law never took effect.</p><p>By 2000, lawmakers settled on a lowest common denominator: mandating internet filters in public schools as a condition for federal funding. That law, the Children's Internet Protection Act, was upheld by the Supreme Court. It was evidence of success, however incrementally, for an anti-porn movement that felt the fight slipping away from them-and that couldn't have known at the time how soon smartphones would render the legislation hopelessly antiquated.</p><p>Republicans hadn't yet given up on the political value of an anti-porn crusade. George W. Bush promised repeatedly during the 2000 presidential campaign to cast a wider prosecutorial net for obscenity. In practice, this would mean targeting the producers of hardcore material-depicting, for example, rape, violence or bodily waste-that satisfied the complex Miller test. Bush appeared to mean business when he selected as his attorney general John Ashcroft, a favorite of religious conservatives and a longtime anti-porn crusader himself. In his first eight months on the job, Ashcroft met with activists, organized a symposium, evaluated the department's operations and handpicked a new leader of the obscenity division. Combating pornography, Bush and Ashcroft told conservatives, would be a federal priority again.</p><p>That changed on September 11, 2001.</p><p>\"9/11 stopped the Bush administration's momentum,\" says Richard Land, the longtime political head of the Southern Baptist Convention. \"They were planning to re-Reaganize the Department of Justice on this issue, and then they got completely waylaid.\"</p><p>Neil Malamuth, a University of California, Los Angeles, psychology professor and prominent scholar on porn, adds, \"Bush was going to make pornography a major issue. But when 9/11 happened, his administration made a conscious decision that it wasn't worth it. They knew they didn't have the resources, and they knew they needed to rally the public around certain causes. Pornography wasn't one of them.\"</p><p>Terrorism was suddenly an all-eclipsing concern for Americans across the ideological spectrum. As evangelical Christians grasped what this meant for their porn campaign, their concern turned to frustration and eventually anger. Religious conservatives watched in horror as big porn hitched itself to the rise of big tech, giving obscenity a foothold in corporate America and solidifying the adult industry's product as culturally tolerable. In December 2003, the magazine published by Christian organization Focus on the Family noted how, in 2000, \"conservatives celebrated what they thought marked the end of hard-core's unchecked reign.\" Three years later, the article concluded, \"those celebrations have given way to disappointment.\"</p><p>Such criticism of Bush from the right faded, however, as his administration wore on. The simplest explanation is fatigue: Having lost so many battles during the Clinton years, only to then see the hope of the Ashcroft era vanish, much of the anti-porn movement ran out of gas. \"We put the issue front and center in the '90s. Congress was engaged, we were engaged and the technology industry was engaged fighting against us,\" says Hughes, the internet safety advocate. \"We had a bipartisan coalition behind us, but we were losing just about every battle in the courts. And it just demoralized so many people. I think that's when the white flag came out.\"</p><p>Around this time, a pair of practical acknowledgments began reshaping the political discourse surrounding porn. The first was that Pandora's box could never be closed-that with the internet oozing adult content from every portal, prevention and education made more sense than prosecution and enforcement. The second was that, to the extent prosecution and enforcement remained viable, the government's overriding responsibility should be protecting children-from both viewing mature content and starring in it.</p><p>This is what animates much of today's anti-porn movement. Hughes considered it a \"huge victory\" when, in 2016, both Trump and Hillary Clinton supported her organization's Child's Internet Safety Presidential Pledge, which called for tougher enforcement of existing laws \"to prevent the sexual exploitation of children online.\" But the developments since have been discouraging. When Hughes raised the issue to Sessions at a meeting last year, he knew nothing about the pledge. Vice President Mike Pence told Hughes in a separate conversation that he supported her efforts-but made clear that only Trump's active support could truly move the needle. She is not holding her breath.</p><p>The truth is, despite federal laws on the books-as well as 25 state versions mandating filters in schools and libraries-efforts to shield children from explicit content have failed miserably. In part, this is because of its sheer prevalence: The Huffington Post reported last year that porn websites account for more monthly traffic than Netflix, Amazon and Twitter combined. There has never been a reliable dollar figure placed on pornography as a whole; NBC News reported in 2015 that the industry is worth $97 billion, an estimate that experts I spoke with agreed was severely lowballing. Perhaps the most telling statistic: On planet Earth, only Google and Netflix are known to consume more bandwidth than MindGeek, the umbrella corporation that houses several of the biggest free porn aggregator websites.</p><p>Precise statistics related to adolescent pornography use are similarly elusive, in this case because kids worry about getting into trouble for answering honestly. In 2016, a Christian research organization called The Barna Group released the results of a comprehensive online survey based on interviews with nearly 2,800 participants. The findings were stark: Forty-nine percent of children ages 13 to 17 consume pornography at least once a month, with a further 30 percent saying they did so less often. Only 21 percent said they had never viewed pornography.</p><p>The numbers jumped considerably when moving to the next bracket, young adults ages 18 to 24. Among those respondents, 71 percent reported consuming pornography at least monthly, with just 9 percent saying they had never viewed it. These findings are consistent with the work done by academics; setting aside disagreements over morality and consequences, the consensus within the community of pornography experts is that young people are consuming explicit content in near-universal fashion. A study of the subject in 2009, undertaken by a researcher at the University of Montreal, had to be canceled. The reason: He could not find a control group of men in their 20s who had not viewed pornography.</p><p>The public's shifting attitude toward adult content is due in no small part to mass consumption by nonadults. In the survey, when respondents 25 and older were asked about the morality of watching porn, 54 percent said it was \"wrong.\" Yet among respondents ages 13 to 24, just 32 percent said viewing porn is \"wrong\"-compared with 48 percent who said the same of overeating, and 56 percent who said the same of not recycling.</p><p>Younger people are not the sole driver of porn's mainstreaming, however. At the beginning of the decade, Gallup began tracking the percentage of Americans who found porn \"morally acceptable.\" The number was 30 percent in 2011. By 2018, it had spiked to 43 percent. Age aside, the sharp uptick can be heavily attributed to softer perceptions of porn among single men, nonreligious people and Democrats. Yet a greater acceptance of porn is apparent across virtually every demographic, including women, married men and churchgoers; among Republicans, the \"morally acceptable\" figure has jumped 11 points in the past eight years.</p><p>Still, 43 percent approval leaves a majority of Americans disapproving. In political terms, 57 percent represents a winning issue. There is no question most Americans feel that there's something wrong about porn; it's barred at workplaces and unwelcome in polite company. In polls its acceptability registers lower than other hot-button culture issues like abortion, gay marriage and legal pot. So why won't anyone in government go after it?</p><p>***</p><p>In the dimly lit bowels of a Washington hotel complex, hundreds of politically active Christians gathered in late September for the annual Values Voter Summit. This year's exhibit hall offered advocacy for all seasons: expanded religious freedom, tighter abortion restrictions, counseling for relatives of ex-gays, paid family leave, single-gender college dormitories, refugee settlement programs, faith-based financial planning, the preservation of Social Security and much more.</p><p>One issue, however, was not represented: pornography. The closest thing to a mention of porn at the conference was in literature provided by the group Concerned Women for America, which combats \"sexual exploitation.\" When I asked the two young women working the exhibit about specific advocacy related to porn, they shifted uncomfortably in their seats and produced a synchronized shrug. At a neighboring booth, Frank Mitchell, a Christian activist and veteran attendee of the summit, gave me his theory of the case. \"The fact is, times have changed and we have bigger issues to deal with. If we're sitting around debating pornography, we're wasting our time,\" Mitchell says. He tells me the American Family Association was once the tip of the spear in combating obscenity; as fate would have it, he had just attended a lunch sponsored by that group. Did porn come up? \"It didn't come up. It never comes up,\" Mitchell shook his head. \"It's not like it's been pushed to the side. It's been pushed off the table.\"</p><p>Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council and organizer of the Values Voter Summit, won't go that far. \"It's still a very big issue, but it's not necessarily a policy issue because the internet has made it so that it's everywhere,\" he says. \"I mean, even before the internet, the government didn't do a good job of policing it. So how do you get the genie back in the bottle?\"</p><p>This is the fundamental question facing an anti-porn movement that is attempting to rebrand itself. The adult industry's most notable modern adversary is Fight the New Drug, a well-heeled organization that grabbed headlines a few years ago by plastering \"Porn Kills Love\" billboards all over San Francisco. Hoping to transcend the stereotypes attached to the old opposition-stuffy, Bible-thumping zealots-Fight the New Drug markets itself as stylish and tech-savvy. The crucial distinction is emphasis: Rather than attacking porn as a moral evil in and of itself, Fight the New Drug focuses on the practical harms to people, relationships and families. That said, the wheel isn't being reinvented: The group calls itself \"non-legislative and non-religious,\" but it publishes updates on political activities and was seeded with millions of dollars from Mormon church officials, a fact it downplays.</p><p>Morality in Media, a faith-based organization that was central to anti-porn efforts beginning in the 1960s, was rechristened in 2015 as the National Center on Sexual Exploitation. Its president is none other than Trueman, the former DOJ \"obscenity strike force\" chief who says he is \"trying to revitalize the movement against pornography\" to fit the times. \"We knew it couldn't be and shouldn't be just a religious conservative issue, because pornography affects the issue of sex trafficking, it affects child sexual abuse, it affects sexual violence against women, it affects the rape crisis on college campuses,\" he says. \"We needed to create a new movement, and we knew it needed to be broad-based in order to win.\"</p><p>One might think the #MeToo era, with its fierce backlash against toxic masculinity, would give new energy to the enemies of an industry that traffics heavily in the filmed subjugation of women. Some conservatives have tried to capitalize on this point; earlier this year, Ross Douthat wrote an op-ed in the New York Times titled, \"Let's Ban Porn.\" Feminists, however, are decidedly less vocal than they were in past decades, split internally over the question of whether filmed sex empowers women or exploits them. \"Some have broken with the faith-based organizations, but we haven't, even though we're a different breed-progressive, lefty feminists,\" says Gail Dines, a prominent anti-porn activist. \"For us, this is still all about gender equality. You can't pick and choose. You either believe that women and men have the right to the same political, social and cultural respect, or you don't.\"</p><p>Meanwhile, inside the other half of the anti-porn coalition, it seems for every new step taken toward combating obscenity, two steps are taken back. Evangelical leaders I spoke with cited instances of pastors shying away from the subject for fear of alienating their congregants. \"It's very pervasive even in the church,\" Perkins says. \"It's not just men, it's women, too. ... Some pastors are afraid to hit the issue too hard.\"</p><p>In this sense, it's easy to understand why elected officials have backed off. If politics is downstream from culture, and culture has accepted porn, why wouldn't politicians do the same? If pastors are afraid to alienate their constituents by condemning porn, what policymaker in his or her right mind would?</p><p>***</p><p>Todd Weiler went where no politician had gone before-an unwitting trailblazer in the latest chapter of the war on porn. In March 2016, the Utah state senator created national buzz when he introduced a resolution labeling pornography \"a public health crisis.\" It passed unanimously in the Legislature and was signed into law by the governor. The resolution is toothless; it simply states that porn causes \"a broad spectrum of individual and public health impacts and societal harms,\" and calls for \"education, prevention, research and policy change at the community and societal level.\" Still, the action in Utah seemed to snap the debate surrounding porn from its yearslong slumber. Four other states-South Dakota, Virginia, Tennessee and Arkansas-passed similar resolutions in 2017. Florida and Kansas passed resolutions in 2018, and a host of other states have begun debating similar measures.</p><p>Two things stand out about Weiler's ploy.</p><p>The first is that Utah's resolution, which served as the template for those in other states, is filled with controversial, scientifically unverified suggestions about links to addiction, violence and infidelity. This was the product of a partnership with Trueman's group, the National Center on Sexual Exploitation. \"They were looking for a 'courageous'-meaning dumb and gullible-legislator to introduce the first resolution,\" Weiler says, laughing and recounting how he first stumbled into porn legislation because of dogged complaints from a constituent. The senator let Trueman's group draft much of the language; the result was criticism from outside experts for asserting causalities and correlations that have never been proven.</p><p>The second is that Weiler believes those debates are peripheral to the task at hand, having championed the resolution as a means toward a more specific end. He says American culture is past the point of no return when it comes to porn, and explains that he sponsored the measure for one reason-to start a conversation about protecting minors. \"People think I'm some kind of zealot,\" he says, \"but everything I'm doing is to protect children. I haven't sponsored any legislation dealing with adults. I'm not trying to make pornography illegal. ... People sell all kinds of things on the internet, but they don't sell them to 15-year-olds because they would get in trouble-gun manufacturers, vaping companies, alcohol distributors. That's not the case with porn websites.\"</p><p>In this, at least, he has expert opinion on his side. The community of recognized authorities on pornography is small and secretive; most belong to a private listserv, \"SEXNET,\" hosted by Northwestern University. In conversations with a number of members, I heard diverging opinions about any number of issues-but a consensus of near-panic emerged when I asked about the science of adolescent porn use and its physiological ramifications. Samuel Perry, a sociologist at the University of Oklahoma who has written more than 50 peer-reviewed articles and two books about pornography, says the debates regarding addiction and violence are \"ideologically loaded, with some scholars bound and determined to find negative effects, and others bound and determined to say there's nothing to see here.\" When it comes to kids and porn, however, Perry says sociologists are generally and increasingly in agreement that we are facing a multifaceted crisis. Academics are unable to perform experiments that expose minors to explicit content, for obvious reasons, so they are left with third-party research that is often unreliable. Without their own data, academics have largely \"remained silent\" on the issue of adolescent porn consumption, at least publicly, Perry says, even as it's \"tremendously concerning for people across the spectrum, even the most sexually progressive people in my field, that young people are exposed to things they aren't ready for and don't know how to process.\"</p><p>A possibility, given the meteoric growth of porn in America and the government's inability to contain it, is that human brains might be changed by processing obscenity at earlier ages. Malamuth, the UCLA professor and godfather of the porn research community, says he has taught a course on sexuality and women's studies for decades. His tradition was to show a disturbing, explicit clip as part of a lecture on pornography-prefaced with a long warning about what the students were about to watch, and urging those with sensitivities to leave the room. \"When I first started showing it, you would have very strong reactions-women crying, people hugging each other, deeply affected by it,\" Malamuth says. \"But in the later years, after my warnings and after showing the film, the students would give me these strange looks. 'What the hell was the warning all about?'\"</p><p>Malamuth continues, \"The anti-pornography people argued for years that once people saw enough of this stuff they would become desensitized in a way that's dysfunctional and could affect their attitudes and behaviors related to violence and women. The pro-pornography people said that once we're exposed to pornography we're desensitized in a good way-we realize it's not a very big deal.\" He chuckles. \"They've looked at the same data and drawn different conclusions.\"</p><p>That debate will continue, no doubt, but it will take place on the outskirts of modern culture-miles from the ideological mainstream and light years from the political arena. In this sense, desensitization isn't just an explanation; it's a national phenomenon. So much so that millions of elementary schoolers have instant access to unlimited amounts of pornography. So much so that lawmakers consider themselves powerless to do anything about it. So much so that news of the president of the United States having a past romance with a hardcore adult actress has met with a collective shrug. \"Let's face it,\" says Weiler, the Utah state senator. \"The fact that the president cheated on his wife with a porn star has been kind of a yawner.\"</p><p>Article originally published on POLITICO Magazine</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">POLTCO-221917</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">POLTCO2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TPS-4M31-F118-902N-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">334576</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-11-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"6786\"/><timeReceived>11:52 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Capitol News Company, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Politico.com</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"11\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>November 11, 2018 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

Despite the official government line remaining the same since 2013, the public's widely held perception of the NBN is as an abject failure.</p><p>Late last week Communications Minister Paul Fletcher put out a media release entitled \"NBN Co powers through FY19 rollout and activation targets\", in which he sought praise for NBN reporting that it had exceeded its rollout and activation targets for the 2018-19 financial year.</p><p>However, the supposed good news sank like a stone, as NBN related conversations instead centred around revelations that NBN Co had <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.itnews.com.au/news/nbn-co-floats-its-own-netflix-tax-527507\">floated the idea of carving out video streaming traffic</url> - for applications like Netflix and Stan - and potentially charging more for it.</p><p>The so-called \"Netflix tax\" was met with widespread derision, for its worrying nods towards the lack of Net Neutrality in Australia. But mainly for the implication that, to even consider making consumers pay more for the most popular use of their internet plans, the NBN and its business model are clearly not fit for long-term purpose.</p><p>NBN has since attempted to hose down the topic, saying it was merely looking to assess whether handling streaming traffic was a problem for the retail service providers like Telstra, Optus, TPG and Aussie Broadband, which resell its network.</p><p>But the problem NBN and the government have in spinning their line now is that the general public cannot be hoodwinked as easily as they could when the Coalition came to power in 2013 and ripped up the original NBN fibre to the premise plan.</p><p>Back then Comms Minister Malcolm Turnbull and Prime Minister Tony Abbott told the country that Labor's proposed network was too expensive, and changed course to a multi-technology mix of lesser technologies, which it said would be completed quicker, more cheaply and be just as useful for citizens.</p><p>At the time the protests among the tech literate were deafening, but most voters paid scant attention as many media outlets reported the government's assessments without detailed investigation.</p><p>Viewers and readers were turned off by the tech talk, but that is no longer the case.</p><p>Citizens now tangibly see the limitations of the network that is being rolled out, and stories like the \"Netflix tax\" make them question what the point has been of subsidising a network that will seemingly struggle to offer the most basic of services affordably in the near future.</p><p>Rather than listen to the government talking up the completion of the NBN in 2020, citizens want to know how it will be upgraded to cater to the growing needs as the next decade progresses.</p><p>There are no answers to that question and, regardless of how the economics of the original NBN may have played out, history will not look kindly on the politicians and their enablers who led the country down this path.</p><p>Stories on Monday quoting NBN execs as <link service=\"DOCUMENT\"><marker>somehow being surprised</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"lni\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey></locator></link> by the sudden popularity of online streaming services are a blatant attempt to rewrite history and deflect from the over-reliance on unsuitable infrastructure, which those in charge must have known about back in 2013.</p><p>We are at a point when the technology underpinning communications and the services that run on top of it are mainstream life. It is hard to see how the government can fix its NBN predicament, but now is the time for it to grapple with big tech based on a position of expertise rather than politics.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFRONL-1520151575</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFRONL2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WHJ-KKP1-DY19-C33H-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">429670</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"909\"/><timeReceived>12:00 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

It was one of a number of posters carrying colourful niceties such as \u201cbe bold\u201d, \u201clisten as much as you speak\u201d and \u201cinclusion is within everyone\u2019s ability.\u201d</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In front of the colourful wall, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar beamed with Facebook founder and billionaire Mark Zuckerberg, who was announcing several hundred jobs and a multimillion-euro expansion at the Facebook headquarters in Dublin\u2019s Silicon Docks. After the photo-op, they sat down for a private meeting. In response to a subsequent parliamentary question from Miche\u00e1l Martin, the Taoiseach said they did not have \u201cany substantive discussions on regulatory matters\u201d during their chat.</p><p>The November meeting was not the first interaction between both men. When he became Taoiseach, Varadkar received a personal note from Zuckerberg describing its office in Dublin as \u201can important part of our global community\u201d and thanking him for taking part in a photoshoot there to highlight the company\u2019s parental leave policy.</p><p>When Varadkar became Taoiseach, Facebook and other social media sites also became an important client of the government. It spent \u20ac76,000 to promote Project Ireland 2040 across Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.</p><p>The spend on social media to promote Bliain na Gaeilge was \u20ac1.35 million last year, for Healthy Ireland it was \u20ac5 million and its failed campaign to bring the Rugby World Cup to Ireland spent \u20ac6,500 on social media ads. This contrasts to 2016, before Varadkar became Taoiseach, when the government spent zero on social media advertising.</p><p>From Facebook, the government gets well-paid jobs in the capital, photo opportunities and a platform to market its work. From the government, Facebook gets a talented workforce, low tax and weak regulation for its European office base. Given their mutual reliance it is fair to raise questions about whether politicians can be honest brokers when it comes to policies that affect the bottom line of big tech.</p><p>For this reason, it is no wonder that suspicions were raised over the government\u2019s plans to set the digital age of consent at 13, which was stopped in its tracks by a D\u00e1il vote last week. The Dail defeat for the government - and victory for many working in the area of children\u2019s rights - followed a less than adequate process of consultation and a poor level of understanding among the public about what was planned.</p><p>Put simply, the government tried to push laws through the D\u00e1il that would allow tech companies to permanently own everything that a child, from the age of 13, puts up about themselves online. Companies like Facebook, or gaming sites, could permanently store all the photographs they put up, messages with their friends, records of their locations and movements. They could use this information to sell ads or push products on those children and, essentially, to make money.</p><p>Throughout this debate, there seemed to be a perception in public debate that the age of consent was about the age at which teenagers should be allowed online. But this has nothing at all to do with access to the internet. It is about what companies like Facebook do with the information that children share once they are online.</p><p>The government had significant cover for its proposal from organisations like the ISPCC and the Children\u2019s Rights Alliance who had supported the proposal to set it at 13.</p><p>But at a closer look, the consultation process was far from thorough. For a start, it lasted just one month, meaning some organisations missed the deadline and had to follow up with the justice minister after the process was closed. The Children\u2019s Rights Alliance represents more than one hundred organisations.</p><p>Following some probing by columnist and satirist Oliver Callan, the organisation conceded that it made the recommendation of 13 to the government even though the vast majority of its members did not take a position. One of its members, the Irish National Teachers Organisation (INTO) wanted it set at 16, while another, the Teacher\u2019s Union of Ireland (TUI) thought 13 was too low.</p><p>CARI - the organisation which is at the front line of providing counselling not only to children who are victims of abuse but those who are displaying risky sexual behaviour towards other children, recommended an age of 15. It said there was a \u201cgrowing phenomenon\u201d of children themselves posing a risk of abuse, because of the mixed messages about consent that they are getting online, and pornographic content being targeted at them.</p><p>An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na also recommended that the age should be 16, but raised to 18 when the material related to sexual activity.</p><p>The Royal College of Physicians Faculty of Pediatrics missed the consultation and subsequently wrote to the Minister for Justice expressing concern that the age was being set at 13.</p><p>It said children and teenagers \u201cmay lack comprehension of the significant risks and consequences of sharing personal data, including photographs\u201d and \u201cmay not have the judgement/maturity to understand the consequences of inappropriate disclosure of feelings and personal thoughts on the internet.\u201d It said: \u201cThis behaviour may lead to significant feelings of regret, worry and anxiety.\u201d</p><p>TDs and senators lived up to their legislative responsibility and listened to these concerns. The age of consent was debated at length in the D\u00e1il, Seanad and in committee rooms of Leinster House. On Wednesday night, Labour and Fianna Fail joined forces to propose an amendment to set the age at 16. They were supported by Sinn F\u00e9in, and the government\u2019s plan for 13 was defeated by 56 votes to 51.</p><p>This is the sort of legislative process we were promised when an inconclusive election result left us with what was known as \u201cnew politics\u201d two years ago: Parties working across the divide to ensure that the D\u00e1il was not merely a place to rubber stamp government decisions, where laws are made following careful consideration, consultation and compromise.</p><p>In this case, it is a law that will be in the long-term interest of children.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SUBUPO-416999</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SUBUPO2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SC4-1KF1-F0B4-81W6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">315448</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-05-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1016\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Post Publications Ltd.
