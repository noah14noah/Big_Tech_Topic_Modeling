The stock has its worst day in four years after another privacy misstep. It led tech lower, and it pulled the rest of the market down with it.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">BILL GRIFFETH, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR: Here we go again. The government could be shut down in just days as lawmakers try to work through a number of thorny issues before Friday`s deadline.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">HERERA: Falling out of love. Ten years after the crash, a new report says fewer people are embracing stocks.</p><p>Those stories and more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Monday, March 19th.</p><p>GRIFFETH: And we bid you good evening, everybody. Welcome.</p><p>It was a rough start to the week on Wall Street today. All of the major indexes fell more than 1 percent with the Nasdaq off the most. It was led lower by Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), which had its worst day since 2014, as you heard. That after the company said that a third-party firm improperly kept data on millions of its users. We`ll have more on that story in a bit.</p><p>The sell-off, though, in tech, which has been one of the hottest sectors in the past year, that led the broader market lower as well today with the Dow closing down 335 points to 24,610. The Nasdaq was off by 137. The S&amp;P fell by 39.</p><p>Bob Pisani has more for us tonight from the New York Stock Exchange.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BOB PISANI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: The big story today was Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), down 7 percent. On the surface, it`s easy to blame today`s market woes just on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). It`s a big name, big valuation, a lot of momentum behind it.</p><p>When it reverses like it did today, it gives a lot of investors, particularly momentum investors, pause. But the story`s bigger than Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). Social media in general has been under assault for over a year. Many now realize that services that companies like Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) or Snap claim they provide to them for free, in fact, comes with a heavy cost -- privacy. And the customers are now coming to it understand that in many cases, they`re not customers, they`re the product.</p><p>But there`s bigger problems for the market. There`s a big leadership vacuum right now. No group is stepping forward as tech stocks have dropped. Stocks started the year strong on the strength of leadership among the biggest sectors like technology and financials, consumer discretionary.</p><p>But tech is now rolling over amid an assault of social media and nothing`s stepping forward. Energy stocks never recovered from the drops in early February. Materials and steel stocks have been dropping after rallying briefing. Industrials are faltering on these trade war issues. And banks were the last leadership group to go. They too have trending down in the last few days.</p><p>So, there is considerable nervousness around the Fed meeting with talk of a fourth rate hike. Trade wars are weighing on stocks and the White House drama is also a distraction. The issue, what`s left to power the markets forward?</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Bob Pisani at the New York Stock Exchange.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: More now on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), which shed more than $35 billion in market value today.</p><p>And as Bob just mentioned, the stock dropped about 7 percent in a very rough day of trading.</p><p>Julia Boorstin explains what exactly happened at the company and why investors fled the stock.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JULIA BOORSTIN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) under fire. Lawmakers in the U.S. and U.K. calling for CEO Mark Zuckerberg to testify, and the E.U. announcing an investigation into violations of privacy laws.</p><p>Here`s what happened. In early 2014, an app developer accessed info from 275,000 users of its app, as well as the data from about 50 million of their friends. Until April 2014, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) allowed app developers to access that data. The developer illegally sold that data to Cambridge Analytica, a data firm that worked with the Trump campaign.</p><p>When Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) found out in 2015, the data firm told Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) it deleted all of it. This weekend`s reports say the data is still out there and note that Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) failed to alert consumers whose data was harvested.</p><p>MARK MAHANEY, RBC CAPITAL MARKETS: I think Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) got blindsided, and they weren`t quick enough to acknowledge that their data was hacked and their data was misused. I think they need to be more up front about that, but there`s no question, these are very difficult I.T. challenges for Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).</p><p>BOORSTIN: Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) says it`s investigating the accuracy of the claims and just hired an outside firm to do a comprehensive audit. And Cambridge Analytica denies wrongdoing, saying it cooperated fully with Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) to delete the data, after discovering that the app developer it was working with had broken the rules.</p><p>Facebook`s business is built on its more than 2 billion monthly active users having confidence in the platform. And consumer reaction is mixed.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I figure everyone has my data. Like, it`s all out there, so I`m not so concerned.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I believe these executives should be held accountable.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I still trust that Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and other companies are trying their best to do it the right way.</p><p>BOORSTIN: Users` trust is key to provide valuable data to advertisers to target them.</p><p>BOB PECK, CREDIT SUISSE: They know at the end of the day, having the trust of their consumer is paramount, it`s key, and if they don`t earn that trust every single day, you will see users go off the platform. So, I think look for them to try to self-regulate as much as possible as they go forward here.</p><p>BOORSTIN: Now, analysts are raising concerns about potential advertiser backlash. Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) warning that this creates a serious public relations black eye and could lead to additional regulatory scrutiny.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Julia Boorstin in Los Angeles.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH: So, could the allegations facing Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) cause a wave of regulation to crash in on big tech? And if so, what would that mean for the whole technology sector?</p><p>Joining us tonight to talk about it is Ed Lee, managing editor at Recode.</p><p>Ed, already tonight, we`ve heard that the Connecticut attorney general is talking about a new investigation there into these allegations. So, the drumbeat is already starting to sound. What should Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) do in terms of self-regulation, in your view?</p><p>ED LEE, RECODE MANAGING EDITOR: So, it`s a great question. I think that sort of hits it on the head in terms of Facebook`s dilemma right now. There`s a lot of political will getting into this in terms of, you know, should Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) be regulated.</p><p>It`s going to be a test of Mark Zuckerberg`s leadership, the CEO. They haven`t taken definitive action as of yet, right? They`re basically saying we still need to investigate this, make sure that the reported claims are actually true, that this data is still on these third-party servers.</p><p>But even after that, there needs to be a more systemic fix in place in order to prove to Congress and to the American public that, you know what, we`re going to keep people`s data safe. Right now, they`re just taking these small, incremental steps.</p><p>HERERA: But as Bill mentioned, the risk of regulation is higher now than it probably has ever been before for this company. If, indeed, regulation is imposed, what do you think that would look like? Would it be more like European standards, which are stricter privacy codes?</p><p>LEE: So, I think Europe is actually a good model in terms of where the U.S. could look in terms of, this is what Europe does in terms of how they restrict data, how they protect people`s privacy. The U.S. typically sort of gives much more leeway, probably because these are U.S. companies we`re talking about. They want to make sure they have certain advantages or maintain a certain advantage.</p><p>I think if they really, really go full bore, they`ll want to restrict how Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) actually uses its data, in other words, how they sell the data to advertisers which is -- I mean, advertisers -- advertising is the life blood of Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Snap, these other social media companies. So, that`s the hardest they could hit them. Chances are, it might be more of like a warning label type thing, you know? When people sort of sign up for things, there might be a label that comes up, says your data could be used without you knowing it, kind of a disclaimer. That would be sort of at the other end.</p><p>GRIFFETH: And if the fears are valid, that if there are regulatory restraints put on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), the rest of the industry should be worried about that at the same time. Do you think Twitter`s not far behind or other social media platforms or other technology companies?</p><p>LEE: I think if Congress does craft some kind of regulatory framework for how this is used, it`s not going to be just Facebook (NASDAQ:FB)-specific. I think partly to be fair but also to make it level playing field. So, yes, if it affects Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), it`s going to affect Twitter, it`s going to affect Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), it`s going to affect Snapchat, basically all online advertising.</p><p>And I think that`s the framework. Those are the stakes. They`re really, really high. In order for it to be fair, it wouldn`t have to single out one specific player. It should be across the board.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Ed Lee with Recode, always good to see you. Thanks, Ed.</p><p>LEE: Sure.</p><p>HERERA: To Asia now, and specifically, China, which has a new central banker. Economists say the choice signals Beijing`s focus on economic reforms and the need to get its debt under control.</p><p>Eunice Yoon has the details from Beijing.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>UENICE YOON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: China has a new central bank chief. His name is Yi Gang. And he is no stranger to the United States.</p><p>He studied in Minnesota. He got his PhD at the University of Illinois and tenure at Indiana University.</p><p>Now, up until now, he was a deputy governor at the People`s Bank of China and a protege of the outgoing governor. The outgoing governor is known as a pro-markets voice among Chinese policymakers and favors faster liberalization.</p><p>Now, for foreign investors, there are two things that people want to know. First, is Yi Gang going to be an advocate for opening up the financial market?</p><p>In his first comments of governor, Yi said a new slew of reform and opening policies would be announced from now until early April, though he didn`t mention anything specific.</p><p>Now, the second question for investors is what is Yi going to do with all of the debt? Debt here has been rising, and the outgoing governor has expressed his concern about it. Yi didn`t say anything about that today.</p><p>Now, it`s unclear how much influence Yi will have over policymaking. Here in China, unlike the Federal Reserve or the ECB, the PBOC doesn`t have full independence from the government or the communist party, and the man who appears to be calling the shots on the economy is President Xi Jinping`s close ally, Liu He. Liu is now vice premier and presents himself as a market reformer, though so far under his guidance, we haven`t seen much financial liberalization.</p><p>Xi`s team on the economy has been focused in recent months on reining in credit and clamping down on shadow banking, but the question is, is as the economy continues to slow down, will this team decide that they`re going to stay the course, or will they reverse policy and start to pump up credit in order to keep up the growth?</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Eunice Yoon in Beijing.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH: Time to take a look at some of today`s upgrades and downgrades now.</p><p>Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) is reaffirming its sell rating on Tesla. The analyst there expects model 3 deliveries to come in below expectations. The firm, though, is maintaining its 205 6-month price target on that stock, the stock fell, though, 2 percent to $315.56.</p><p>Meanwhile, coverage of Fitbit started with a buy rating at Craig-Hallum. They call the stock price compelling, saying all of the pieces are in place now for a successful change to Fitbit`s strategy. Price target $10. Shares rose 2 percent today to $5.37.</p><p>HERERA: Grubhub saw its rating cut to hold from buy over at Stifel. The analyst there is concerned about the stock`s valuation, which has risen about 50 percent so far this year. The price target is $110. That`s just above where it closed today, which was $108.82.</p><p>Dr. Pepper/Snapple`s rating was raised to outperform from sector perform at RBC capital markets. The analyst there noted potential improvements to its coffee business following its merger agreement with Keurig. The price target is $135, and the stock rose fractionally today to $118.36.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Still ahead, why some Americans still shun the stock market, even after one of the strongest bull runs we`ve seen in history.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GRIFFETH: President Trump was in New Hampshire today, where he outlined steps to combat the opioid crisis. In fact, he said he is considering suing some drug makers for the role they`ve played in fueling the epidemic.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Now our Department of Justice is looking very seriously into bringing major litigation against some of these drug companies. We`ll bring it at a federal level. Some states are already bringing it, but we`re thinking about bringing it at a very high federal level.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GRIFFETH: In fact, those comments sent shares of three opioid producers lower, namely Mallinckrodt, Endo and Depomed.</p><p>HERERA: The national debt has topped $21 trillion for the first time ever. That milestone comes shortly after the suspension of the federal debt limit last month. That allows the government to borrow an unlimited amount of money. Economists expect wider budget deficits over the near term due to the tax cuts that were signed into law late last year.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Congress has only a few days now to finish up the details on a spending bill that was broadly agreed to just three weeks ago, and it if they don`t come to an agreement, the government faces yet another shutdown.</p><p>Ylan Mui is covering that story for us from Capitol Hill.</p><p>So, what are the sticking points at this point, Ylan?</p><p>YLAN MUI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Bill, Republicans had been meeting to discuss the final details of this $1.3 trillion spending package just this evening.</p><p>As you mentioned, they`ve already agreed to the top-line spending numbers, but there are side agreements that usually get attached to these types of bills that they are still hashing out. One of them is stabilizing health insurance marketplaces. That is one that we`re hearing is being negotiated up until the last minute. Also, funding for a border wall and a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants who are brought to the U.S. as children. The last we heard is that that will not be in the omnibus spending bill, as it`s called. But again, those final details still to be released.</p><p>Also still up for debate is funding for the gateway project that includes a tunnel between New York and New Jersey. That`s been a priority for Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer, but it`s something that the White House has been adamantly against. So, lawmakers really see this as their last chance to get a piece of the pie in what could be the final must-pass legislation for Congress this year.</p><p>HERERA: If that wasn`t enough, what else is on the congressional agenda?</p><p>MUI: Well, once they get through this spending bill, it should clear the decks for the next two years. You`re expected to see Congress really focus on those midterm elections, but what also could be coming up is tax reform phase two. We spoke to the head of the House Freedom Caucus, Representative Mark Meadows, who said he believes we could see a rollout as soon as April 15th, so mark your calendars, guys.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Wow. Tax legislation that close to an election, that should be interesting.</p><p>Ylan Mui in Washington, thank you.</p><p>HERERA: Oracle`s revenue comes up short, and that`s where we begin tonight`s \"Market Focus.\"</p><p>After the bell, the cloud computing company topped profit expectations but saw its sales slightly miss targets. The company`s software licensing revenue rose, but that, too, wasn`t good enough for the street. The shares initially fell in the extended session. They ended the regular day down a fraction to $51.95.</p><p>Shares of the smartphone technology-maker Universal (NYSE:UVV) Display were pressured following a report that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is investing in next- generation technology to make its own phone screens. Bloomberg says Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has secretly been working on developing micro LED screens, a feature that could make devices slimmer, but also improve battery life. A finished product is said to be a few years away, but shares of universal display fell 12 percent today to $109 even.</p><p>Newell Brands will give billionaire Carl Icahn`s five board seats in exchange for support in fending off activist hedge fund Starboard Value, which has been pushing for a management shake up at the consumer products company. Last week, Icahn revealed a nearly 7 percent stake in the maker of Sharpies. As part of its deal with Icahn, Newell will consider selling some of its noncore assets. Shares of Newell Brands were off 6 percent to $26.79.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Biotech firm Herron Therapeutics says its experimental anesthetic (INAUDIBLE) undergoing specific surgeries significantly decreased pain when compared to existing treatments. The company also said that patients who were given new anesthetic needed fewer opioids in the hours following the procedure. That`s certainly good news. Shares jumped nearly 27 percent on that news to $27.30.</p><p>And ship equipment-maker KLA-Tencor (NASDAQ:KLAC) is buying technology company Orbotech (NASDAQ:ORBK) for about $3.5 billion. KLA said that the deal will grow its customer base and create new revenue generating opportunities. Separately, KLA launched a $2 billion share buyback program. KLA-Tencor (NASDAQ:KLAC) Shares fell more than 3 percent today to $115.98. Meanwhile, as might be expected, shares of Orbotech (NASDAQ:ORBK) popped by 6 percent to $63.99.</p><p>And McDonald`s (NYSE:MCD) reportedly is going to settle a lawsuit charging the fast-food giant with alleged labor law violations at its franchises. A union group representing McDonald`s (NYSE:MCD) employees had previously claimed that workers were fired after participating in protests seeking a higher minimum wage. Shares of McDonald`s fell 2 percent today to $159.01.</p><p>HERERA: Well, it`s been a decade since the start of the financial crisis that wiped out trillions of dollars worth of assets held by U.S. households. Since the crisis, though, a bull market has emerged and stocks have enjoyed quite significant gains. But despite the run-up in stocks, a \"Reuters\" report says many Americans are staying on the sidelines, investing about $900 billion less than they did in 2007.</p><p>Joining us to talk about that is Stephen Wood. He`s the chief market strategist at Russell Investments.</p><p>It`s always good to have you here, Stephen. Welcome.</p><p>STEPHEN WOOD, RUSSELL INVESTMENT`S CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST: Thank you.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Welcome back.</p><p>HERERA: So, what do you think is behind this? First of all, what do you think about that report and the statistics, and why do you think it is?</p><p>WOOD: Well, I think there are certain generational impacts. If we look at our grandparents, how the Depression affected them -- our parents, how they react to inflation given their experience in the `60s and `70s. That financial crisis was a serious blow to a lot of investors. So, I think there`s some aspect of that even a decade later, and it could be generational.</p><p>I think there is also an aspect where the average retail investor typically looks to buy at the top and sell at the bottom. And that`s something we work hard with our strategies to minimize, but that is, unfortunately, a common characteristic of investment patterns.</p><p>GRIFFETH: There are probably plenty of people who feel like they missed the boat this time around, so they`re going to wait for a significant pullback to get into the market, right?</p><p>WOOD: Well, that would be people that are paying attention to the market specifically. That may not be everyone.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Well, let me ask this, where are they putting the money, if they`re not putting in the stock market right now?</p><p>WOOD: I think, right now, you`re seeing cash build-ups and I think a lot of people are probably just sitting on the sidelines. As you mentioned, they`re waiting for maybe a higher rally in the market to confirm.</p><p>So, there`s a lot of behavioral finance, the psychology of investment that`s really impactful, and I think that`s why you need a very good, global, disciplined strategy to minimize some of those behavioral biases.</p><p>HERERA: Perfect segue into where to put your money to work and you do like a global strategy. You like Europe, Japan, emerging markets?</p><p>WOOD: We do. As I`m sharing with you earlier, I`ve been in Portugal, Spain, just got back from Japan. So, the time zone I`m in, I don`t know. But --</p><p>HERERA: You`re not sure.</p><p>WOOD: I`m not sure, I`m not sure. But assuming we`re in New York right now, the message is similar in Japan, it`s similar in Europe, and it`s similar here, that if you look at the cycle right now in the U.S., the economy looks okay. Earnings are going to look good, but it`s a very expensive market.</p><p>So, for an American or a dollar-based investor, this is a pretty good time to start thinking about rebalancing globally, just being disciplined, blocking and tackling, looking at Europe, which is cheaper. They`ve got an earlier economic cycle. And whereas our central bank is raising rates, they`re still accommodative, similar to Japan.</p><p>So, ten years ago, the U.S. was lagging. Right now, the U.S. is leading. So, rebalance globally and be disciplined, which, again, it minimizes some of those behavioral mistakes.</p><p>GRIFFETH: But we`ll see if the millennials who were damaged by the financial crisis of ten years ago decide they want to get into the market, right?</p><p>WOOD: Well, the benefit for them is they`re young and they`re going to live a lot longer than we will. So they`ve got time.</p><p>GRIFFETH: We can only hope.</p><p>Stephen Wood of Russell Investments, always good to see you. Thanks.</p><p>WOOD: Thank you, sir.</p><p>HERERA: Coming up, retail`s extreme makeover.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>COURTNEY REAGAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: I`m Courtney Reagan in Las Vegas, Nevada, at one of retail`s biggest conferences of the year where established brands, tech companies and start-ups are all coming together to figure out what the future of retail will look like. I`ve got the story coming up on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GRIFFETH: Here`s what to watch on Tuesday.</p><p>Jerome Powell will chair his first monetary policy committee meeting. The two-day meeting begins tomorrow, concludes with that press conference on Wednesday.</p><p>FedEx (NYSE:FDX) reports earnings that include results from its peak holiday season. That should be interesting. And the Saudi crown prince will be visiting the White House to discuss economic priorities between our two countries. And that is what to watch on a very busy Tuesday tomorrow.</p><p>HERERA: Indeed.</p><p>Uber has temporarily suspended its self-driving car tests in all locations after a deadly accident in Arizona. A woman was reportedly hit and killed by a vehicle in self-driving mode as she crossed the street. That incident appears to be the first time that someone has been killed by an autonomous vehicle. Uber says it`s cooperating with the investigation.</p><p>GRIFFETH: The nation`s largest retailers are asking the White House not to levy new tariffs on China. A letter signed today by 40 different retailers, including Walmart, Target (NYSE:TGT), and Costco (NASDAQ:COST), argued that tariffs would lead to higher prices, which, in turn, would hurt working families who shop in their stores. There are reports, you may have heard, that the White House is considering tariffs on at least $30 billion worth of imports from China, beyond steel and aluminum.</p><p>HERERA: Teen jewelry chain Claire`s is filing for bankruptcy. The retailer, which says it has pierced more than 100 million ears worldwide -- never heard of that statistic, but that`s what they say -- is struggling with a heavy debt burden. Now, the company operates in 99 percent of America`s malls and was purchased by the private equity firm Apollo Global Management for more than $3 billion back in 2007.</p><p>GRIFFETH: That`s over 40 years, by the way.</p><p>HERERA: Yes.</p><p>GRIFFETH: As the retail industry does change, many companies are looking to technology to give them an edge.</p><p>Courtney Reagan reports now from a major retail conference in Las Vegas.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>COURTNEY REAGAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Here at shop talk, everybody is talking about the future of retail in which companies will lead the way. There seems to be no doubt that technology will play a critical role. Start-ups are announcing deals with established retailers and tech companies are pitching ideas to make shopping better in store and online. Walmart and Handy are going to offer shoppers TV installation and furniture assembly services in 2,000 stores.</p><p>By the end of the year, shoppers in Macy`s (NYSE:M) stores can scan and check out on their phones. CEO Jeff Gennette says mobile checkout saves time than going to a cashier, even though store employees still have to remove security tags and verify the purchase. Macy`s is partnering with a tech company Marxent to roll out a virtual reality program so shoppers can lay out Macy`s (NYSE:M) furniture in their living room to see how it will look before they buy.</p><p>JEFF GENNETTE, MACY`S CHAIRMAN AND CEO: It`s increasing what they buy on that purchase and it`s decreasing the amount they return, because they`ve already kind of tested it. They`ve already kind of felt that the shape and size will work in their home environment. You don`t have to have a physical sample in the store, and that`s why the furniture space can be half of what they are to do the same level of volume.</p><p>REAGAN: But infusing stores with technology will only be a winning strategy if it brings shoppers in. Mall operator Westfield co-CEO Steve Lowy thinks physical retailers are massively behind when it comes to understanding their consumers. As chairman of One Market, it`s a retail technology start-up. He`s working to change that.</p><p>STEVE LOWLY, WESTFIELD CORP. CO-CEO: The retailing industry really needs to focus on servicing its consumer much better than it is. It`s currently really boxing with a hand behind its back right now, because they`re really only working with their own data. We don`t really have the ability to share data across the network so they can better understand their consumer. They have no idea what the consumer is doing before they actually make a purchase.</p><p>REAGAN: No one is sure what the future of retail will look like, but there`s a ground swell of innovative companies here determined to figure it out.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Courtney Reagan in Las Vegas, Nevada.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: Little Caesars made a March Madness bet and now it owes everyone a free lunch. The pizza chain said that if a bottom-seeded team beat a number one seed on Friday night, everyone in the country would get a free meal. Now, that seemed like a pretty safe bet, but that`s not how it turned out when number 16 University of Maryland Baltimore County defeated number 1 University of Virginia. So, your free lunch is April 2nd.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Meantime, \"Black Panther\" has marked yet another box office milestone. The movie topped the domestic box office for the fifth straight week, making it only the third film in the past 20 years to do that. The Disney (NYSE:DIS) film took in another $27 million over the weekend in ticket sales, pushing its domestic gross to more than $605 million.</p><p>HERERA: And here`s another look at the sell-off on Wall Street today. The Dow is down 335 points, Nasdaq off 137, S&amp;P 500 fell 39.</p><p>And that`s it for NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT tonight. I`m Sue Herera. Thanks for joining us.</p><p>GRIFFETH: I`m Bill Griffeth. Have a great Monday evening, everybody. See you tomorrow.</p><p>Nightly Business Report transcripts and video are available on-line post broadcast at <url normalizedValue=\"http://nbr.com\">http://nbr.com</url>.

The  stock has its worst day in four years after another privacy misstep.  It  led tech lower, and it pulled the rest of the market down with it.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> BILL GRIFFETH, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR:  Here we go again.  The  government could be shut down in just days as lawmakers try to work through  a number of thorny issues before Friday's deadline.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> HERERA:  Falling out of love.  Ten years after the crash, a new report says  fewer people are embracing stocks.  </p><p> Those stories and more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Monday, March  19th.  </p><p> GRIFFETH:  And we bid you good evening, everybody.  Welcome.  </p><p> It was a rough start to the week on Wall Street today.  All of the major  indexes fell more than 1 percent with the Nasdaq off the most.  It was led  lower by Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), which had its worst day since 2014, as you  heard.  That after the company said that a third-party firm improperly kept  data on millions of its users.  We'll have more on that story in a bit.  </p><p> The sell-off, though, in tech, which has been one of the hottest sectors in  the past year, that led the broader market lower as well today with the Dow  closing down 335 points to 24,610.  The Nasdaq was off by 137.  The S&amp;P  fell by 39.  </p><p> Bob Pisani has more for us tonight from the New York Stock Exchange.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> BOB PISANI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  The big story today was  Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), down 7 percent.  On the surface, it's easy to blame  today's market woes just on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).  It's a big name, big  valuation, a lot of momentum behind it.  </p><p> When it reverses like it did today, it gives a lot of investors,  particularly momentum investors, pause.  But the story's bigger than  Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).  Social media in general has been under assault for  over a year.  Many now realize that services that companies like Facebook  (NASDAQ:FB) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) or Snap claim they provide to them for  free, in fact, comes with a heavy cost -- privacy.  And the customers are  now coming to it understand that in many cases, they're not customers,  they're the product.</p><p> But there's bigger problems for the market.  There's a big leadership  vacuum right now.  No group is stepping forward as tech stocks have  dropped.  Stocks started the year strong on the strength of leadership  among the biggest sectors like technology and financials, consumer  discretionary.  </p><p> But tech is now rolling over amid an assault of social media and nothing's  stepping forward.  Energy stocks never recovered from the drops in early  February.  Materials and steel stocks have been dropping after rallying  briefing.  Industrials are faltering on these trade war issues.  And banks  were the last leadership group to go.  They too have trending down in the  last few days.  </p><p> So, there is considerable nervousness around the Fed meeting with talk of a  fourth rate hike.  Trade wars are weighing on stocks and the White House  drama is also a distraction.  The issue, what's left to power the markets  forward?  </p><p> For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Bob Pisani at the New York Stock Exchange.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> HERERA:  More now on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), which shed more than $35 billion  in market value today.  </p><p> And as Bob just mentioned, the stock dropped about 7 percent in a very  rough day of trading.  </p><p> Julia Boorstin explains what exactly happened at the company and why  investors fled the stock.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> JULIA BOORSTIN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Facebook  (NASDAQ:FB) under fire.  Lawmakers in the U.S. and U.K. calling for CEO  Mark Zuckerberg to testify, and the E.U. announcing an investigation into  violations of privacy laws.  </p><p> Here's what happened.  In early 2014, an app developer accessed info from  275,000 users of its app, as well as the data from about 50 million of  their friends.  Until April 2014, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) allowed app  developers to access that data.  The developer illegally sold that data to  Cambridge Analytica, a data firm that worked with the Trump campaign.  </p><p> When Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) found out in 2015, the data firm told Facebook  (NASDAQ:FB) it deleted all of it.  This weekend's reports say the data is  still out there and note that Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) failed to alert  consumers whose data was harvested.  </p><p> MARK MAHANEY, RBC CAPITAL MARKETS:  I think Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) got  blindsided, and they weren't quick enough to acknowledge that their data  was hacked and their data was misused.  I think they need to be more up  front about that, but there's no question, these are very difficult I.T.  challenges for Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).  </p><p> BOORSTIN:  Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) says it's investigating the accuracy of the  claims and just hired an outside firm to do a comprehensive audit.  And  Cambridge Analytica denies wrongdoing, saying it cooperated fully with  Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) to delete the data, after discovering that the app  developer it was working with had broken the rules.  </p><p> Facebook's business is built on its more than 2 billion monthly active  users having confidence in the platform.  And consumer reaction is mixed.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I figure everyone has my data.  Like, it's all out  there, so I'm not so concerned.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I believe these executives should be held accountable.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I still trust that Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and other  companies are trying their best to do it the right way.  </p><p> BOORSTIN:  Users' trust is key to provide valuable data to advertisers to  target them.  </p><p> BOB PECK, CREDIT SUISSE:  They know at the end of the day, having the trust  of their consumer is paramount, it's key, and if they don't earn that trust  every single day, you will see users go off the platform.  So, I think look  for them to try to self-regulate as much as possible as they go forward  here.  </p><p> BOORSTIN:  Now, analysts are raising concerns about potential advertiser  backlash.  Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) warning that this creates a serious  public relations black eye and could lead to additional regulatory  scrutiny.  </p><p> For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Julia Boorstin in Los Angeles.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> GRIFFETH:  So, could the allegations facing Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) cause a  wave of regulation to crash in on big tech?  And if so, what would that  mean for the whole technology sector?  </p><p> Joining us tonight to talk about it is Ed Lee, managing editor at Recode.  </p><p> Ed, already tonight, we've heard that the Connecticut attorney general is  talking about a new investigation there into these allegations.  So, the  drumbeat is already starting to sound.  What should Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) do  in terms of self-regulation, in your view?  </p><p> ED LEE, RECODE MANAGING EDITOR:  So, it's a great question.  I think that  sort of hits it on the head in terms of Facebook's dilemma right now.   There's a lot of political will getting into this in terms of, you know,  should Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) be regulated. </p><p> It's going to be a test of Mark Zuckerberg's leadership, the CEO.  They  haven't taken definitive action as of yet, right?  They're basically saying  we still need to investigate this, make sure that the reported claims are  actually true, that this data is still on these third-party servers.  </p><p> But even after that, there needs to be a more systemic fix in place in  order to prove to Congress and to the American public that, you know what,  we're going to keep people's data safe.  Right now, they're just taking  these small, incremental steps.  </p><p> HERERA:  But as Bill mentioned, the risk of regulation is higher now than  it probably has ever been before for this company.  If, indeed, regulation  is imposed, what do you think that would look like?  Would it be more like  European standards, which are stricter privacy codes?  </p><p> LEE:  So, I think Europe is actually a good model in terms of where the  U.S. could look in terms of, this is what Europe does in terms of how they  restrict data, how they protect people's privacy.  The U.S. typically sort  of gives much more leeway, probably because these are U.S. companies we're  talking about.  They want to make sure they have certain advantages or  maintain a certain advantage.  </p><p> I think if they really, really go full bore, they'll want to restrict how  Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) actually uses its data, in other words, how they sell  the data to advertisers which is -- I mean, advertisers -- advertising is  the life blood of Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Snap,  these other social media companies.  So, that's the hardest they could hit  them.  Chances are, it might be more of like a warning label type thing,  you know?  When people sort of sign up for things, there might be a label  that comes up, says your data could be used without you knowing it, kind of  a disclaimer.  That would be sort of at the other end.  </p><p> GRIFFETH:  And if the fears are valid, that if there are regulatory  restraints put on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), the rest of the industry should be  worried about that at the same time.  Do you think Twitter's not far behind  or other social media platforms or other technology companies?  </p><p> LEE:  I think if Congress does craft some kind of regulatory framework for  how this is used, it's not going to be just Facebook (NASDAQ:FB)-specific.   I think partly to be fair but also to make it level playing field.  So,  yes, if it affects Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), it's going to affect Twitter, it's  going to affect Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), it's going to affect Snapchat,  basically all online advertising.  </p><p> And I think that's the framework.  Those are the stakes.  They're really,  really high.  In order for it to be fair, it wouldn't have to single out  one specific player.  It should be across the board.  </p><p> GRIFFETH:  Ed Lee with Recode, always good to see you.  Thanks, Ed.  </p><p> LEE:  Sure.  </p><p> HERERA:  To Asia now, and specifically, China, which has a new central  banker.  Economists say the choice signals Beijing's focus on economic  reforms and the need to get its debt under control.  </p><p> Eunice Yoon has the details from Beijing.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> UENICE YOON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  China has a new  central bank chief.  His name is Yi Gang.  And he is no stranger to the  United States.  </p><p> He studied in Minnesota.  He got his PhD at the University of Illinois and  tenure at Indiana University.  </p><p> Now, up until now, he was a deputy governor at the People's Bank of China  and a protege of the outgoing governor.  The outgoing governor is known as  a pro-markets voice among Chinese policymakers and favors faster  liberalization.  </p><p> Now, for foreign investors, there are two things that people want to know.   First, is Yi Gang going to be an advocate for opening up the financial  market?  </p><p> In his first comments of governor, Yi said a new slew of reform and opening  policies would be announced from now until early April, though he didn't  mention anything specific.  </p><p> Now, the second question for investors is what is Yi going to do with all  of the debt?  Debt here has been rising, and the outgoing governor has  expressed his concern about it.  Yi didn't say anything about that today.  </p><p> Now, it's unclear how much influence Yi will have over policymaking.  Here  in China, unlike the Federal Reserve or the ECB, the PBOC doesn't have full  independence from the government or the communist party, and the man who  appears to be calling the shots on the economy is President Xi Jinping's  close ally, Liu He.  Liu is now vice premier and presents himself as a  market reformer, though so far under his guidance, we haven't seen much  financial liberalization.  </p><p> Xi's team on the economy has been focused in recent months on reining in  credit and clamping down on shadow banking, but the question is, is as the  economy continues to slow down, will this team decide that they're going to  stay the course, or will they reverse policy and start to pump up credit in  order to keep up the growth?  </p><p> For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Eunice Yoon in Beijing.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> GRIFFETH:  Time to take a look at some of today's upgrades and downgrades  now.  </p><p> Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) is reaffirming its sell rating on Tesla.  The  analyst there expects model 3 deliveries to come in below expectations.   The firm, though, is maintaining its 205 6-month price target on that  stock, the stock fell, though, 2 percent to $315.56.  </p><p> Meanwhile, coverage of Fitbit started with a buy rating at Craig-Hallum.   They call the stock price compelling, saying all of the pieces are in place  now for a successful change to Fitbit's strategy.  Price target $10.   Shares rose 2 percent today to $5.37.  </p><p> HERERA:  Grubhub saw its rating cut to hold from buy over at Stifel.  The  analyst there is concerned about the stock's valuation, which has risen  about 50 percent so far this year.  The price target is $110.  That's just  above where it closed today, which was $108.82.  </p><p> Dr. Pepper/Snapple's rating was raised to outperform from sector perform at  RBC capital markets.  The analyst there noted potential improvements to its  coffee business following its merger agreement with Keurig.  The price  target is $135, and the stock rose fractionally today to $118.36.  </p><p> GRIFFETH:  Still ahead, why some Americans still shun the stock market,  even after one of the strongest bull runs we've seen in history.</p><p> (MUSIC)</p><p> GRIFFETH:  President Trump was in New Hampshire today, where he outlined  steps to combat the opioid crisis.  In fact, he said he is considering  suing some drug makers for the role they've played in fueling the epidemic.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Now our Department of  Justice is looking very seriously into bringing major litigation against  some of these drug companies.  We'll bring it at a federal level.  Some  states are already bringing it, but we're thinking about bringing it at a  very high federal level.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> GRIFFETH:  In fact, those comments sent shares of three opioid producers  lower, namely Mallinckrodt, Endo and Depomed.  </p><p> HERERA:  The national debt has topped $21 trillion for the first time ever.   That milestone comes shortly after the suspension of the federal debt limit  last month.  That allows the government to borrow an unlimited amount of  money.  Economists expect wider budget deficits over the near term due to  the tax cuts that were signed into law late last year.  </p><p> GRIFFETH:  Congress has only a few days now to finish up the details on a  spending bill that was broadly agreed to just three weeks ago, and it if  they don't come to an agreement, the government faces yet another shutdown.  </p><p> Ylan Mui is covering that story for us from Capitol Hill.  </p><p> So, what are the sticking points at this point, Ylan?  </p><p> YLAN MUI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Bill, Republicans had  been meeting to discuss the final details of this $1.3 trillion spending  package just this evening.  </p><p> As you mentioned, they've already agreed to the top-line spending numbers,  but there are side agreements that usually get attached to these types of  bills that they are still hashing out.  One of them is stabilizing health  insurance marketplaces.  That is one that we're hearing is being negotiated  up until the last minute.  Also, funding for a border wall and a pathway to  citizenship for undocumented immigrants who are brought to the U.S. as  children.  The last we heard is that that will not be in the omnibus  spending bill, as it's called.  But again, those final details still to be  released.  </p><p> Also still up for debate is funding for the gateway project that includes a  tunnel between New York and New Jersey.  That's been a priority for Senate  Democratic leader Chuck Schumer, but it's something that the White House  has been adamantly against.  So, lawmakers really see this as their last  chance to get a piece of the pie in what could be the final must-pass  legislation for Congress this year.  </p><p> HERERA:  If that wasn't enough, what else is on the congressional agenda?  </p><p> MUI:  Well, once they get through this spending bill, it should clear the  decks for the next two years.  You're expected to see Congress really focus  on those midterm elections, but what also could be coming up is tax reform  phase two.  We spoke to the head of the House Freedom Caucus,  Representative Mark Meadows, who said he believes we could see a rollout as  soon as April 15th, so mark your calendars, guys.  </p><p> GRIFFETH:  Wow.  Tax legislation that close to an election, that should be  interesting.  </p><p> Ylan Mui in Washington, thank you.  </p><p> HERERA:  Oracle's revenue comes up short, and that's where we begin  tonight's \"Market Focus.\" </p><p> After the bell, the cloud computing company topped profit expectations but  saw its sales slightly miss targets.  The company's software licensing  revenue rose, but that, too, wasn't good enough for the street.  The shares  initially fell in the extended session.  They ended the regular day down a  fraction to $51.95.  </p><p> Shares of the smartphone technology-maker Universal (NYSE:UVV) Display were  pressured following a report that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is investing in next- generation technology to make its own phone screens.  Bloomberg says Apple  (NASDAQ:AAPL) has secretly been working on developing micro LED screens, a  feature that could make devices slimmer, but also improve battery life.  A  finished product is said to be a few years away, but shares of universal  display fell 12 percent today to $109 even.  </p><p> Newell Brands will give billionaire Carl Icahn's five board seats in  exchange for support in fending off activist hedge fund Starboard Value,  which has been pushing for a management shake up at the consumer products  company.  Last week, Icahn revealed a nearly 7 percent stake in the maker  of Sharpies.  As part of its deal with Icahn, Newell will consider selling  some of its noncore assets.  Shares of Newell Brands were off 6 percent to  $26.79.  </p><p> GRIFFETH:  Biotech firm Herron Therapeutics says its experimental  anesthetic (INAUDIBLE) undergoing specific surgeries significantly  decreased pain when compared to existing treatments.  The company also said  that patients who were given new anesthetic needed fewer opioids in the  hours following the procedure.  That's certainly good news.  Shares jumped  nearly 27 percent on that news to $27.30.</p><p> And ship equipment-maker KLA-Tencor (NASDAQ:KLAC) is buying technology  company Orbotech (NASDAQ:ORBK) for about $3.5 billion.  KLA said that the  deal will grow its customer base and create new revenue generating  opportunities.  Separately, KLA launched a $2 billion share buyback  program.  KLA-Tencor (NASDAQ:KLAC) Shares fell more than 3 percent today to  $115.98.  Meanwhile, as might be expected, shares of Orbotech (NASDAQ:ORBK)  popped by 6 percent to $63.99.  </p><p> And McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) reportedly is going to settle a lawsuit charging  the fast-food giant with alleged labor law violations at its franchises.  A  union group representing McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) employees had previously  claimed that workers were fired after participating in protests seeking a  higher minimum wage.  Shares of McDonald's fell 2 percent today to $159.01.  </p><p> HERERA:  Well, it's been a decade since the start of the financial crisis  that wiped out trillions of dollars worth of assets held by U.S.  households.  Since the crisis, though, a bull market has emerged and stocks  have enjoyed quite significant gains.  But despite the run-up in stocks, a  \"Reuters\" report says many Americans are staying on the sidelines,  investing about $900 billion less than they did in 2007.  </p><p> Joining us to talk about that is Stephen Wood.  He's the chief market  strategist at Russell Investments.  </p><p> It's always good to have you here, Stephen.  Welcome.  </p><p> STEPHEN WOOD, RUSSELL INVESTMENT'S CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST:  Thank you.  </p><p> GRIFFETH:  Welcome back.  </p><p> HERERA:  So, what do you think is behind this?  First of all, what do you  think about that report and the statistics, and why do you think it is?  </p><p> WOOD:  Well, I think there are certain generational impacts.  If we look at  our grandparents, how the Depression affected them -- our parents, how they  react to inflation given their experience in the '60s and '70s.  That  financial crisis was a serious blow to a lot of investors.  So, I think  there's some aspect of that even a decade later, and it could be  generational.  </p><p> I think there is also an aspect where the average retail investor typically  looks to buy at the top and sell at the bottom.  And that's something we  work hard with our strategies to minimize, but that is, unfortunately, a  common characteristic of investment patterns.  </p><p> GRIFFETH:  There are probably plenty of people who feel like they missed  the boat this time around, so they're going to wait for a significant  pullback to get into the market, right?  </p><p> WOOD:  Well, that would be people that are paying attention to the market  specifically.  That may not be everyone.  </p><p> GRIFFETH:  Well, let me ask this, where are they putting the money, if  they're not putting in the stock market right now?  </p><p> WOOD:  I think, right now, you're seeing cash build-ups and I think a lot  of people are probably just sitting on the sidelines.  As you mentioned,  they're waiting for maybe a higher rally in the market to confirm.  </p><p> So, there's a lot of behavioral finance, the psychology of investment  that's really impactful, and I think that's why you need a very good,  global, disciplined strategy to minimize some of those behavioral biases.  </p><p> HERERA:  Perfect segue into where to put your money to work and you do like  a global strategy.  You like Europe, Japan, emerging markets?  </p><p> WOOD:  We do.  As I'm sharing with you earlier, I've been in Portugal,  Spain, just got back from Japan.  So, the time zone I'm in, I don't know.   But -- </p><p> HERERA:  You're not sure.  </p><p> WOOD:  I'm not sure, I'm not sure.  But assuming we're in New York right  now, the message is similar in Japan, it's similar in Europe, and it's  similar here, that if you look at the cycle right now in the U.S., the  economy looks okay.  Earnings are going to look good, but it's a very  expensive market.  </p><p> So, for an American or a dollar-based investor, this is a pretty good time  to start thinking about rebalancing globally, just being disciplined,  blocking and tackling, looking at Europe, which is cheaper.  They've got an  earlier economic cycle.  And whereas our central bank is raising rates,  they're still accommodative, similar to Japan.  </p><p> So, ten years ago, the U.S. was lagging.  Right now, the U.S. is leading.   So, rebalance globally and be disciplined, which, again, it minimizes some  of those behavioral mistakes.  </p><p> GRIFFETH:  But we'll see if the millennials who were damaged by the  financial crisis of ten years ago decide they want to get into the market,  right?  </p><p> WOOD:  Well, the benefit for them is they're young and they're going to  live a lot longer than we will.  So they've got time.  </p><p> GRIFFETH:  We can only hope.  </p><p> Stephen Wood of Russell Investments, always good to see you.  Thanks.</p><p> WOOD:  Thank you, sir.  </p><p> HERERA:  Coming up, retail's extreme makeover.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> COURTNEY REAGAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  I'm Courtney  Reagan in Las Vegas, Nevada, at one of retail's biggest conferences of the  year where established brands, tech companies and start-ups are all coming  together to figure out what the future of retail will look like.  I've got  the story coming up on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> (MUSIC)</p><p> GRIFFETH:  Here's what to watch on Tuesday.  </p><p> Jerome Powell will chair his first monetary policy committee meeting.  The  two-day meeting begins tomorrow, concludes with that press conference on  Wednesday.  </p><p> FedEx (NYSE:FDX) reports earnings that include results from its peak  holiday season.  That should be interesting.  And the Saudi crown prince  will be visiting the White House to discuss economic priorities between our  two countries.  And that is what to watch on a very busy Tuesday tomorrow.  </p><p> HERERA:  Indeed.  </p><p> Uber has temporarily suspended its self-driving car tests in all locations  after a deadly accident in Arizona.  A woman was reportedly hit and killed  by a vehicle in self-driving mode as she crossed the street.  That incident  appears to be the first time that someone has been killed by an autonomous  vehicle.  Uber says it's cooperating with the investigation.  </p><p> GRIFFETH:  The nation's largest retailers are asking the White House not to  levy new tariffs on China.  A letter signed today by 40 different  retailers, including Walmart, Target (NYSE:TGT), and Costco (NASDAQ:COST),  argued that tariffs would lead to higher prices, which, in turn, would hurt  working families who shop in their stores.  There are reports, you may have  heard, that the White House is considering tariffs on at least $30 billion  worth of imports from China, beyond steel and aluminum.  </p><p> HERERA:  Teen jewelry chain Claire's is filing for bankruptcy.  The  retailer, which says it has pierced more than 100 million ears worldwide --  never heard of that statistic, but that's what they say -- is struggling  with a heavy debt burden.  Now, the company operates in 99 percent of  America's malls and was purchased by the private equity firm Apollo Global  Management for more than $3 billion back in 2007.  </p><p> GRIFFETH:  That's over 40 years, by the way.  </p><p> HERERA:  Yes.  </p><p> GRIFFETH:  As the retail industry does change, many companies are looking  to technology to give them an edge.  </p><p> Courtney Reagan reports now from a major retail conference in Las Vegas.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> COURTNEY REAGAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Here at shop talk,  everybody is talking about the future of retail in which companies will  lead the way.  There seems to be no doubt that technology will play a  critical role.  Start-ups are announcing deals with established retailers  and tech companies are pitching ideas to make shopping better in store and  online.  Walmart and Handy are going to offer shoppers TV installation and  furniture assembly services in 2,000 stores.  </p><p> By the end of the year, shoppers in Macy's (NYSE:M) stores can scan and  check out on their phones.  CEO Jeff Gennette says mobile checkout saves  time than going to a cashier, even though store employees still have to  remove security tags and verify the purchase.  Macy's is partnering with a  tech company Marxent to roll out a virtual reality program so shoppers can  lay out Macy's (NYSE:M) furniture in their living room to see how it will  look before they buy.  </p><p> JEFF GENNETTE, MACY'S CHAIRMAN AND CEO:  It's increasing what they buy on  that purchase and it's decreasing the amount they return, because they've  already kind of tested it.  They've already kind of felt that the shape and  size will work in their home environment.  You don't have to have a  physical sample in the store, and that's why the furniture space can be  half of what they are to do the same level of volume.  </p><p> REAGAN:  But infusing stores with technology will only be a winning  strategy if it brings shoppers in.  Mall operator Westfield co-CEO Steve  Lowy thinks physical retailers are massively behind when it comes to  understanding their consumers.  As chairman of One Market, it's a retail  technology start-up.  He's working to change that.  </p><p> STEVE LOWLY, WESTFIELD CORP. CO-CEO:  The retailing industry really needs  to focus on servicing its consumer much better than it is.  It's currently  really boxing with a hand behind its back right now, because they're really  only working with their own data.  We don't really have the ability to  share data across the network so they can better understand their consumer.   They have no idea what the consumer is doing before they actually make a  purchase.  </p><p> REAGAN:  No one is sure what the future of retail will look like, but  there's a ground swell of innovative companies here determined to figure it  out. </p><p> For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Courtney Reagan in Las Vegas, Nevada.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> HERERA:  Little Caesars made a March Madness bet and now it owes everyone a  free lunch.  The pizza chain said that if a bottom-seeded team beat a  number one seed on Friday night, everyone in the country would get a free  meal.  Now, that seemed like a pretty safe bet, but that's not how it  turned out when number 16 University of Maryland Baltimore County defeated  number 1 University of Virginia.  So, your free lunch is April 2nd.  </p><p> GRIFFETH:  Meantime, \"Black Panther\" has marked yet another box office  milestone.  The movie topped the domestic box office for the fifth straight  week, making it only the third film in the past 20 years to do that.  The  Disney (NYSE:DIS) film took in another $27 million over the weekend in  ticket sales, pushing its domestic gross to more than $605 million.  </p><p> HERERA:  And here's another look at the sell-off on Wall Street today.  The  Dow is down 335 points, Nasdaq off 137, S&amp;P 500 fell 39.  </p><p> And that's it for NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT tonight.  I'm Sue Herera.  Thanks  for joining us.  </p><p> GRIFFETH:  I'm Bill Griffeth.  Have a great Monday evening, everybody.  See  you tomorrow.</p><p> END</p><p> Nightly Business Report transcripts and video are available on-line post  broadcast at <url normalizedValue=\"http://nbr.com\">http://nbr.com</url>.

The  stock has its worst day in four years after another privacy misstep.  It  led tech lower, and it pulled the rest of the market down with it.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">BILL GRIFFETH, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR:  Here we go again.  The  government could be shut down in just days as lawmakers try to work through  a number of thorny issues before Friday's deadline.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">HERERA:  Falling out of love.  Ten years after the crash, a new report says  fewer people are embracing stocks.  </p><p>Those stories and more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Monday, March  19th.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  And we bid you good evening, everybody.  Welcome.  </p><p>It was a rough start to the week on Wall Street today.  All of the major  indexes fell more than 1 percent with the Nasdaq off the most.  It was led  lower by Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), which had its worst day since 2014, as you  heard.  That after the company said that a third-party firm improperly kept  data on millions of its users.  We'll have more on that story in a bit.  </p><p>The sell-off, though, in tech, which has been one of the hottest sectors in  the past year, that led the broader market lower as well today with the Dow  closing down 335 points to 24,610.  The Nasdaq was off by 137.  The S&amp;P  fell by 39.  </p><p>Bob Pisani has more for us tonight from the New York Stock Exchange.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BOB PISANI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  The big story today was  Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), down 7 percent.  On the surface, it's easy to blame  today's market woes just on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).  It's a big name, big  valuation, a lot of momentum behind it.  </p><p>When it reverses like it did today, it gives a lot of investors,  particularly momentum investors, pause.  But the story's bigger than  Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).  Social media in general has been under assault for  over a year.  Many now realize that services that companies like Facebook  (NASDAQ:FB) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) or Snap claim they provide to them for  free, in fact, comes with a heavy cost -- privacy.  And the customers are  now coming to it understand that in many cases, they're not customers,  they're the product.</p><p>But there's bigger problems for the market.  There's a big leadership  vacuum right now.  No group is stepping forward as tech stocks have  dropped.  Stocks started the year strong on the strength of leadership  among the biggest sectors like technology and financials, consumer  discretionary.  </p><p>But tech is now rolling over amid an assault of social media and nothing's  stepping forward.  Energy stocks never recovered from the drops in early  February.  Materials and steel stocks have been dropping after rallying  briefing.  Industrials are faltering on these trade war issues.  And banks  were the last leadership group to go.  They too have trending down in the  last few days.  </p><p>So, there is considerable nervousness around the Fed meeting with talk of a  fourth rate hike.  Trade wars are weighing on stocks and the White House  drama is also a distraction.  The issue, what's left to power the markets  forward?  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Bob Pisani at the New York Stock Exchange.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  More now on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), which shed more than $35 billion  in market value today.  </p><p>And as Bob just mentioned, the stock dropped about 7 percent in a very  rough day of trading.  </p><p>Julia Boorstin explains what exactly happened at the company and why  investors fled the stock.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JULIA BOORSTIN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Facebook  (NASDAQ:FB) under fire.  Lawmakers in the U.S. and U.K. calling for CEO  Mark Zuckerberg to testify, and the E.U. announcing an investigation into  violations of privacy laws.  </p><p>Here's what happened.  In early 2014, an app developer accessed info from  275,000 users of its app, as well as the data from about 50 million of  their friends.  Until April 2014, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) allowed app  developers to access that data.  The developer illegally sold that data to  Cambridge Analytica, a data firm that worked with the Trump campaign.  </p><p>When Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) found out in 2015, the data firm told Facebook  (NASDAQ:FB) it deleted all of it.  This weekend's reports say the data is  still out there and note that Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) failed to alert  consumers whose data was harvested.  </p><p>MARK MAHANEY, RBC CAPITAL MARKETS:  I think Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) got  blindsided, and they weren't quick enough to acknowledge that their data  was hacked and their data was misused.  I think they need to be more up  front about that, but there's no question, these are very difficult I.T.  challenges for Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).  </p><p>BOORSTIN:  Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) says it's investigating the accuracy of the  claims and just hired an outside firm to do a comprehensive audit.  And  Cambridge Analytica denies wrongdoing, saying it cooperated fully with  Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) to delete the data, after discovering that the app  developer it was working with had broken the rules.  </p><p>Facebook's business is built on its more than 2 billion monthly active  users having confidence in the platform.  And consumer reaction is mixed.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I figure everyone has my data.  Like, it's all out  there, so I'm not so concerned.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I believe these executives should be held accountable.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I still trust that Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and other  companies are trying their best to do it the right way.  </p><p>BOORSTIN:  Users' trust is key to provide valuable data to advertisers to  target them.  </p><p>BOB PECK, CREDIT SUISSE:  They know at the end of the day, having the trust  of their consumer is paramount, it's key, and if they don't earn that trust  every single day, you will see users go off the platform.  So, I think look  for them to try to self-regulate as much as possible as they go forward  here.  </p><p>BOORSTIN:  Now, analysts are raising concerns about potential advertiser  backlash.  Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) warning that this creates a serious  public relations black eye and could lead to additional regulatory  scrutiny.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Julia Boorstin in Los Angeles.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  So, could the allegations facing Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) cause a  wave of regulation to crash in on big tech?  And if so, what would that  mean for the whole technology sector?  </p><p>Joining us tonight to talk about it is Ed Lee, managing editor at Recode.  </p><p>Ed, already tonight, we've heard that the Connecticut attorney general is  talking about a new investigation there into these allegations.  So, the  drumbeat is already starting to sound.  What should Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) do  in terms of self-regulation, in your view?  </p><p>ED LEE, RECODE MANAGING EDITOR:  So, it's a great question.  I think that  sort of hits it on the head in terms of Facebook's dilemma right now.   There's a lot of political will getting into this in terms of, you know,  should Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) be regulated. </p><p>It's going to be a test of Mark Zuckerberg's leadership, the CEO.  They  haven't taken definitive action as of yet, right?  They're basically saying  we still need to investigate this, make sure that the reported claims are  actually true, that this data is still on these third-party servers.  </p><p>But even after that, there needs to be a more systemic fix in place in  order to prove to Congress and to the American public that, you know what,  we're going to keep people's data safe.  Right now, they're just taking  these small, incremental steps.  </p><p>HERERA:  But as Bill mentioned, the risk of regulation is higher now than  it probably has ever been before for this company.  If, indeed, regulation  is imposed, what do you think that would look like?  Would it be more like  European standards, which are stricter privacy codes?  </p><p>LEE:  So, I think Europe is actually a good model in terms of where the  U.S. could look in terms of, this is what Europe does in terms of how they  restrict data, how they protect people's privacy.  The U.S. typically sort  of gives much more leeway, probably because these are U.S. companies we're  talking about.  They want to make sure they have certain advantages or  maintain a certain advantage.  </p><p>I think if they really, really go full bore, they'll want to restrict how  Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) actually uses its data, in other words, how they sell  the data to advertisers which is -- I mean, advertisers -- advertising is  the life blood of Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Snap,  these other social media companies.  So, that's the hardest they could hit  them.  Chances are, it might be more of like a warning label type thing,  you know?  When people sort of sign up for things, there might be a label  that comes up, says your data could be used without you knowing it, kind of  a disclaimer.  That would be sort of at the other end.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  And if the fears are valid, that if there are regulatory  restraints put on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), the rest of the industry should be  worried about that at the same time.  Do you think Twitter's not far behind  or other social media platforms or other technology companies?  </p><p>LEE:  I think if Congress does craft some kind of regulatory framework for  how this is used, it's not going to be just Facebook (NASDAQ:FB)-specific.   I think partly to be fair but also to make it level playing field.  So,  yes, if it affects Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), it's going to affect Twitter, it's  going to affect Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), it's going to affect Snapchat,  basically all online advertising.  </p><p>And I think that's the framework.  Those are the stakes.  They're really,  really high.  In order for it to be fair, it wouldn't have to single out  one specific player.  It should be across the board.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  Ed Lee with Recode, always good to see you.  Thanks, Ed.  </p><p>LEE:  Sure.  </p><p>HERERA:  To Asia now, and specifically, China, which has a new central  banker.  Economists say the choice signals Beijing's focus on economic  reforms and the need to get its debt under control.  </p><p>Eunice Yoon has the details from Beijing.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>UENICE YOON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  China has a new  central bank chief.  His name is Yi Gang.  And he is no stranger to the  United States.  </p><p>He studied in Minnesota.  He got his PhD at the University of Illinois and  tenure at Indiana University.  </p><p>Now, up until now, he was a deputy governor at the People's Bank of China  and a protege of the outgoing governor.  The outgoing governor is known as  a pro-markets voice among Chinese policymakers and favors faster  liberalization.  </p><p>Now, for foreign investors, there are two things that people want to know.   First, is Yi Gang going to be an advocate for opening up the financial  market?  </p><p>In his first comments of governor, Yi said a new slew of reform and opening  policies would be announced from now until early April, though he didn't  mention anything specific.  </p><p>Now, the second question for investors is what is Yi going to do with all  of the debt?  Debt here has been rising, and the outgoing governor has  expressed his concern about it.  Yi didn't say anything about that today.  </p><p>Now, it's unclear how much influence Yi will have over policymaking.  Here  in China, unlike the Federal Reserve or the ECB, the PBOC doesn't have full  independence from the government or the communist party, and the man who  appears to be calling the shots on the economy is President Xi Jinping's  close ally, Liu He.  Liu is now vice premier and presents himself as a  market reformer, though so far under his guidance, we haven't seen much  financial liberalization.  </p><p>Xi's team on the economy has been focused in recent months on reining in  credit and clamping down on shadow banking, but the question is, is as the  economy continues to slow down, will this team decide that they're going to  stay the course, or will they reverse policy and start to pump up credit in  order to keep up the growth?  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Eunice Yoon in Beijing.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Time to take a look at some of today's upgrades and downgrades  now.  </p><p>Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) is reaffirming its sell rating on Tesla.  The  analyst there expects model 3 deliveries to come in below expectations.   The firm, though, is maintaining its 205 6-month price target on that  stock, the stock fell, though, 2 percent to $315.56.  </p><p>Meanwhile, coverage of Fitbit started with a buy rating at Craig-Hallum.   They call the stock price compelling, saying all of the pieces are in place  now for a successful change to Fitbit's strategy.  Price target $10.   Shares rose 2 percent today to $5.37.  </p><p>HERERA:  Grubhub saw its rating cut to hold from buy over at Stifel.  The  analyst there is concerned about the stock's valuation, which has risen  about 50 percent so far this year.  The price target is $110.  That's just  above where it closed today, which was $108.82.  </p><p>Dr. Pepper/Snapple's rating was raised to outperform from sector perform at  RBC capital markets.  The analyst there noted potential improvements to its  coffee business following its merger agreement with Keurig.  The price  target is $135, and the stock rose fractionally today to $118.36.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  Still ahead, why some Americans still shun the stock market,  even after one of the strongest bull runs we've seen in history.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  President Trump was in New Hampshire today, where he outlined  steps to combat the opioid crisis.  In fact, he said he is considering  suing some drug makers for the role they've played in fueling the epidemic.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Now our Department of  Justice is looking very seriously into bringing major litigation against  some of these drug companies.  We'll bring it at a federal level.  Some  states are already bringing it, but we're thinking about bringing it at a  very high federal level.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  In fact, those comments sent shares of three opioid producers  lower, namely Mallinckrodt, Endo and Depomed.  </p><p>HERERA:  The national debt has topped $21 trillion for the first time ever.   That milestone comes shortly after the suspension of the federal debt limit  last month.  That allows the government to borrow an unlimited amount of  money.  Economists expect wider budget deficits over the near term due to  the tax cuts that were signed into law late last year.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  Congress has only a few days now to finish up the details on a  spending bill that was broadly agreed to just three weeks ago, and it if  they don't come to an agreement, the government faces yet another shutdown.  </p><p>Ylan Mui is covering that story for us from Capitol Hill.  </p><p>So, what are the sticking points at this point, Ylan?  </p><p>YLAN MUI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Bill, Republicans had  been meeting to discuss the final details of this $1.3 trillion spending  package just this evening.  </p><p>As you mentioned, they've already agreed to the top-line spending numbers,  but there are side agreements that usually get attached to these types of  bills that they are still hashing out.  One of them is stabilizing health  insurance marketplaces.  That is one that we're hearing is being negotiated  up until the last minute.  Also, funding for a border wall and a pathway to  citizenship for undocumented immigrants who are brought to the U.S. as  children.  The last we heard is that that will not be in the omnibus  spending bill, as it's called.  But again, those final details still to be  released.  </p><p>Also still up for debate is funding for the gateway project that includes a  tunnel between New York and New Jersey.  That's been a priority for Senate  Democratic leader Chuck Schumer, but it's something that the White House  has been adamantly against.  So, lawmakers really see this as their last  chance to get a piece of the pie in what could be the final must-pass  legislation for Congress this year.  </p><p>HERERA:  If that wasn't enough, what else is on the congressional agenda?  </p><p>MUI:  Well, once they get through this spending bill, it should clear the  decks for the next two years.  You're expected to see Congress really focus  on those midterm elections, but what also could be coming up is tax reform  phase two.  We spoke to the head of the House Freedom Caucus,  Representative Mark Meadows, who said he believes we could see a rollout as  soon as April 15th, so mark your calendars, guys.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  Wow.  Tax legislation that close to an election, that should be  interesting.  </p><p>Ylan Mui in Washington, thank you.  </p><p>HERERA:  Oracle's revenue comes up short, and that's where we begin  tonight's \"Market Focus.\" </p><p>After the bell, the cloud computing company topped profit expectations but  saw its sales slightly miss targets.  The company's software licensing  revenue rose, but that, too, wasn't good enough for the street.  The shares  initially fell in the extended session.  They ended the regular day down a  fraction to $51.95.  </p><p>Shares of the smartphone technology-maker Universal (NYSE:UVV) Display were  pressured following a report that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is investing in next- generation technology to make its own phone screens.  Bloomberg says Apple  (NASDAQ:AAPL) has secretly been working on developing micro LED screens, a  feature that could make devices slimmer, but also improve battery life.  A  finished product is said to be a few years away, but shares of universal  display fell 12 percent today to $109 even.  </p><p>Newell Brands will give billionaire Carl Icahn's five board seats in  exchange for support in fending off activist hedge fund Starboard Value,  which has been pushing for a management shake up at the consumer products  company.  Last week, Icahn revealed a nearly 7 percent stake in the maker  of Sharpies.  As part of its deal with Icahn, Newell will consider selling  some of its noncore assets.  Shares of Newell Brands were off 6 percent to  $26.79.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  Biotech firm Herron Therapeutics says its experimental  anesthetic (INAUDIBLE) undergoing specific surgeries significantly  decreased pain when compared to existing treatments.  The company also said  that patients who were given new anesthetic needed fewer opioids in the  hours following the procedure.  That's certainly good news.  Shares jumped  nearly 27 percent on that news to $27.30.</p><p>And ship equipment-maker KLA-Tencor (NASDAQ:KLAC) is buying technology  company Orbotech (NASDAQ:ORBK) for about $3.5 billion.  KLA said that the  deal will grow its customer base and create new revenue generating  opportunities.  Separately, KLA launched a $2 billion share buyback  program.  KLA-Tencor (NASDAQ:KLAC) Shares fell more than 3 percent today to  $115.98.  Meanwhile, as might be expected, shares of Orbotech (NASDAQ:ORBK)  popped by 6 percent to $63.99.  </p><p>And McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) reportedly is going to settle a lawsuit charging  the fast-food giant with alleged labor law violations at its franchises.  A  union group representing McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) employees had previously  claimed that workers were fired after participating in protests seeking a  higher minimum wage.  Shares of McDonald's fell 2 percent today to $159.01.  </p><p>HERERA:  Well, it's been a decade since the start of the financial crisis  that wiped out trillions of dollars worth of assets held by U.S.  households.  Since the crisis, though, a bull market has emerged and stocks  have enjoyed quite significant gains.  But despite the run-up in stocks, a  \"Reuters\" report says many Americans are staying on the sidelines,  investing about $900 billion less than they did in 2007.  </p><p>Joining us to talk about that is Stephen Wood.  He's the chief market  strategist at Russell Investments.  </p><p>It's always good to have you here, Stephen.  Welcome.  </p><p>STEPHEN WOOD, RUSSELL INVESTMENT'S CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST:  Thank you.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  Welcome back.  </p><p>HERERA:  So, what do you think is behind this?  First of all, what do you  think about that report and the statistics, and why do you think it is?  </p><p>WOOD:  Well, I think there are certain generational impacts.  If we look at  our grandparents, how the Depression affected them -- our parents, how they  react to inflation given their experience in the '60s and '70s.  That  financial crisis was a serious blow to a lot of investors.  So, I think  there's some aspect of that even a decade later, and it could be  generational.  </p><p>I think there is also an aspect where the average retail investor typically  looks to buy at the top and sell at the bottom.  And that's something we  work hard with our strategies to minimize, but that is, unfortunately, a  common characteristic of investment patterns.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  There are probably plenty of people who feel like they missed  the boat this time around, so they're going to wait for a significant  pullback to get into the market, right?  </p><p>WOOD:  Well, that would be people that are paying attention to the market  specifically.  That may not be everyone.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  Well, let me ask this, where are they putting the money, if  they're not putting in the stock market right now?  </p><p>WOOD:  I think, right now, you're seeing cash build-ups and I think a lot  of people are probably just sitting on the sidelines.  As you mentioned,  they're waiting for maybe a higher rally in the market to confirm.  </p><p>So, there's a lot of behavioral finance, the psychology of investment  that's really impactful, and I think that's why you need a very good,  global, disciplined strategy to minimize some of those behavioral biases.  </p><p>HERERA:  Perfect segue into where to put your money to work and you do like  a global strategy.  You like Europe, Japan, emerging markets?  </p><p>WOOD:  We do.  As I'm sharing with you earlier, I've been in Portugal,  Spain, just got back from Japan.  So, the time zone I'm in, I don't know.   But -- </p><p>HERERA:  You're not sure.  </p><p>WOOD:  I'm not sure, I'm not sure.  But assuming we're in New York right  now, the message is similar in Japan, it's similar in Europe, and it's  similar here, that if you look at the cycle right now in the U.S., the  economy looks okay.  Earnings are going to look good, but it's a very  expensive market.  </p><p>So, for an American or a dollar-based investor, this is a pretty good time  to start thinking about rebalancing globally, just being disciplined,  blocking and tackling, looking at Europe, which is cheaper.  They've got an  earlier economic cycle.  And whereas our central bank is raising rates,  they're still accommodative, similar to Japan.  </p><p>So, ten years ago, the U.S. was lagging.  Right now, the U.S. is leading.   So, rebalance globally and be disciplined, which, again, it minimizes some  of those behavioral mistakes.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  But we'll see if the millennials who were damaged by the  financial crisis of ten years ago decide they want to get into the market,  right?  </p><p>WOOD:  Well, the benefit for them is they're young and they're going to  live a lot longer than we will.  So they've got time.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  We can only hope.  </p><p>Stephen Wood of Russell Investments, always good to see you.  Thanks.</p><p>WOOD:  Thank you, sir.  </p><p>HERERA:  Coming up, retail's extreme makeover.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>COURTNEY REAGAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  I'm Courtney  Reagan in Las Vegas, Nevada, at one of retail's biggest conferences of the  year where established brands, tech companies and start-ups are all coming  together to figure out what the future of retail will look like.  I've got  the story coming up on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Here's what to watch on Tuesday.  </p><p>Jerome Powell will chair his first monetary policy committee meeting.  The  two-day meeting begins tomorrow, concludes with that press conference on  Wednesday.  </p><p>FedEx (NYSE:FDX) reports earnings that include results from its peak  holiday season.  That should be interesting.  And the Saudi crown prince  will be visiting the White House to discuss economic priorities between our  two countries.  And that is what to watch on a very busy Tuesday tomorrow.  </p><p>HERERA:  Indeed.  </p><p>Uber has temporarily suspended its self-driving car tests in all locations  after a deadly accident in Arizona.  A woman was reportedly hit and killed  by a vehicle in self-driving mode as she crossed the street.  That incident  appears to be the first time that someone has been killed by an autonomous  vehicle.  Uber says it's cooperating with the investigation.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  The nation's largest retailers are asking the White House not to  levy new tariffs on China.  A letter signed today by 40 different  retailers, including Walmart, Target (NYSE:TGT), and Costco (NASDAQ:COST),  argued that tariffs would lead to higher prices, which, in turn, would hurt  working families who shop in their stores.  There are reports, you may have  heard, that the White House is considering tariffs on at least $30 billion  worth of imports from China, beyond steel and aluminum.  </p><p>HERERA:  Teen jewelry chain Claire's is filing for bankruptcy.  The  retailer, which says it has pierced more than 100 million ears worldwide --  never heard of that statistic, but that's what they say -- is struggling  with a heavy debt burden.  Now, the company operates in 99 percent of  America's malls and was purchased by the private equity firm Apollo Global  Management for more than $3 billion back in 2007.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  That's over 40 years, by the way.  </p><p>HERERA:  Yes.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  As the retail industry does change, many companies are looking  to technology to give them an edge.  </p><p>Courtney Reagan reports now from a major retail conference in Las Vegas.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>COURTNEY REAGAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Here at shop talk,  everybody is talking about the future of retail in which companies will  lead the way.  There seems to be no doubt that technology will play a  critical role.  Start-ups are announcing deals with established retailers  and tech companies are pitching ideas to make shopping better in store and  online.  Walmart and Handy are going to offer shoppers TV installation and  furniture assembly services in 2,000 stores.  </p><p>By the end of the year, shoppers in Macy's (NYSE:M) stores can scan and  check out on their phones.  CEO Jeff Gennette says mobile checkout saves  time than going to a cashier, even though store employees still have to  remove security tags and verify the purchase.  Macy's is partnering with a  tech company Marxent to roll out a virtual reality program so shoppers can  lay out Macy's (NYSE:M) furniture in their living room to see how it will  look before they buy.  </p><p>JEFF GENNETTE, MACY'S CHAIRMAN AND CEO:  It's increasing what they buy on  that purchase and it's decreasing the amount they return, because they've  already kind of tested it.  They've already kind of felt that the shape and  size will work in their home environment.  You don't have to have a  physical sample in the store, and that's why the furniture space can be  half of what they are to do the same level of volume.  </p><p>REAGAN:  But infusing stores with technology will only be a winning  strategy if it brings shoppers in.  Mall operator Westfield co-CEO Steve  Lowy thinks physical retailers are massively behind when it comes to  understanding their consumers.  As chairman of One Market, it's a retail  technology start-up.  He's working to change that.  </p><p>STEVE LOWLY, WESTFIELD CORP. CO-CEO:  The retailing industry really needs  to focus on servicing its consumer much better than it is.  It's currently  really boxing with a hand behind its back right now, because they're really  only working with their own data.  We don't really have the ability to  share data across the network so they can better understand their consumer.   They have no idea what the consumer is doing before they actually make a  purchase.  </p><p>REAGAN:  No one is sure what the future of retail will look like, but  there's a ground swell of innovative companies here determined to figure it  out. </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Courtney Reagan in Las Vegas, Nevada.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  Little Caesars made a March Madness bet and now it owes everyone a  free lunch.  The pizza chain said that if a bottom-seeded team beat a  number one seed on Friday night, everyone in the country would get a free  meal.  Now, that seemed like a pretty safe bet, but that's not how it  turned out when number 16 University of Maryland Baltimore County defeated  number 1 University of Virginia.  So, your free lunch is April 2nd.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  Meantime, \"Black Panther\" has marked yet another box office  milestone.  The movie topped the domestic box office for the fifth straight  week, making it only the third film in the past 20 years to do that.  The  Disney (NYSE:DIS) film took in another $27 million over the weekend in  ticket sales, pushing its domestic gross to more than $605 million.  </p><p>HERERA:  And here's another look at the sell-off on Wall Street today.  The  Dow is down 335 points, Nasdaq off 137, S&amp;P 500 fell 39.  </p><p>And that's it for NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT tonight.  I'm Sue Herera.  Thanks  for joining us.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  I'm Bill Griffeth.  Have a great Monday evening, everybody.  See  you tomorrow.</p><p>END</p><p>Nightly Business Report transcripts and video are available on-line post  broadcast at <url normalizedValue=\"http://nbr.com\">http://nbr.com</url>.

The Fed signals it may not make any moves on interest rates this year, cutting its forecast from two hikes to none.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">BILL GRIFFETH, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR: Antitrust fine.

Disney (NYSE:DIS) closes its blockbuster $71 billion purchase of Fox and now, the hard work begins.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Those stories and more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Wednesday, March 28th.</p><p>GRIFFETH: And we do bid you a good evening, everybody, and welcome. So, it was decision day for the Federal Reserve with a twist. As expected, the Central Bank kept its benchmark interest rate unchanged.</p><p>What was not expected was a strong signal then that there will be no rate increases this year and maybe only one next year. Investors breathed a sigh of relief immediately after that announcement was made. The Dow recovered from a 200-point decline but words from President Trump today that U.S. tariffs against China may remain in place for a prolonged period, that took a toll.</p><p>And by the close, the Dow was down 141 points. It closed at 25,745. Nasdaq was still up five points. The S&amp;P was down eight.</p><p>Steve Liesman has more on the Fed`s decision from Washington for us tonight.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>STEVE LIESMAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: The Federal Reserve in a series of major announcements after its March meeting kept interest rates on hold, downgraded its economic outlook and forecast no rate hikes in 2019. The meeting of members of the committee had previously forecast two hikes this year. They`re gone now.</p><p>The Fed also decided to stop reducing its balance sheet, that some of the market had said was hurting the economy and that would begin in September. For a central bank that moves policy slowly, it was a rapid about-face for a forecast of strong growth and a rate hike as recently as December.</p><p>Despite the changes, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell maintained a positive outlook.</p><p>JEROME POWELL, FEDERAL RESERVE CHAIRMAN: The data are not currently sending a signal that we need to move in one direction or another.</p><p>Committee members, participants generally see a growth of around 2 percent. They see unemployment remaining below 4 percent. They see inflation remaining close to target and they see growth, as I said, around 2 percent.</p><p>So that`s a positive outlook. It`s a favorable outlook.</p><p>LIESMAN: Still, the Fed downgraded its outlook for growth from 2.3 percent to 2.1 percent this year and Powell highlighted risks to the economy coming in part from global developments.</p><p>POWELL: You see slowing global growth. You still have -- there`s no resolution of Brexit. There`s no resolution really of the trade talks. These are ongoing risks. We`re also carefully monitoring what`s happening with U.S. growth. We called that out in our statement, that the limited data that we have do show a slowdown.</p><p>On the other hand, as I mentioned, we see the underlying economic fundamentals for growth this year as still very positive.</p><p>LIESMAN: Finally, Powell noted that downward pressure on inflation is a major challenge for Fed and central banks around the world. But overall, no hint from Powell about what the next move is up or down. And he gave the clear impression today he doesn`t know either.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Steve Liesman in Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: Let`s turn now to Art Hogan for more analysis on the Fed, the economy and the market. He is chief market strategist at National Securities.</p><p>Welcome back, Art.</p><p>ART HOGAN, CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST, NATIONAL SECURITIES: Hi, Sue. Thanks so much for having me.</p><p>HERERA: You say this is a bold move. I guess the question is, in your opinion, was it the right move?</p><p>HOGAN: Well, it`s hard to say. You know, it`s interesting. The three things I think about here, I really feel like Jay Powell didn`t need to actually remove both of the dots for 2019. Plenty more meetings in front of him that he could have done that, so that`s where it really gets bold. So, that exceeded expectations.</p><p>But, you know, this is truly a Fed has made a pivot in January from being auto pilot hawkish in December to patient in January and now they`re even more patient. So, what does this tell us? It tells us the Fed is actually at neutral. They`re literally at neutral.</p><p>And the next move could be a hike or a cut in interest rates. My guess is the next move is a hike. And I think that probably comes in the first part of 2020.</p><p>But right now, the Fed has reinforced the fact that they`re really patient and that`s probably a tailwind for the market.</p><p>GRIFFETH: So what does the stock market do with that? Clearly for Wall Street, no more hikes at least for the foreseeable future, that`s a good thing. But they also downgrade the forecast on the economy. That`s not such a good thing.</p><p>So where does the stock market go, do you think?</p><p>HOGAN: Right, and I think you really would rather have the Fed tightening than cutting rates as their next move. And that would mean the economic activity had picked back up. So, you know, we know the first quarter is likely going to be slower than the fourth quarter of last year. We hope that the second quarter picks up in activity. We don`t know that yet.</p><p>And I think what Jay Powell was speaking to was that, oh, by the way, the global economy has slowed down and we have no resolution on both Brexit and the U.S./China trade war. So, I think when we think about all of those things, if any of those things turn positive. For example, if we get a U.S.-China trade deal, I think the economy picks up in the second and third quarter of this year. There`s just a question of when that timing comes up. The Fed may have to hike again, it may happen this year, but it`s just not in the cards.</p><p>HERERA: So, as you look at the market as an investor, a longer term investor, how do you handicap this given the headline risk that you just outlined?</p><p>HOGAN: Well, we need a trade behind us to think we can earn $170 for the S&amp;P 500 this year. That`s what our base assumption is. And if we don`t do that and if we escalate, then I certainly think that, you know, this market is pricey.</p><p>Our base case is we`re going to get that trade deal done. Unfortunately, we`re going through that back and forth process right now, which seems like it`s the end of the process, not the beginning. But I think getting a trade deal behind us, we think this market can move higher than we are right now. We just need to get that in the rear-view mirror.</p><p>HERERA: All right, Art. We`ll leave it there. Thank you.</p><p>HOGAN: Thank you.</p><p>HERERA: Art Hogan with National Securities.</p><p>European Union officials say they are willing to grant a short delay for Britain`s exit from the bloc but that delay comes with conditions. They want parliament to approve the withdrawal plan that has already been rejected. That increases uncertainty just days before the U.K. is scheduled to leave the E.U. on March 29th.</p><p>GRIFFETH: And the European Union has ordered Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) to pay $1.7 billion for antitrust violations. This is its third fines in a series of penalties. The E.U. competition commissioner sys Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) abused its position in the online advertising market.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP</p><p>MARGRETHE VESTAGER, EUROPEAN COMMISSIONER FOR COMPETITION: If you have a travel Website or a news Website and you want to sell the advertising space next to the search that you can do on your site, you need a broker. And Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) is one of the absolute biggest brokers in this market, and they misused their dominant position to make sure that no rivals were able to compete in this market for advertising on new sites, on travel sites.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GRIFFETH: In response, Google`s parent, Alphabet, said today it has already made changes to its products and that it plans to make additional updates as well.</p><p>HERERA: The tech giant and others in the industry are also coming under pressure here in the U.S. So what does that mean for the tech industry?</p><p>Ian Sherr is executive editor at CNET. He joins us now to talk about that.</p><p>Ian, welcome. Nice to have you here.</p><p>It seems as though Europe is taking the lead on all the talk about regulation of big tech and also possible breakup of big tech. What do you think is going to play out on this country`s soil?</p><p>IAN SHERR, CNET EXECUTIVE EDITOR: You know, it`s going to be really interesting. I think there`s going to be an ongoing conversation on Capitol Hill where they try to understand the basics of how technology works. We`ve learned they have a lot of education to go through.</p><p>I think at some point, there`s going to be a test, whether it`s an attempt to really see what a breakup of Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) or Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) could look like, and then to see what happens to the rest of the tech industry. But there`s going to be a lot of pushback, and especially from the tech industry, who says, look, we`re getting all of this pressure and we don`t deserve it.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Here it has happened again. It`s happened in the past. Technology companies or companies on the cutting edge of some type of innovation get way out ahead of regulators and lawmakers. It happened with AT&amp;T (NYSE:T), it happened with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and now it`s happening with a lot of these FANG stocks.</p><p>What`s your expectation not just for what the regulators and lawmakers are going to do, but what the companies, how they will respond?</p><p>SHERR: Well, they need to get in front of this as much as they can, right? There`s a lot of things that have been put out there. I think that Senator Elizabeth Warren, who`s now a presidential candidate has caused a lot of conversation that probably would not have happened otherwise or taken a little longer by calling for a breakup of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). So --</p><p>GRIFFETH: But is there -- are there regulations or self regulation that these companies can come up with that would give them some space between the regulators and lawmakers so that they sort of tone down the rhetoric?</p><p>SHERR: They could answer a lot of these concerns. I mean, the thing is that right now, these companies are getting a lot of pressure from all sorts of places. And they`re kind of responding to some of it, but the larger problems still remain.</p><p>You know, we`re still not convinced that the election interference that happened in 2016 won`t repeat. We`re still not convinced that these companies are not acting monopolistically, and there`s still ongoing concerns that they are not protecting our data correctly.</p><p>And if they can`t answer those types of questions, they`re going to have a bad day at some point.</p><p>HERERA: Yes, very quickly in the 30 seconds that we have left, if it indeed it came to the ultimate solution, which will be perhaps a breakup, wouldn`t that foster perhaps more innovation? We have seen that in the past as well.</p><p>SHERR: That`s definitely an argument, and I think that`s where you`re starting to see people like Senator Warren push toward, but that`s not a guarantee. If we just break them up for the sake of breaking them up, we`re causing trouble in the economy. We`re not actually being thoughtful.</p><p>That`s what`s important. We need to be thoughtful if we`re ever going to go down that path.</p><p>HERERA: All right. Ian Sherr with CNET, thanks so much.</p><p>SHERR: My pleasure.</p><p>GRIFFETH: So, with all the talk about regulations and laws to rein in some of these tech giants, is Wall Street`s so-called FANG era coming to an end? And if so, where does new leadership come from?</p><p>Mike Santoli is staying late for us tonight at the New York Stock Exchange to explore that.</p><p>And you actually don`t buy the notion that the FANG era is coming to a close?</p><p>MIKE SANTOLI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Well, I do, Bill, think it`s a little premature to say it`s coming to a close. What we have seen, though, is a little fracturing of FANG.</p><p>What I mean by that is if you look at Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), to a lesser degree Google`s parent Alphabet, those stocks underperformed for a lot of last year. Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) has had its valuation punished to some degree because of all these concerns. But at the same time, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), these companies that are not really using your private data in a way to sell to advertisers but are selling a service that you are purchasing of your own free will and you wish to, they have actually performed better.</p><p>So there`s definitely been some rethinking about exactly how durable some of these business models are.</p><p>HERERA: All right. So, if indeed we do see action against some of these companies or regulations, where do you see new leadership kind of emerging?</p><p>SANTOLI: You know, Sue, it`s very difficult to conceive of new leadership that is exactly as dominant as these companies, because I do think there`s an argument to be made that these businesses are in some sense, they tend toward natural monopolies. They have these network effects that gives them power. But I think they would probably, if they did get broken up or recede in the market`s favor, probably health care is the place to look -- whether it`s medical technology or health care services.</p><p>You`ve already seen it grow to a large portion of the overall market value of the S&amp;P 500. So perhaps that is the way to go. But we`ve gone long stretches of time in the market without a single dominant cohort of companies that was really driving returns.</p><p>GRIFFETH: But going back to the FANGs for a moment here, you have to admit if there are to be regulations or some kind of a law, even if there`s a breakup, that is going to put a crimp on their profitability going forward, isn`t it?</p><p>SANTOLI: No, I mean, I would completely agree with that. Not only overt regulations or breakups or lawsuits, but also just the chilling effect it has on these companies` ambitions down the road, right? Every one of these technology companies probably figures it has to maneuver for its next act, expand with new businesses, whether it`s self-driving cars or some other services.</p><p>And are they going to be permitted, for example, to make additional acquisitions the way Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) has done so well over the years or are they going to expand into those other areas aggressively. Or would they be thwarted? Those things I think very long term should be on investors` radars, just exactly how open-ended the growth prospects for a lot of these companies?</p><p>GRIFFETH: Mike Santoli at the New York Stock Exchange -- thanks, Michael.</p><p>SANTOLI: Thank you.</p><p>HERERA: It is time to take a look at some of today`s \"Upgrades and Downgrades\".</p><p>FedEx (NYSE:FDX) was downgraded to neutral from overweight at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM). The firm cites rising labor costs and potential pressure on operating margins. As we reported, the company cut its full year profit outlook late yesterday.</p><p>The price target is $202. The stock fell about 3.5 percent to $175.07.</p><p>Sony (NYSE:SNE) was downgraded to hold from buy at Jefferies. The analyst cites concerns about a peak in game profits and Sony`s inability to exit the smartphone business. The price target is $50.70. The stock fell almost 5 percent to $43.28.</p><p>And Dollar Tree (NASDAQ:DLTR) was upgraded to outperform from market perform at Telsey Advisory Group. The analyst there cites a recent meeting with management which increased his confidence in the company`s plan. The price target is $117. Shares rose a fraction to $101.35.</p><p>GRIFFETH: And still ahead, and idled auto plant and the home town feeling the impact.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>FRANK HOLLAND, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: This Shrine of Hope has been built outside this now closed GM plant that has President Trump tweeting. I`m Frank Holland, I`ll have local reaction to those tweets and the closure coming up on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GRIFFETH: There are reports tonight that the FBI has now joined the criminal investigation into the certification process of the Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX. As first reported by \"The Seattle Times,\" the FBI`s Seattle field office is now part of this investigation because of its close proximity to Boeing`s 737 manufacturing plant in Renton. The investigation is being overseen by the Justice Department and carried out by the Transportation Department`s inspector general.</p><p>This latest report sent Boeing (NYSE:BA) stock initially lower in after- hours trading tonight.</p><p>HERERA: Oil prices settled at a four-month high after hitting $60 for the first time since November. Government data showed a sharp decline in oil and refine fuel inventories. That sent the price of domestic crude higher, though it settled just below that $60 level.</p><p>GRIFETH: Optimism among the nation`s CEOs is cooling off. According to the latest survey from the business roundtable, chief executives are concerned about global economic growth. CEOs now see the economies growing at 2.5 percent. That would be this year and it`s slightly down from the earlier estimate.</p><p>HERERA: The Disney (NYSE:DIS) and Fox merger is officially complete, and it could mark the beginning of a new era for Hollywood. But integrating the two companies could prove challenging.</p><p>Julia Boorstin explains.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JULIA BOORSTIN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Disney (NYSE:DIS) has officially acquired Fox`s entertainment assets, including its movie and TV studio with its Avatar (NASDAQ:AVTR) and X-Men franchises, along with National Geographic and FX, plus Indian media giant Star, and an additional 30 percent stake in Hulu.</p><p>These assets building Disney (NYSE:DIS) into a behemoth with more content to stream direct to consumers to enable and to better complete with digital giants such as Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX).</p><p>JOEL KULINA, WEDBUSH: It`s kind of roll the dice to see who`s going to come out. It`s going to -- for everything to go seamless and everyone to be a winner, that`s probably a little unrealistic. And we`ve seen Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), what they`ve done over the years is spend, spend, spend.</p><p>I mean, I think Disney (NYSE:DIS) and the likes of so many other players going to find out to compete with Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), it`s going to ding their profitability.</p><p>BOORSTIN: Iger writing in a note to employees today: I wish I could tell you that the hardest part is behind us. That closing the deal was the finish line rather than just the next milestone. What lies ahead is the challenging work.</p><p>The challenge that lies ahead isn`t just about integrating the two companies but about the launch of Disney`s direct-to-consumer streaming service, Disney (NYSE:DIS) Plus, later this year. It`s expected to include new, original exclusive content plus Disney`s library.</p><p>Disney (NYSE:DIS) will unveil the details of the new service which will feature its major brands such as \"Star Wars\" and Fox`s National Geographic at a preview day next month.</p><p>JOANNA COLES, FORMER HEARST CHIEF CONTENT OFFICER: It remains to be seen if Gen Z, millennials, actually want to download something called Disney (NYSE:DIS) Plus. Does that remind them of their childhood? Do they like the idea of something more edgy? Which is definitely what Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) provides.</p><p>BOORSTIN: As Disney (NYSE:DIS) doubles down on on-demand content, the remainder of Fox is focused on live news and sports, spinning of as an independent company, focusing on its ability to drive ad revenue and cable retransmission fees for its timely content, looking to benefit from the political news cycle in sharp contrast to Disney`s more timeless content.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Julia Boorstin.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH: The FDA approves the first postpartum depression drug. That`s where we begin tonight`s \"Market Focus\".</p><p>Sage Therapeutics is the company that made the injectable drug called Zulresso that treats this condition. It will only be available through a restricted program because there are concerns about risks, including excessive sedation or sudden loss of consciousness. Two clinical studies, though, showed improved symptoms at the end of the first infusion. And the CEO says that is key.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JEFF JONAS, SAGE THERAPEUTICS CEO: When you think about what we potentially are offering -- rapid response, one-time therapy, getting women back home, you know, we don`t hear any resistance to that. In fact, there`s a lot of enthusiasm, in order for these women not to suffer in silence but to get better.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GRIFFETH: Wall Street has been anticipating this. The stock has been up 60 percent so far this year, but it ended the day down more than 2.5 percent to $152.46.</p><p>General Mills (NYSE:GIS) increased prices, and it paid off. The packaged food maker today reported higher margins, better-than-expected earnings and it is now forecasting improved profits for this fiscal year. The company was also helped by lower costs. Shares rose about 2 percent today to $48.29.</p><p>HERERA: Nexstar will sell 19 TV stations for more than a billion dollars to Tegna and Scripps. The divestitures follow the acquisition of Tribune Media by Nexstar which said it is in talks to sell two more stations in Indianapolis. All three stocks fell. Nexstar was off a fraction. Tegna and EW Scripps were down close to 3 percent each.</p><p>Ford plans to build a new factory in Michigan for autonomous vehicles. The new facility is expected to open in the necessary two years. The move is part of the automaker`s plan to focus on its future line up of self-driving and electric cars. The stock fell 2 percent to $8.51.</p><p>GRIFFETH: President Trump traveled to Ohio today just days after pressuring General Motors (NYSE:GM) to reopen a plant in that state. The automaker`s factory closed earlier this month and the town of Lordstown is feeling the impact.</p><p>Here`s Frank Holland.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>FRANK HOLLAND, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Outside of its now closed factory where General Motors (NYSE:GM) made the Chevy Cruze, a Shrine of Hope left by some of the thousands of workers who made their living here.</p><p>RYAN MCCABE, LAID OFF GM EMPLOYEE: You just don`t replace these jobs.</p><p>HOLLAND: Ryan McCabe, a husband and father of six, was laid off from the Lordstown, Ohio, plant, after 19 years.</p><p>MCCABE: Your family has worked at General Motors (NYSE:GM), your family has retired from General Motors (NYSE:GM), and you`re the last one there. Then, all of a sudden, it`s all gone.</p><p>HOLLAND: GM closing this factory as it focuses more on trucks and SUVs. Sales of the Cruze sedan falling by almost half over the past five years. McCabe took these pictures of the last Cruze leaving the assembly line. Now, he and thousands of other workers are searching for jobs at other GM factories.</p><p>MCCABE: When General Motors (NYSE:GM) and Mary Barra tells us there`s all these opportunities for us to transfer, it comes across as so cold and calculated because I know they have kids, I know they have families. How would they react in the same situation as us?</p><p>HOLLAND: Lordstown is under reallocation and could reopen after September when GM and the union enter contract negotiations.</p><p>But President Trump, who visited Ohio today, wants answers now. Tweeting over the weekend: I want jobs to stay in the USA and want Lordstown and one of the best economies in our history opened or sold to a company who will open it up fast.</p><p>MCCABE: I`m glad he is supporting us and wants to help us. I just wish he would come here and kind of see firsthand, instead of just making random tweets about it.</p><p>HOLLAND: The reaction from others in town is mixed, especially after a 2017 speech where the president told local workers manufacturing jobs would be coming back.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I think it`s a little too late. I think he should have been on the bandwagon when they first -- when they cut the other shifts and when they announced that they were going to cut this shift.</p><p>UNIDNETIFIED FEMALE: I feel like it`s the company`s fault, not the president`s fault.</p><p>HOLLAND: The closure of this plant is expected to have a $3 billion negative impact on this region this year. But at the same time, manufacturing jobs here in Ohio have grown more than 2.5 percent since January of 2017. Still, the fate of this factory and McCabe remains unclear.</p><p>MCCABE: We don`t know if this is a temporary layoff or permanent layoff. The whole unallocated status just kind of makes -- it makes it hard to gauge what to do, especially for people with families.</p><p>HOLLAND: For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Frank Holland in Lordstown, Ohio.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: Coming up, companies are looking for the next big thing in gaming. But are consumers willing to pay up?</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GRIFFETH: There was a legal setback for German life sciences giant Bayer last night. A second jury has ruled that its Roundup weed killer caused a man`s cancer. Bayer denies the allegation, saying it was disappointed with the decision. Bayer did acquire Monsanto (NYSE:MON) which makes Roundup for $63 billion last year.</p><p>HERERA: We told you yesterday about Google`s big push into the growing video game market. Today, other companies showed off their new innovative devices that they hope will be the next big thing in gaming.</p><p>Josh Lipton is in San Francisco tonight.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Great. If you move your body around --</p><p>JOSH LIPTON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Some fans don`t just want to play video games, they want to feel like they`re inside the game itself. That`s the appeal of virtual reality or VR, a totally immersive 360-degree experience.</p><p>Today, here at the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco, one of the biggest players, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB)-owned Oculus, introduced the Oculus Rift S.</p><p>NATE MITCHELL, FACEBOOK HEAD OF VR PRODUCTS: Rift S features a much higher resolution display, which obviously makes the whole image a lot clearer and more immersive, and also features, you know, Oculus touch controllers, which give you a natural sense of real hand presence, being able to reach out and interact with the virtual world around you.</p><p>LIPTON: It`s not just the big companies. Startup magically sells so- called mixed reality goggles where the digital content is integrated into the real world. For example, when I put on the goggles, I suddenly appeared like an old man to my fellow gamer, as we ran around the room and took shots at each other.</p><p>But for all the hype, this remains a relatively small market for now. Analysts say only 6 percent of U.S. gamers own a virtual reality or augmented reality headset.</p><p>In part they say that`s because there still isn`t enough compelling content right now to motivate a lot of gamers to go out and buy this hardware. And that`s partly because of the rising popularity of games that are free to play, like \"Fortnite\", made by Epic Games. It boasts more than 200 million registered players, raking in almost $2.5 billion last year.</p><p>Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:ERTS) released rival game \"Apex Legends\" in early February.</p><p>Fifty million players signed up for that game in the title`s first month.</p><p>Analysts are watching Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:ERTS) closely. If \"Apex Legends\" is a success, then other publishers, such as Activision may follow suit and more enthusiastically embrace that same free to play battle royale style.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Josh Lipton at San Francisco.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH: Finally tonight, it`s time for March Madness. According to the American Gaming Association, nearly 50 million Americans are going to wager a collective $8.5 billion on the college basketball tournament. This is the first March Madness, by the way, since the Supreme Court overturned that ruling that effectively outlawed sports betting in almost every state.</p><p>HERERA: Here`s a look at the final numbers on Wall Street. The Dow fell 141 points, Nasdaq rose 5, S&amp;P 500 down 8.</p><p>That will do it for NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT tonight. I`m Sue Herera. Thanks for joining us.</p><p>GRIFFETH: I`m Bill Griffeth.

The Fed signals it may not make any moves on interest rates this year, cutting its forecast from two hikes to none.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">BILL GRIFFETH, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR:  Antitrust fine.  The European Union goes after Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), just the latest regulator to turn up the heat on big tech.  Is this the price they pay for success?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">HERERA:  Done deal.  Disney (NYSE:DIS) closes its blockbuster $71 billion purchase of Fox and now, the hard work begins.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Those stories and more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Wednesday, March 28th.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  And we do bid you a good evening, everybody, and welcome.  So, it was decision day for the Federal Reserve with a twist.  As expected, the Central Bank kept its benchmark interest rate unchanged.</p><p>What was not expected was a strong signal then that there will be no rate increases this year and maybe only one next year.  Investors breathed a sigh of relief immediately after that announcement was made.  The Dow recovered from a 200-point decline but words from President Trump today that U.S. tariffs against China may remain in place for a prolonged period, that took a toll.</p><p>And by the close, the Dow was down 141 points.  It closed at 25,745.  Nasdaq was still up five points.  The S&amp;P was down eight.</p><p>Steve Liesman has more on the Fed`s decision from Washington for us tonight.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>STEVE LIESMAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  The Federal Reserve in a series of major announcements after its March meeting kept interest rates on hold, downgraded its economic outlook and forecast no rate hikes in 2019.  The meeting of members of the committee had previously forecast two hikes this year.  They`re gone now.</p><p>The Fed also decided to stop reducing its balance sheet, that some of the market had said was hurting the economy and that would begin in September.  For a central bank that moves policy slowly, it was a rapid about-face for a forecast of strong growth and a rate hike as recently as December.</p><p>Despite the changes, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell maintained a positive outlook.</p><p>JEROME POWELL, FEDERAL RESERVE CHAIRMAN:  The data are not currently sending a signal that we need to move in one direction or another.</p><p>Committee members, participants generally see a growth of around 2 percent.  They see unemployment remaining below 4 percent.  They see inflation remaining close to target and they see growth, as I said, around 2 percent.</p><p>So that`s a positive outlook.  It`s a favorable outlook.</p><p>LIESMAN:  Still, the Fed downgraded its outlook for growth from 2.3 percent to 2.1 percent this year and Powell highlighted risks to the economy coming in part from global developments.</p><p>POWELL:  You see slowing global growth.  You still have -- there`s no resolution of Brexit.  There`s no resolution really of the trade talks.  These are ongoing risks.  We`re also carefully monitoring what`s happening with U.S. growth.  We called that out in our statement, that the limited data that we have do show a slowdown.</p><p>On the other hand, as I mentioned, we see the underlying economic fundamentals for growth this year as still very positive.</p><p>LIESMAN:  Finally, Powell noted that downward pressure on inflation is a major challenge for Fed and central banks around the world.  But overall, no hint from Powell about what the next move is up or down.  And he gave the clear impression today he doesn`t know either.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Steve Liesman in Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  Let`s turn now to Art Hogan for more analysis on the Fed, the economy and the market.  He is chief market strategist at National Securities.</p><p>Welcome back, Art.</p><p>ART HOGAN, CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST, NATIONAL SECURITIES:  Hi, Sue.  Thanks so much for having me.</p><p>HERERA:  You say this is a bold move.  I guess the question is, in your opinion, was it the right move?</p><p>HOGAN:  Well, it`s hard to say.  You know, it`s interesting.  The three things I think about here, I really feel like Jay Powell didn`t need to actually remove both of the dots for 2019.  Plenty more meetings in front of him that he could have done that, so that`s where it really gets bold.  So, that exceeded expectations.</p><p>But, you know, this is truly a Fed has made a pivot in January from being auto pilot hawkish in December to patient in January and now they`re even more patient.  So, what does this tell us?  It tells us the Fed is actually at neutral.  They`re literally at neutral.</p><p>And the next move could be a hike or a cut in interest rates.  My guess is the next move is a hike.  And I think that probably comes in the first part of 2020.</p><p>But right now, the Fed has reinforced the fact that they`re really patient and that`s probably a tailwind for the market.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  So what does the stock market do with that?  Clearly for Wall Street, no more hikes at least for the foreseeable future, that`s a good thing.  But they also downgrade the forecast on the economy.  That`s not such a good thing.</p><p>So where does the stock market go, do you think?</p><p>HOGAN:  Right, and I think you really would rather have the Fed tightening than cutting rates as their next move.  And that would mean the economic activity had picked back up.  So, you know, we know the first quarter is likely going to be slower than the fourth quarter of last year.  We hope that the second quarter picks up in activity.  We don`t know that yet.</p><p>And I think what Jay Powell was speaking to was that, oh, by the way, the global economy has slowed down and we have no resolution on both Brexit and the U.S./China trade war.  So, I think when we think about all of those things, if any of those things turn positive.  For example, if we get a U.S.-China trade deal, I think the economy picks up in the second and third quarter of this year.  There`s just a question of when that timing comes up.  The Fed may have to hike again, it may happen this year, but it`s just not in the cards.</p><p>HERERA:  So, as you look at the market as an investor, a longer term investor, how do you handicap this given the headline risk that you just outlined?</p><p>HOGAN:  Well, we need a trade behind us to think we can earn $170 for the S&amp;P 500 this year.  That`s what our base assumption is.  And if we don`t do that and if we escalate, then I certainly think that, you know, this market is pricey.</p><p>Our base case is we`re going to get that trade deal done.  Unfortunately, we`re going through that back and forth process right now, which seems like it`s the end of the process, not the beginning.  But I think getting a trade deal behind us, we think this market can move higher than we are right now.  We just need to get that in the rear-view mirror.</p><p>HERERA:  All right, Art.  We`ll leave it there.  Thank you.</p><p>HOGAN:  Thank you.</p><p>HERERA:  Art Hogan with National Securities.</p><p>European Union officials say they are willing to grant a short delay for Britain`s exit from the bloc but that delay comes with conditions.  They want parliament to approve the withdrawal plan that has already been rejected.  That increases uncertainty just days before the U.K. is scheduled to leave the E.U. on March 29th.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  And the European Union has ordered Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) to pay $1.7 billion for antitrust violations.  This is its third fines in a series of penalties.  The E.U. competition commissioner sys Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) abused its position in the online advertising market.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP</p><p>MARGRETHE VESTAGER, EUROPEAN COMMISSIONER FOR COMPETITION:  If you have a travel Website or a news Website and you want to sell the advertising space next to the search that you can do on your site, you need a broker.  And Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) is one of the absolute biggest brokers in this market, and they misused their dominant position to make sure that no rivals were able to compete in this market for advertising on new sites, on travel sites.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  In response, Google`s parent, Alphabet, said today it has already made changes to its products and that it plans to make additional updates as well.</p><p>HERERA:  The tech giant and others in the industry are also coming under pressure here in the U.S.  So what does that mean for the tech industry?</p><p>Ian Sherr is executive editor at CNET.  He joins us now to talk about that.</p><p>Ian, welcome.  Nice to have you here.</p><p>It seems as though Europe is taking the lead on all the talk about regulation of big tech and also possible breakup of big tech.  What do you think is going to play out on this country`s soil?</p><p>IAN SHERR, CNET EXECUTIVE EDITOR:  You know, it`s going to be really interesting.  I think there`s going to be an ongoing conversation on Capitol Hill where they try to understand the basics of how technology works.  We`ve learned they have a lot of education to go through.</p><p>I think at some point, there`s going to be a test, whether it`s an attempt to really see what a breakup of Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) or Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) could look like, and then to see what happens to the rest of the tech industry.  But there`s going to be a lot of pushback, and especially from the tech industry, who says, look, we`re getting all of this pressure and we don`t deserve it.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Here it has happened again.  It`s happened in the past.  Technology companies or companies on the cutting edge of some type of innovation get way out ahead of regulators and lawmakers.  It happened with AT&amp;T (NYSE:T), it happened with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and now it`s happening with a lot of these FANG stocks.</p><p>What`s your expectation not just for what the regulators and lawmakers are going to do, but what the companies, how they will respond?</p><p>SHERR:  Well, they need to get in front of this as much as they can, right?  There`s a lot of things that have been put out there.  I think that Senator Elizabeth Warren, who`s now a presidential candidate has caused a lot of conversation that probably would not have happened otherwise or taken a little longer by calling for a breakup of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).  So --</p><p>GRIFFETH:  But is there -- are there regulations or self regulation that these companies can come up with that would give them some space between the regulators and lawmakers so that they sort of tone down the rhetoric?</p><p>SHERR:  They could answer a lot of these concerns.  I mean, the thing is that right now, these companies are getting a lot of pressure from all sorts of places.  And they`re kind of responding to some of it, but the larger problems still remain.</p><p>You know, we`re still not convinced that the election interference that happened in 2016 won`t repeat.  We`re still not convinced that these companies are not acting monopolistically, and there`s still ongoing concerns that they are not protecting our data correctly.</p><p>And if they can`t answer those types of questions, they`re going to have a bad day at some point.</p><p>HERERA:  Yes, very quickly in the 30 seconds that we have left, if it indeed it came to the ultimate solution, which will be perhaps a breakup, wouldn`t that foster perhaps more innovation?  We have seen that in the past as well.</p><p>SHERR:  That`s definitely an argument, and I think that`s where you`re starting to see people like Senator Warren push toward, but that`s not a guarantee.  If we just break them up for the sake of breaking them up, we`re causing trouble in the economy.  We`re not actually being thoughtful.</p><p>That`s what`s important.  We need to be thoughtful if we`re ever going to go down that path.</p><p>HERERA:  All right.  Ian Sherr with CNET, thanks so much.</p><p>SHERR:  My pleasure.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  So, with all the talk about regulations and laws to rein in some of these tech giants, is Wall Street`s so-called FANG era coming to an end?  And if so, where does new leadership come from?</p><p>Mike Santoli is staying late for us tonight at the New York Stock Exchange to explore that.</p><p>And you actually don`t buy the notion that the FANG era is coming to a close?</p><p>MIKE SANTOLI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Well, I do, Bill, think it`s a little premature to say it`s coming to a close.  What we have seen, though, is a little fracturing of FANG.</p><p>What I mean by that is if you look at Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), to a lesser degree Google`s parent Alphabet, those stocks underperformed for a lot of last year.  Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) has had its valuation punished to some degree because of all these concerns.  But at the same time, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), these companies that are not really using your private data in a way to sell to advertisers but are selling a service that you are purchasing of your own free will and you wish to, they have actually performed better.</p><p>So there`s definitely been some rethinking about exactly how durable some of these business models are.</p><p>HERERA:  All right.  So, if indeed we do see action against some of these companies or regulations, where do you see new leadership kind of emerging?</p><p>SANTOLI:  You know, Sue, it`s very difficult to conceive of new leadership that is exactly as dominant as these companies, because I do think there`s an argument to be made that these businesses are in some sense, they tend toward natural monopolies.  They have these network effects that gives them power.  But I think they would probably, if they did get broken up or recede in the market`s favor, probably health care is the place to look -- whether it`s medical technology or health care services.</p><p>You`ve already seen it grow to a large portion of the overall market value of the S&amp;P 500.  So perhaps that is the way to go.  But we`ve gone long stretches of time in the market without a single dominant cohort of companies that was really driving returns.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  But going back to the FANGs for a moment here, you have to admit if there are to be regulations or some kind of a law, even if there`s a breakup, that is going to put a crimp on their profitability going forward, isn`t it?</p><p>SANTOLI:  No, I mean, I would completely agree with that.  Not only overt regulations or breakups or lawsuits, but also just the chilling effect it has on these companies` ambitions down the road, right?  Every one of these technology companies probably figures it has to maneuver for its next act, expand with new businesses, whether it`s self-driving cars or some other services.</p><p>And are they going to be permitted, for example, to make additional acquisitions the way Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) has done so well over the years or are they going to expand into those other areas aggressively.  Or would they be thwarted?  Those things I think very long term should be on investors` radars, just exactly how open-ended the growth prospects for a lot of these companies?</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Mike Santoli at the New York Stock Exchange -- thanks, Michael.</p><p>SANTOLI:  Thank you.</p><p>HERERA:  It is time to take a look at some of today`s \"Upgrades and Downgrades\".</p><p>FedEx (NYSE:FDX) was downgraded to neutral from overweight at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM).  The firm cites rising labor costs and potential pressure on operating margins.  As we reported, the company cut its full year profit outlook late yesterday.</p><p>The price target is $202.  The stock fell about 3.5 percent to $175.07.</p><p>Sony (NYSE:SNE) was downgraded to hold from buy at Jefferies.  The analyst cites concerns about a peak in game profits and Sony`s inability to exit the smartphone business.  The price target is $50.70.  The stock fell almost 5 percent to $43.28.</p><p>And Dollar Tree (NASDAQ:DLTR) was upgraded to outperform from market perform at Telsey Advisory Group.  The analyst there cites a recent meeting with management which increased his confidence in the company`s plan.  The price target is $117.  Shares rose a fraction to $101.35.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  And still ahead, and idled auto plant and the home town feeling the impact.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>FRANK HOLLAND, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  This Shrine of Hope has been built outside this now closed GM plant that has President Trump tweeting.  I`m Frank Holland, I`ll have local reaction to those tweets and the closure coming up on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  There are reports tonight that the FBI has now joined the criminal investigation into the certification process of the Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX.  As first reported by \"The Seattle Times,\" the FBI`s Seattle field office is now part of this investigation because of its close proximity to Boeing`s 737 manufacturing plant in Renton.  The investigation is being overseen by the Justice Department and carried out by the Transportation Department`s inspector general.</p><p>This latest report sent Boeing (NYSE:BA) stock initially lower in after-hours trading tonight.</p><p>HERERA:  Oil prices settled at a four-month high after hitting $60 for the first time since November.  Government data showed a sharp decline in oil and refine fuel inventories.  That sent the price of domestic crude higher, though it settled just below that $60 level.</p><p>GRIFETH:  Optimism among the nation`s CEOs is cooling off.  According to the latest survey from the business roundtable, chief executives are concerned about global economic growth.  CEOs now see the economies growing at 2.5 percent.  That would be this year and it`s slightly down from the earlier estimate.</p><p>HERERA:  The Disney (NYSE:DIS) and Fox merger is officially complete, and it could mark the beginning of a new era for Hollywood.  But integrating the two companies could prove challenging.</p><p>Julia Boorstin explains.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JULIA BOORSTIN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Disney (NYSE:DIS) has officially acquired Fox`s entertainment assets, including its movie and TV studio with its Avatar (NASDAQ:AVTR) and X-Men franchises, along with National Geographic and FX, plus Indian media giant Star, and an additional 30 percent stake in Hulu.</p><p>These assets building Disney (NYSE:DIS) into a behemoth with more content to stream direct to consumers to enable and to better complete with digital giants such as Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX).</p><p>JOEL KULINA, WEDBUSH:  It`s kind of roll the dice to see who`s going to come out.  It`s going to -- for everything to go seamless and everyone to be a winner, that`s probably a little unrealistic.  And we`ve seen Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), what they`ve done over the years is spend, spend, spend.</p><p>I mean, I think Disney (NYSE:DIS) and the likes of so many other players going to find out to compete with Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), it`s going to ding their profitability.</p><p>BOORSTIN:  Iger writing in a note to employees today: I wish I could tell you that the hardest part is behind us.  That closing the deal was the finish line rather than just the next milestone.  What lies ahead is the challenging work.</p><p>The challenge that lies ahead isn`t just about integrating the two companies but about the launch of Disney`s direct-to-consumer streaming service, Disney (NYSE:DIS) Plus, later this year.  It`s expected to include new, original exclusive content plus Disney`s library.</p><p>Disney (NYSE:DIS) will unveil the details of the new service which will feature its major brands such as \"Star Wars\" and Fox`s National Geographic at a preview day next month.</p><p>JOANNA COLES, FORMER HEARST CHIEF CONTENT OFFICER:  It remains to be seen if Gen Z, millennials, actually want to download something called Disney (NYSE:DIS) Plus.  Does that remind them of their childhood?  Do they like the idea of something more edgy?  Which is definitely what Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) provides.</p><p>BOORSTIN:  As Disney (NYSE:DIS) doubles down on on-demand content, the remainder of Fox is focused on live news and sports, spinning of as an independent company, focusing on its ability to drive ad revenue and cable retransmission fees for its timely content, looking to benefit from the political news cycle in sharp contrast to Disney`s more timeless content.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Julia Boorstin.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  The FDA approves the first postpartum depression drug.  That`s where we begin tonight`s \"Market Focus\".</p><p>Sage Therapeutics is the company that made the injectable drug called Zulresso that treats this condition.  It will only be available through a restricted program because there are concerns about risks, including excessive sedation or sudden loss of consciousness.  Two clinical studies, though, showed improved symptoms at the end of the first infusion.  And the CEO says that is key.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JEFF JONAS, SAGE THERAPEUTICS CEO:  When you think about what we potentially are offering -- rapid response, one-time therapy, getting women back home, you know, we don`t hear any resistance to that.  In fact, there`s a lot of enthusiasm, in order for these women not to suffer in silence but to get better.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Wall Street has been anticipating this.  The stock has been up 60 percent so far this year, but it ended the day down more than 2.5 percent to $152.46.</p><p>General Mills (NYSE:GIS) increased prices, and it paid off.  The packaged food maker today reported higher margins, better-than-expected earnings and it is now forecasting improved profits for this fiscal year.  The company was also helped by lower costs.  Shares rose about 2 percent today to $48.29.</p><p>HERERA:  Nexstar will sell 19 TV stations for more than a billion dollars to Tegna and Scripps.  The divestitures follow the acquisition of Tribune Media by Nexstar which said it is in talks to sell two more stations in Indianapolis.  All three stocks fell.  Nexstar was off a fraction.  Tegna and EW Scripps were down close to 3 percent each.</p><p>Ford plans to build a new factory in Michigan for autonomous vehicles.  The new facility is expected to open in the necessary two years.  The move is part of the automaker`s plan to focus on its future line up of self-driving and electric cars.  The stock fell 2 percent to $8.51.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  President Trump traveled to Ohio today just days after pressuring General Motors (NYSE:GM) to reopen a plant in that state.  The automaker`s factory closed earlier this month and the town of Lordstown is feeling the impact.</p><p>Here`s Frank Holland.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>FRANK HOLLAND, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Outside of its now closed factory where General Motors (NYSE:GM) made the Chevy Cruze, a Shrine of Hope left by some of the thousands of workers who made their living here.</p><p>RYAN MCCABE, LAID OFF GM EMPLOYEE:  You just don`t replace these jobs.</p><p>HOLLAND:  Ryan McCabe, a husband and father of six, was laid off from the Lordstown, Ohio, plant, after 19 years.</p><p>MCCABE:  Your family has worked at General Motors (NYSE:GM), your family has retired from General Motors (NYSE:GM), and you`re the last one there.  Then, all of a sudden, it`s all gone.</p><p>HOLLAND:  GM closing this factory as it focuses more on trucks and SUVs.  Sales of the Cruze sedan falling by almost half over the past five years.  McCabe took these pictures of the last Cruze leaving the assembly line.  Now, he and thousands of other workers are searching for jobs at other GM factories.</p><p>MCCABE:  When General Motors (NYSE:GM) and Mary Barra tells us there`s all these opportunities for us to transfer, it comes across as so cold and calculated because I know they have kids, I know they have families.  How would they react in the same situation as us?</p><p>HOLLAND:  Lordstown is under reallocation and could reopen after September when GM and the union enter contract negotiations.</p><p>But President Trump, who visited Ohio today, wants answers now.  Tweeting over the weekend: I want jobs to stay in the USA and want Lordstown and one of the best economies in our history opened or sold to a company who will open it up fast.</p><p>MCCABE:  I`m glad he is supporting us and wants to help us.  I just wish he would come here and kind of see firsthand, instead of just making random tweets about it.</p><p>HOLLAND:  The reaction from others in town is mixed, especially after a 2017 speech where the president told local workers manufacturing jobs would be coming back.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I think it`s a little too late.  I think he should have been on the bandwagon when they first -- when they cut the other shifts and when they announced that they were going to cut this shift.</p><p>UNIDNETIFIED FEMALE:  I feel like it`s the company`s fault, not the president`s fault.</p><p>HOLLAND:  The closure of this plant is expected to have a $3 billion negative impact on this region this year.  But at the same time, manufacturing jobs here in Ohio have grown more than 2.5 percent since January of 2017.  Still, the fate of this factory and McCabe remains unclear.</p><p>MCCABE:  We don`t know if this is a temporary layoff or permanent layoff.  The whole unallocated status just kind of makes -- it makes it hard to gauge what to do, especially for people with families.</p><p>HOLLAND:  For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Frank Holland in Lordstown, Ohio.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  Coming up, companies are looking for the next big thing in gaming.  But are consumers willing to pay up?</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  There was a legal setback for German life sciences giant Bayer last night.  A second jury has ruled that its Roundup weed killer caused a man`s cancer.  Bayer denies the allegation, saying it was disappointed with the decision.  Bayer did acquire Monsanto (NYSE:MON) which makes Roundup for $63 billion last year.</p><p>HERERA:  We told you yesterday about Google`s big push into the growing video game market.  Today, other companies showed off their new innovative devices that they hope will be the next big thing in gaming.</p><p>Josh Lipton is in San Francisco tonight.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Great.  If you move your body around --</p><p>JOSH LIPTON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Some fans don`t just want to play video games, they want to feel like they`re inside the game itself.  That`s the appeal of virtual reality or VR, a totally immersive 360-degree experience.</p><p>Today, here at the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco, one of the biggest players, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB)-owned Oculus, introduced the Oculus Rift S.</p><p>NATE MITCHELL, FACEBOOK HEAD OF VR PRODUCTS:  Rift S features a much higher resolution display, which obviously makes the whole image a lot clearer and more immersive, and also features, you know, Oculus touch controllers, which give you a natural sense of real hand presence, being able to reach out and interact with the virtual world around you.</p><p>LIPTON:  It`s not just the big companies.  Startup magically sells so-called mixed reality goggles where the digital content is integrated into the real world.  For example, when I put on the goggles, I suddenly appeared like an old man to my fellow gamer, as we ran around the room and took shots at each other.</p><p>But for all the hype, this remains a relatively small market for now.  Analysts say only 6 percent of U.S. gamers own a virtual reality or augmented reality headset.</p><p>In part they say that`s because there still isn`t enough compelling content right now to motivate a lot of gamers to go out and buy this hardware.  And that`s partly because of the rising popularity of games that are free to play, like \"Fortnite\", made by Epic Games.  It boasts more than 200 million registered players, raking in almost $2.5 billion last year.</p><p>Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:ERTS) released rival game \"Apex Legends\" in early February.</p><p>Fifty million players signed up for that game in the title`s first month.</p><p>Analysts are watching Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:ERTS) closely.  If \"Apex Legends\" is a success, then other publishers, such as Activision may follow suit and more enthusiastically embrace that same free to play battle royale style.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Josh Lipton at San Francisco.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Finally tonight, it`s time for March Madness.  According to the American Gaming Association, nearly 50 million Americans are going to wager a collective $8.5 billion on the college basketball tournament.  This is the first March Madness, by the way, since the Supreme Court overturned that ruling that effectively outlawed sports betting in almost every state.</p><p>HERERA:  Here`s a look at the final numbers on Wall Street.  The Dow fell 141 points, Nasdaq rose 5, S&amp;P 500 down 8.</p><p>That will do it for NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT tonight.  I`m Sue Herera.  Thanks for joining us.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  I`m Bill Griffeth.

So, it was decision day for the Federal Reserve with a twist.  As expected, the Central Bank kept its benchmark interest rate unchanged.</p><p>What was not expected was a strong signal then that there will be no rate increases this year and maybe only one next year.  Investors breathed a sigh of relief immediately after that announcement was made.  The Dow recovered from a 200-point decline but words from President Trump today that U.S. tariffs against China may remain in place for a prolonged period, that took a toll.</p><p>And by the close, the Dow was down 141 points.  It closed at 25,745.  Nasdaq was still up five points.  The S&amp;P was down eight.</p><p>Steve Liesman has more on the Fed`s decision from Washington for us tonight.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>STEVE LIESMAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  The Federal Reserve in a series of major announcements after its March meeting kept interest rates on hold, downgraded its economic outlook and forecast no rate hikes in 2019.  The meeting of members of the committee had previously forecast two hikes this year.  They`re gone now.</p><p>The Fed also decided to stop reducing its balance sheet, that some of the market had said was hurting the economy and that would begin in September.  For a central bank that moves policy slowly, it was a rapid about-face for a forecast of strong growth and a rate hike as recently as December.</p><p>Despite the changes, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell maintained a positive outlook.</p><p>JEROME POWELL, FEDERAL RESERVE CHAIRMAN:  The data are not currently sending a signal that we need to move in one direction or another.</p><p>Committee members, participants generally see a growth of around 2 percent.  They see unemployment remaining below 4 percent.  They see inflation remaining close to target and they see growth, as I said, around 2 percent.</p><p>So that`s a positive outlook.  It`s a favorable outlook.</p><p>LIESMAN:  Still, the Fed downgraded its outlook for growth from 2.3 percent to 2.1 percent this year and Powell highlighted risks to the economy coming in part from global developments.</p><p>POWELL:  You see slowing global growth.  You still have -- there`s no resolution of Brexit.  There`s no resolution really of the trade talks.  These are ongoing risks.  We`re also carefully monitoring what`s happening with U.S. growth.  We called that out in our statement, that the limited data that we have do show a slowdown.</p><p>On the other hand, as I mentioned, we see the underlying economic fundamentals for growth this year as still very positive.</p><p>LIESMAN:  Finally, Powell noted that downward pressure on inflation is a major challenge for Fed and central banks around the world.  But overall, no hint from Powell about what the next move is up or down.  And he gave the clear impression today he doesn`t know either.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Steve Liesman in Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  Let`s turn now to Art Hogan for more analysis on the Fed, the economy and the market.  He is chief market strategist at National Securities.</p><p>Welcome back, Art.</p><p>ART HOGAN, CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST, NATIONAL SECURITIES:  Hi, Sue.  Thanks so much for having me.</p><p>HERERA:  You say this is a bold move.  I guess the question is, in your opinion, was it the right move?</p><p>HOGAN:  Well, it`s hard to say.  You know, it`s interesting.  The three things I think about here, I really feel like Jay Powell didn`t need to actually remove both of the dots for 2019.  Plenty more meetings in front of him that he could have done that, so that`s where it really gets bold.  So, that exceeded expectations.</p><p>But, you know, this is truly a Fed has made a pivot in January from being auto pilot hawkish in December to patient in January and now they`re even more patient.  So, what does this tell us?  It tells us the Fed is actually at neutral.  They`re literally at neutral.</p><p>And the next move could be a hike or a cut in interest rates.  My guess is the next move is a hike.  And I think that probably comes in the first part of 2020.</p><p>But right now, the Fed has reinforced the fact that they`re really patient and that`s probably a tailwind for the market.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  So what does the stock market do with that?  Clearly for Wall Street, no more hikes at least for the foreseeable future, that`s a good thing.  But they also downgrade the forecast on the economy.  That`s not such a good thing.</p><p>So where does the stock market go, do you think?</p><p>HOGAN:  Right, and I think you really would rather have the Fed tightening than cutting rates as their next move.  And that would mean the economic activity had picked back up.  So, you know, we know the first quarter is likely going to be slower than the fourth quarter of last year.  We hope that the second quarter picks up in activity.  We don`t know that yet.</p><p>And I think what Jay Powell was speaking to was that, oh, by the way, the global economy has slowed down and we have no resolution on both Brexit and the U.S./China trade war.  So, I think when we think about all of those things, if any of those things turn positive.  For example, if we get a U.S.-China trade deal, I think the economy picks up in the second and third quarter of this year.  There`s just a question of when that timing comes up.  The Fed may have to hike again, it may happen this year, but it`s just not in the cards.</p><p>HERERA:  So, as you look at the market as an investor, a longer term investor, how do you handicap this given the headline risk that you just outlined?</p><p>HOGAN:  Well, we need a trade behind us to think we can earn $170 for the S&amp;P 500 this year.  That`s what our base assumption is.  And if we don`t do that and if we escalate, then I certainly think that, you know, this market is pricey.</p><p>Our base case is we`re going to get that trade deal done.  Unfortunately, we`re going through that back and forth process right now, which seems like it`s the end of the process, not the beginning.  But I think getting a trade deal behind us, we think this market can move higher than we are right now.  We just need to get that in the rear-view mirror.</p><p>HERERA:  All right, Art.  We`ll leave it there.  Thank you.</p><p>HOGAN:  Thank you.</p><p>HERERA:  Art Hogan with National Securities.</p><p>European Union officials say they are willing to grant a short delay for Britain`s exit from the bloc but that delay comes with conditions.  They want parliament to approve the withdrawal plan that has already been rejected.  That increases uncertainty just days before the U.K. is scheduled to leave the E.U. on March 29th.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  And the European Union has ordered Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) to pay $1.7 billion for antitrust violations.  This is its third fines in a series of penalties.  The E.U. competition commissioner sys Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) abused its position in the online advertising market.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP</p><p>MARGRETHE VESTAGER, EUROPEAN COMMISSIONER FOR COMPETITION:  If you have a travel Website or a news Website and you want to sell the advertising space next to the search that you can do on your site, you need a broker.  And Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) is one of the absolute biggest brokers in this market, and they misused their dominant position to make sure that no rivals were able to compete in this market for advertising on new sites, on travel sites.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  In response, Google`s parent, Alphabet, said today it has already made changes to its products and that it plans to make additional updates as well.</p><p>HERERA:  The tech giant and others in the industry are also coming under pressure here in the U.S.  So what does that mean for the tech industry?</p><p>Ian Sherr is executive editor at CNET.  He joins us now to talk about that.</p><p>Ian, welcome.  Nice to have you here.</p><p>It seems as though Europe is taking the lead on all the talk about regulation of big tech and also possible breakup of big tech.  What do you think is going to play out on this country`s soil?</p><p>IAN SHERR, CNET EXECUTIVE EDITOR:  You know, it`s going to be really interesting.  I think there`s going to be an ongoing conversation on Capitol Hill where they try to understand the basics of how technology works.  We`ve learned they have a lot of education to go through.</p><p>I think at some point, there`s going to be a test, whether it`s an attempt to really see what a breakup of Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) or Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) could look like, and then to see what happens to the rest of the tech industry.  But there`s going to be a lot of pushback, and especially from the tech industry, who says, look, we`re getting all of this pressure and we don`t deserve it.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Here it has happened again.  It`s happened in the past.  Technology companies or companies on the cutting edge of some type of innovation get way out ahead of regulators and lawmakers.  It happened with AT&amp;T (NYSE:T), it happened with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and now it`s happening with a lot of these FANG stocks.</p><p>What`s your expectation not just for what the regulators and lawmakers are going to do, but what the companies, how they will respond?</p><p>SHERR:  Well, they need to get in front of this as much as they can, right?  There`s a lot of things that have been put out there.  I think that Senator Elizabeth Warren, who`s now a presidential candidate has caused a lot of conversation that probably would not have happened otherwise or taken a little longer by calling for a breakup of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).  So --</p><p>GRIFFETH:  But is there -- are there regulations or self regulation that these companies can come up with that would give them some space between the regulators and lawmakers so that they sort of tone down the rhetoric?</p><p>SHERR:  They could answer a lot of these concerns.  I mean, the thing is that right now, these companies are getting a lot of pressure from all sorts of places.  And they`re kind of responding to some of it, but the larger problems still remain.</p><p>You know, we`re still not convinced that the election interference that happened in 2016 won`t repeat.  We`re still not convinced that these companies are not acting monopolistically, and there`s still ongoing concerns that they are not protecting our data correctly.</p><p>And if they can`t answer those types of questions, they`re going to have a bad day at some point.</p><p>HERERA:  Yes, very quickly in the 30 seconds that we have left, if it indeed it came to the ultimate solution, which will be perhaps a breakup, wouldn`t that foster perhaps more innovation?  We have seen that in the past as well.</p><p>SHERR:  That`s definitely an argument, and I think that`s where you`re starting to see people like Senator Warren push toward, but that`s not a guarantee.  If we just break them up for the sake of breaking them up, we`re causing trouble in the economy.  We`re not actually being thoughtful.</p><p>That`s what`s important.  We need to be thoughtful if we`re ever going to go down that path.</p><p>HERERA:  All right.  Ian Sherr with CNET, thanks so much.</p><p>SHERR:  My pleasure.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  So, with all the talk about regulations and laws to rein in some of these tech giants, is Wall Street`s so-called FANG era coming to an end?  And if so, where does new leadership come from?</p><p>Mike Santoli is staying late for us tonight at the New York Stock Exchange to explore that.</p><p>And you actually don`t buy the notion that the FANG era is coming to a close?</p><p>MIKE SANTOLI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Well, I do, Bill, think it`s a little premature to say it`s coming to a close.  What we have seen, though, is a little fracturing of FANG.</p><p>What I mean by that is if you look at Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), to a lesser degree Google`s parent Alphabet, those stocks underperformed for a lot of last year.  Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) has had its valuation punished to some degree because of all these concerns.  But at the same time, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), these companies that are not really using your private data in a way to sell to advertisers but are selling a service that you are purchasing of your own free will and you wish to, they have actually performed better.</p><p>So there`s definitely been some rethinking about exactly how durable some of these business models are.</p><p>HERERA:  All right.  So, if indeed we do see action against some of these companies or regulations, where do you see new leadership kind of emerging?</p><p>SANTOLI:  You know, Sue, it`s very difficult to conceive of new leadership that is exactly as dominant as these companies, because I do think there`s an argument to be made that these businesses are in some sense, they tend toward natural monopolies.  They have these network effects that gives them power.  But I think they would probably, if they did get broken up or recede in the market`s favor, probably health care is the place to look -- whether it`s medical technology or health care services.</p><p>You`ve already seen it grow to a large portion of the overall market value of the S&amp;P 500.  So perhaps that is the way to go.  But we`ve gone long stretches of time in the market without a single dominant cohort of companies that was really driving returns.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  But going back to the FANGs for a moment here, you have to admit if there are to be regulations or some kind of a law, even if there`s a breakup, that is going to put a crimp on their profitability going forward, isn`t it?</p><p>SANTOLI:  No, I mean, I would completely agree with that.  Not only overt regulations or breakups or lawsuits, but also just the chilling effect it has on these companies` ambitions down the road, right?  Every one of these technology companies probably figures it has to maneuver for its next act, expand with new businesses, whether it`s self-driving cars or some other services.</p><p>And are they going to be permitted, for example, to make additional acquisitions the way Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) has done so well over the years or are they going to expand into those other areas aggressively.  Or would they be thwarted?  Those things I think very long term should be on investors` radars, just exactly how open-ended the growth prospects for a lot of these companies?</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Mike Santoli at the New York Stock Exchange -- thanks, Michael.</p><p>SANTOLI:  Thank you.</p><p>HERERA:  It is time to take a look at some of today`s \"Upgrades and Downgrades\".</p><p>FedEx (NYSE:FDX) was downgraded to neutral from overweight at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM).  The firm cites rising labor costs and potential pressure on operating margins.  As we reported, the company cut its full year profit outlook late yesterday.</p><p>The price target is $202.  The stock fell about 3.5 percent to $175.07.</p><p>Sony (NYSE:SNE) was downgraded to hold from buy at Jefferies.  The analyst cites concerns about a peak in game profits and Sony`s inability to exit the smartphone business.  The price target is $50.70.  The stock fell almost 5 percent to $43.28.</p><p>And Dollar Tree (NASDAQ:DLTR) was upgraded to outperform from market perform at Telsey Advisory Group.  The analyst there cites a recent meeting with management which increased his confidence in the company`s plan.  The price target is $117.  Shares rose a fraction to $101.35.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  And still ahead, and idled auto plant and the home town feeling the impact.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>FRANK HOLLAND, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  This Shrine of Hope has been built outside this now closed GM plant that has President Trump tweeting.  I`m Frank Holland, I`ll have local reaction to those tweets and the closure coming up on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  There are reports tonight that the FBI has now joined the criminal investigation into the certification process of the Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX.  As first reported by \"The Seattle Times,\" the FBI`s Seattle field office is now part of this investigation because of its close proximity to Boeing`s 737 manufacturing plant in Renton.  The investigation is being overseen by the Justice Department and carried out by the Transportation Department`s inspector general.</p><p>This latest report sent Boeing (NYSE:BA) stock initially lower in after-hours trading tonight.</p><p>HERERA:  Oil prices settled at a four-month high after hitting $60 for the first time since November.  Government data showed a sharp decline in oil and refine fuel inventories.  That sent the price of domestic crude higher, though it settled just below that $60 level.</p><p>GRIFETH:  Optimism among the nation`s CEOs is cooling off.  According to the latest survey from the business roundtable, chief executives are concerned about global economic growth.  CEOs now see the economies growing at 2.5 percent.  That would be this year and it`s slightly down from the earlier estimate.</p><p>HERERA:  The Disney (NYSE:DIS) and Fox merger is officially complete, and it could mark the beginning of a new era for Hollywood.  But integrating the two companies could prove challenging.</p><p>Julia Boorstin explains.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JULIA BOORSTIN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Disney (NYSE:DIS) has officially acquired Fox`s entertainment assets, including its movie and TV studio with its Avatar (NASDAQ:AVTR) and X-Men franchises, along with National Geographic and FX, plus Indian media giant Star, and an additional 30 percent stake in Hulu.</p><p>These assets building Disney (NYSE:DIS) into a behemoth with more content to stream direct to consumers to enable and to better complete with digital giants such as Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX).</p><p>JOEL KULINA, WEDBUSH:  It`s kind of roll the dice to see who`s going to come out.  It`s going to -- for everything to go seamless and everyone to be a winner, that`s probably a little unrealistic.  And we`ve seen Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), what they`ve done over the years is spend, spend, spend.</p><p>I mean, I think Disney (NYSE:DIS) and the likes of so many other players going to find out to compete with Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), it`s going to ding their profitability.</p><p>BOORSTIN:  Iger writing in a note to employees today: I wish I could tell you that the hardest part is behind us.  That closing the deal was the finish line rather than just the next milestone.  What lies ahead is the challenging work.</p><p>The challenge that lies ahead isn`t just about integrating the two companies but about the launch of Disney`s direct-to-consumer streaming service, Disney (NYSE:DIS) Plus, later this year.  It`s expected to include new, original exclusive content plus Disney`s library.</p><p>Disney (NYSE:DIS) will unveil the details of the new service which will feature its major brands such as \"Star Wars\" and Fox`s National Geographic at a preview day next month.</p><p>JOANNA COLES, FORMER HEARST CHIEF CONTENT OFFICER:  It remains to be seen if Gen Z, millennials, actually want to download something called Disney (NYSE:DIS) Plus.  Does that remind them of their childhood?  Do they like the idea of something more edgy?  Which is definitely what Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) provides.</p><p>BOORSTIN:  As Disney (NYSE:DIS) doubles down on on-demand content, the remainder of Fox is focused on live news and sports, spinning of as an independent company, focusing on its ability to drive ad revenue and cable retransmission fees for its timely content, looking to benefit from the political news cycle in sharp contrast to Disney`s more timeless content.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Julia Boorstin.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  The FDA approves the first postpartum depression drug.  That`s where we begin tonight`s \"Market Focus\".</p><p>Sage Therapeutics is the company that made the injectable drug called Zulresso that treats this condition.  It will only be available through a restricted program because there are concerns about risks, including excessive sedation or sudden loss of consciousness.  Two clinical studies, though, showed improved symptoms at the end of the first infusion.  And the CEO says that is key.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JEFF JONAS, SAGE THERAPEUTICS CEO:  When you think about what we potentially are offering -- rapid response, one-time therapy, getting women back home, you know, we don`t hear any resistance to that.  In fact, there`s a lot of enthusiasm, in order for these women not to suffer in silence but to get better.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Wall Street has been anticipating this.  The stock has been up 60 percent so far this year, but it ended the day down more than 2.5 percent to $152.46.</p><p>General Mills (NYSE:GIS) increased prices, and it paid off.  The packaged food maker today reported higher margins, better-than-expected earnings and it is now forecasting improved profits for this fiscal year.  The company was also helped by lower costs.  Shares rose about 2 percent today to $48.29.</p><p>HERERA:  Nexstar will sell 19 TV stations for more than a billion dollars to Tegna and Scripps.  The divestitures follow the acquisition of Tribune Media by Nexstar which said it is in talks to sell two more stations in Indianapolis.  All three stocks fell.  Nexstar was off a fraction.  Tegna and EW Scripps were down close to 3 percent each.</p><p>Ford plans to build a new factory in Michigan for autonomous vehicles.  The new facility is expected to open in the necessary two years.  The move is part of the automaker`s plan to focus on its future line up of self-driving and electric cars.  The stock fell 2 percent to $8.51.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  President Trump traveled to Ohio today just days after pressuring General Motors (NYSE:GM) to reopen a plant in that state.  The automaker`s factory closed earlier this month and the town of Lordstown is feeling the impact.</p><p>Here`s Frank Holland.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>FRANK HOLLAND, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Outside of its now closed factory where General Motors (NYSE:GM) made the Chevy Cruze, a Shrine of Hope left by some of the thousands of workers who made their living here.</p><p>RYAN MCCABE, LAID OFF GM EMPLOYEE:  You just don`t replace these jobs.</p><p>HOLLAND:  Ryan McCabe, a husband and father of six, was laid off from the Lordstown, Ohio, plant, after 19 years.</p><p>MCCABE:  Your family has worked at General Motors (NYSE:GM), your family has retired from General Motors (NYSE:GM), and you`re the last one there.  Then, all of a sudden, it`s all gone.</p><p>HOLLAND:  GM closing this factory as it focuses more on trucks and SUVs.  Sales of the Cruze sedan falling by almost half over the past five years.  McCabe took these pictures of the last Cruze leaving the assembly line.  Now, he and thousands of other workers are searching for jobs at other GM factories.</p><p>MCCABE:  When General Motors (NYSE:GM) and Mary Barra tells us there`s all these opportunities for us to transfer, it comes across as so cold and calculated because I know they have kids, I know they have families.  How would they react in the same situation as us?</p><p>HOLLAND:  Lordstown is under reallocation and could reopen after September when GM and the union enter contract negotiations.</p><p>But President Trump, who visited Ohio today, wants answers now.  Tweeting over the weekend: I want jobs to stay in the USA and want Lordstown and one of the best economies in our history opened or sold to a company who will open it up fast.</p><p>MCCABE:  I`m glad he is supporting us and wants to help us.  I just wish he would come here and kind of see firsthand, instead of just making random tweets about it.</p><p>HOLLAND:  The reaction from others in town is mixed, especially after a 2017 speech where the president told local workers manufacturing jobs would be coming back.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I think it`s a little too late.  I think he should have been on the bandwagon when they first -- when they cut the other shifts and when they announced that they were going to cut this shift.</p><p>UNIDNETIFIED FEMALE:  I feel like it`s the company`s fault, not the president`s fault.</p><p>HOLLAND:  The closure of this plant is expected to have a $3 billion negative impact on this region this year.  But at the same time, manufacturing jobs here in Ohio have grown more than 2.5 percent since January of 2017.  Still, the fate of this factory and McCabe remains unclear.</p><p>MCCABE:  We don`t know if this is a temporary layoff or permanent layoff.  The whole unallocated status just kind of makes -- it makes it hard to gauge what to do, especially for people with families.</p><p>HOLLAND:  For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Frank Holland in Lordstown, Ohio.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  Coming up, companies are looking for the next big thing in gaming.  But are consumers willing to pay up?</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  There was a legal setback for German life sciences giant Bayer last night.  A second jury has ruled that its Roundup weed killer caused a man`s cancer.  Bayer denies the allegation, saying it was disappointed with the decision.  Bayer did acquire Monsanto (NYSE:MON) which makes Roundup for $63 billion last year.</p><p>HERERA:  We told you yesterday about Google`s big push into the growing video game market.  Today, other companies showed off their new innovative devices that they hope will be the next big thing in gaming.</p><p>Josh Lipton is in San Francisco tonight.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Great.  If you move your body around --</p><p>JOSH LIPTON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Some fans don`t just want to play video games, they want to feel like they`re inside the game itself.  That`s the appeal of virtual reality or VR, a totally immersive 360-degree experience.</p><p>Today, here at the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco, one of the biggest players, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB)-owned Oculus, introduced the Oculus Rift S.</p><p>NATE MITCHELL, FACEBOOK HEAD OF VR PRODUCTS:  Rift S features a much higher resolution display, which obviously makes the whole image a lot clearer and more immersive, and also features, you know, Oculus touch controllers, which give you a natural sense of real hand presence, being able to reach out and interact with the virtual world around you.</p><p>LIPTON:  It`s not just the big companies.  Startup magically sells so-called mixed reality goggles where the digital content is integrated into the real world.  For example, when I put on the goggles, I suddenly appeared like an old man to my fellow gamer, as we ran around the room and took shots at each other.</p><p>But for all the hype, this remains a relatively small market for now.  Analysts say only 6 percent of U.S. gamers own a virtual reality or augmented reality headset.</p><p>In part they say that`s because there still isn`t enough compelling content right now to motivate a lot of gamers to go out and buy this hardware.  And that`s partly because of the rising popularity of games that are free to play, like \"Fortnite\", made by Epic Games.  It boasts more than 200 million registered players, raking in almost $2.5 billion last year.</p><p>Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:ERTS) released rival game \"Apex Legends\" in early February.</p><p>Fifty million players signed up for that game in the title`s first month.</p><p>Analysts are watching Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:ERTS) closely.  If \"Apex Legends\" is a success, then other publishers, such as Activision may follow suit and more enthusiastically embrace that same free to play battle royale style.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Josh Lipton at San Francisco.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Finally tonight, it`s time for March Madness.  According to the American Gaming Association, nearly 50 million Americans are going to wager a collective $8.5 billion on the college basketball tournament.  This is the first March Madness, by the way, since the Supreme Court overturned that ruling that effectively outlawed sports betting in almost every state.</p><p>HERERA:  Here`s a look at the final numbers on Wall Street.  The Dow fell 141 points, Nasdaq rose 5, S&amp;P 500 down 8.</p><p>That will do it for NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT tonight.  I`m Sue Herera.  Thanks for joining us.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  I`m Bill Griffeth.

The Fed signals it may not make any moves on interest rates this year, cutting its forecast from two hikes to none.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">BILL GRIFFETH, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR:  Antitrust fine.  The European Union goes after Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), just the latest regulator to turn up the heat on big tech.  Is this the price they pay for success?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">HERERA:  Done deal.  Disney (NYSE:DIS) closes its blockbuster $71 billion purchase of Fox and now, the hard work begins.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Those stories and more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Wednesday, March 28th.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  And we do bid you a good evening, everybody, and welcome.  So, it was decision day for the Federal Reserve with a twist.  As expected, the Central Bank kept its benchmark interest rate unchanged.</p><p>What was not expected was a strong signal then that there will be no rate increases this year and maybe only one next year.  Investors breathed a sigh of relief immediately after that announcement was made.  The Dow recovered from a 200-point decline but words from President Trump today that U.S. tariffs against China may remain in place for a prolonged period, that took a toll.</p><p>And by the close, the Dow was down 141 points.  It closed at 25,745.  Nasdaq was still up five points.  The S&amp;P was down eight.</p><p>Steve Liesman has more on the Fed`s decision from Washington for us tonight.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>STEVE LIESMAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  The Federal Reserve in a series of major announcements after its March meeting kept interest rates on hold, downgraded its economic outlook and forecast no rate hikes in 2019.  The meeting of members of the committee had previously forecast two hikes this year.  They`re gone now.</p><p>The Fed also decided to stop reducing its balance sheet, that some of the market had said was hurting the economy and that would begin in September.  For a central bank that moves policy slowly, it was a rapid about-face for a forecast of strong growth and a rate hike as recently as December.</p><p>Despite the changes, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell maintained a positive outlook.</p><p>JEROME POWELL, FEDERAL RESERVE CHAIRMAN:  The data are not currently sending a signal that we need to move in one direction or another.</p><p>Committee members, participants generally see a growth of around 2 percent.  They see unemployment remaining below 4 percent.  They see inflation remaining close to target and they see growth, as I said, around 2 percent.</p><p>So that`s a positive outlook.  It`s a favorable outlook.</p><p>LIESMAN:  Still, the Fed downgraded its outlook for growth from 2.3 percent to 2.1 percent this year and Powell highlighted risks to the economy coming in part from global developments.</p><p>POWELL:  You see slowing global growth.  You still have -- there`s no resolution of Brexit.  There`s no resolution really of the trade talks.  These are ongoing risks.  We`re also carefully monitoring what`s happening with U.S. growth.  We called that out in our statement, that the limited data that we have do show a slowdown.</p><p>On the other hand, as I mentioned, we see the underlying economic fundamentals for growth this year as still very positive.</p><p>LIESMAN:  Finally, Powell noted that downward pressure on inflation is a major challenge for Fed and central banks around the world.  But overall, no hint from Powell about what the next move is up or down.  And he gave the clear impression today he doesn`t know either.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Steve Liesman in Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  Let`s turn now to Art Hogan for more analysis on the Fed, the economy and the market.  He is chief market strategist at National Securities.</p><p>Welcome back, Art.</p><p>ART HOGAN, CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST, NATIONAL SECURITIES:  Hi, Sue.  Thanks so much for having me.</p><p>HERERA:  You say this is a bold move.  I guess the question is, in your opinion, was it the right move?</p><p>HOGAN:  Well, it`s hard to say.  You know, it`s interesting.  The three things I think about here, I really feel like Jay Powell didn`t need to actually remove both of the dots for 2019.  Plenty more meetings in front of him that he could have done that, so that`s where it really gets bold.  So, that exceeded expectations.</p><p>But, you know, this is truly a Fed has made a pivot in January from being auto pilot hawkish in December to patient in January and now they`re even more patient.  So, what does this tell us?  It tells us the Fed is actually at neutral.  They`re literally at neutral.</p><p>And the next move could be a hike or a cut in interest rates.  My guess is the next move is a hike.  And I think that probably comes in the first part of 2020.</p><p>But right now, the Fed has reinforced the fact that they`re really patient and that`s probably a tailwind for the market.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  So what does the stock market do with that?  Clearly for Wall Street, no more hikes at least for the foreseeable future, that`s a good thing.  But they also downgrade the forecast on the economy.  That`s not such a good thing.</p><p>So where does the stock market go, do you think?</p><p>HOGAN:  Right, and I think you really would rather have the Fed tightening than cutting rates as their next move.  And that would mean the economic activity had picked back up.  So, you know, we know the first quarter is likely going to be slower than the fourth quarter of last year.  We hope that the second quarter picks up in activity.  We don`t know that yet.</p><p>And I think what Jay Powell was speaking to was that, oh, by the way, the global economy has slowed down and we have no resolution on both Brexit and the U.S./China trade war.  So, I think when we think about all of those things, if any of those things turn positive.  For example, if we get a U.S.-China trade deal, I think the economy picks up in the second and third quarter of this year.  There`s just a question of when that timing comes up.  The Fed may have to hike again, it may happen this year, but it`s just not in the cards.</p><p>HERERA:  So, as you look at the market as an investor, a longer term investor, how do you handicap this given the headline risk that you just outlined?</p><p>HOGAN:  Well, we need a trade behind us to think we can earn $170 for the S&amp;P 500 this year.  That`s what our base assumption is.  And if we don`t do that and if we escalate, then I certainly think that, you know, this market is pricey.</p><p>Our base case is we`re going to get that trade deal done.  Unfortunately, we`re going through that back and forth process right now, which seems like it`s the end of the process, not the beginning.  But I think getting a trade deal behind us, we think this market can move higher than we are right now.  We just need to get that in the rear-view mirror.</p><p>HERERA:  All right, Art.  We`ll leave it there.  Thank you.</p><p>HOGAN:  Thank you.</p><p>HERERA:  Art Hogan with National Securities.</p><p>European Union officials say they are willing to grant a short delay for Britain`s exit from the bloc but that delay comes with conditions.  They want parliament to approve the withdrawal plan that has already been rejected.  That increases uncertainty just days before the U.K. is scheduled to leave the E.U. on March 29th.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  And the European Union has ordered Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) to pay $1.7 billion for antitrust violations.  This is its third fines in a series of penalties.  The E.U. competition commissioner sys Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) abused its position in the online advertising market.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP</p><p>MARGRETHE VESTAGER, EUROPEAN COMMISSIONER FOR COMPETITION:  If you have a travel Website or a news Website and you want to sell the advertising space next to the search that you can do on your site, you need a broker.  And Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) is one of the absolute biggest brokers in this market, and they misused their dominant position to make sure that no rivals were able to compete in this market for advertising on new sites, on travel sites.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  In response, Google`s parent, Alphabet, said today it has already made changes to its products and that it plans to make additional updates as well.</p><p>HERERA:  The tech giant and others in the industry are also coming under pressure here in the U.S.  So what does that mean for the tech industry?</p><p>Ian Sherr is executive editor at CNET.  He joins us now to talk about that.</p><p>Ian, welcome.  Nice to have you here.</p><p>It seems as though Europe is taking the lead on all the talk about regulation of big tech and also possible breakup of big tech.  What do you think is going to play out on this country`s soil?</p><p>IAN SHERR, CNET EXECUTIVE EDITOR:  You know, it`s going to be really interesting.  I think there`s going to be an ongoing conversation on Capitol Hill where they try to understand the basics of how technology works.  We`ve learned they have a lot of education to go through.</p><p>I think at some point, there`s going to be a test, whether it`s an attempt to really see what a breakup of Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) or Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) could look like, and then to see what happens to the rest of the tech industry.  But there`s going to be a lot of pushback, and especially from the tech industry, who says, look, we`re getting all of this pressure and we don`t deserve it.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Here it has happened again.  It`s happened in the past.  Technology companies or companies on the cutting edge of some type of innovation get way out ahead of regulators and lawmakers.  It happened with AT&amp;T (NYSE:T), it happened with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and now it`s happening with a lot of these FANG stocks.</p><p>What`s your expectation not just for what the regulators and lawmakers are going to do, but what the companies, how they will respond?</p><p>SHERR:  Well, they need to get in front of this as much as they can, right?  There`s a lot of things that have been put out there.  I think that Senator Elizabeth Warren, who`s now a presidential candidate has caused a lot of conversation that probably would not have happened otherwise or taken a little longer by calling for a breakup of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).  So --</p><p>GRIFFETH:  But is there -- are there regulations or self regulation that these companies can come up with that would give them some space between the regulators and lawmakers so that they sort of tone down the rhetoric?</p><p>SHERR:  They could answer a lot of these concerns.  I mean, the thing is that right now, these companies are getting a lot of pressure from all sorts of places.  And they`re kind of responding to some of it, but the larger problems still remain.</p><p>You know, we`re still not convinced that the election interference that happened in 2016 won`t repeat.  We`re still not convinced that these companies are not acting monopolistically, and there`s still ongoing concerns that they are not protecting our data correctly.</p><p>And if they can`t answer those types of questions, they`re going to have a bad day at some point.</p><p>HERERA:  Yes, very quickly in the 30 seconds that we have left, if it indeed it came to the ultimate solution, which will be perhaps a breakup, wouldn`t that foster perhaps more innovation?  We have seen that in the past as well.</p><p>SHERR:  That`s definitely an argument, and I think that`s where you`re starting to see people like Senator Warren push toward, but that`s not a guarantee.  If we just break them up for the sake of breaking them up, we`re causing trouble in the economy.  We`re not actually being thoughtful.</p><p>That`s what`s important.  We need to be thoughtful if we`re ever going to go down that path.</p><p>HERERA:  All right.  Ian Sherr with CNET, thanks so much.</p><p>SHERR:  My pleasure.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  So, with all the talk about regulations and laws to rein in some of these tech giants, is Wall Street`s so-called FANG era coming to an end?  And if so, where does new leadership come from?</p><p>Mike Santoli is staying late for us tonight at the New York Stock Exchange to explore that.</p><p>And you actually don`t buy the notion that the FANG era is coming to a close?</p><p>MIKE SANTOLI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Well, I do, Bill, think it`s a little premature to say it`s coming to a close.  What we have seen, though, is a little fracturing of FANG.</p><p>What I mean by that is if you look at Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), to a lesser degree Google`s parent Alphabet, those stocks underperformed for a lot of last year.  Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) has had its valuation punished to some degree because of all these concerns.  But at the same time, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), these companies that are not really using your private data in a way to sell to advertisers but are selling a service that you are purchasing of your own free will and you wish to, they have actually performed better.</p><p>So there`s definitely been some rethinking about exactly how durable some of these business models are.</p><p>HERERA:  All right.  So, if indeed we do see action against some of these companies or regulations, where do you see new leadership kind of emerging?</p><p>SANTOLI:  You know, Sue, it`s very difficult to conceive of new leadership that is exactly as dominant as these companies, because I do think there`s an argument to be made that these businesses are in some sense, they tend toward natural monopolies.  They have these network effects that gives them power.  But I think they would probably, if they did get broken up or recede in the market`s favor, probably health care is the place to look -- whether it`s medical technology or health care services.</p><p>You`ve already seen it grow to a large portion of the overall market value of the S&amp;P 500.  So perhaps that is the way to go.  But we`ve gone long stretches of time in the market without a single dominant cohort of companies that was really driving returns.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  But going back to the FANGs for a moment here, you have to admit if there are to be regulations or some kind of a law, even if there`s a breakup, that is going to put a crimp on their profitability going forward, isn`t it?</p><p>SANTOLI:  No, I mean, I would completely agree with that.  Not only overt regulations or breakups or lawsuits, but also just the chilling effect it has on these companies` ambitions down the road, right?  Every one of these technology companies probably figures it has to maneuver for its next act, expand with new businesses, whether it`s self-driving cars or some other services.</p><p>And are they going to be permitted, for example, to make additional acquisitions the way Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) has done so well over the years or are they going to expand into those other areas aggressively.  Or would they be thwarted?  Those things I think very long term should be on investors` radars, just exactly how open-ended the growth prospects for a lot of these companies?</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Mike Santoli at the New York Stock Exchange -- thanks, Michael.</p><p>SANTOLI:  Thank you.</p><p>HERERA:  It is time to take a look at some of today`s \"Upgrades and Downgrades\".</p><p>FedEx (NYSE:FDX) was downgraded to neutral from overweight at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM).  The firm cites rising labor costs and potential pressure on operating margins.  As we reported, the company cut its full year profit outlook late yesterday.</p><p>The price target is $202.  The stock fell about 3.5 percent to $175.07.</p><p>Sony (NYSE:SNE) was downgraded to hold from buy at Jefferies.  The analyst cites concerns about a peak in game profits and Sony`s inability to exit the smartphone business.  The price target is $50.70.  The stock fell almost 5 percent to $43.28.</p><p>And Dollar Tree (NASDAQ:DLTR) was upgraded to outperform from market perform at Telsey Advisory Group.  The analyst there cites a recent meeting with management which increased his confidence in the company`s plan.  The price target is $117.  Shares rose a fraction to $101.35.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  And still ahead, and idled auto plant and the home town feeling the impact.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>FRANK HOLLAND, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  This Shrine of Hope has been built outside this now closed GM plant that has President Trump tweeting.  I`m Frank Holland, I`ll have local reaction to those tweets and the closure coming up on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  There are reports tonight that the FBI has now joined the criminal investigation into the certification process of the Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX.  As first reported by \"The Seattle Times,\" the FBI`s Seattle field office is now part of this investigation because of its close proximity to Boeing`s 737 manufacturing plant in Renton.  The investigation is being overseen by the Justice Department and carried out by the Transportation Department`s inspector general.</p><p>This latest report sent Boeing (NYSE:BA) stock initially lower in after-hours trading tonight.</p><p>HERERA:  Oil prices settled at a four-month high after hitting $60 for the first time since November.  Government data showed a sharp decline in oil and refine fuel inventories.  That sent the price of domestic crude higher, though it settled just below that $60 level.</p><p>GRIFETH:  Optimism among the nation`s CEOs is cooling off.  According to the latest survey from the business roundtable, chief executives are concerned about global economic growth.  CEOs now see the economies growing at 2.5 percent.  That would be this year and it`s slightly down from the earlier estimate.</p><p>HERERA:  The Disney (NYSE:DIS) and Fox merger is officially complete, and it could mark the beginning of a new era for Hollywood.  But integrating the two companies could prove challenging.</p><p>Julia Boorstin explains.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JULIA BOORSTIN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Disney (NYSE:DIS) has officially acquired Fox`s entertainment assets, including its movie and TV studio with its Avatar (NASDAQ:AVTR) and X-Men franchises, along with National Geographic and FX, plus Indian media giant Star, and an additional 30 percent stake in Hulu.</p><p>These assets building Disney (NYSE:DIS) into a behemoth with more content to stream direct to consumers to enable and to better complete with digital giants such as Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX).</p><p>JOEL KULINA, WEDBUSH:  It`s kind of roll the dice to see who`s going to come out.  It`s going to -- for everything to go seamless and everyone to be a winner, that`s probably a little unrealistic.  And we`ve seen Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), what they`ve done over the years is spend, spend, spend.</p><p>I mean, I think Disney (NYSE:DIS) and the likes of so many other players going to find out to compete with Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), it`s going to ding their profitability.</p><p>BOORSTIN:  Iger writing in a note to employees today: I wish I could tell you that the hardest part is behind us.  That closing the deal was the finish line rather than just the next milestone.  What lies ahead is the challenging work.</p><p>The challenge that lies ahead isn`t just about integrating the two companies but about the launch of Disney`s direct-to-consumer streaming service, Disney (NYSE:DIS) Plus, later this year.  It`s expected to include new, original exclusive content plus Disney`s library.</p><p>Disney (NYSE:DIS) will unveil the details of the new service which will feature its major brands such as \"Star Wars\" and Fox`s National Geographic at a preview day next month.</p><p>JOANNA COLES, FORMER HEARST CHIEF CONTENT OFFICER:  It remains to be seen if Gen Z, millennials, actually want to download something called Disney (NYSE:DIS) Plus.  Does that remind them of their childhood?  Do they like the idea of something more edgy?  Which is definitely what Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) provides.</p><p>BOORSTIN:  As Disney (NYSE:DIS) doubles down on on-demand content, the remainder of Fox is focused on live news and sports, spinning of as an independent company, focusing on its ability to drive ad revenue and cable retransmission fees for its timely content, looking to benefit from the political news cycle in sharp contrast to Disney`s more timeless content.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Julia Boorstin.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  The FDA approves the first postpartum depression drug.  That`s where we begin tonight`s \"Market Focus\".</p><p>Sage Therapeutics is the company that made the injectable drug called Zulresso that treats this condition.  It will only be available through a restricted program because there are concerns about risks, including excessive sedation or sudden loss of consciousness.  Two clinical studies, though, showed improved symptoms at the end of the first infusion.  And the CEO says that is key.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JEFF JONAS, SAGE THERAPEUTICS CEO:  When you think about what we potentially are offering -- rapid response, one-time therapy, getting women back home, you know, we don`t hear any resistance to that.  In fact, there`s a lot of enthusiasm, in order for these women not to suffer in silence but to get better.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Wall Street has been anticipating this.  The stock has been up 60 percent so far this year, but it ended the day down more than 2.5 percent to $152.46.</p><p>General Mills (NYSE:GIS) increased prices, and it paid off.  The packaged food maker today reported higher margins, better-than-expected earnings and it is now forecasting improved profits for this fiscal year.  The company was also helped by lower costs.  Shares rose about 2 percent today to $48.29.</p><p>HERERA:  Nexstar will sell 19 TV stations for more than a billion dollars to Tegna and Scripps.  The divestitures follow the acquisition of Tribune Media by Nexstar which said it is in talks to sell two more stations in Indianapolis.  All three stocks fell.  Nexstar was off a fraction.  Tegna and EW Scripps were down close to 3 percent each.</p><p>Ford plans to build a new factory in Michigan for autonomous vehicles.  The new facility is expected to open in the necessary two years.  The move is part of the automaker`s plan to focus on its future line up of self-driving and electric cars.  The stock fell 2 percent to $8.51.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  President Trump traveled to Ohio today just days after pressuring General Motors (NYSE:GM) to reopen a plant in that state.  The automaker`s factory closed earlier this month and the town of Lordstown is feeling the impact.</p><p>Here`s Frank Holland.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>FRANK HOLLAND, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Outside of its now closed factory where General Motors (NYSE:GM) made the Chevy Cruze, a Shrine of Hope left by some of the thousands of workers who made their living here.</p><p>RYAN MCCABE, LAID OFF GM EMPLOYEE:  You just don`t replace these jobs.</p><p>HOLLAND:  Ryan McCabe, a husband and father of six, was laid off from the Lordstown, Ohio, plant, after 19 years.</p><p>MCCABE:  Your family has worked at General Motors (NYSE:GM), your family has retired from General Motors (NYSE:GM), and you`re the last one there.  Then, all of a sudden, it`s all gone.</p><p>HOLLAND:  GM closing this factory as it focuses more on trucks and SUVs.  Sales of the Cruze sedan falling by almost half over the past five years.  McCabe took these pictures of the last Cruze leaving the assembly line.  Now, he and thousands of other workers are searching for jobs at other GM factories.</p><p>MCCABE:  When General Motors (NYSE:GM) and Mary Barra tells us there`s all these opportunities for us to transfer, it comes across as so cold and calculated because I know they have kids, I know they have families.  How would they react in the same situation as us?</p><p>HOLLAND:  Lordstown is under reallocation and could reopen after September when GM and the union enter contract negotiations.</p><p>But President Trump, who visited Ohio today, wants answers now.  Tweeting over the weekend: I want jobs to stay in the USA and want Lordstown and one of the best economies in our history opened or sold to a company who will open it up fast.</p><p>MCCABE:  I`m glad he is supporting us and wants to help us.  I just wish he would come here and kind of see firsthand, instead of just making random tweets about it.</p><p>HOLLAND:  The reaction from others in town is mixed, especially after a 2017 speech where the president told local workers manufacturing jobs would be coming back.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I think it`s a little too late.  I think he should have been on the bandwagon when they first -- when they cut the other shifts and when they announced that they were going to cut this shift.</p><p>UNIDNETIFIED FEMALE:  I feel like it`s the company`s fault, not the president`s fault.</p><p>HOLLAND:  The closure of this plant is expected to have a $3 billion negative impact on this region this year.  But at the same time, manufacturing jobs here in Ohio have grown more than 2.5 percent since January of 2017.  Still, the fate of this factory and McCabe remains unclear.</p><p>MCCABE:  We don`t know if this is a temporary layoff or permanent layoff.  The whole unallocated status just kind of makes -- it makes it hard to gauge what to do, especially for people with families.</p><p>HOLLAND:  For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Frank Holland in Lordstown, Ohio.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  Coming up, companies are looking for the next big thing in gaming.  But are consumers willing to pay up?</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  There was a legal setback for German life sciences giant Bayer last night.  A second jury has ruled that its Roundup weed killer caused a man`s cancer.  Bayer denies the allegation, saying it was disappointed with the decision.  Bayer did acquire Monsanto (NYSE:MON) which makes Roundup for $63 billion last year.</p><p>HERERA:  We told you yesterday about Google`s big push into the growing video game market.  Today, other companies showed off their new innovative devices that they hope will be the next big thing in gaming.</p><p>Josh Lipton is in San Francisco tonight.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Great.  If you move your body around --</p><p>JOSH LIPTON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Some fans don`t just want to play video games, they want to feel like they`re inside the game itself.  That`s the appeal of virtual reality or VR, a totally immersive 360-degree experience.</p><p>Today, here at the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco, one of the biggest players, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB)-owned Oculus, introduced the Oculus Rift S.</p><p>NATE MITCHELL, FACEBOOK HEAD OF VR PRODUCTS:  Rift S features a much higher resolution display, which obviously makes the whole image a lot clearer and more immersive, and also features, you know, Oculus touch controllers, which give you a natural sense of real hand presence, being able to reach out and interact with the virtual world around you.</p><p>LIPTON:  It`s not just the big companies.  Startup magically sells so-called mixed reality goggles where the digital content is integrated into the real world.  For example, when I put on the goggles, I suddenly appeared like an old man to my fellow gamer, as we ran around the room and took shots at each other.</p><p>But for all the hype, this remains a relatively small market for now.  Analysts say only 6 percent of U.S. gamers own a virtual reality or augmented reality headset.</p><p>In part they say that`s because there still isn`t enough compelling content right now to motivate a lot of gamers to go out and buy this hardware.  And that`s partly because of the rising popularity of games that are free to play, like \"Fortnite\", made by Epic Games.  It boasts more than 200 million registered players, raking in almost $2.5 billion last year.</p><p>Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:ERTS) released rival game \"Apex Legends\" in early February.</p><p>Fifty million players signed up for that game in the title`s first month.</p><p>Analysts are watching Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:ERTS) closely.  If \"Apex Legends\" is a success, then other publishers, such as Activision may follow suit and more enthusiastically embrace that same free to play battle royale style.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Josh Lipton at San Francisco.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Finally tonight, it`s time for March Madness.  According to the American Gaming Association, nearly 50 million Americans are going to wager a collective $8.5 billion on the college basketball tournament.  This is the first March Madness, by the way, since the Supreme Court overturned that ruling that effectively outlawed sports betting in almost every state.</p><p>HERERA:  Here`s a look at the final numbers on Wall Street.  The Dow fell 141 points, Nasdaq rose 5, S&amp;P 500 down 8.</p><p>That will do it for NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT tonight.  I`m Sue Herera.  Thanks for joining us.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  I`m Bill Griffeth.

But is the next step regulation?  </p><p> Those stories and more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for this  Thursday, March the 22nd.  </p><p> HERERA:  Good evening, everyone, and welcome.  </p><p> A sell off on Wall Street.  All 30 Dow components closed lower, about two- thirds of the stocks in that index fell more than 1 percent today.  Half of  the S&amp;P 500 is now in correction territory.  </p><p> Investors became unnerved after the White House unveiled a new round of  tariffs that some fear could threaten the trade war with China, the world's  second largest economy.  So, by the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average  had plunged 724 points to 23,957, a nearly 3 percent decline.  The Nasdaq  fell 178.  And the S&amp;P 500 lost 68.  </p><p> The biggest losers on the Dow were the major industrials like Caterpillar,  Boeing, and 3M.  </p><p> Bob Pisani reports tonight on that selloff from the New York Stock  Exchange.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> BOB PISANI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Stocks closed right  around their worst levels of the session with the Dow down more than 700  points.  That's right, 700 points.  </p><p> The markets are clearly concerned about two things.  Number one,  technology.  And number two, trade.  Two big issues.  </p><p> President Donald Trump announced he would be imposing tariffs of up to $60  billion on Chinese goods over the next few weeks.  No details on which  products will be taxed by how much yet.  But he did say there would be a  30-day grace period to negotiate those terms.  </p><p> Shares of U.S. and other metals and mining stocks got slammed on news that  Trump will be exempting a handful of allies from steel and aluminum  tariffs, including the European Unions, South Korea and Brazil.  In fact,  U.S. steel is down 20 percent since those tariffs were first announced a  few weeks ago.  It looks like they are not as tough as some people thought  they might be.</p><p> Facebook is facing an existential crisis right now.  In fact, the whole  social media group is.  And that's weighing heavily on all the other social  media stocks.  The stock market has lost its team leadership group,  technology, and social media is part of that.  And there's really nothing  taking its place.  The subsectors that powered tech high, which were  semiconductors and the FANG names, your Facebook, your Apples, and your  Amazons, they stopped advancing and in most cases, they reversed.  </p><p> So, once those FANG and semiconductor stocks stopped going up in the second  week of March, the market stalled out because no other sector has stepped  forward to lead the market higher.  Industrials and materials are suffering  from these trade war concerns.  FANGs can't move higher without the help of  higher volume.  That's not happening.  </p><p> On top of that, drama in Washington is still on the front burner.  Stocks  did fall earlier on word in a John Dowd, President Trump's lead lawyer in  the Russia probe had resigned.  </p><p> For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Bob Pisani at the New York Stock Exchange.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> GRIFFETH:  Mike Santoli is also at the New York Stock Exchange.  He joins  us tonight with some more insights on this decline.</p><p> I think you were the one who coined the term tariff tantrum.  Is that -- is  that all we saw today, or was there more going on, do you think?  </p><p> MIKE SANTOLI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  I don't take the  blame or the credit for that one.</p><p> Yes, I don't think it was all we were seeing today but I think that was the  added element this morning, right at the outset, that came upon a market  that also was already concerned about this general notion that interest  rates are going up, this Fed is looking for opportunities to bring rates  higher if they can, if the economic data allow for that.  And then, you  know, as Bob was saying, the loss of leadership from the big tech group,  which a lot of investors I think were hiding in because it seems seemed  like they could grow in almost any environment.  </p><p> But the tariff issue is a reminder that policy across a bunch of fronts,  whether it is trade or monetary policy have turned a little bit less  friendly than we got used to last year.  </p><p> HERERA:  The volume, though, Mike.  I mean, it didn't seem like they were  just throwing stocks out the window today.  Was that mostly the  professionals who were selling?  </p><p> SANTOLI:  Interesting.  No, you are absolutely right, Sue.  It was not a  feeling of panic.  It was not this mass liquidation of stocks.  As a matter  of fact, a couple of folks are pointing out that small cap stocks had  outperformed the large cap indexes.  </p><p> So, the more domestically focused businesses seemed like they were not  caught up in this selloff quite much.  The volumes weren't that high.  The  volatility index definitely got up there, but not at levels we saw in early  February.  So, it was a somewhat lower intensity selloff than what we did  see in early February.  </p><p> Whether that something that means that folks are more likely to buy it at  this level or not is not clear, but it definitely was not indiscriminate.</p><p> GRIFFETH:  Mike Santoli at the New York Stock Exchange for us tonight --  thanks, Mike.  </p><p> SANTOLI:  Thank you.</p><p> HERERA:  So, as we mentioned, the president did announce his toughest trade  action to date.  And as Kayla Tausche reports from Washington, there are  fears of more to come.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> KAYLA TAUSCHE, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  President Trump  signed an order that paved the way for steep tariffs on a wide range of  Chinese imports.  The move marks the end of its seven-month investigation  into Chinese tactics to challenge U.S. technology dominance.  </p><p>TRUMP:  We have a tremendous intellectual property situation going on.  So,  we're going to get it taken care of.  And frankly, it's going to make us a  much stronger, much richer nation.  </p><p> TAUSCHE:  The action comes as the U.S. is imposing tariffs on all imports  of steel and aluminum with certain allies and products exempted, and on top  of tariffs on Chinese made solar panels.  U.S. exporters including soybean  farmers, pork producers, and aircraft maker Boeing are bracing for a  counter-punch from China, which says it will take all necessary measures to  safeguard its interests.  </p><p>U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer told lawmakers that kind of  retaliation is unfair but doesn't change things.  </p><p> ROBERT LIGHTHIZER, U.S. TRADE REPRESENTATIVE:  It's not possible to take  the position that because we are soybean farmers, we're not going to stick  up for our rights in a whole variety of ways and have hundreds of billions  of dollars worth of exporters and domestic producers be punished because of  unfair trade.  </p><p> TAUSCHE:  There CEO of engine maker Cummins, Tom Linebarger, fears the  administration's approach is leading to a trade war.  </p><p> TOM LINEBARGER, CEO CUMMINS:  We agree there are challenges in China.  We  just want to address it in a different way, a way that's proven effective  over many, many decades, as opposed to unilateral tariffs which have always  proven ineffective.  </p><p> TAUSCHE:  But Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross says those fears are  overblown.  </p><p> WILBUR ROSS, COMMERCE SECRETARY:  I think there will be some ultimate  retaliation, but I don't think it's going to be the end of the earth.   There may be some firing shots over the bow.  But I believe at the end of  the day, this will end up in a negotiated settlement.  </p><p> TAUSCHE:  A senior administration official tells me this is just the  kickoff to a set of multiple penalties against China and that further  actions, namely restrictions on Chinese investments in the United States,  could be unveiled in the coming days.  </p><p> For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Kayla Tausche in Washington.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> GRIFFETH:  And joining us right now to talk more about the new tariffs and  the impact they could have on the markets and the economy, joining us  tonight, Art Hogan.  He's chief market strategist with B. Riley FBR.  And  Josh Feinman is global chief economist at Deutsche Asset Management.  </p><p> Good to see you both.  </p><p> JOSHUA FEINMAN, DEUTSCHE ASSET MANAGEMENT GLOBAL CHIEF ECONOMIST:  Good to  be here.  </p><p> GRIFFETH:  Art, how do you -- do you step aside and let things clear out or  do you see opportunities already presenting themselves as a result of these  tariffs being imposed?  </p><p> ART HOGAN, B. RILEY FBR CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST:  That's such a good  question.  And I think you have to think about that three ways.  Yes, I  think we overdo the selloffs, and today was certainly overdone.  Can it get  worse before it gets better?  I certainly think so.  </p><p> I think fundamentally this market is underpriced and certainly more  underpriced today than it was yesterday.  I think the problem with this is  we don't know how far our government will go with tariffs down the road to  trade wars versus using this as a negotiating tactic.  </p><p> And it really feels like -- I think -- you know, I think Secretary Ross  just said that.  We hope to get a negotiated settlement.  That's the best  case scenario.  Unfortunately, unintended consequences can creep up on us.  </p><p> So, until something like that turns economic and actually slows the economy  down.  I'll give you a great example.  NAFTA, if we walk away from those  negotiations, we'll lose a half a percentage GDP growth this year.  That's  something we need to make sure we accomplish.  And the same thing would be  true we got an extended trade war.  That would be very bad for the economy.  </p><p> HERERA:  Josh, weigh in on that if you would, because you say that although  a benign outcome is certainly is not guaranteed, the realistic economic  impact may be smaller than perhaps what Wall Street is fearing.  </p><p> FEINMAN:  Yes, you look at the move today, while I think ill-advised, it  affects a very small part of the U.S. economy.  You are talking about less  than less than three-tenths of 1 percent of GDP, even if you get some  retaliatory measures from China and not likely to have big macro  repercussions.  And if this is just a negotiating gambit, OK, it will be  fine.  </p><p> The worry, though, is that it could escalate into something more and it  also that reflects a protectionist mindset, this view that somehow trade is  a zero sum game, trade deficits are a sign of weakness and foreign  malfeasance.  And I think that's deeply misguided view and one that ignores  the tremendous benefits that it accrued from the post-World War II free  trade order, and the damage that could be done undermining that, and the  damage that has been done in the past from protectionist forays.  So,  that's the worry that I have.</p><p> GRIFFETH:  Josh, at this point, we have not had the kind of inflation that  the Fed might be hoping for oddly enough as they start to raise interest  rates.  If we impose these tariffs down the road, that could bring the  inflation back, don't you think?  </p><p> FEINMAN:  It could.  It depends on the scope of the tariffs and so forth.   It would likely be a short-term bump up, though.  What -- not likely to  have the kind of lasting effects on inflation to get inflation back up to 2  percent by itself.  </p><p> HERERA:  So, Art, if you have a long term time horizon as an investor, you  have a confluence of events that are going on, where you have the tariffs  going into effect.  You have Facebook and social media under fire possibly  facing some regulation.  What do you do?  Do you put new money to work in  those sectors because they come down so much or not?  </p><p> HOGAN:  I think you asked the question the best way we should ask that  question.  If your time horizon is as a long term investor, a lot of this  is noise and we won't be talking about it next year.  Unfortunately, you  know, in the news cycle that we're in, we're going to be talking about  these things on a minute by minute basis.  </p><p> So, for example, I think we will see an administration that says these  trade wars or these tariffs have adversely affected the economy and the  market.  Remember, they like use the market as a score card and you will  see a pull back from that.  I think regulation is probably good for social  media.  I think it's the Wild Wild West.  I think it needs some.  I think  we'll see those valuations get replaced by perhaps the more normal towards  what they're doing and I think we'll be fine with that.  </p><p> Right now, there is going to be volatility.  There is more volatility this  year than we have seen in any given year for the last ten years, right?   So, if that makes you stay up at night, then your exposure of the market is  probably a little too high and you should think about ratcheting it down.  </p><p> GRIFFETH:  And quickly, Josh, if this is a headwind for the economy, does  the Fed have to rethink its plan for raising interest rates later this  year?  </p><p> FEINMAN:  If it were a serious headwind, yes.  I think based on what we've  seen so far, it's likely not to turn into that.  But that's the risk.  And  we'll just have to be watching it very carefully.  When you rattle trade  savers, you know, you run the risk of unleashing the adverse economic  consequences.  </p><p> GRIFFETH:  Josh Feinman with Deutsche Asset Management, Art Hogan with B.  Riley FBR -- thank you both for joining us tonight.  </p><p> FEINMAN:  Thank you.</p><p> HOGAN:  Thank you.</p><p> HERERA:  In Washington, the House passed a $1.3 trillion spending bill, the  2,200-page legislation will fund the government until October.  It will  increase military spending and a number of domestic programs.  The measure  now heads to the Senate where it is expected to pass with bipartisan  support.  And the president said that he will sign that bill once it  reaches his desk.  </p><p> GRIFFETH:  Meanwhile, a key congressional committee has asked Facebook CEO  Mark Zuckerberg to testify about that data scandal that improperly accessed  personal information of about 50 million Facebook users.  That pressured  the stock again today.  It's now down more than 10 percent over just the  past week.  </p><p> Julia Boorstin talked to Facebook executive Sheryl Sandberg today about the  controversy and what she plans to do next.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> JULIA BOORSTIN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  With Facebook  shares down 10 percent this week, chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg  weighing in on the data privacy scandal that's raised concerns of users,  investors, regulators, and advertisers.  </p><p> SANDBERG:  This was a huge breach of trust.  People come to Facebook every  day and they depend upon us to protect their data.  And I'm so sorry that  we let so many people down.  </p><p> We spent the last few days trying to get to the bottom of what happened.   Cambridge Analytica never should have had this data.  They told us they  deleted it.  But it is our mistake that we did not verify that.  </p><p> Years ago, we changed platforms so apps get much less data.  But that  really wasn't enough.  </p><p> BOORSTIN:  With advertiser Nestle today raising questions about consumer  privacy, Sandberg stressed their business model does not put consumer data  at risk.  </p><p> SANDBERG:  We provide a free service.  That's an ad-based business model.   And in order to do that, we do not sell your data.  We are able to show  targeted advertising that's relevant to people.  We're able to give  advertisers aggregate anonymous reports, never telling them who you are.  </p><p> We believe that we can operate our service with our current business model,  continue to provide a free service all around the world, and protect  people's data.  But we are going to have to earn that trust.  </p><p> BOORSTIN:  Sandberg saying she wished that she and CEO Mark Zuckerberg had  weighed in on this controversial issue sooner.  She also said that they are  laying out strong steps to prevent this from ever happening again and they  are working to earn back consumers' trust.  </p><p> For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Julia Boorstin in Menlo Park, California.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> HERERA:  J.P. Eggers joins us now to discuss what a regulated Facebook  would look like.  He is a professor of management at New York University's  Stern School of Business.</p><p> Professor, welcome back.  It's always good to have you here.  </p><p> J.P. EGGERS, PROFESSOR OF MANAGEMENT, NEW YORK UNIVERSITY'S STERN SCHOOL OF  BUSINESS:  Thank you very much.  </p><p> HERERA:  You know, one of the clips that was not in Julia's piece was the  question of regulation.  And Ms. Sandberg basically was open to the concept  of regulation, as was Mark Zuckerberg yesterday, which surprised a lot of  people.  It seems to me they think it is a foregone conclusion that that is  coming their way.  </p><p> What do you think?  </p><p> EGGERS:  Well, I think the recognition in a there is obviously been this --  as Ms. Sandberg said, kind of a breach of trust and the implications that  the government and policymakers may want to try and weigh in on that and  the implications of that, I think this becomes real question, can Facebook  kind of help to co-create the regulations that would be put in place that  would govern some degree of control over both advertising and the  management of social media on line?  To me, the real question is, you know,  how deep those regulations would actually go if they were to be put in  place, and how enforceable they would be.  </p><p> There's been discussions around things like transparency in advertising.   But it's unclear how that would work, who would verify that, how that would  be done in any way that would be reliable.  Certainly, the government  doesn't have the resources to go do that, and it's not on Facebook's  interest to take on that responsibility.  </p><p> GRIFFETH:  You anticipated my question, J.P., because I was going to ask  what exactly you need to regulate.  And Mark Zuckerberg acknowledged that  it was transparency in advertising that he felt would be the target there.   But it's not going to be just about Facebook.  We're talking about perhaps  all social media that would be subject to these regulations, right?  </p><p> EGGERS:  Social media and just kind of online media in general.  Look, I  mean, Google is one -- Google is the biggest seller of advertising online.   And if we are talking about ways to try and regulate transparency in  advertising, it would certainly affect Google at least as much if not more  than it would affect Facebook in this way.  Obviously, those two big  players are going to feel kind of a disproportionate volume of any sort of  regulations that gets put in place because they are the main ones who are  selling ads online.  </p><p> But, yes, I think this is the way in which Mark Zuckerberg is trying to  push for this co-creation.  You never want the regulators to come just  after your business.  You want them to be coming after the entire sector so  that there's a level playing field as close as possible for all the firms.  </p><p> HERERA:  Now, a number of these companies, obviously, do business globally  and different countries have different rules about how they can function in  their countries.  The European models are much more conservative than the  U.S. regulations.  Might the companies try and avoid regulation by adopting  some of those European regulations or European rules?  </p><p> EGGERS:  I think certainly the risk would become that if -- if the  companies resisted this sort of regulation, that the most stringent form  available might be the one that's put in place, which would definitely be  bad for their business.  The ability to engage in micro-targeting, even if  they're not selling data externally, but to help and facilitate micro- targeting for advertisers is a huge portion of what makes Facebook  successful.  And to the extent that there are data privacy limits that go  beyond simply disclosure of how your data is used, but actual regulation of  exactly how the data could and couldn't be used, that would be much more  significant for Facebook's bottom line.  </p><p> HERERA:  All right.  J.P. Eggers, thanks so much for joining us again.  </p><p> EGGERS:  Thank you.</p><p> HERERA:  J.P. is with the New York University's Stern School of Business.  </p><p> GRIFFETH:  By the way, Commerce Bank and Mozilla are temporarily pulling  their advertising from Facebook because of this user data controversy.   Commerce Bank cited brand safety and data security.  And in a blog post,  browser maker Mozilla said despite promises from Facebook executives, it  takes issue with the social media company's default privacy setting.   Mozilla said that when Facebook takes stronger action in how it shares  customer data, it will consider returning.  </p><p> HERERA:  It is time to look at some of today's upgrades and downgrades.  </p><p> The auto parts maker Visteon was downgraded two notches to underweight from  overweight at Morgan Stanley.  That's Wall Street's only sell rating on the  stock.  The firm says Visteon could be an acquisition target but the level  of insider selling suggests the deal is unlikely in the near term.  Price  target was cut to $110 a share.  The shares dropped 6 percent to $113.45.  </p><p> Trivago shares were cut to underweight from neutral at J.P. Morgan.  The  analyst there says its hotel search business remains challenged.  The price  target is now $8.  Trivago shares fell 5 percent to $7.40 -- Bill.  </p><p> GRIFFETH:  J.P. Morgan also downgraded online car shopping service provider  TrueCar to under weight from neutral.  The firm is concerned about weak  automotive industry trends overall and the price target, they cut down to  $10 a share.  The stock fell 1 percent to $9.80, just below that.  </p><p> Ralph Lauren's rating was raised to outperform from market perform at Cowen  and Company.  The analyst says that the luxury brand growth could  accelerate as a result of its marketing and digital strategy.  The price  target was raised to $122 a share.  Shares, though, were down along with  the rest of the market, closing 1 percent lower to $107.66.  </p><p> HERERA:  Still ahead, Nike just does it, reporting better than expected  earnings.  And that could set the tone for trading tomorrow.</p><p> (MUSIC)</p><p> GRIFFETH:  Late today, cloud storage company Dropbox priced its IPO above  expectations.  According to CNBC, the highly anticipated offering priced at  $21 a share.  The range was anywhere between $18 and $20.  Dropbox is  expected to start trading tomorrow.  It will be the largest tech IPO since  Snap started trading more than a year ago -- Sue.</p><p> HERERA:  Bill, the Dow component Nike reported better than expected  earnings and revenue fueled by growth in its international sales and its  momentum in China.  The CEO said he sees a sales slump though in the U.S.  reversing.  And that sent the stock initially higher in afterhours trading.  </p><p> Courtney Reagan has more on Nike's results.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> COURTNEY REAGAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Nike's strong  third quarter results driven by strong international sales.  Sales coming  in stronger than expected in Europe, greater China, and Asia Pacific,  though Nike's North America's sales disappoint.  </p><p> CEO Mark Parker says sales direct to consumers rather than through retail  partner like a department store grew double digits internationally, with  China leading the way.  It is been a difficult week for Nike after Parker  sent a memo to employees revealing allegations of inappropriate workplace  behavior had been reported and two executives left in the wake of that  announcement, though Nike didn't directly tie them to those allegations.  </p><p> For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Courtney Reagan.</p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> GRIFFETH:  Chip maker Micron beats expectations.  And that's where we begin  tonight's \"Market Focus\".  </p><p> After the bell, the company said that broad-based demand for its memory and  storage products led to a strong quarter.  The company expects that to  continue.  That's why it gave guidance for the current quarter above  estimates.  Shares were volatile in the after-hours.  They finished the  regular session, though, down more than 3 percent at $58.92.</p><p> Higher selling prices helped earnings topped estimates at home builder KB  Home.  Orders rose and they were also stronger than expected.  But  investors focused on revenue which came in late.  Shares were volatile in  after-hours and finished the regular session down 3 percent at $28.84.</p><p> Darden said that an increase in the number of restaurants in operation  helped profits topped expectations.  The owner of Olive Garden and LongHorn  Steakhouse said that it raised its earnings guidance for the rest of the  year.  Overall sales, though, were a sore spot for this quarter.  They rose  less than anticipated.  Darden shares off nearly 8 percent today to $85.94.</p><p> HERERA:  New product launches helped G-III apparel grow sales and profit  above street expectations.  But the owner of brands like Tommy Hilfiger and  Calvin Klein gave guidance for 2019 that was below street estimates.   Shares of G-III plunged 12 percent today to $33.01.  </p><p> Carnival said a rise onboard spending helped that cruise line topped both  sales and profit expectations.  The company said demand remains strong.   Carnival shares fell 1 percent to $66.20.  </p><p> GRIFFETH:  Coming up, AT&amp;T spars with the U.S. government.  At stake, $85  billion, and Time Warner.  We head to court, next.  </p><p> (MUSIC)</p><p> GRIFFEH:  The biggest antitrust case in a generation is finally gotten  underway.  The Justice Department, as you know, is suing to block AT&amp;T's  $85 billion merger with Time Warner.  </p><p> Hampton Pearson is at the courthouse for us tonight -- Hampton.  </p><p> HAMPTON PEARSON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Well, Bill, this  was like really opening day of that long awaited legal battle between the  Department of Justice antitrust and AT&amp;T Time Warner.  Opening arguments  attended by, among others, AT&amp;T's CEO Randall Stephenson, as well as his  Time Warner colleague Jeff Bewkes.  What they heard once they were in court  is the government in essence saying that this merger would see consumers  paying higher prices and less innovation going forward for all of the video  however they choose to receive it, whether it's on a TV, smart phone, or  tablet going forward.  </p><p> The lead government lawyer even said in court that AT&amp;T would use Time  Warner as a weapon against its competitors and to some degree against  consumers in future negotiations going forward because Time Warner is  considered to be must-have content.  </p><p> On the flip side, AT&amp;T says the government has it backwards.  They have to  get in the game because of the likes of Facebook, Netflix, Amazon and  Google that are getting more and more subscribers in their online formats  and frankly twinning to win the war with advertisers.  This trial is  expected to last six to eight weeks.  We're just getting started.  </p><p> GRIFFETH:  All right.  Hampton Pearson for us in Washington tonight --  thank you, Hampton.  </p><p> And there's more sad news from the Toys \"R\" Us world tonight.  The founder  of the toy retailer has passed away at the age of 84.  The great Charles  Lazarus, he founded the company 70 years ago.  He rightly anticipated that  the post-war baby boom would create demand for baby supplies and toys.   Boy, was he right.  </p><p> He remained CEO of the company until 1994, and the man who succeeded him  called Charles Lazarus the father of the toy business.  </p><p> HERERA:  Before we go, here's another look at today's selloff on Wall  Street.  And it accelerated as we went into the close.  The Dow Jones  Industrial Average finished down 724 points to 23,957.  The Nasdaq lost  178, almost 179 points to 7,166.  And the S&amp;P lost 68 points.  </p><p> So, quite a day on the street.  </p><p> GRIFFETH:  Indeed.  </p><p> HERERA:  That does it for us tonight.  I'm Sue Herera.  Thanks for joining  us.  </p><p> GRIFFETH:  I'm Bill Griffeth.  Have a great evening.  See you tomorrow.</p><p> END</p><p> Nightly Business Report transcripts and video are available on-line post  broadcast at <url normalizedValue=\"http://nbr.com\">http://nbr.com</url>.

But is the next step regulation?  </p><p> Those stories and more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for this  Thursday, March the 22nd.  </p><p> HERERA:  Good evening, everyone, and welcome.  </p><p> A sell off on Wall Street.  All 30 Dow components closed lower, about two- thirds of the stocks in that index fell more than 1 percent today.  Half of  the S&amp;P 500 is now in correction territory.  </p><p> Investors became unnerved after the White House unveiled a new round of  tariffs that some fear could threaten the trade war with China, the world's  second largest economy.  So, by the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average  had plunged 724 points to 23,957, a nearly 3 percent decline.  The Nasdaq  fell 178.  And the S&amp;P 500 lost 68.  </p><p> The biggest losers on the Dow were the major industrials like Caterpillar,  Boeing, and 3M.  </p><p> Bob Pisani reports tonight on that selloff from the New York Stock  Exchange.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> BOB PISANI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Stocks closed right  around their worst levels of the session with the Dow down more than 700  points.  That's right, 700 points.  </p><p> The markets are clearly concerned about two things.  Number one,  technology.  And number two, trade.  Two big issues.  </p><p> President Donald Trump announced he would be imposing tariffs of up to $60  billion on Chinese goods over the next few weeks.  No details on which  products will be taxed by how much yet.  But he did say there would be a  30-day grace period to negotiate those terms.  </p><p> Shares of U.S. and other metals and mining stocks got slammed on news that  Trump will be exempting a handful of allies from steel and aluminum  tariffs, including the European Unions, South Korea and Brazil.  In fact,  U.S. steel is down 20 percent since those tariffs were first announced a  few weeks ago.  It looks like they are not as tough as some people thought  they might be.</p><p> Facebook is facing an existential crisis right now.  In fact, the whole  social media group is.  And that's weighing heavily on all the other social  media stocks.  The stock market has lost its team leadership group,  technology, and social media is part of that.  And there's really nothing  taking its place.  The subsectors that powered tech high, which were  semiconductors and the FANG names, your Facebook, your Apples, and your  Amazons, they stopped advancing and in most cases, they reversed.  </p><p> So, once those FANG and semiconductor stocks stopped going up in the second  week of March, the market stalled out because no other sector has stepped  forward to lead the market higher.  Industrials and materials are suffering  from these trade war concerns.  FANGs can't move higher without the help of  higher volume.  That's not happening.  </p><p> On top of that, drama in Washington is still on the front burner.  Stocks  did fall earlier on word in a John Dowd, President Trump's lead lawyer in  the Russia probe had resigned.  </p><p> For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Bob Pisani at the New York Stock Exchange.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> GRIFFETH:  Mike Santoli is also at the New York Stock Exchange.  He joins  us tonight with some more insights on this decline.</p><p> I think you were the one who coined the term tariff tantrum.  Is that -- is  that all we saw today, or was there more going on, do you think?  </p><p> MIKE SANTOLI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  I don't take the  blame or the credit for that one.</p><p> Yes, I don't think it was all we were seeing today but I think that was the  added element this morning, right at the outset, that came upon a market  that also was already concerned about this general notion that interest  rates are going up, this Fed is looking for opportunities to bring rates  higher if they can, if the economic data allow for that.  And then, you  know, as Bob was saying, the loss of leadership from the big tech group,  which a lot of investors I think were hiding in because it seems seemed  like they could grow in almost any environment.  </p><p> But the tariff issue is a reminder that policy across a bunch of fronts,  whether it is trade or monetary policy have turned a little bit less  friendly than we got used to last year.  </p><p> HERERA:  The volume, though, Mike.  I mean, it didn't seem like they were  just throwing stocks out the window today.  Was that mostly the  professionals who were selling?  </p><p> SANTOLI:  Interesting.  No, you are absolutely right, Sue.  It was not a  feeling of panic.  It was not this mass liquidation of stocks.  As a matter  of fact, a couple of folks are pointing out that small cap stocks had  outperformed the large cap indexes.  </p><p> So, the more domestically focused businesses seemed like they were not  caught up in this selloff quite much.  The volumes weren't that high.  The  volatility index definitely got up there, but not at levels we saw in early  February.  So, it was a somewhat lower intensity selloff than what we did  see in early February.  </p><p> Whether that something that means that folks are more likely to buy it at  this level or not is not clear, but it definitely was not indiscriminate.</p><p> GRIFFETH:  Mike Santoli at the New York Stock Exchange for us tonight --  thanks, Mike.  </p><p> SANTOLI:  Thank you.</p><p> HERERA:  So, as we mentioned, the president did announce his toughest trade  action to date.  And as Kayla Tausche reports from Washington, there are  fears of more to come.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> KAYLA TAUSCHE, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  President Trump  signed an order that paved the way for steep tariffs on a wide range of  Chinese imports.  The move marks the end of its seven-month investigation  into Chinese tactics to challenge U.S. technology dominance.  </p><p> TRUMP:  We have a tremendous intellectual property situation going on.  So,  we're going to get it taken care of.  And frankly, it's going to make us a  much stronger, much richer nation.  </p><p> TAUSCHE:  The action comes as the U.S. is imposing tariffs on all imports  of steel and aluminum with certain allies and products exempted, and on top  of tariffs on Chinese made solar panels.  U.S. exporters including soybean  farmers, pork producers, and aircraft maker Boeing are bracing for a  counter-punch from China, which says it will take all necessary measures to  safeguard its interests.  </p><p>U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer told lawmakers that kind of  retaliation is unfair but doesn't change things.  </p><p> ROBERT LIGHTHIZER, U.S. TRADE REPRESENTATIVE:  It's not possible to take  the position that because we are soybean farmers, we're not going to stick  up for our rights in a whole variety of ways and have hundreds of billions  of dollars worth of exporters and domestic producers be punished because of  unfair trade.  </p><p> TAUSCHE:  There CEO of engine maker Cummins, Tom Linebarger, fears the  administration's approach is leading to a trade war.  </p><p> TOM LINEBARGER, CEO CUMMINS:  We agree there are challenges in China.  We  just want to address it in a different way, a way that's proven effective  over many, many decades, as opposed to unilateral tariffs which have always  proven ineffective.  </p><p> TAUSCHE:  But Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross says those fears are  overblown.  </p><p> WILBUR ROSS, COMMERCE SECRETARY:  I think there will be some ultimate  retaliation, but I don't think it's going to be the end of the earth.   There may be some firing shots over the bow.  But I believe at the end of  the day, this will end up in a negotiated settlement.  </p><p> TAUSCHE:  A senior administration official tells me this is just the  kickoff to a set of multiple penalties against China and that further  actions, namely restrictions on Chinese investments in the United States,  could be unveiled in the coming days.  </p><p> For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Kayla Tausche in Washington.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> GRIFFETH:  And joining us right now to talk more about the new tariffs and  the impact they could have on the markets and the economy, joining us  tonight, Art Hogan.  He's chief market strategist with B. Riley FBR.  And  Josh Feinman is global chief economist at Deutsche Asset Management.  </p><p> Good to see you both.  </p><p> JOSHUA FEINMAN, DEUTSCHE ASSET MANAGEMENT GLOBAL CHIEF ECONOMIST:  Good to  be here.  </p><p> GRIFFETH:  Art, how do you -- do you step aside and let things clear out or  do you see opportunities already presenting themselves as a result of these  tariffs being imposed?  </p><p> ART HOGAN, B. RILEY FBR CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST:  That's such a good  question.  And I think you have to think about that three ways.  Yes, I  think we overdo the selloffs, and today was certainly overdone.  Can it get  worse before it gets better?  I certainly think so.  </p><p> I think fundamentally this market is underpriced and certainly more  underpriced today than it was yesterday.  I think the problem with this is  we don't know how far our government will go with tariffs down the road to  trade wars versus using this as a negotiating tactic.  </p><p> And it really feels like -- I think -- you know, I think Secretary Ross  just said that.  We hope to get a negotiated settlement.  That's the best  case scenario.  Unfortunately, unintended consequences can creep up on us.  </p><p> So, until something like that turns economic and actually slows the economy  down.  I'll give you a great example.  NAFTA, if we walk away from those  negotiations, we'll lose a half a percentage GDP growth this year.  That's  something we need to make sure we accomplish.  And the same thing would be  true we got an extended trade war.  That would be very bad for the economy.  </p><p> HERERA:  Josh, weigh in on that if you would, because you say that although  a benign outcome is certainly is not guaranteed, the realistic economic  impact may be smaller than perhaps what Wall Street is fearing.  </p><p> FEINMAN:  Yes, you look at the move today, while I think ill-advised, it  affects a very small part of the U.S. economy.  You are talking about less  than less than three-tenths of 1 percent of GDP, even if you get some  retaliatory measures from China and not likely to have big macro  repercussions.  And if this is just a negotiating gambit, OK, it will be  fine.  </p><p> The worry, though, is that it could escalate into something more and it  also that reflects a protectionist mindset, this view that somehow trade is  a zero sum game, trade deficits are a sign of weakness and foreign  malfeasance.  And I think that's deeply misguided view and one that ignores  the tremendous benefits that it accrued from the post-World War II free  trade order, and the damage that could be done undermining that, and the  damage that has been done in the past from protectionist forays.  So,  that's the worry that I have.</p><p> GRIFFETH:  Josh, at this point, we have not had the kind of inflation that  the Fed might be hoping for oddly enough as they start to raise interest  rates.  If we impose these tariffs down the road, that could bring the  inflation back, don't you think?  </p><p> FEINMAN:  It could.  It depends on the scope of the tariffs and so forth.   It would likely be a short-term bump up, though.  What -- not likely to  have the kind of lasting effects on inflation to get inflation back up to 2  percent by itself.  </p><p> HERERA:  So, Art, if you have a long term time horizon as an investor, you  have a confluence of events that are going on, where you have the tariffs  going into effect.  You have Facebook and social media under fire possibly  facing some regulation.  What do you do?  Do you put new money to work in  those sectors because they come down so much or not?  </p><p> HOGAN:  I think you asked the question the best way we should ask that  question.  If your time horizon is as a long term investor, a lot of this  is noise and we won't be talking about it next year.  Unfortunately, you  know, in the news cycle that we're in, we're going to be talking about  these things on a minute by minute basis.  </p><p> So, for example, I think we will see an administration that says these  trade wars or these tariffs have adversely affected the economy and the  market.  Remember, they like use the market as a score card and you will  see a pull back from that.  I think regulation is probably good for social  media.  I think it's the Wild Wild West.  I think it needs some.  I think  we'll see those valuations get replaced by perhaps the more normal towards  what they're doing and I think we'll be fine with that.  </p><p> Right now, there is going to be volatility.  There is more volatility this  year than we have seen in any given year for the last ten years, right?   So, if that makes you stay up at night, then your exposure of the market is  probably a little too high and you should think about ratcheting it down.  </p><p> GRIFFETH:  And quickly, Josh, if this is a headwind for the economy, does  the Fed have to rethink its plan for raising interest rates later this  year?  </p><p> FEINMAN:  If it were a serious headwind, yes.  I think based on what we've  seen so far, it's likely not to turn into that.  But that's the risk.  And  we'll just have to be watching it very carefully.  When you rattle trade  savers, you know, you run the risk of unleashing the adverse economic  consequences.  </p><p> GRIFFETH:  Josh Feinman with Deutsche Asset Management, Art Hogan with B.  Riley FBR -- thank you both for joining us tonight.  </p><p> FEINMAN:  Thank you.</p><p> HOGAN:  Thank you.</p><p> HERERA:  In Washington, the House passed a $1.3 trillion spending bill, the  2,200-page legislation will fund the government until October.  It will  increase military spending and a number of domestic programs.  The measure  now heads to the Senate where it is expected to pass with bipartisan  support.  And the president said that he will sign that bill once it  reaches his desk.  </p><p> GRIFFETH:  Meanwhile, a key congressional committee has asked Facebook CEO  Mark Zuckerberg to testify about that data scandal that improperly accessed  personal information of about 50 million Facebook users.  That pressured  the stock again today.  It's now down more than 10 percent over just the  past week.  </p><p> Julia Boorstin talked to Facebook executive Sheryl Sandberg today about the  controversy and what she plans to do next.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> JULIA BOORSTIN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  With Facebook  shares down 10 percent this week, chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg  weighing in on the data privacy scandal that's raised concerns of users,  investors, regulators, and advertisers.  </p><p> SANDBERG:  This was a huge breach of trust.  People come to Facebook every  day and they depend upon us to protect their data.  And I'm so sorry that  we let so many people down.  </p><p> We spent the last few days trying to get to the bottom of what happened.   Cambridge Analytica never should have had this data.  They told us they  deleted it.  But it is our mistake that we did not verify that.  </p><p> Years ago, we changed platforms so apps get much less data.  But that  really wasn't enough.  </p><p> BOORSTIN:  With advertiser Nestle today raising questions about consumer  privacy, Sandberg stressed their business model does not put consumer data  at risk.  </p><p> SANDBERG:  We provide a free service.  That's an ad-based business model.   And in order to do that, we do not sell your data.  We are able to show  targeted advertising that's relevant to people.  We're able to give  advertisers aggregate anonymous reports, never telling them who you are.  </p><p> We believe that we can operate our service with our current business model,  continue to provide a free service all around the world, and protect  people's data.  But we are going to have to earn that trust.  </p><p> BOORSTIN:  Sandberg saying she wished that she and CEO Mark Zuckerberg had  weighed in on this controversial issue sooner.  She also said that they are  laying out strong steps to prevent this from ever happening again and they  are working to earn back consumers' trust.  </p><p> For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Julia Boorstin in Menlo Park, California.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> HERERA:  J.P. Eggers joins us now to discuss what a regulated Facebook  would look like.  He is a professor of management at New York University's  Stern School of Business.</p><p> Professor, welcome back.  It's always good to have you here.  </p><p> J.P. EGGERS, PROFESSOR OF MANAGEMENT, NEW YORK UNIVERSITY'S STERN SCHOOL OF  BUSINESS:  Thank you very much.  </p><p> HERERA:  You know, one of the clips that was not in Julia's piece was the  question of regulation.  And Ms. Sandberg basically was open to the concept  of regulation, as was Mark Zuckerberg yesterday, which surprised a lot of  people.  It seems to me they think it is a foregone conclusion that that is  coming their way.  </p><p> What do you think?  </p><p> EGGERS:  Well, I think the recognition in a there is obviously been this --  as Ms. Sandberg said, kind of a breach of trust and the implications that  the government and policymakers may want to try and weigh in on that and  the implications of that, I think this becomes real question, can Facebook  kind of help to co-create the regulations that would be put in place that  would govern some degree of control over both advertising and the  management of social media on line?  To me, the real question is, you know,  how deep those regulations would actually go if they were to be put in  place, and how enforceable they would be.  </p><p> There's been discussions around things like transparency in advertising.   But it's unclear how that would work, who would verify that, how that would  be done in any way that would be reliable.  Certainly, the government  doesn't have the resources to go do that, and it's not on Facebook's  interest to take on that responsibility.  </p><p> GRIFFETH:  You anticipated my question, J.P., because I was going to ask  what exactly you need to regulate.  And Mark Zuckerberg acknowledged that  it was transparency in advertising that he felt would be the target there.   But it's not going to be just about Facebook.  We're talking about perhaps  all social media that would be subject to these regulations, right?  </p><p> EGGERS:  Social media and just kind of online media in general.  Look, I  mean, Google is one -- Google is the biggest seller of advertising online.   And if we are talking about ways to try and regulate transparency in  advertising, it would certainly affect Google at least as much if not more  than it would affect Facebook in this way.  Obviously, those two big  players are going to feel kind of a disproportionate volume of any sort of  regulations that gets put in place because they are the main ones who are  selling ads online.  </p><p> But, yes, I think this is the way in which Mark Zuckerberg is trying to  push for this co-creation.  You never want the regulators to come just  after your business.  You want them to be coming after the entire sector so  that there's a level playing field as close as possible for all the firms.  </p><p> HERERA:  Now, a number of these companies, obviously, do business globally  and different countries have different rules about how they can function in  their countries.  The European models are much more conservative than the  U.S. regulations.  Might the companies try and avoid regulation by adopting  some of those European regulations or European rules?  </p><p> EGGERS:  I think certainly the risk would become that if -- if the  companies resisted this sort of regulation, that the most stringent form  available might be the one that's put in place, which would definitely be  bad for their business.  The ability to engage in micro-targeting, even if  they're not selling data externally, but to help and facilitate micro- targeting for advertisers is a huge portion of what makes Facebook  successful.  And to the extent that there are data privacy limits that go  beyond simply disclosure of how your data is used, but actual regulation of  exactly how the data could and couldn't be used, that would be much more  significant for Facebook's bottom line.  </p><p> HERERA:  All right.  J.P. Eggers, thanks so much for joining us again.  </p><p> EGGERS:  Thank you.</p><p> HERERA:  J.P. is with the New York University's Stern School of Business.  </p><p> GRIFFETH:  By the way, Commerce Bank and Mozilla are temporarily pulling  their advertising from Facebook because of this user data controversy.   Commerce Bank cited brand safety and data security.  And in a blog post,  browser maker Mozilla said despite promises from Facebook executives, it  takes issue with the social media company's default privacy setting.   Mozilla said that when Facebook takes stronger action in how it shares  customer data, it will consider returning.  </p><p> HERERA:  It is time to look at some of today's upgrades and downgrades.  </p><p> The auto parts maker Visteon was downgraded two notches to underweight from  overweight at Morgan Stanley.  That's Wall Street's only sell rating on the  stock.  The firm says Visteon could be an acquisition target but the level  of insider selling suggests the deal is unlikely in the near term.  Price  target was cut to $110 a share.  The shares dropped 6 percent to $113.45.  </p><p> Trivago shares were cut to underweight from neutral at J.P. Morgan.  The  analyst there says its hotel search business remains challenged.  The price  target is now $8.  Trivago shares fell 5 percent to $7.40 -- Bill.  </p><p> GRIFFETH:  J.P. Morgan also downgraded online car shopping service provider  TrueCar to under weight from neutral.  The firm is concerned about weak  automotive industry trends overall and the price target, they cut down to  $10 a share.  The stock fell 1 percent to $9.80, just below that.  </p><p> Ralph Lauren's rating was raised to outperform from market perform at Cowen  and Company.  The analyst says that the luxury brand growth could  accelerate as a result of its marketing and digital strategy.  The price  target was raised to $122 a share.  Shares, though, were down along with  the rest of the market, closing 1 percent lower to $107.66.  </p><p> HERERA:  Still ahead, Nike just does it, reporting better than expected  earnings.  And that could set the tone for trading tomorrow.</p><p> (MUSIC)</p><p> GRIFFETH:  Late today, cloud storage company Dropbox priced its IPO above  expectations.  According to CNBC, the highly anticipated offering priced at  $21 a share.  The range was anywhere between $18 and $20.  Dropbox is  expected to start trading tomorrow.  It will be the largest tech IPO since  Snap started trading more than a year ago -- Sue.</p><p> HERERA:  Bill, the Dow component Nike reported better than expected  earnings and revenue fueled by growth in its international sales and its  momentum in China.  The CEO said he sees a sales slump though in the U.S.  reversing.  And that sent the stock initially higher in afterhours trading.  </p><p> Courtney Reagan has more on Nike's results.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> COURTNEY REAGAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Nike's strong  third quarter results driven by strong international sales.  Sales coming  in stronger than expected in Europe, greater China, and Asia Pacific,  though Nike's North America's sales disappoint.  </p><p> CEO Mark Parker says sales direct to consumers rather than through retail  partner like a department store grew double digits internationally, with  China leading the way.  It is been a difficult week for Nike after Parker  sent a memo to employees revealing allegations of inappropriate workplace  behavior had been reported and two executives left in the wake of that  announcement, though Nike didn't directly tie them to those allegations.  </p><p> For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Courtney Reagan.</p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> GRIFFETH:  Chip maker Micron beats expectations.  And that's where we begin  tonight's \"Market Focus\".  </p><p> After the bell, the company said that broad-based demand for its memory and  storage products led to a strong quarter.  The company expects that to  continue.  That's why it gave guidance for the current quarter above  estimates.  Shares were volatile in the after-hours.  They finished the  regular session, though, down more than 3 percent at $58.92.</p><p> Higher selling prices helped earnings topped estimates at home builder KB  Home.  Orders rose and they were also stronger than expected.  But  investors focused on revenue which came in late.  Shares were volatile in  after-hours and finished the regular session down 3 percent at $28.84.</p><p> Darden said that an increase in the number of restaurants in operation  helped profits topped expectations.  The owner of Olive Garden and LongHorn  Steakhouse said that it raised its earnings guidance for the rest of the  year.  Overall sales, though, were a sore spot for this quarter.  They rose  less than anticipated.  Darden shares off nearly 8 percent today to $85.94.</p><p> HERERA:  New product launches helped G-III apparel grow sales and profit  above street expectations.  But the owner of brands like Tommy Hilfiger and  Calvin Klein gave guidance for 2019 that was below street estimates.   Shares of G-III plunged 12 percent today to $33.01.  </p><p> Carnival said a rise onboard spending helped that cruise line topped both  sales and profit expectations.  The company said demand remains strong.   Carnival shares fell 1 percent to $66.20.  </p><p> GRIFFETH:  Coming up, AT&amp;T spars with the U.S. government.  At stake, $85  billion, and Time Warner.  We head to court, next.  </p><p> (MUSIC)</p><p> GRIFFEH:  The biggest antitrust case in a generation is finally gotten  underway.  The Justice Department, as you know, is suing to block AT&amp;T's  $85 billion merger with Time Warner.  </p><p> Hampton Pearson is at the courthouse for us tonight -- Hampton.  </p><p> HAMPTON PEARSON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Well, Bill, this  was like really opening day of that long awaited legal battle between the  Department of Justice antitrust and AT&amp;T Time Warner.  Opening arguments  attended by, among others, AT&amp;T's CEO Randall Stephenson, as well as his  Time Warner colleague Jeff Bewkes.  What they heard once they were in court  is the government in essence saying that this merger would see consumers  paying higher prices and less innovation going forward for all of the video  however they choose to receive it, whether it's on a TV, smart phone, or  tablet going forward.  </p><p> The lead government lawyer even said in court that AT&amp;T would use Time  Warner as a weapon against its competitors and to some degree against  consumers in future negotiations going forward because Time Warner is  considered to be must-have content.  </p><p> On the flip side, AT&amp;T says the government has it backwards.  They have to  get in the game because of the likes of Facebook, Netflix, Amazon and  Google that are getting more and more subscribers in their online formats  and frankly twinning to win the war with advertisers.  This trial is  expected to last six to eight weeks.  We're just getting started.  </p><p> GRIFFETH:  All right.  Hampton Pearson for us in Washington tonight --  thank you, Hampton.  </p><p> And there's more sad news from the Toys \"R\" Us world tonight.  The founder  of the toy retailer has passed away at the age of 84.  The great Charles  Lazarus, he founded the company 70 years ago.  He rightly anticipated that  the post-war baby boom would create demand for baby supplies and toys.   Boy, was he right.  </p><p> He remained CEO of the company until 1994, and the man who succeeded him  called Charles Lazarus the father of the toy business.  </p><p> HERERA:  Before we go, here's another look at today's selloff on Wall  Street.  And it accelerated as we went into the close.  The Dow Jones  Industrial Average finished down 724 points to 23,957.  The Nasdaq lost  178, almost 179 points to 7,166.  And the S&amp;P lost 68 points.  </p><p> So, quite a day on the street.  </p><p> GRIFFETH:  Indeed.  </p><p> HERERA:  That does it for us tonight.  I'm Sue Herera.  Thanks for joining  us.  </p><p> GRIFFETH:  I'm Bill Griffeth.  Have a great evening.  See you tomorrow.</p><p> END</p><p> Nightly Business Report transcripts and video are available on-line post  broadcast at <url normalizedValue=\"http://nbr.com\">http://nbr.com</url>.

But is the next step regulation?  </p><p> Those stories and more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for this  Thursday, March the 22nd.  </p><p> HERERA:  Good evening, everyone, and welcome.  </p><p> A sell off on Wall Street.  All 30 Dow components closed lower, about two- thirds of the stocks in that index fell more than 1 percent today.  Half of  the S&amp;P 500 is now in correction territory.  </p><p> Investors became unnerved after the White House unveiled a new round of  tariffs that some fear could threaten the trade war with China, the world's  second largest economy.  So, by the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average  had plunged 724 points to 23,957, a nearly 3 percent decline.  The Nasdaq  fell 178.  And the S&amp;P 500 lost 68.  </p><p> The biggest losers on the Dow were the major industrials like Caterpillar,  Boeing, and 3M.  </p><p> Bob Pisani reports tonight on that selloff from the New York Stock  Exchange.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> BOB PISANI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Stocks closed right  around their worst levels of the session with the Dow down more than 700  points.  That's right, 700 points.  </p><p> The markets are clearly concerned about two things.  Number one,  technology.  And number two, trade.  Two big issues.  </p><p> President Donald Trump announced he would be imposing tariffs of up to $60  billion on Chinese goods over the next few weeks.  No details on which  products will be taxed by how much yet.  But he did say there would be a  30-day grace period to negotiate those terms.  </p><p> Shares of U.S. and other metals and mining stocks got slammed on news that  Trump will be exempting a handful of allies from steel and aluminum  tariffs, including the European Unions, South Korea and Brazil.  In fact,  U.S. steel is down 20 percent since those tariffs were first announced a  few weeks ago.  It looks like they are not as tough as some people thought  they might be.</p><p> Facebook is facing an existential crisis right now.  In fact, the whole  social media group is.  And that's weighing heavily on all the other social  media stocks.  The stock market has lost its team leadership group,  technology, and social media is part of that.  And there's really nothing  taking its place.  The subsectors that powered tech high, which were  semiconductors and the FANG names, your Facebook, your Apples, and your  Amazons, they stopped advancing and in most cases, they reversed.  </p><p> So, once those FANG and semiconductor stocks stopped going up in the second  week of March, the market stalled out because no other sector has stepped  forward to lead the market higher.  Industrials and materials are suffering  from these trade war concerns.  FANGs can't move higher without the help of  higher volume.  That's not happening.  </p><p> On top of that, drama in Washington is still on the front burner.  Stocks  did fall earlier on word in a John Dowd, President Trump's lead lawyer in  the Russia probe had resigned.  </p><p> For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Bob Pisani at the New York Stock Exchange.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> GRIFFETH:  Mike Santoli is also at the New York Stock Exchange.  He joins  us tonight with some more insights on this decline.</p><p> I think you were the one who coined the term tariff tantrum.  Is that -- is  that all we saw today, or was there more going on, do you think?  </p><p> MIKE SANTOLI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  I don't take the  blame or the credit for that one.</p><p> Yes, I don't think it was all we were seeing today but I think that was the  added element this morning, right at the outset, that came upon a market  that also was already concerned about this general notion that interest  rates are going up, this Fed is looking for opportunities to bring rates  higher if they can, if the economic data allow for that.  And then, you  know, as Bob was saying, the loss of leadership from the big tech group,  which a lot of investors I think were hiding in because it seems seemed  like they could grow in almost any environment.  </p><p> But the tariff issue is a reminder that policy across a bunch of fronts,  whether it is trade or monetary policy have turned a little bit less  friendly than we got used to last year.  </p><p> HERERA:  The volume, though, Mike.  I mean, it didn't seem like they were  just throwing stocks out the window today.  Was that mostly the  professionals who were selling?  </p><p> SANTOLI:  Interesting.  No, you are absolutely right, Sue.  It was not a  feeling of panic.  It was not this mass liquidation of stocks.  As a matter  of fact, a couple of folks are pointing out that small cap stocks had  outperformed the large cap indexes.  </p><p> So, the more domestically focused businesses seemed like they were not  caught up in this selloff quite much.  The volumes weren't that high.  The  volatility index definitely got up there, but not at levels we saw in early  February.  So, it was a somewhat lower intensity selloff than what we did  see in early February.  </p><p> Whether that something that means that folks are more likely to buy it at  this level or not is not clear, but it definitely was not indiscriminate.</p><p> GRIFFETH:  Mike Santoli at the New York Stock Exchange for us tonight --  thanks, Mike.  </p><p> SANTOLI:  Thank you.</p><p> HERERA:  So, as we mentioned, the president did announce his toughest trade  action to date.  And as Kayla Tausche reports from Washington, there are  fears of more to come.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> KAYLA TAUSCHE, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  President Trump  signed an order that paved the way for steep tariffs on a wide range of  Chinese imports.  The move marks the end of its seven-month investigation  into Chinese tactics to challenge U.S. technology dominance.  </p><p> TRUMP:  We have a tremendous intellectual property situation going on.  So,  we're going to get it taken care of.  And frankly, it's going to make us a  much stronger, much richer nation.  </p><p> TAUSCHE:  The action comes as the U.S. is imposing tariffs on all imports  of steel and aluminum with certain allies and products exempted, and on top  of tariffs on Chinese made solar panels.  U.S. exporters including soybean  farmers, pork producers, and aircraft maker Boeing are bracing for a  counter-punch from China, which says it will take all necessary measures to  safeguard its interests.  </p><p>U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer told lawmakers that kind of  retaliation is unfair but doesn't change things.  </p><p> ROBERT LIGHTHIZER, U.S. TRADE REPRESENTATIVE:  It's not possible to take  the position that because we are soybean farmers, we're not going to stick  up for our rights in a whole variety of ways and have hundreds of billions  of dollars worth of exporters and domestic producers be punished because of  unfair trade.  </p><p> TAUSCHE:  There CEO of engine maker Cummins, Tom Linebarger, fears the  administration's approach is leading to a trade war.  </p><p> TOM LINEBARGER, CEO CUMMINS:  We agree there are challenges in China.  We  just want to address it in a different way, a way that's proven effective  over many, many decades, as opposed to unilateral tariffs which have always  proven ineffective.  </p><p> TAUSCHE:  But Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross says those fears are  overblown.  </p><p> WILBUR ROSS, COMMERCE SECRETARY:  I think there will be some ultimate  retaliation, but I don't think it's going to be the end of the earth.   There may be some firing shots over the bow.  But I believe at the end of  the day, this will end up in a negotiated settlement.  </p><p> TAUSCHE:  A senior administration official tells me this is just the  kickoff to a set of multiple penalties against China and that further  actions, namely restrictions on Chinese investments in the United States,  could be unveiled in the coming days.  </p><p> For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Kayla Tausche in Washington.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> GRIFFETH:  And joining us right now to talk more about the new tariffs and  the impact they could have on the markets and the economy, joining us  tonight, Art Hogan.  He's chief market strategist with B. Riley FBR.  And  Josh Feinman is global chief economist at Deutsche Asset Management.  </p><p> Good to see you both.  </p><p> JOSHUA FEINMAN, DEUTSCHE ASSET MANAGEMENT GLOBAL CHIEF ECONOMIST:  Good to  be here.  </p><p> GRIFFETH:  Art, how do you -- do you step aside and let things clear out or  do you see opportunities already presenting themselves as a result of these  tariffs being imposed?  </p><p> ART HOGAN, B. RILEY FBR CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST:  That's such a good  question.  And I think you have to think about that three ways.  Yes, I  think we overdo the selloffs, and today was certainly overdone.  Can it get  worse before it gets better?  I certainly think so.  </p><p> I think fundamentally this market is underpriced and certainly more  underpriced today than it was yesterday.  I think the problem with this is  we don't know how far our government will go with tariffs down the road to  trade wars versus using this as a negotiating tactic.  </p><p> And it really feels like -- I think -- you know, I think Secretary Ross  just said that.  We hope to get a negotiated settlement.  That's the best  case scenario.  Unfortunately, unintended consequences can creep up on us.  </p><p> So, until something like that turns economic and actually slows the economy  down.  I'll give you a great example.  NAFTA, if we walk away from those  negotiations, we'll lose a half a percentage GDP growth this year.  That's  something we need to make sure we accomplish.  And the same thing would be  true we got an extended trade war.  That would be very bad for the economy.  </p><p> HERERA:  Josh, weigh in on that if you would, because you say that although  a benign outcome is certainly is not guaranteed, the realistic economic  impact may be smaller than perhaps what Wall Street is fearing.  </p><p> FEINMAN:  Yes, you look at the move today, while I think ill-advised, it  affects a very small part of the U.S. economy.  You are talking about less  than less than three-tenths of 1 percent of GDP, even if you get some  retaliatory measures from China and not likely to have big macro  repercussions.  And if this is just a negotiating gambit, OK, it will be  fine.  </p><p> The worry, though, is that it could escalate into something more and it  also that reflects a protectionist mindset, this view that somehow trade is  a zero sum game, trade deficits are a sign of weakness and foreign  malfeasance.  And I think that's deeply misguided view and one that ignores  the tremendous benefits that it accrued from the post-World War II free  trade order, and the damage that could be done undermining that, and the  damage that has been done in the past from protectionist forays.  So,  that's the worry that I have.</p><p> GRIFFETH:  Josh, at this point, we have not had the kind of inflation that  the Fed might be hoping for oddly enough as they start to raise interest  rates.  If we impose these tariffs down the road, that could bring the  inflation back, don't you think?  </p><p> FEINMAN:  It could.  It depends on the scope of the tariffs and so forth.   It would likely be a short-term bump up, though.  What -- not likely to  have the kind of lasting effects on inflation to get inflation back up to 2  percent by itself.  </p><p> HERERA:  So, Art, if you have a long term time horizon as an investor, you  have a confluence of events that are going on, where you have the tariffs  going into effect.  You have Facebook and social media under fire possibly  facing some regulation.  What do you do?  Do you put new money to work in  those sectors because they come down so much or not?  </p><p> HOGAN:  I think you asked the question the best way we should ask that  question.  If your time horizon is as a long term investor, a lot of this  is noise and we won't be talking about it next year.  Unfortunately, you  know, in the news cycle that we're in, we're going to be talking about  these things on a minute by minute basis.  </p><p> So, for example, I think we will see an administration that says these  trade wars or these tariffs have adversely affected the economy and the  market.  Remember, they like use the market as a score card and you will  see a pull back from that.  I think regulation is probably good for social  media.  I think it's the Wild Wild West.  I think it needs some.  I think  we'll see those valuations get replaced by perhaps the more normal towards  what they're doing and I think we'll be fine with that.  </p><p> Right now, there is going to be volatility.  There is more volatility this  year than we have seen in any given year for the last ten years, right?   So, if that makes you stay up at night, then your exposure of the market is  probably a little too high and you should think about ratcheting it down.  </p><p> GRIFFETH:  And quickly, Josh, if this is a headwind for the economy, does  the Fed have to rethink its plan for raising interest rates later this  year?  </p><p> FEINMAN:  If it were a serious headwind, yes.  I think based on what we've  seen so far, it's likely not to turn into that.  But that's the risk.  And  we'll just have to be watching it very carefully.  When you rattle trade  savers, you know, you run the risk of unleashing the adverse economic  consequences.  </p><p> GRIFFETH:  Josh Feinman with Deutsche Asset Management, Art Hogan with B.  Riley FBR -- thank you both for joining us tonight.  </p><p> FEINMAN:  Thank you.</p><p> HOGAN:  Thank you.</p><p> HERERA:  In Washington, the House passed a $1.3 trillion spending bill, the  2,200-page legislation will fund the government until October.  It will  increase military spending and a number of domestic programs.  The measure  now heads to the Senate where it is expected to pass with bipartisan  support.  And the president said that he will sign that bill once it  reaches his desk.  </p><p> GRIFFETH:  Meanwhile, a key congressional committee has asked Facebook CEO  Mark Zuckerberg to testify about that data scandal that improperly accessed  personal information of about 50 million Facebook users.  That pressured  the stock again today.  It's now down more than 10 percent over just the  past week.  </p><p> Julia Boorstin talked to Facebook executive Sheryl Sandberg today about the  controversy and what she plans to do next.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> JULIA BOORSTIN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  With Facebook  shares down 10 percent this week, chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg  weighing in on the data privacy scandal that's raised concerns of users,  investors, regulators, and advertisers.  </p><p> SANDBERG:  This was a huge breach of trust.  People come to Facebook every  day and they depend upon us to protect their data.  And I'm so sorry that  we let so many people down.  </p><p> We spent the last few days trying to get to the bottom of what happened.   Cambridge Analytica never should have had this data.  They told us they  deleted it.  But it is our mistake that we did not verify that.  </p><p> Years ago, we changed platforms so apps get much less data.  But that  really wasn't enough.  </p><p> BOORSTIN:  With advertiser Nestle today raising questions about consumer  privacy, Sandberg stressed their business model does not put consumer data  at risk.  </p><p> SANDBERG:  We provide a free service.  That's an ad-based business model.   And in order to do that, we do not sell your data.  We are able to show  targeted advertising that's relevant to people.  We're able to give  advertisers aggregate anonymous reports, never telling them who you are.  </p><p> We believe that we can operate our service with our current business model,  continue to provide a free service all around the world, and protect  people's data.  But we are going to have to earn that trust.  </p><p> BOORSTIN:  Sandberg saying she wished that she and CEO Mark Zuckerberg had  weighed in on this controversial issue sooner.  She also said that they are  laying out strong steps to prevent this from ever happening again and they  are working to earn back consumers' trust.  </p><p> For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Julia Boorstin in Menlo Park, California.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> HERERA:  J.P. Eggers joins us now to discuss what a regulated Facebook  would look like.  He is a professor of management at New York University's  Stern School of Business.</p><p> Professor, welcome back.  It's always good to have you here.  </p><p> J.P. EGGERS, PROFESSOR OF MANAGEMENT, NEW YORK UNIVERSITY'S STERN SCHOOL OF  BUSINESS:  Thank you very much.  </p><p> HERERA:  You know, one of the clips that was not in Julia's piece was the  question of regulation.  And Ms. Sandberg basically was open to the concept  of regulation, as was Mark Zuckerberg yesterday, which surprised a lot of  people.  It seems to me they think it is a foregone conclusion that that is  coming their way.  </p><p> What do you think?  </p><p> EGGERS:  Well, I think the recognition in a there is obviously been this --  as Ms. Sandberg said, kind of a breach of trust and the implications that  the government and policymakers may want to try and weigh in on that and  the implications of that, I think this becomes real question, can Facebook  kind of help to co-create the regulations that would be put in place that  would govern some degree of control over both advertising and the  management of social media on line?  To me, the real question is, you know,  how deep those regulations would actually go if they were to be put in  place, and how enforceable they would be.  </p><p> There's been discussions around things like transparency in advertising.   But it's unclear how that would work, who would verify that, how that would  be done in any way that would be reliable.  Certainly, the government  doesn't have the resources to go do that, and it's not on Facebook's  interest to take on that responsibility.  </p><p> GRIFFETH:  You anticipated my question, J.P., because I was going to ask  what exactly you need to regulate.  And Mark Zuckerberg acknowledged that  it was transparency in advertising that he felt would be the target there.   But it's not going to be just about Facebook.  We're talking about perhaps  all social media that would be subject to these regulations, right?  </p><p> EGGERS:  Social media and just kind of online media in general.  Look, I  mean, Google is one -- Google is the biggest seller of advertising online.   And if we are talking about ways to try and regulate transparency in  advertising, it would certainly affect Google at least as much if not more  than it would affect Facebook in this way.  Obviously, those two big  players are going to feel kind of a disproportionate volume of any sort of  regulations that gets put in place because they are the main ones who are  selling ads online.  </p><p> But, yes, I think this is the way in which Mark Zuckerberg is trying to  push for this co-creation.  You never want the regulators to come just  after your business.  You want them to be coming after the entire sector so  that there's a level playing field as close as possible for all the firms.  </p><p> HERERA:  Now, a number of these companies, obviously, do business globally  and different countries have different rules about how they can function in  their countries.  The European models are much more conservative than the  U.S. regulations.  Might the companies try and avoid regulation by adopting  some of those European regulations or European rules?  </p><p> EGGERS:  I think certainly the risk would become that if -- if the  companies resisted this sort of regulation, that the most stringent form  available might be the one that's put in place, which would definitely be  bad for their business.  The ability to engage in micro-targeting, even if  they're not selling data externally, but to help and facilitate micro- targeting for advertisers is a huge portion of what makes Facebook  successful.  And to the extent that there are data privacy limits that go  beyond simply disclosure of how your data is used, but actual regulation of  exactly how the data could and couldn't be used, that would be much more  significant for Facebook's bottom line.  </p><p> HERERA:  All right.  J.P. Eggers, thanks so much for joining us again.  </p><p> EGGERS:  Thank you.</p><p> HERERA:  J.P. is with the New York University's Stern School of Business.  </p><p> GRIFFETH:  By the way, Commerce Bank and Mozilla are temporarily pulling  their advertising from Facebook because of this user data controversy.   Commerce Bank cited brand safety and data security.  And in a blog post,  browser maker Mozilla said despite promises from Facebook executives, it  takes issue with the social media company's default privacy setting.   Mozilla said that when Facebook takes stronger action in how it shares  customer data, it will consider returning.  </p><p> HERERA:  It is time to look at some of today's upgrades and downgrades.  </p><p> The auto parts maker Visteon was downgraded two notches to underweight from  overweight at Morgan Stanley.  That's Wall Street's only sell rating on the  stock.  The firm says Visteon could be an acquisition target but the level  of insider selling suggests the deal is unlikely in the near term.  Price  target was cut to $110 a share.  The shares dropped 6 percent to $113.45.  </p><p> Trivago shares were cut to underweight from neutral at J.P. Morgan.  The  analyst there says its hotel search business remains challenged.  The price  target is now $8.  Trivago shares fell 5 percent to $7.40 -- Bill.  </p><p> GRIFFETH:  J.P. Morgan also downgraded online car shopping service provider  TrueCar to under weight from neutral.  The firm is concerned about weak  automotive industry trends overall and the price target, they cut down to  $10 a share.  The stock fell 1 percent to $9.80, just below that.  </p><p> Ralph Lauren's rating was raised to outperform from market perform at Cowen  and Company.  The analyst says that the luxury brand growth could  accelerate as a result of its marketing and digital strategy.  The price  target was raised to $122 a share.  Shares, though, were down along with  the rest of the market, closing 1 percent lower to $107.66.  </p><p> HERERA:  Still ahead, Nike just does it, reporting better than expected  earnings.  And that could set the tone for trading tomorrow.</p><p> (MUSIC)</p><p> GRIFFETH:  Late today, cloud storage company Dropbox priced its IPO above  expectations.  According to CNBC, the highly anticipated offering priced at  $21 a share.  The range was anywhere between $18 and $20.  Dropbox is  expected to start trading tomorrow.  It will be the largest tech IPO since  Snap started trading more than a year ago -- Sue.</p><p> HERERA:  Bill, the Dow component Nike reported better than expected  earnings and revenue fueled by growth in its international sales and its  momentum in China.  The CEO said he sees a sales slump though in the U.S.  reversing.  And that sent the stock initially higher in afterhours trading.  </p><p> Courtney Reagan has more on Nike's results.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> COURTNEY REAGAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Nike's strong  third quarter results driven by strong international sales.  Sales coming  in stronger than expected in Europe, greater China, and Asia Pacific,  though Nike's North America's sales disappoint.  </p><p> CEO Mark Parker says sales direct to consumers rather than through retail  partner like a department store grew double digits internationally, with  China leading the way.  It is been a difficult week for Nike after Parker  sent a memo to employees revealing allegations of inappropriate workplace  behavior had been reported and two executives left in the wake of that  announcement, though Nike didn't directly tie them to those allegations.  </p><p> For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Courtney Reagan.</p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> GRIFFETH:  Chip maker Micron beats expectations.  And that's where we begin  tonight's \"Market Focus\".  </p><p> After the bell, the company said that broad-based demand for its memory and  storage products led to a strong quarter.  The company expects that to  continue.  That's why it gave guidance for the current quarter above  estimates.  Shares were volatile in the after-hours.  They finished the  regular session, though, down more than 3 percent at $58.92.</p><p> Higher selling prices helped earnings topped estimates at home builder KB  Home.  Orders rose and they were also stronger than expected.  But  investors focused on revenue which came in late.  Shares were volatile in  after-hours and finished the regular session down 3 percent at $28.84.</p><p> Darden said that an increase in the number of restaurants in operation  helped profits topped expectations.  The owner of Olive Garden and LongHorn  Steakhouse said that it raised its earnings guidance for the rest of the  year.  Overall sales, though, were a sore spot for this quarter.  They rose  less than anticipated.  Darden shares off nearly 8 percent today to $85.94.</p><p> HERERA:  New product launches helped G-III apparel grow sales and profit  above street expectations.  But the owner of brands like Tommy Hilfiger and  Calvin Klein gave guidance for 2019 that was below street estimates.   Shares of G-III plunged 12 percent today to $33.01.  </p><p> Carnival said a rise onboard spending helped that cruise line topped both  sales and profit expectations.  The company said demand remains strong.   Carnival shares fell 1 percent to $66.20.  </p><p> GRIFFETH:  Coming up, AT&amp;T spars with the U.S. government.  At stake, $85  billion, and Time Warner.  We head to court, next.  </p><p> (MUSIC)</p><p> GRIFFEH:  The biggest antitrust case in a generation is finally gotten  underway.  The Justice Department, as you know, is suing to block AT&amp;T's  $85 billion merger with Time Warner.  </p><p> Hampton Pearson is at the courthouse for us tonight -- Hampton.  </p><p> HAMPTON PEARSON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Well, Bill, this  was like really opening day of that long awaited legal battle between the  Department of Justice antitrust and AT&amp;T Time Warner.  Opening arguments  attended by, among others, AT&amp;T's CEO Randall Stephenson, as well as his  Time Warner colleague Jeff Bewkes.  What they heard once they were in court  is the government in essence saying that this merger would see consumers  paying higher prices and less innovation going forward for all of the video  however they choose to receive it, whether it's on a TV, smart phone, or  tablet going forward.  </p><p> The lead government lawyer even said in court that AT&amp;T would use Time  Warner as a weapon against its competitors and to some degree against  consumers in future negotiations going forward because Time Warner is  considered to be must-have content.  </p><p> On the flip side, AT&amp;T says the government has it backwards.  They have to  get in the game because of the likes of Facebook, Netflix, Amazon and  Google that are getting more and more subscribers in their online formats  and frankly twinning to win the war with advertisers.  This trial is  expected to last six to eight weeks.  We're just getting started.  </p><p> GRIFFETH:  All right.  Hampton Pearson for us in Washington tonight --  thank you, Hampton.  </p><p> And there's more sad news from the Toys \"R\" Us world tonight.  The founder  of the toy retailer has passed away at the age of 84.  The great Charles  Lazarus, he founded the company 70 years ago.  He rightly anticipated that  the post-war baby boom would create demand for baby supplies and toys.   Boy, was he right.  </p><p> He remained CEO of the company until 1994, and the man who succeeded him  called Charles Lazarus the father of the toy business.  </p><p> HERERA:  Before we go, here's another look at today's selloff on Wall  Street.  And it accelerated as we went into the close.  The Dow Jones  Industrial Average finished down 724 points to 23,957.  The Nasdaq lost  178, almost 179 points to 7,166.  And the S&amp;P lost 68 points.  </p><p> So, quite a day on the street.  </p><p> GRIFFETH:  Indeed.  </p><p> HERERA:  That does it for us tonight.  I'm Sue Herera.  Thanks for joining  us.  </p><p> GRIFFETH:  I'm Bill Griffeth.  Have a great evening.  See you tomorrow.</p><p> END</p><p> Nightly Business Report transcripts and video are available on-line post  broadcast at <url normalizedValue=\"http://nbr.com\">http://nbr.com</url>.

But is the next step regulation?  </p><p>Those stories and more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for this  Thursday, March the 22nd.  </p><p>HERERA:  Good evening, everyone, and welcome.  </p><p>A sell off on Wall Street.  All 30 Dow components closed lower, about two- thirds of the stocks in that index fell more than 1 percent today.  Half of  the S&amp;P 500 is now in correction territory.  </p><p>Investors became unnerved after the White House unveiled a new round of  tariffs that some fear could threaten the trade war with China, the world's  second largest economy.  So, by the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average  had plunged 724 points to 23,957, a nearly 3 percent decline.  The Nasdaq  fell 178.  And the S&amp;P 500 lost 68.  </p><p>The biggest losers on the Dow were the major industrials like Caterpillar,  Boeing, and 3M.  </p><p>Bob Pisani reports tonight on that selloff from the New York Stock  Exchange.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BOB PISANI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Stocks closed right  around their worst levels of the session with the Dow down more than 700  points.  That's right, 700 points.  </p><p>The markets are clearly concerned about two things.  Number one,  technology.  And number two, trade.  Two big issues.  </p><p>President Donald Trump announced he would be imposing tariffs of up to $60  billion on Chinese goods over the next few weeks.  No details on which  products will be taxed by how much yet.  But he did say there would be a  30-day grace period to negotiate those terms.  </p><p>Shares of U.S. and other metals and mining stocks got slammed on news that  Trump will be exempting a handful of allies from steel and aluminum  tariffs, including the European Unions, South Korea and Brazil.  In fact,  U.S. steel is down 20 percent since those tariffs were first announced a  few weeks ago.  It looks like they are not as tough as some people thought  they might be.</p><p>Facebook is facing an existential crisis right now.  In fact, the whole  social media group is.  And that's weighing heavily on all the other social  media stocks.  The stock market has lost its team leadership group,  technology, and social media is part of that.  And there's really nothing  taking its place.  The subsectors that powered tech high, which were  semiconductors and the FANG names, your Facebook, your Apples, and your  Amazons, they stopped advancing and in most cases, they reversed.  </p><p>So, once those FANG and semiconductor stocks stopped going up in the second  week of March, the market stalled out because no other sector has stepped  forward to lead the market higher.  Industrials and materials are suffering  from these trade war concerns.  FANGs can't move higher without the help of  higher volume.  That's not happening.  </p><p>On top of that, drama in Washington is still on the front burner.  Stocks  did fall earlier on word in a John Dowd, President Trump's lead lawyer in  the Russia probe had resigned.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Bob Pisani at the New York Stock Exchange.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Mike Santoli is also at the New York Stock Exchange.  He joins  us tonight with some more insights on this decline.</p><p>I think you were the one who coined the term tariff tantrum.  Is that -- is  that all we saw today, or was there more going on, do you think?  </p><p>MIKE SANTOLI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  I don't take the  blame or the credit for that one.</p><p>Yes, I don't think it was all we were seeing today but I think that was the  added element this morning, right at the outset, that came upon a market  that also was already concerned about this general notion that interest  rates are going up, this Fed is looking for opportunities to bring rates  higher if they can, if the economic data allow for that.  And then, you  know, as Bob was saying, the loss of leadership from the big tech group,  which a lot of investors I think were hiding in because it seems seemed  like they could grow in almost any environment.  </p><p>But the tariff issue is a reminder that policy across a bunch of fronts,  whether it is trade or monetary policy have turned a little bit less  friendly than we got used to last year.  </p><p>HERERA:  The volume, though, Mike.  I mean, it didn't seem like they were  just throwing stocks out the window today.  Was that mostly the  professionals who were selling?  </p><p>SANTOLI:  Interesting.  No, you are absolutely right, Sue.  It was not a  feeling of panic.  It was not this mass liquidation of stocks.  As a matter  of fact, a couple of folks are pointing out that small cap stocks had  outperformed the large cap indexes.  </p><p>So, the more domestically focused businesses seemed like they were not  caught up in this selloff quite much.  The volumes weren't that high.  The  volatility index definitely got up there, but not at levels we saw in early  February.  So, it was a somewhat lower intensity selloff than what we did  see in early February.  </p><p>Whether that something that means that folks are more likely to buy it at  this level or not is not clear, but it definitely was not indiscriminate.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Mike Santoli at the New York Stock Exchange for us tonight --  thanks, Mike.  </p><p>SANTOLI:  Thank you.</p><p>HERERA:  So, as we mentioned, the president did announce his toughest trade  action to date.  And as Kayla Tausche reports from Washington, there are  fears of more to come.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>KAYLA TAUSCHE, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  President Trump  signed an order that paved the way for steep tariffs on a wide range of  Chinese imports.  The move marks the end of its seven-month investigation  into Chinese tactics to challenge U.S. technology dominance.  </p><p>TRUMP:  We have a tremendous intellectual property situation going on.  So,  we're going to get it taken care of.  And frankly, it's going to make us a  much stronger, much richer nation.  </p><p>TAUSCHE:  The action comes as the U.S. is imposing tariffs on all imports  of steel and aluminum with certain allies and products exempted, and on top  of tariffs on Chinese made solar panels.  U.S. exporters including soybean  farmers, pork producers, and aircraft maker Boeing are bracing for a  counter-punch from China, which says it will take all necessary measures to  safeguard its interests.  </p><p>U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer told lawmakers that kind of  retaliation is unfair but doesn't change things.  </p><p>ROBERT LIGHTHIZER, U.S. TRADE REPRESENTATIVE:  It's not possible to take  the position that because we are soybean farmers, we're not going to stick  up for our rights in a whole variety of ways and have hundreds of billions  of dollars worth of exporters and domestic producers be punished because of  unfair trade.  </p><p>TAUSCHE:  There CEO of engine maker Cummins, Tom Linebarger, fears the  administration's approach is leading to a trade war.  </p><p>TOM LINEBARGER, CEO CUMMINS:  We agree there are challenges in China.  We  just want to address it in a different way, a way that's proven effective  over many, many decades, as opposed to unilateral tariffs which have always  proven ineffective.  </p><p>TAUSCHE:  But Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross says those fears are  overblown.  </p><p>WILBUR ROSS, COMMERCE SECRETARY:  I think there will be some ultimate  retaliation, but I don't think it's going to be the end of the earth.   There may be some firing shots over the bow.  But I believe at the end of  the day, this will end up in a negotiated settlement.  </p><p>TAUSCHE:  A senior administration official tells me this is just the  kickoff to a set of multiple penalties against China and that further  actions, namely restrictions on Chinese investments in the United States,  could be unveiled in the coming days.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Kayla Tausche in Washington.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  And joining us right now to talk more about the new tariffs and  the impact they could have on the markets and the economy, joining us  tonight, Art Hogan.  He's chief market strategist with B. Riley FBR.  And  Josh Feinman is global chief economist at Deutsche Asset Management.  </p><p>Good to see you both.  </p><p>JOSHUA FEINMAN, DEUTSCHE ASSET MANAGEMENT GLOBAL CHIEF ECONOMIST:  Good to  be here.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  Art, how do you -- do you step aside and let things clear out or  do you see opportunities already presenting themselves as a result of these  tariffs being imposed?  </p><p>ART HOGAN, B. RILEY FBR CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST:  That's such a good  question.  And I think you have to think about that three ways.  Yes, I  think we overdo the selloffs, and today was certainly overdone.  Can it get  worse before it gets better?  I certainly think so.  </p><p>I think fundamentally this market is underpriced and certainly more  underpriced today than it was yesterday.  I think the problem with this is  we don't know how far our government will go with tariffs down the road to  trade wars versus using this as a negotiating tactic.  </p><p>And it really feels like -- I think -- you know, I think Secretary Ross  just said that.  We hope to get a negotiated settlement.  That's the best  case scenario.  Unfortunately, unintended consequences can creep up on us.  </p><p>So, until something like that turns economic and actually slows the economy  down.  I'll give you a great example.  NAFTA, if we walk away from those  negotiations, we'll lose a half a percentage GDP growth this year.  That's  something we need to make sure we accomplish.  And the same thing would be  true we got an extended trade war.  That would be very bad for the economy.  </p><p>HERERA:  Josh, weigh in on that if you would, because you say that although  a benign outcome is certainly is not guaranteed, the realistic economic  impact may be smaller than perhaps what Wall Street is fearing.  </p><p>FEINMAN:  Yes, you look at the move today, while I think ill-advised, it  affects a very small part of the U.S. economy.  You are talking about less  than less than three-tenths of 1 percent of GDP, even if you get some  retaliatory measures from China and not likely to have big macro  repercussions.  And if this is just a negotiating gambit, OK, it will be  fine.  </p><p>The worry, though, is that it could escalate into something more and it  also that reflects a protectionist mindset, this view that somehow trade is  a zero sum game, trade deficits are a sign of weakness and foreign  malfeasance.  And I think that's deeply misguided view and one that ignores  the tremendous benefits that it accrued from the post-World War II free  trade order, and the damage that could be done undermining that, and the  damage that has been done in the past from protectionist forays.  So,  that's the worry that I have.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Josh, at this point, we have not had the kind of inflation that  the Fed might be hoping for oddly enough as they start to raise interest  rates.  If we impose these tariffs down the road, that could bring the  inflation back, don't you think?  </p><p>FEINMAN:  It could.  It depends on the scope of the tariffs and so forth.   It would likely be a short-term bump up, though.  What -- not likely to  have the kind of lasting effects on inflation to get inflation back up to 2  percent by itself.  </p><p>HERERA:  So, Art, if you have a long term time horizon as an investor, you  have a confluence of events that are going on, where you have the tariffs  going into effect.  You have Facebook and social media under fire possibly  facing some regulation.  What do you do?  Do you put new money to work in  those sectors because they come down so much or not?  </p><p>HOGAN:  I think you asked the question the best way we should ask that  question.  If your time horizon is as a long term investor, a lot of this  is noise and we won't be talking about it next year.  Unfortunately, you  know, in the news cycle that we're in, we're going to be talking about  these things on a minute by minute basis.  </p><p>So, for example, I think we will see an administration that says these  trade wars or these tariffs have adversely affected the economy and the  market.  Remember, they like use the market as a score card and you will  see a pull back from that.  I think regulation is probably good for social  media.  I think it's the Wild Wild West.  I think it needs some.  I think  we'll see those valuations get replaced by perhaps the more normal towards  what they're doing and I think we'll be fine with that.  </p><p>Right now, there is going to be volatility.  There is more volatility this  year than we have seen in any given year for the last ten years, right?   So, if that makes you stay up at night, then your exposure of the market is  probably a little too high and you should think about ratcheting it down.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  And quickly, Josh, if this is a headwind for the economy, does  the Fed have to rethink its plan for raising interest rates later this  year?  </p><p>FEINMAN:  If it were a serious headwind, yes.  I think based on what we've  seen so far, it's likely not to turn into that.  But that's the risk.  And  we'll just have to be watching it very carefully.  When you rattle trade  savers, you know, you run the risk of unleashing the adverse economic  consequences.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  Josh Feinman with Deutsche Asset Management, Art Hogan with B.  Riley FBR -- thank you both for joining us tonight.  </p><p>FEINMAN:  Thank you.</p><p>HOGAN:  Thank you.</p><p>HERERA:  In Washington, the House passed a $1.3 trillion spending bill, the  2,200-page legislation will fund the government until October.  It will  increase military spending and a number of domestic programs.  The measure  now heads to the Senate where it is expected to pass with bipartisan  support.  And the president said that he will sign that bill once it  reaches his desk.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  Meanwhile, a key congressional committee has asked Facebook CEO  Mark Zuckerberg to testify about that data scandal that improperly accessed  personal information of about 50 million Facebook users.  That pressured  the stock again today.  It's now down more than 10 percent over just the  past week.  </p><p>Julia Boorstin talked to Facebook executive Sheryl Sandberg today about the  controversy and what she plans to do next.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JULIA BOORSTIN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  With Facebook  shares down 10 percent this week, chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg  weighing in on the data privacy scandal that's raised concerns of users,  investors, regulators, and advertisers.  </p><p>SANDBERG:  This was a huge breach of trust.  People come to Facebook every  day and they depend upon us to protect their data.  And I'm so sorry that  we let so many people down.  </p><p>We spent the last few days trying to get to the bottom of what happened.   Cambridge Analytica never should have had this data.  They told us they  deleted it.  But it is our mistake that we did not verify that.  </p><p>Years ago, we changed platforms so apps get much less data.  But that  really wasn't enough.  </p><p>BOORSTIN:  With advertiser Nestle today raising questions about consumer  privacy, Sandberg stressed their business model does not put consumer data  at risk.  </p><p>SANDBERG:  We provide a free service.  That's an ad-based business model.   And in order to do that, we do not sell your data.  We are able to show  targeted advertising that's relevant to people.  We're able to give  advertisers aggregate anonymous reports, never telling them who you are.  </p><p>We believe that we can operate our service with our current business model,  continue to provide a free service all around the world, and protect  people's data.  But we are going to have to earn that trust.  </p><p>BOORSTIN:  Sandberg saying she wished that she and CEO Mark Zuckerberg had  weighed in on this controversial issue sooner.  She also said that they are  laying out strong steps to prevent this from ever happening again and they  are working to earn back consumers' trust.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Julia Boorstin in Menlo Park, California.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  J.P. Eggers joins us now to discuss what a regulated Facebook  would look like.  He is a professor of management at New York University's  Stern School of Business.</p><p>Professor, welcome back.  It's always good to have you here.  </p><p>J.P. EGGERS, PROFESSOR OF MANAGEMENT, NEW YORK UNIVERSITY'S STERN SCHOOL OF  BUSINESS:  Thank you very much.  </p><p>HERERA:  You know, one of the clips that was not in Julia's piece was the  question of regulation.  And Ms. Sandberg basically was open to the concept  of regulation, as was Mark Zuckerberg yesterday, which surprised a lot of  people.  It seems to me they think it is a foregone conclusion that that is  coming their way.  </p><p>What do you think?  </p><p>EGGERS:  Well, I think the recognition in a there is obviously been this --  as Ms. Sandberg said, kind of a breach of trust and the implications that  the government and policymakers may want to try and weigh in on that and  the implications of that, I think this becomes real question, can Facebook  kind of help to co-create the regulations that would be put in place that  would govern some degree of control over both advertising and the  management of social media on line?  To me, the real question is, you know,  how deep those regulations would actually go if they were to be put in  place, and how enforceable they would be.  </p><p>There's been discussions around things like transparency in advertising.   But it's unclear how that would work, who would verify that, how that would  be done in any way that would be reliable.  Certainly, the government  doesn't have the resources to go do that, and it's not on Facebook's  interest to take on that responsibility.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  You anticipated my question, J.P., because I was going to ask  what exactly you need to regulate.  And Mark Zuckerberg acknowledged that  it was transparency in advertising that he felt would be the target there.   But it's not going to be just about Facebook.  We're talking about perhaps  all social media that would be subject to these regulations, right?  </p><p>EGGERS:  Social media and just kind of online media in general.  Look, I  mean, Google is one -- Google is the biggest seller of advertising online.   And if we are talking about ways to try and regulate transparency in  advertising, it would certainly affect Google at least as much if not more  than it would affect Facebook in this way.  Obviously, those two big  players are going to feel kind of a disproportionate volume of any sort of  regulations that gets put in place because they are the main ones who are  selling ads online.  </p><p>But, yes, I think this is the way in which Mark Zuckerberg is trying to  push for this co-creation.  You never want the regulators to come just  after your business.  You want them to be coming after the entire sector so  that there's a level playing field as close as possible for all the firms.  </p><p>HERERA:  Now, a number of these companies, obviously, do business globally  and different countries have different rules about how they can function in  their countries.  The European models are much more conservative than the  U.S. regulations.  Might the companies try and avoid regulation by adopting  some of those European regulations or European rules?  </p><p>EGGERS:  I think certainly the risk would become that if -- if the  companies resisted this sort of regulation, that the most stringent form  available might be the one that's put in place, which would definitely be  bad for their business.  The ability to engage in micro-targeting, even if  they're not selling data externally, but to help and facilitate micro- targeting for advertisers is a huge portion of what makes Facebook  successful.  And to the extent that there are data privacy limits that go  beyond simply disclosure of how your data is used, but actual regulation of  exactly how the data could and couldn't be used, that would be much more  significant for Facebook's bottom line.  </p><p>HERERA:  All right.  J.P. Eggers, thanks so much for joining us again.  </p><p>EGGERS:  Thank you.</p><p>HERERA:  J.P. is with the New York University's Stern School of Business.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  By the way, Commerce Bank and Mozilla are temporarily pulling  their advertising from Facebook because of this user data controversy.   Commerce Bank cited brand safety and data security.  And in a blog post,  browser maker Mozilla said despite promises from Facebook executives, it  takes issue with the social media company's default privacy setting.   Mozilla said that when Facebook takes stronger action in how it shares  customer data, it will consider returning.  </p><p>HERERA:  It is time to look at some of today's upgrades and downgrades.  </p><p>The auto parts maker Visteon was downgraded two notches to underweight from  overweight at Morgan Stanley.  That's Wall Street's only sell rating on the  stock.  The firm says Visteon could be an acquisition target but the level  of insider selling suggests the deal is unlikely in the near term.  Price  target was cut to $110 a share.  The shares dropped 6 percent to $113.45.  </p><p>Trivago shares were cut to underweight from neutral at J.P. Morgan.  The  analyst there says its hotel search business remains challenged.  The price  target is now $8.  Trivago shares fell 5 percent to $7.40 -- Bill.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  J.P. Morgan also downgraded online car shopping service provider  TrueCar to under weight from neutral.  The firm is concerned about weak  automotive industry trends overall and the price target, they cut down to  $10 a share.  The stock fell 1 percent to $9.80, just below that.  </p><p>Ralph Lauren's rating was raised to outperform from market perform at Cowen  and Company.  The analyst says that the luxury brand growth could  accelerate as a result of its marketing and digital strategy.  The price  target was raised to $122 a share.  Shares, though, were down along with  the rest of the market, closing 1 percent lower to $107.66.  </p><p>HERERA:  Still ahead, Nike just does it, reporting better than expected  earnings.  And that could set the tone for trading tomorrow.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Late today, cloud storage company Dropbox priced its IPO above  expectations.  According to CNBC, the highly anticipated offering priced at  $21 a share.  The range was anywhere between $18 and $20.  Dropbox is  expected to start trading tomorrow.  It will be the largest tech IPO since  Snap started trading more than a year ago -- Sue.</p><p>HERERA:  Bill, the Dow component Nike reported better than expected  earnings and revenue fueled by growth in its international sales and its  momentum in China.  The CEO said he sees a sales slump though in the U.S.  reversing.  And that sent the stock initially higher in afterhours trading.  </p><p>Courtney Reagan has more on Nike's results.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>COURTNEY REAGAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Nike's strong  third quarter results driven by strong international sales.  Sales coming  in stronger than expected in Europe, greater China, and Asia Pacific,  though Nike's North America's sales disappoint.  </p><p>CEO Mark Parker says sales direct to consumers rather than through retail  partner like a department store grew double digits internationally, with  China leading the way.  It is been a difficult week for Nike after Parker  sent a memo to employees revealing allegations of inappropriate workplace  behavior had been reported and two executives left in the wake of that  announcement, though Nike didn't directly tie them to those allegations.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Courtney Reagan.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Chip maker Micron beats expectations.  And that's where we begin  tonight's \"Market Focus\".  </p><p>After the bell, the company said that broad-based demand for its memory and  storage products led to a strong quarter.  The company expects that to  continue.  That's why it gave guidance for the current quarter above  estimates.  Shares were volatile in the after-hours.  They finished the  regular session, though, down more than 3 percent at $58.92.</p><p>Higher selling prices helped earnings topped estimates at home builder KB  Home.  Orders rose and they were also stronger than expected.  But  investors focused on revenue which came in late.  Shares were volatile in  after-hours and finished the regular session down 3 percent at $28.84.</p><p>Darden said that an increase in the number of restaurants in operation  helped profits topped expectations.  The owner of Olive Garden and LongHorn  Steakhouse said that it raised its earnings guidance for the rest of the  year.  Overall sales, though, were a sore spot for this quarter.  They rose  less than anticipated.  Darden shares off nearly 8 percent today to $85.94.</p><p>HERERA:  New product launches helped G-III apparel grow sales and profit  above street expectations.  But the owner of brands like Tommy Hilfiger and  Calvin Klein gave guidance for 2019 that was below street estimates.   Shares of G-III plunged 12 percent today to $33.01.  </p><p>Carnival said a rise onboard spending helped that cruise line topped both  sales and profit expectations.  The company said demand remains strong.   Carnival shares fell 1 percent to $66.20.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  Coming up, AT&amp;T spars with the U.S. government.  At stake, $85  billion, and Time Warner.  We head to court, next.  </p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GRIFFEH:  The biggest antitrust case in a generation is finally gotten  underway.  The Justice Department, as you know, is suing to block AT&amp;T's  $85 billion merger with Time Warner.  </p><p>Hampton Pearson is at the courthouse for us tonight -- Hampton.  </p><p>HAMPTON PEARSON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Well, Bill, this  was like really opening day of that long awaited legal battle between the  Department of Justice antitrust and AT&amp;T Time Warner.  Opening arguments  attended by, among others, AT&amp;T's CEO Randall Stephenson, as well as his  Time Warner colleague Jeff Bewkes.  What they heard once they were in court  is the government in essence saying that this merger would see consumers  paying higher prices and less innovation going forward for all of the video  however they choose to receive it, whether it's on a TV, smart phone, or  tablet going forward.  </p><p>The lead government lawyer even said in court that AT&amp;T would use Time  Warner as a weapon against its competitors and to some degree against  consumers in future negotiations going forward because Time Warner is  considered to be must-have content.  </p><p>On the flip side, AT&amp;T says the government has it backwards.  They have to  get in the game because of the likes of Facebook, Netflix, Amazon and  Google that are getting more and more subscribers in their online formats  and frankly twinning to win the war with advertisers.  This trial is  expected to last six to eight weeks.  We're just getting started.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  All right.  Hampton Pearson for us in Washington tonight --  thank you, Hampton.  </p><p>And there's more sad news from the Toys \"R\" Us world tonight.  The founder  of the toy retailer has passed away at the age of 84.  The great Charles  Lazarus, he founded the company 70 years ago.  He rightly anticipated that  the post-war baby boom would create demand for baby supplies and toys.   Boy, was he right.  </p><p>He remained CEO of the company until 1994, and the man who succeeded him  called Charles Lazarus the father of the toy business.  </p><p>HERERA:  Before we go, here's another look at today's selloff on Wall  Street.  And it accelerated as we went into the close.  The Dow Jones  Industrial Average finished down 724 points to 23,957.  The Nasdaq lost  178, almost 179 points to 7,166.  And the S&amp;P lost 68 points.  </p><p>So, quite a day on the street.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  Indeed.  </p><p>HERERA:  That does it for us tonight.  I'm Sue Herera.  Thanks for joining  us.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  I'm Bill Griffeth.  Have a great evening.  See you tomorrow.</p><p>END</p><p>Nightly Business Report transcripts and video are available on-line post  broadcast at <url normalizedValue=\"http://nbr.com\">http://nbr.com</url>.

But is the next step regulation?  </p><p>Those stories and more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for this  Thursday, March the 22nd.  </p><p>HERERA:  Good evening, everyone, and welcome.  </p><p>A sell off on Wall Street.  All 30 Dow components closed lower, about two- thirds of the stocks in that index fell more than 1 percent today.  Half of  the S&amp;P 500 is now in correction territory.  </p><p>Investors became unnerved after the White House unveiled a new round of  tariffs that some fear could threaten the trade war with China, the world's  second largest economy.  So, by the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average  had plunged 724 points to 23,957, a nearly 3 percent decline.  The Nasdaq  fell 178.  And the S&amp;P 500 lost 68.  </p><p>The biggest losers on the Dow were the major industrials like Caterpillar,  Boeing, and 3M.  </p><p>Bob Pisani reports tonight on that selloff from the New York Stock  Exchange.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BOB PISANI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Stocks closed right  around their worst levels of the session with the Dow down more than 700  points.  That's right, 700 points.  </p><p>The markets are clearly concerned about two things.  Number one,  technology.  And number two, trade.  Two big issues.  </p><p>President Donald Trump announced he would be imposing tariffs of up to $60  billion on Chinese goods over the next few weeks.  No details on which  products will be taxed by how much yet.  But he did say there would be a  30-day grace period to negotiate those terms.  </p><p>Shares of U.S. and other metals and mining stocks got slammed on news that  Trump will be exempting a handful of allies from steel and aluminum  tariffs, including the European Unions, South Korea and Brazil.  In fact,  U.S. steel is down 20 percent since those tariffs were first announced a  few weeks ago.  It looks like they are not as tough as some people thought  they might be.</p><p>Facebook is facing an existential crisis right now.  In fact, the whole  social media group is.  And that's weighing heavily on all the other social  media stocks.  The stock market has lost its team leadership group,  technology, and social media is part of that.  And there's really nothing  taking its place.  The subsectors that powered tech high, which were  semiconductors and the FANG names, your Facebook, your Apples, and your  Amazons, they stopped advancing and in most cases, they reversed.  </p><p>So, once those FANG and semiconductor stocks stopped going up in the second  week of March, the market stalled out because no other sector has stepped  forward to lead the market higher.  Industrials and materials are suffering  from these trade war concerns.  FANGs can't move higher without the help of  higher volume.  That's not happening.  </p><p>On top of that, drama in Washington is still on the front burner.  Stocks  did fall earlier on word in a John Dowd, President Trump's lead lawyer in  the Russia probe had resigned.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Bob Pisani at the New York Stock Exchange.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Mike Santoli is also at the New York Stock Exchange.  He joins  us tonight with some more insights on this decline.</p><p>I think you were the one who coined the term tariff tantrum.  Is that -- is  that all we saw today, or was there more going on, do you think?  </p><p>MIKE SANTOLI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  I don't take the  blame or the credit for that one.</p><p>Yes, I don't think it was all we were seeing today but I think that was the  added element this morning, right at the outset, that came upon a market  that also was already concerned about this general notion that interest  rates are going up, this Fed is looking for opportunities to bring rates  higher if they can, if the economic data allow for that.  And then, you  know, as Bob was saying, the loss of leadership from the big tech group,  which a lot of investors I think were hiding in because it seems seemed  like they could grow in almost any environment.  </p><p>But the tariff issue is a reminder that policy across a bunch of fronts,  whether it is trade or monetary policy have turned a little bit less  friendly than we got used to last year.  </p><p>HERERA:  The volume, though, Mike.  I mean, it didn't seem like they were  just throwing stocks out the window today.  Was that mostly the  professionals who were selling?  </p><p>SANTOLI:  Interesting.  No, you are absolutely right, Sue.  It was not a  feeling of panic.  It was not this mass liquidation of stocks.  As a matter  of fact, a couple of folks are pointing out that small cap stocks had  outperformed the large cap indexes.  </p><p>So, the more domestically focused businesses seemed like they were not  caught up in this selloff quite much.  The volumes weren't that high.  The  volatility index definitely got up there, but not at levels we saw in early  February.  So, it was a somewhat lower intensity selloff than what we did  see in early February.  </p><p>Whether that something that means that folks are more likely to buy it at  this level or not is not clear, but it definitely was not indiscriminate.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Mike Santoli at the New York Stock Exchange for us tonight --  thanks, Mike.  </p><p>SANTOLI:  Thank you.</p><p>HERERA:  So, as we mentioned, the president did announce his toughest trade  action to date.  And as Kayla Tausche reports from Washington, there are  fears of more to come.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>KAYLA TAUSCHE, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  President Trump  signed an order that paved the way for steep tariffs on a wide range of  Chinese imports.  The move marks the end of its seven-month investigation  into Chinese tactics to challenge U.S. technology dominance.  </p><p>TRUMP:  We have a tremendous intellectual property situation going on.  So,  we're going to get it taken care of.  And frankly, it's going to make us a  much stronger, much richer nation.  </p><p>TAUSCHE:  The action comes as the U.S. is imposing tariffs on all imports  of steel and aluminum with certain allies and products exempted, and on top  of tariffs on Chinese made solar panels.  U.S. exporters including soybean  farmers, pork producers, and aircraft maker Boeing are bracing for a  counter-punch from China, which says it will take all necessary measures to  safeguard its interests.  </p><p>U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer told lawmakers that kind of  retaliation is unfair but doesn't change things.  </p><p>ROBERT LIGHTHIZER, U.S. TRADE REPRESENTATIVE:  It's not possible to take  the position that because we are soybean farmers, we're not going to stick  up for our rights in a whole variety of ways and have hundreds of billions  of dollars worth of exporters and domestic producers be punished because of  unfair trade.  </p><p>TAUSCHE:  There CEO of engine maker Cummins, Tom Linebarger, fears the  administration's approach is leading to a trade war.  </p><p>TOM LINEBARGER, CEO CUMMINS:  We agree there are challenges in China.  We  just want to address it in a different way, a way that's proven effective  over many, many decades, as opposed to unilateral tariffs which have always  proven ineffective.  </p><p>TAUSCHE:  But Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross says those fears are  overblown.  </p><p>WILBUR ROSS, COMMERCE SECRETARY:  I think there will be some ultimate  retaliation, but I don't think it's going to be the end of the earth.   There may be some firing shots over the bow.  But I believe at the end of  the day, this will end up in a negotiated settlement.  </p><p>TAUSCHE:  A senior administration official tells me this is just the  kickoff to a set of multiple penalties against China and that further  actions, namely restrictions on Chinese investments in the United States,  could be unveiled in the coming days.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Kayla Tausche in Washington.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  And joining us right now to talk more about the new tariffs and  the impact they could have on the markets and the economy, joining us  tonight, Art Hogan.  He's chief market strategist with B. Riley FBR.  And  Josh Feinman is global chief economist at Deutsche Asset Management.  </p><p>Good to see you both.  </p><p>JOSHUA FEINMAN, DEUTSCHE ASSET MANAGEMENT GLOBAL CHIEF ECONOMIST:  Good to  be here.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  Art, how do you -- do you step aside and let things clear out or  do you see opportunities already presenting themselves as a result of these  tariffs being imposed?  </p><p>ART HOGAN, B. RILEY FBR CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST:  That's such a good  question.  And I think you have to think about that three ways.  Yes, I  think we overdo the selloffs, and today was certainly overdone.  Can it get  worse before it gets better?  I certainly think so.  </p><p>I think fundamentally this market is underpriced and certainly more  underpriced today than it was yesterday.  I think the problem with this is  we don't know how far our government will go with tariffs down the road to  trade wars versus using this as a negotiating tactic.  </p><p>And it really feels like -- I think -- you know, I think Secretary Ross  just said that.  We hope to get a negotiated settlement.  That's the best  case scenario.  Unfortunately, unintended consequences can creep up on us.  </p><p>So, until something like that turns economic and actually slows the economy  down.  I'll give you a great example.  NAFTA, if we walk away from those  negotiations, we'll lose a half a percentage GDP growth this year.  That's  something we need to make sure we accomplish.  And the same thing would be  true we got an extended trade war.  That would be very bad for the economy.  </p><p>HERERA:  Josh, weigh in on that if you would, because you say that although  a benign outcome is certainly is not guaranteed, the realistic economic  impact may be smaller than perhaps what Wall Street is fearing.  </p><p>FEINMAN:  Yes, you look at the move today, while I think ill-advised, it  affects a very small part of the U.S. economy.  You are talking about less  than less than three-tenths of 1 percent of GDP, even if you get some  retaliatory measures from China and not likely to have big macro  repercussions.  And if this is just a negotiating gambit, OK, it will be  fine.  </p><p>The worry, though, is that it could escalate into something more and it  also that reflects a protectionist mindset, this view that somehow trade is  a zero sum game, trade deficits are a sign of weakness and foreign  malfeasance.  And I think that's deeply misguided view and one that ignores  the tremendous benefits that it accrued from the post-World War II free  trade order, and the damage that could be done undermining that, and the  damage that has been done in the past from protectionist forays.  So,  that's the worry that I have.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Josh, at this point, we have not had the kind of inflation that  the Fed might be hoping for oddly enough as they start to raise interest  rates.  If we impose these tariffs down the road, that could bring the  inflation back, don't you think?  </p><p>FEINMAN:  It could.  It depends on the scope of the tariffs and so forth.   It would likely be a short-term bump up, though.  What -- not likely to  have the kind of lasting effects on inflation to get inflation back up to 2  percent by itself.  </p><p>HERERA:  So, Art, if you have a long term time horizon as an investor, you  have a confluence of events that are going on, where you have the tariffs  going into effect.  You have Facebook and social media under fire possibly  facing some regulation.  What do you do?  Do you put new money to work in  those sectors because they come down so much or not?  </p><p>HOGAN:  I think you asked the question the best way we should ask that  question.  If your time horizon is as a long term investor, a lot of this  is noise and we won't be talking about it next year.  Unfortunately, you  know, in the news cycle that we're in, we're going to be talking about  these things on a minute by minute basis.  </p><p>So, for example, I think we will see an administration that says these  trade wars or these tariffs have adversely affected the economy and the  market.  Remember, they like use the market as a score card and you will  see a pull back from that.  I think regulation is probably good for social  media.  I think it's the Wild Wild West.  I think it needs some.  I think  we'll see those valuations get replaced by perhaps the more normal towards  what they're doing and I think we'll be fine with that.  </p><p>Right now, there is going to be volatility.  There is more volatility this  year than we have seen in any given year for the last ten years, right?   So, if that makes you stay up at night, then your exposure of the market is  probably a little too high and you should think about ratcheting it down.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  And quickly, Josh, if this is a headwind for the economy, does  the Fed have to rethink its plan for raising interest rates later this  year?  </p><p>FEINMAN:  If it were a serious headwind, yes.  I think based on what we've  seen so far, it's likely not to turn into that.  But that's the risk.  And  we'll just have to be watching it very carefully.  When you rattle trade  savers, you know, you run the risk of unleashing the adverse economic  consequences.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  Josh Feinman with Deutsche Asset Management, Art Hogan with B.  Riley FBR -- thank you both for joining us tonight.  </p><p>FEINMAN:  Thank you.</p><p>HOGAN:  Thank you.</p><p>HERERA:  In Washington, the House passed a $1.3 trillion spending bill, the  2,200-page legislation will fund the government until October.  It will  increase military spending and a number of domestic programs.  The measure  now heads to the Senate where it is expected to pass with bipartisan  support.  And the president said that he will sign that bill once it  reaches his desk.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  Meanwhile, a key congressional committee has asked Facebook CEO  Mark Zuckerberg to testify about that data scandal that improperly accessed  personal information of about 50 million Facebook users.  That pressured  the stock again today.  It's now down more than 10 percent over just the  past week.  </p><p>Julia Boorstin talked to Facebook executive Sheryl Sandberg today about the  controversy and what she plans to do next.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JULIA BOORSTIN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  With Facebook  shares down 10 percent this week, chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg  weighing in on the data privacy scandal that's raised concerns of users,  investors, regulators, and advertisers.  </p><p>SANDBERG:  This was a huge breach of trust.  People come to Facebook every  day and they depend upon us to protect their data.  And I'm so sorry that  we let so many people down.  </p><p>We spent the last few days trying to get to the bottom of what happened.   Cambridge Analytica never should have had this data.  They told us they  deleted it.  But it is our mistake that we did not verify that.  </p><p>Years ago, we changed platforms so apps get much less data.  But that  really wasn't enough.  </p><p>BOORSTIN:  With advertiser Nestle today raising questions about consumer  privacy, Sandberg stressed their business model does not put consumer data  at risk.  </p><p>SANDBERG:  We provide a free service.  That's an ad-based business model.   And in order to do that, we do not sell your data.  We are able to show  targeted advertising that's relevant to people.  We're able to give  advertisers aggregate anonymous reports, never telling them who you are.  </p><p>We believe that we can operate our service with our current business model,  continue to provide a free service all around the world, and protect  people's data.  But we are going to have to earn that trust.  </p><p>BOORSTIN:  Sandberg saying she wished that she and CEO Mark Zuckerberg had  weighed in on this controversial issue sooner.  She also said that they are  laying out strong steps to prevent this from ever happening again and they  are working to earn back consumers' trust.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Julia Boorstin in Menlo Park, California.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  J.P. Eggers joins us now to discuss what a regulated Facebook  would look like.  He is a professor of management at New York University's  Stern School of Business.</p><p>Professor, welcome back.  It's always good to have you here.  </p><p>J.P. EGGERS, PROFESSOR OF MANAGEMENT, NEW YORK UNIVERSITY'S STERN SCHOOL OF  BUSINESS:  Thank you very much.  </p><p>HERERA:  You know, one of the clips that was not in Julia's piece was the  question of regulation.  And Ms. Sandberg basically was open to the concept  of regulation, as was Mark Zuckerberg yesterday, which surprised a lot of  people.  It seems to me they think it is a foregone conclusion that that is  coming their way.  </p><p>What do you think?  </p><p>EGGERS:  Well, I think the recognition in a there is obviously been this --  as Ms. Sandberg said, kind of a breach of trust and the implications that  the government and policymakers may want to try and weigh in on that and  the implications of that, I think this becomes real question, can Facebook  kind of help to co-create the regulations that would be put in place that  would govern some degree of control over both advertising and the  management of social media on line?  To me, the real question is, you know,  how deep those regulations would actually go if they were to be put in  place, and how enforceable they would be.  </p><p>There's been discussions around things like transparency in advertising.   But it's unclear how that would work, who would verify that, how that would  be done in any way that would be reliable.  Certainly, the government  doesn't have the resources to go do that, and it's not on Facebook's  interest to take on that responsibility.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  You anticipated my question, J.P., because I was going to ask  what exactly you need to regulate.  And Mark Zuckerberg acknowledged that  it was transparency in advertising that he felt would be the target there.   But it's not going to be just about Facebook.  We're talking about perhaps  all social media that would be subject to these regulations, right?  </p><p>EGGERS:  Social media and just kind of online media in general.  Look, I  mean, Google is one -- Google is the biggest seller of advertising online.   And if we are talking about ways to try and regulate transparency in  advertising, it would certainly affect Google at least as much if not more  than it would affect Facebook in this way.  Obviously, those two big  players are going to feel kind of a disproportionate volume of any sort of  regulations that gets put in place because they are the main ones who are  selling ads online.  </p><p>But, yes, I think this is the way in which Mark Zuckerberg is trying to  push for this co-creation.  You never want the regulators to come just  after your business.  You want them to be coming after the entire sector so  that there's a level playing field as close as possible for all the firms.  </p><p>HERERA:  Now, a number of these companies, obviously, do business globally  and different countries have different rules about how they can function in  their countries.  The European models are much more conservative than the  U.S. regulations.  Might the companies try and avoid regulation by adopting  some of those European regulations or European rules?  </p><p>EGGERS:  I think certainly the risk would become that if -- if the  companies resisted this sort of regulation, that the most stringent form  available might be the one that's put in place, which would definitely be  bad for their business.  The ability to engage in micro-targeting, even if  they're not selling data externally, but to help and facilitate micro- targeting for advertisers is a huge portion of what makes Facebook  successful.  And to the extent that there are data privacy limits that go  beyond simply disclosure of how your data is used, but actual regulation of  exactly how the data could and couldn't be used, that would be much more  significant for Facebook's bottom line.  </p><p>HERERA:  All right.  J.P. Eggers, thanks so much for joining us again.  </p><p>EGGERS:  Thank you.</p><p>HERERA:  J.P. is with the New York University's Stern School of Business.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  By the way, Commerce Bank and Mozilla are temporarily pulling  their advertising from Facebook because of this user data controversy.   Commerce Bank cited brand safety and data security.  And in a blog post,  browser maker Mozilla said despite promises from Facebook executives, it  takes issue with the social media company's default privacy setting.

The stock fell 1 percent to $9.80, just below that.  </p><p>Ralph Lauren's rating was raised to outperform from market perform at Cowen  and Company.  The analyst says that the luxury brand growth could  accelerate as a result of its marketing and digital strategy.  The price  target was raised to $122 a share.  Shares, though, were down along with  the rest of the market, closing 1 percent lower to $107.66.  </p><p>HERERA:  Still ahead, Nike just does it, reporting better than expected  earnings.  And that could set the tone for trading tomorrow.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Late today, cloud storage company Dropbox priced its IPO above  expectations.  According to CNBC, the highly anticipated offering priced at  $21 a share.  The range was anywhere between $18 and $20.  Dropbox is  expected to start trading tomorrow.  It will be the largest tech IPO since  Snap started trading more than a year ago -- Sue.</p><p>HERERA:  Bill, the Dow component Nike reported better than expected  earnings and revenue fueled by growth in its international sales and its  momentum in China.  The CEO said he sees a sales slump though in the U.S.  reversing.  And that sent the stock initially higher in afterhours trading.  </p><p>Courtney Reagan has more on Nike's results.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>COURTNEY REAGAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Nike's strong  third quarter results driven by strong international sales.  Sales coming  in stronger than expected in Europe, greater China, and Asia Pacific,  though Nike's North America's sales disappoint.  </p><p>CEO Mark Parker says sales direct to consumers rather than through retail  partner like a department store grew double digits internationally, with  China leading the way.  It is been a difficult week for Nike after Parker  sent a memo to employees revealing allegations of inappropriate workplace  behavior had been reported and two executives left in the wake of that  announcement, though Nike didn't directly tie them to those allegations.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Courtney Reagan.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Chip maker Micron beats expectations.  And that's where we begin  tonight's \"Market Focus\".  </p><p>After the bell, the company said that broad-based demand for its memory and  storage products led to a strong quarter.  The company expects that to  continue.  That's why it gave guidance for the current quarter above  estimates.  Shares were volatile in the after-hours.  They finished the  regular session, though, down more than 3 percent at $58.92.</p><p>Higher selling prices helped earnings topped estimates at home builder KB  Home.  Orders rose and they were also stronger than expected.  But  investors focused on revenue which came in late.  Shares were volatile in  after-hours and finished the regular session down 3 percent at $28.84.</p><p>Darden said that an increase in the number of restaurants in operation  helped profits topped expectations.  The owner of Olive Garden and LongHorn  Steakhouse said that it raised its earnings guidance for the rest of the  year.  Overall sales, though, were a sore spot for this quarter.  They rose  less than anticipated.  Darden shares off nearly 8 percent today to $85.94.</p><p>HERERA:  New product launches helped G-III apparel grow sales and profit  above street expectations.  But the owner of brands like Tommy Hilfiger and  Calvin Klein gave guidance for 2019 that was below street estimates.   Shares of G-III plunged 12 percent today to $33.01.  </p><p>Carnival said a rise onboard spending helped that cruise line topped both  sales and profit expectations.  The company said demand remains strong.   Carnival shares fell 1 percent to $66.20.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  Coming up, AT&amp;T spars with the U.S. government.  At stake, $85  billion, and Time Warner.  We head to court, next.  </p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GRIFFEH:  The biggest antitrust case in a generation is finally gotten  underway.  The Justice Department, as you know, is suing to block AT&amp;T's  $85 billion merger with Time Warner.  </p><p>Hampton Pearson is at the courthouse for us tonight -- Hampton.  </p><p>HAMPTON PEARSON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Well, Bill, this  was like really opening day of that long awaited legal battle between the  Department of Justice antitrust and AT&amp;T Time Warner.  Opening arguments  attended by, among others, AT&amp;T's CEO Randall Stephenson, as well as his  Time Warner colleague Jeff Bewkes.  What they heard once they were in court  is the government in essence saying that this merger would see consumers  paying higher prices and less innovation going forward for all of the video  however they choose to receive it, whether it's on a TV, smart phone, or  tablet going forward.  </p><p>The lead government lawyer even said in court that AT&amp;T would use Time  Warner as a weapon against its competitors and to some degree against  consumers in future negotiations going forward because Time Warner is  considered to be must-have content.  </p><p>On the flip side, AT&amp;T says the government has it backwards.  They have to  get in the game because of the likes of Facebook, Netflix, Amazon and  Google that are getting more and more subscribers in their online formats  and frankly twinning to win the war with advertisers.  This trial is  expected to last six to eight weeks.  We're just getting started.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  All right.  Hampton Pearson for us in Washington tonight --  thank you, Hampton.  </p><p>And there's more sad news from the Toys \"R\" Us world tonight.  The founder  of the toy retailer has passed away at the age of 84.  The great Charles  Lazarus, he founded the company 70 years ago.  He rightly anticipated that  the post-war baby boom would create demand for baby supplies and toys.   Boy, was he right.  </p><p>He remained CEO of the company until 1994, and the man who succeeded him  called Charles Lazarus the father of the toy business.  </p><p>HERERA:  Before we go, here's another look at today's selloff on Wall  Street.  And it accelerated as we went into the close.  The Dow Jones  Industrial Average finished down 724 points to 23,957.  The Nasdaq lost  178, almost 179 points to 7,166.  And the S&amp;P lost 68 points.  </p><p>So, quite a day on the street.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  Indeed.  </p><p>HERERA:  That does it for us tonight.  I'm Sue Herera.  Thanks for joining  us.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  I'm Bill Griffeth.  Have a great evening.  See you tomorrow.</p><p>END</p><p>Nightly Business Report transcripts and video are available on-line post  broadcast at <url normalizedValue=\"http://nbr.com\">http://nbr.com</url>.

And the S&amp;P 500 lost 68.</p><p>The biggest losers on the Dow were the major industrials like Caterpillar, Boeing, and 3M.</p><p>Bob Pisani reports tonight on that selloff from the New York Stock Exchange.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BOB PISANI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Stocks closed right around their worst levels of the session with the Dow down more than 700 points. That`s right, 700 points.</p><p>The markets are clearly concerned about two things. Number one, technology. And number two, trade. Two big issues.</p><p>President Donald Trump announced he would be imposing tariffs of up to $60 billion on Chinese goods over the next few weeks. No details on which products will be taxed by how much yet. But he did say there would be a 30-day grace period to negotiate those terms.</p><p>Shares of U.S. and other metals and mining stocks got slammed on news that Trump will be exempting a handful of allies from steel and aluminum tariffs, including the European Unions, South Korea and Brazil. In fact, U.S. steel is down 20 percent since those tariffs were first announced a few weeks ago. It looks like they are not as tough as some people thought they might be.</p><p>Facebook is facing an existential crisis right now. In fact, the whole social media group is. And that`s weighing heavily on all the other social media stocks. The stock market has lost its team leadership group, technology, and social media is part of that. And there`s really nothing taking its place. The subsectors that powered tech high, which were semiconductors and the FANG names, your Facebook, your Apples, and your Amazons, they stopped advancing and in most cases, they reversed.</p><p>So, once those FANG and semiconductor stocks stopped going up in the second week of March, the market stalled out because no other sector has stepped forward to lead the market higher. Industrials and materials are suffering from these trade war concerns. FANGs can`t move higher without the help of higher volume. That`s not happening.</p><p>On top of that, drama in Washington is still on the front burner. Stocks did fall earlier on word in a John Dowd, President Trump`s lead lawyer in the Russia probe had resigned.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Bob Pisani at the New York Stock Exchange.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH: Mike Santoli is also at the New York Stock Exchange. He joins us tonight with some more insights on this decline.</p><p>I think you were the one who coined the term tariff tantrum. Is that -- is that all we saw today, or was there more going on, do you think?</p><p>MIKE SANTOLI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: I don`t take the blame or the credit for that one.</p><p>Yes, I don`t think it was all we were seeing today but I think that was the added element this morning, right at the outset, that came upon a market that also was already concerned about this general notion that interest rates are going up, this Fed is looking for opportunities to bring rates higher if they can, if the economic data allow for that. And then, you know, as Bob was saying, the loss of leadership from the big tech group, which a lot of investors I think were hiding in because it seems seemed like they could grow in almost any environment.</p><p>But the tariff issue is a reminder that policy across a bunch of fronts, whether it is trade or monetary policy have turned a little bit less friendly than we got used to last year.</p><p>HERERA: The volume, though, Mike. I mean, it didn`t seem like they were just throwing stocks out the window today. Was that mostly the professionals who were selling?</p><p>SANTOLI: Interesting. No, you are absolutely right, Sue. It was not a feeling of panic. It was not this mass liquidation of stocks. As a matter of fact, a couple of folks are pointing out that small cap stocks had outperformed the large cap indexes.</p><p>So, the more domestically focused businesses seemed like they were not caught up in this selloff quite much. The volumes weren`t that high. The volatility index definitely got up there, but not at levels we saw in early February. So, it was a somewhat lower intensity selloff than what we did see in early February.</p><p>Whether that something that means that folks are more likely to buy it at this level or not is not clear, but it definitely was not indiscriminate.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Mike Santoli at the New York Stock Exchange for us tonight -- thanks, Mike.</p><p>SANTOLI: Thank you.</p><p>HERERA: So, as we mentioned, the president did announce his toughest trade action to date. And as Kayla Tausche reports from Washington, there are fears of more to come.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>KAYLA TAUSCHE, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: President Trump signed an order that paved the way for steep tariffs on a wide range of Chinese imports. The move marks the end of its seven-month investigation into Chinese tactics to challenge U.S. technology dominance.</p><p>TRUMP: We have a tremendous intellectual property situation going on. So, we`re going to get it taken care of. And frankly, it`s going to make us a much stronger, much richer nation.</p><p>TAUSCHE: The action comes as the U.S. is imposing tariffs on all imports of steel and aluminum with certain allies and products exempted, and on top of tariffs on Chinese made solar panels. U.S. exporters including soybean farmers, pork producers, and aircraft maker Boeing are bracing for a counter-punch from China, which says it will take all necessary measures to safeguard its interests.</p><p>U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer told lawmakers that kind of retaliation is unfair but doesn`t change things.</p><p>ROBERT LIGHTHIZER, U.S. TRADE REPRESENTATIVE: It`s not possible to take the position that because we are soybean farmers, we`re not going to stick up for our rights in a whole variety of ways and have hundreds of billions of dollars worth of exporters and domestic producers be punished because of unfair trade.</p><p>TAUSCHE: There CEO of engine maker Cummins, Tom Linebarger, fears the administration`s approach is leading to a trade war.</p><p>TOM LINEBARGER, CEO CUMMINS: We agree there are challenges in China. We just want to address it in a different way, a way that`s proven effective over many, many decades, as opposed to unilateral tariffs which have always proven ineffective.</p><p>TAUSCHE: But Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross says those fears are overblown.</p><p>WILBUR ROSS, COMMERCE SECRETARY: I think there will be some ultimate retaliation, but I don`t think it`s going to be the end of the earth. There may be some firing shots over the bow. But I believe at the end of the day, this will end up in a negotiated settlement.</p><p>TAUSCHE: A senior administration official tells me this is just the kickoff to a set of multiple penalties against China and that further actions, namely restrictions on Chinese investments in the United States, could be unveiled in the coming days.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Kayla Tausche in Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH: And joining us right now to talk more about the new tariffs and the impact they could have on the markets and the economy, joining us tonight, Art Hogan. He`s chief market strategist with B. Riley FBR. And Josh Feinman is global chief economist at Deutsche Asset Management.</p><p>Good to see you both.</p><p>JOSHUA FEINMAN, DEUTSCHE ASSET MANAGEMENT GLOBAL CHIEF ECONOMIST: Good to be here.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Art, how do you -- do you step aside and let things clear out or do you see opportunities already presenting themselves as a result of these tariffs being imposed?</p><p>ART HOGAN, B. RILEY FBR CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST: That`s such a good question. And I think you have to think about that three ways. Yes, I think we overdo the selloffs, and today was certainly overdone. Can it get worse before it gets better? I certainly think so.</p><p>I think fundamentally this market is underpriced and certainly more underpriced today than it was yesterday. I think the problem with this is we don`t know how far our government will go with tariffs down the road to trade wars versus using this as a negotiating tactic.</p><p>And it really feels like -- I think -- you know, I think Secretary Ross just said that. We hope to get a negotiated settlement. That`s the best case scenario. Unfortunately, unintended consequences can creep up on us.</p><p>So, until something like that turns economic and actually slows the economy down. I`ll give you a great example. NAFTA, if we walk away from those negotiations, we`ll lose a half a percentage GDP growth this year. That`s something we need to make sure we accomplish. And the same thing would be true we got an extended trade war. That would be very bad for the economy.</p><p>HERERA: Josh, weigh in on that if you would, because you say that although a benign outcome is certainly is not guaranteed, the realistic economic impact may be smaller than perhaps what Wall Street is fearing.</p><p>FEINMAN: Yes, you look at the move today, while I think ill-advised, it affects a very small part of the U.S. economy. You are talking about less than less than three-tenths of 1 percent of GDP, even if you get some retaliatory measures from China and not likely to have big macro repercussions. And if this is just a negotiating gambit, OK, it will be fine.</p><p>The worry, though, is that it could escalate into something more and it also that reflects a protectionist mindset, this view that somehow trade is a zero sum game, trade deficits are a sign of weakness and foreign malfeasance. And I think that`s deeply misguided view and one that ignores the tremendous benefits that it accrued from the post-World War II free trade order, and the damage that could be done undermining that, and the damage that has been done in the past from protectionist forays. So, that`s the worry that I have.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Josh, at this point, we have not had the kind of inflation that the Fed might be hoping for oddly enough as they start to raise interest rates. If we impose these tariffs down the road, that could bring the inflation back, don`t you think?</p><p>FEINMAN: It could. It depends on the scope of the tariffs and so forth. It would likely be a short-term bump up, though. What -- not likely to have the kind of lasting effects on inflation to get inflation back up to 2 percent by itself.</p><p>HERERA: So, Art, if you have a long term time horizon as an investor, you have a confluence of events that are going on, where you have the tariffs going into effect. You have Facebook and social media under fire possibly facing some regulation. What do you do? Do you put new money to work in those sectors because they come down so much or not?</p><p>HOGAN: I think you asked the question the best way we should ask that question. If your time horizon is as a long term investor, a lot of this is noise and we won`t be talking about it next year. Unfortunately, you know, in the news cycle that we`re in, we`re going to be talking about these things on a minute by minute basis.</p><p>So, for example, I think we will see an administration that says these trade wars or these tariffs have adversely affected the economy and the market. Remember, they like use the market as a score card and you will see a pull back from that. I think regulation is probably good for social media. I think it`s the Wild Wild West. I think it needs some. I think we`ll see those valuations get replaced by perhaps the more normal towards what they`re doing and I think we`ll be fine with that.</p><p>Right now, there is going to be volatility. There is more volatility this year than we have seen in any given year for the last ten years, right? So, if that makes you stay up at night, then your exposure of the market is probably a little too high and you should think about ratcheting it down.</p><p>GRIFFETH: And quickly, Josh, if this is a headwind for the economy, does the Fed have to rethink its plan for raising interest rates later this year?</p><p>FEINMAN: If it were a serious headwind, yes. I think based on what we`ve seen so far, it`s likely not to turn into that. But that`s the risk. And we`ll just have to be watching it very carefully. When you rattle trade savers, you know, you run the risk of unleashing the adverse economic consequences.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Josh Feinman with Deutsche Asset Management, Art Hogan with B. Riley FBR -- thank you both for joining us tonight.</p><p>FEINMAN: Thank you.</p><p>HOGAN: Thank you.</p><p>HERERA: In Washington, the House passed a $1.3 trillion spending bill, the 2,200-page legislation will fund the government until October. It will increase military spending and a number of domestic programs. The measure now heads to the Senate where it is expected to pass with bipartisan support. And the president said that he will sign that bill once it reaches his desk.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Meanwhile, a key congressional committee has asked Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg to testify about that data scandal that improperly accessed personal information of about 50 million Facebook users. That pressured the stock again today. It`s now down more than 10 percent over just the past week.</p><p>Julia Boorstin talked to Facebook executive Sheryl Sandberg today about the controversy and what she plans to do next.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JULIA BOORSTIN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: With Facebook shares down 10 percent this week, chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg weighing in on the data privacy scandal that`s raised concerns of users, investors, regulators, and advertisers.</p><p>SANDBERG: This was a huge breach of trust. People come to Facebook every day and they depend upon us to protect their data. And I`m so sorry that we let so many people down.</p><p>We spent the last few days trying to get to the bottom of what happened. Cambridge Analytica never should have had this data. They told us they deleted it. But it is our mistake that we did not verify that.</p><p>Years ago, we changed platforms so apps get much less data. But that really wasn`t enough.</p><p>BOORSTIN: With advertiser Nestle today raising questions about consumer privacy, Sandberg stressed their business model does not put consumer data at risk.</p><p>SANDBERG: We provide a free service. That`s an ad-based business model. And in order to do that, we do not sell your data. We are able to show targeted advertising that`s relevant to people. We`re able to give advertisers aggregate anonymous reports, never telling them who you are.</p><p>We believe that we can operate our service with our current business model, continue to provide a free service all around the world, and protect people`s data. But we are going to have to earn that trust.</p><p>BOORSTIN: Sandberg saying she wished that she and CEO Mark Zuckerberg had weighed in on this controversial issue sooner. She also said that they are laying out strong steps to prevent this from ever happening again and they are working to earn back consumers` trust.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Julia Boorstin in Menlo Park, California.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: J.P. Eggers joins us now to discuss what a regulated Facebook would look like. He is a professor of management at New York University`s Stern School of Business.</p><p>Professor, welcome back. It`s always good to have you here.</p><p>J.P. EGGERS, PROFESSOR OF MANAGEMENT, NEW YORK UNIVERSITY`S STERN SCHOOL OF BUSINESS: Thank you very much.</p><p>HERERA: You know, one of the clips that was not in Julia`s piece was the question of regulation. And Ms. Sandberg basically was open to the concept of regulation, as was Mark Zuckerberg yesterday, which surprised a lot of people. It seems to me they think it is a foregone conclusion that that is coming their way.</p><p>What do you think?</p><p>EGGERS: Well, I think the recognition in a there is obviously been this -- as Ms. Sandberg said, kind of a breach of trust and the implications that the government and policymakers may want to try and weigh in on that and the implications of that, I think this becomes real question, can Facebook kind of help to co-create the regulations that would be put in place that would govern some degree of control over both advertising and the management of social media on line? To me, the real question is, you know, how deep those regulations would actually go if they were to be put in place, and how enforceable they would be.</p><p>There`s been discussions around things like transparency in advertising. But it`s unclear how that would work, who would verify that, how that would be done in any way that would be reliable. Certainly, the government doesn`t have the resources to go do that, and it`s not on Facebook`s interest to take on that responsibility.</p><p>GRIFFETH: You anticipated my question, J.P., because I was going to ask what exactly you need to regulate. And Mark Zuckerberg acknowledged that it was transparency in advertising that he felt would be the target there. But it`s not going to be just about Facebook. We`re talking about perhaps all social media that would be subject to these regulations, right?</p><p>EGGERS: Social media and just kind of online media in general. Look, I mean, Google is one -- Google is the biggest seller of advertising online. And if we are talking about ways to try and regulate transparency in advertising, it would certainly affect Google at least as much if not more than it would affect Facebook in this way. Obviously, those two big players are going to feel kind of a disproportionate volume of any sort of regulations that gets put in place because they are the main ones who are selling ads online.</p><p>But, yes, I think this is the way in which Mark Zuckerberg is trying to push for this co-creation. You never want the regulators to come just after your business. You want them to be coming after the entire sector so that there`s a level playing field as close as possible for all the firms.</p><p>HERERA: Now, a number of these companies, obviously, do business globally and different countries have different rules about how they can function in their countries. The European models are much more conservative than the U.S. regulations. Might the companies try and avoid regulation by adopting some of those European regulations or European rules?</p><p>EGGERS: I think certainly the risk would become that if -- if the companies resisted this sort of regulation, that the most stringent form available might be the one that`s put in place, which would definitely be bad for their business. The ability to engage in micro-targeting, even if they`re not selling data externally, but to help and facilitate micro- targeting for advertisers is a huge portion of what makes Facebook successful. And to the extent that there are data privacy limits that go beyond simply disclosure of how your data is used, but actual regulation of exactly how the data could and couldn`t be used, that would be much more significant for Facebook`s bottom line.</p><p>HERERA: All right. J.P. Eggers, thanks so much for joining us again.</p><p>EGGERS: Thank you.</p><p>HERERA: J.P. is with the New York University`s Stern School of Business.</p><p>GRIFFETH: By the way, Commerce Bank and Mozilla are temporarily pulling their advertising from Facebook because of this user data controversy. Commerce Bank cited brand safety and data security. And in a blog post, browser maker Mozilla said despite promises from Facebook executives, it takes issue with the social media company`s default privacy setting. Mozilla said that when Facebook takes stronger action in how it shares customer data, it will consider returning.</p><p>HERERA: It is time to look at some of today`s upgrades and downgrades.</p><p>The auto parts maker Visteon was downgraded two notches to underweight from overweight at Morgan Stanley. That`s Wall Street`s only sell rating on the stock. The firm says Visteon could be an acquisition target but the level of insider selling suggests the deal is unlikely in the near term. Price target was cut to $110 a share. The shares dropped 6 percent to $113.45.</p><p>Trivago shares were cut to underweight from neutral at J.P. Morgan. The analyst there says its hotel search business remains challenged. The price target is now $8. Trivago shares fell 5 percent to $7.40 -- Bill.</p><p>GRIFFETH: J.P. Morgan also downgraded online car shopping service provider TrueCar to under weight from neutral. The firm is concerned about weak automotive industry trends overall and the price target, they cut down to $10 a share. The stock fell 1 percent to $9.80, just below that.</p><p>Ralph Lauren`s rating was raised to outperform from market perform at Cowen and Company. The analyst says that the luxury brand growth could accelerate as a result of its marketing and digital strategy. The price target was raised to $122 a share. Shares, though, were down along with the rest of the market, closing 1 percent lower to $107.66.</p><p>HERERA: Still ahead, Nike just does it, reporting better than expected earnings. And that could set the tone for trading tomorrow.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GRIFFETH: Late today, cloud storage company Dropbox priced its IPO above expectations. According to CNBC, the highly anticipated offering priced at $21 a share. The range was anywhere between $18 and $20. Dropbox is expected to start trading tomorrow. It will be the largest tech IPO since Snap started trading more than a year ago -- Sue.</p><p>HERERA: Bill, the Dow component Nike reported better than expected earnings and revenue fueled by growth in its international sales and its momentum in China. The CEO said he sees a sales slump though in the U.S. reversing. And that sent the stock initially higher in afterhours trading.</p><p>Courtney Reagan has more on Nike`s results.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>COURTNEY REAGAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Nike`s strong third quarter results driven by strong international sales. Sales coming in stronger than expected in Europe, greater China, and Asia Pacific, though Nike`s North America`s sales disappoint.</p><p>CEO Mark Parker says sales direct to consumers rather than through retail partner like a department store grew double digits internationally, with China leading the way. It is been a difficult week for Nike after Parker sent a memo to employees revealing allegations of inappropriate workplace behavior had been reported and two executives left in the wake of that announcement, though Nike didn`t directly tie them to those allegations.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Courtney Reagan.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH: Chip maker Micron beats expectations. And that`s where we begin tonight`s \"Market Focus\".</p><p>After the bell, the company said that broad-based demand for its memory and storage products led to a strong quarter. The company expects that to continue. That`s why it gave guidance for the current quarter above estimates. Shares were volatile in the after-hours. They finished the regular session, though, down more than 3 percent at $58.92.</p><p>Higher selling prices helped earnings topped estimates at home builder KB Home. Orders rose and they were also stronger than expected. But investors focused on revenue which came in late. Shares were volatile in after-hours and finished the regular session down 3 percent at $28.84.</p><p>Darden said that an increase in the number of restaurants in operation helped profits topped expectations. The owner of Olive Garden and LongHorn Steakhouse said that it raised its earnings guidance for the rest of the year. Overall sales, though, were a sore spot for this quarter. They rose less than anticipated. Darden shares off nearly 8 percent today to $85.94.</p><p>HERERA: New product launches helped G-III apparel grow sales and profit above street expectations. But the owner of brands like Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein gave guidance for 2019 that was below street estimates. Shares of G-III plunged 12 percent today to $33.01.</p><p>Carnival said a rise onboard spending helped that cruise line topped both sales and profit expectations. The company said demand remains strong. Carnival shares fell 1 percent to $66.20.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Coming up, AT&amp;T spars with the U.S. government. At stake, $85 billion, and Time Warner. We head to court, next.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GRIFFEH: The biggest antitrust case in a generation is finally gotten underway. The Justice Department, as you know, is suing to block AT&amp;T`s $85 billion merger with Time Warner.</p><p>Hampton Pearson is at the courthouse for us tonight -- Hampton.</p><p>HAMPTON PEARSON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Well, Bill, this was like really opening day of that long awaited legal battle between the Department of Justice antitrust and AT&amp;T Time Warner. Opening arguments attended by, among others, AT&amp;T`s CEO Randall Stephenson, as well as his Time Warner colleague Jeff Bewkes. What they heard once they were in court is the government in essence saying that this merger would see consumers paying higher prices and less innovation going forward for all of the video however they choose to receive it, whether it`s on a TV, smart phone, or tablet going forward.</p><p>The lead government lawyer even said in court that AT&amp;T would use Time Warner as a weapon against its competitors and to some degree against consumers in future negotiations going forward because Time Warner is considered to be must-have content.</p><p>On the flip side, AT&amp;T says the government has it backwards. They have to get in the game because of the likes of Facebook, Netflix, Amazon and Google that are getting more and more subscribers in their online formats and frankly twinning to win the war with advertisers. This trial is expected to last six to eight weeks. We`re just getting started.</p><p>GRIFFETH: All right. Hampton Pearson for us in Washington tonight -- thank you, Hampton.</p><p>And there`s more sad news from the Toys \"R\" Us world tonight. The founder of the toy retailer has passed away at the age of 84. The great Charles Lazarus, he founded the company 70 years ago. He rightly anticipated that the post-war baby boom would create demand for baby supplies and toys. Boy, was he right.</p><p>He remained CEO of the company until 1994, and the man who succeeded him called Charles Lazarus the father of the toy business.</p><p>HERERA: Before we go, here`s another look at today`s selloff on Wall Street. And it accelerated as we went into the close. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished down 724 points to 23,957. The Nasdaq lost 178, almost 179 points to 7,166. And the S&amp;P lost 68 points.</p><p>So, quite a day on the street.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Indeed.</p><p>HERERA: That does it for us tonight. I`m Sue Herera. Thanks for joining us.</p><p>GRIFFETH: I`m Bill Griffeth. Have a great evening.

But is the next step regulation?  </p><p>Those stories and more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for this  Thursday, March the 22nd.  </p><p>HERERA:  Good evening, everyone, and welcome.  </p><p>A sell off on Wall Street.  All 30 Dow components closed lower, about two- thirds of the stocks in that index fell more than 1 percent today.  Half of  the S&amp;P 500 is now in correction territory.  </p><p>Investors became unnerved after the White House unveiled a new round of  tariffs that some fear could threaten the trade war with China, the world's  second largest economy.  So, by the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average  had plunged 724 points to 23,957, a nearly 3 percent decline.  The Nasdaq  fell 178.  And the S&amp;P 500 lost 68.  </p><p>The biggest losers on the Dow were the major industrials like Caterpillar,  Boeing, and 3M.  </p><p>Bob Pisani reports tonight on that selloff from the New York Stock  Exchange.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BOB PISANI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Stocks closed right  around their worst levels of the session with the Dow down more than 700  points.  That's right, 700 points.  </p><p>The markets are clearly concerned about two things.  Number one,  technology.  And number two, trade.  Two big issues.  </p><p>President Donald Trump announced he would be imposing tariffs of up to $60  billion on Chinese goods over the next few weeks.  No details on which  products will be taxed by how much yet.  But he did say there would be a  30-day grace period to negotiate those terms.  </p><p>Shares of U.S. and other metals and mining stocks got slammed on news that  Trump will be exempting a handful of allies from steel and aluminum  tariffs, including the European Unions, South Korea and Brazil.  In fact,  U.S. steel is down 20 percent since those tariffs were first announced a  few weeks ago.  It looks like they are not as tough as some people thought  they might be.</p><p>Facebook is facing an existential crisis right now.  In fact, the whole  social media group is.  And that's weighing heavily on all the other social  media stocks.  The stock market has lost its team leadership group,  technology, and social media is part of that.  And there's really nothing  taking its place.  The subsectors that powered tech high, which were  semiconductors and the FANG names, your Facebook, your Apples, and your  Amazons, they stopped advancing and in most cases, they reversed.  </p><p>So, once those FANG and semiconductor stocks stopped going up in the second  week of March, the market stalled out because no other sector has stepped  forward to lead the market higher.  Industrials and materials are suffering  from these trade war concerns.  FANGs can't move higher without the help of  higher volume.  That's not happening.  </p><p>On top of that, drama in Washington is still on the front burner.  Stocks  did fall earlier on word in a John Dowd, President Trump's lead lawyer in  the Russia probe had resigned.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Bob Pisani at the New York Stock Exchange.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Mike Santoli is also at the New York Stock Exchange.  He joins  us tonight with some more insights on this decline.</p><p>I think you were the one who coined the term tariff tantrum.  Is that -- is  that all we saw today, or was there more going on, do you think?  </p><p>MIKE SANTOLI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  I don't take the  blame or the credit for that one.</p><p>Yes, I don't think it was all we were seeing today but I think that was the  added element this morning, right at the outset, that came upon a market  that also was already concerned about this general notion that interest  rates are going up, this Fed is looking for opportunities to bring rates  higher if they can, if the economic data allow for that.  And then, you  know, as Bob was saying, the loss of leadership from the big tech group,  which a lot of investors I think were hiding in because it seems seemed  like they could grow in almost any environment.  </p><p>But the tariff issue is a reminder that policy across a bunch of fronts,  whether it is trade or monetary policy have turned a little bit less  friendly than we got used to last year.  </p><p>HERERA:  The volume, though, Mike.  I mean, it didn't seem like they were  just throwing stocks out the window today.  Was that mostly the  professionals who were selling?  </p><p>SANTOLI:  Interesting.  No, you are absolutely right, Sue.  It was not a  feeling of panic.  It was not this mass liquidation of stocks.  As a matter  of fact, a couple of folks are pointing out that small cap stocks had  outperformed the large cap indexes.  </p><p>So, the more domestically focused businesses seemed like they were not  caught up in this selloff quite much.  The volumes weren't that high.  The  volatility index definitely got up there, but not at levels we saw in early  February.  So, it was a somewhat lower intensity selloff than what we did  see in early February.  </p><p>Whether that something that means that folks are more likely to buy it at  this level or not is not clear, but it definitely was not indiscriminate.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Mike Santoli at the New York Stock Exchange for us tonight --  thanks, Mike.  </p><p>SANTOLI:  Thank you.</p><p>HERERA:  So, as we mentioned, the president did announce his toughest trade  action to date.  And as Kayla Tausche reports from Washington, there are  fears of more to come.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>KAYLA TAUSCHE, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  President Trump  signed an order that paved the way for steep tariffs on a wide range of  Chinese imports.  The move marks the end of its seven-month investigation  into Chinese tactics to challenge U.S. technology dominance.  </p><p>TRUMP:  We have a tremendous intellectual property situation going on.  So,  we're going to get it taken care of.  And frankly, it's going to make us a  much stronger, much richer nation.  </p><p>TAUSCHE:  The action comes as the U.S. is imposing tariffs on all imports  of steel and aluminum with certain allies and products exempted, and on top  of tariffs on Chinese made solar panels.  U.S. exporters including soybean  farmers, pork producers, and aircraft maker Boeing are bracing for a  counter-punch from China, which says it will take all necessary measures to  safeguard its interests.  </p><p>U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer told lawmakers that kind of  retaliation is unfair but doesn't change things.  </p><p>ROBERT LIGHTHIZER, U.S. TRADE REPRESENTATIVE:  It's not possible to take  the position that because we are soybean farmers, we're not going to stick  up for our rights in a whole variety of ways and have hundreds of billions  of dollars worth of exporters and domestic producers be punished because of  unfair trade.  </p><p>TAUSCHE:  There CEO of engine maker Cummins, Tom Linebarger, fears the  administration's approach is leading to a trade war.  </p><p>TOM LINEBARGER, CEO CUMMINS:  We agree there are challenges in China.  We  just want to address it in a different way, a way that's proven effective  over many, many decades, as opposed to unilateral tariffs which have always  proven ineffective.  </p><p>TAUSCHE:  But Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross says those fears are  overblown.  </p><p>WILBUR ROSS, COMMERCE SECRETARY:  I think there will be some ultimate  retaliation, but I don't think it's going to be the end of the earth.   There may be some firing shots over the bow.  But I believe at the end of  the day, this will end up in a negotiated settlement.  </p><p>TAUSCHE:  A senior administration official tells me this is just the  kickoff to a set of multiple penalties against China and that further  actions, namely restrictions on Chinese investments in the United States,  could be unveiled in the coming days.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Kayla Tausche in Washington.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  And joining us right now to talk more about the new tariffs and  the impact they could have on the markets and the economy, joining us  tonight, Art Hogan.  He's chief market strategist with B. Riley FBR.  And  Josh Feinman is global chief economist at Deutsche Asset Management.  </p><p>Good to see you both.  </p><p>JOSHUA FEINMAN, DEUTSCHE ASSET MANAGEMENT GLOBAL CHIEF ECONOMIST:  Good to  be here.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  Art, how do you -- do you step aside and let things clear out or  do you see opportunities already presenting themselves as a result of these  tariffs being imposed?  </p><p>ART HOGAN, B. RILEY FBR CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST:  That's such a good  question.  And I think you have to think about that three ways.  Yes, I  think we overdo the selloffs, and today was certainly overdone.  Can it get  worse before it gets better?  I certainly think so.  </p><p>I think fundamentally this market is underpriced and certainly more  underpriced today than it was yesterday.  I think the problem with this is  we don't know how far our government will go with tariffs down the road to  trade wars versus using this as a negotiating tactic.  </p><p>And it really feels like -- I think -- you know, I think Secretary Ross  just said that.  We hope to get a negotiated settlement.  That's the best  case scenario.  Unfortunately, unintended consequences can creep up on us.  </p><p>So, until something like that turns economic and actually slows the economy  down.  I'll give you a great example.  NAFTA, if we walk away from those  negotiations, we'll lose a half a percentage GDP growth this year.  That's  something we need to make sure we accomplish.  And the same thing would be  true we got an extended trade war.  That would be very bad for the economy.  </p><p>HERERA:  Josh, weigh in on that if you would, because you say that although  a benign outcome is certainly is not guaranteed, the realistic economic  impact may be smaller than perhaps what Wall Street is fearing.  </p><p>FEINMAN:  Yes, you look at the move today, while I think ill-advised, it  affects a very small part of the U.S. economy.  You are talking about less  than less than three-tenths of 1 percent of GDP, even if you get some  retaliatory measures from China and not likely to have big macro  repercussions.  And if this is just a negotiating gambit, OK, it will be  fine.  </p><p>The worry, though, is that it could escalate into something more and it  also that reflects a protectionist mindset, this view that somehow trade is  a zero sum game, trade deficits are a sign of weakness and foreign  malfeasance.  And I think that's deeply misguided view and one that ignores  the tremendous benefits that it accrued from the post-World War II free  trade order, and the damage that could be done undermining that, and the  damage that has been done in the past from protectionist forays.  So,  that's the worry that I have.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Josh, at this point, we have not had the kind of inflation that  the Fed might be hoping for oddly enough as they start to raise interest  rates.  If we impose these tariffs down the road, that could bring the  inflation back, don't you think?  </p><p>FEINMAN:  It could.  It depends on the scope of the tariffs and so forth.   It would likely be a short-term bump up, though.  What -- not likely to  have the kind of lasting effects on inflation to get inflation back up to 2  percent by itself.  </p><p>HERERA:  So, Art, if you have a long term time horizon as an investor, you  have a confluence of events that are going on, where you have the tariffs  going into effect.  You have Facebook and social media under fire possibly  facing some regulation.  What do you do?  Do you put new money to work in  those sectors because they come down so much or not?  </p><p>HOGAN:  I think you asked the question the best way we should ask that  question.  If your time horizon is as a long term investor, a lot of this  is noise and we won't be talking about it next year.  Unfortunately, you  know, in the news cycle that we're in, we're going to be talking about  these things on a minute by minute basis.  </p><p>So, for example, I think we will see an administration that says these  trade wars or these tariffs have adversely affected the economy and the  market.  Remember, they like use the market as a score card and you will  see a pull back from that.  I think regulation is probably good for social  media.  I think it's the Wild Wild West.  I think it needs some.  I think  we'll see those valuations get replaced by perhaps the more normal towards  what they're doing and I think we'll be fine with that.  </p><p>Right now, there is going to be volatility.  There is more volatility this  year than we have seen in any given year for the last ten years, right?   So, if that makes you stay up at night, then your exposure of the market is  probably a little too high and you should think about ratcheting it down.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  And quickly, Josh, if this is a headwind for the economy, does  the Fed have to rethink its plan for raising interest rates later this  year?  </p><p>FEINMAN:  If it were a serious headwind, yes.  I think based on what we've  seen so far, it's likely not to turn into that.  But that's the risk.  And  we'll just have to be watching it very carefully.  When you rattle trade  savers, you know, you run the risk of unleashing the adverse economic  consequences.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  Josh Feinman with Deutsche Asset Management, Art Hogan with B.  Riley FBR -- thank you both for joining us tonight.  </p><p>FEINMAN:  Thank you.</p><p>HOGAN:  Thank you.</p><p>HERERA:  In Washington, the House passed a $1.3 trillion spending bill, the  2,200-page legislation will fund the government until October.  It will  increase military spending and a number of domestic programs.  The measure  now heads to the Senate where it is expected to pass with bipartisan  support.  And the president said that he will sign that bill once it  reaches his desk.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  Meanwhile, a key congressional committee has asked Facebook CEO  Mark Zuckerberg to testify about that data scandal that improperly accessed  personal information of about 50 million Facebook users.  That pressured  the stock again today.  It's now down more than 10 percent over just the  past week.  </p><p>Julia Boorstin talked to Facebook executive Sheryl Sandberg today about the  controversy and what she plans to do next.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JULIA BOORSTIN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  With Facebook  shares down 10 percent this week, chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg  weighing in on the data privacy scandal that's raised concerns of users,  investors, regulators, and advertisers.  </p><p>SANDBERG:  This was a huge breach of trust.  People come to Facebook every  day and they depend upon us to protect their data.  And I'm so sorry that  we let so many people down.  </p><p>We spent the last few days trying to get to the bottom of what happened.   Cambridge Analytica never should have had this data.  They told us they  deleted it.  But it is our mistake that we did not verify that.  </p><p>Years ago, we changed platforms so apps get much less data.  But that  really wasn't enough.  </p><p>BOORSTIN:  With advertiser Nestle today raising questions about consumer  privacy, Sandberg stressed their business model does not put consumer data  at risk.  </p><p>SANDBERG:  We provide a free service.  That's an ad-based business model.   And in order to do that, we do not sell your data.  We are able to show  targeted advertising that's relevant to people.  We're able to give  advertisers aggregate anonymous reports, never telling them who you are.  </p><p>We believe that we can operate our service with our current business model,  continue to provide a free service all around the world, and protect  people's data.  But we are going to have to earn that trust.  </p><p>BOORSTIN:  Sandberg saying she wished that she and CEO Mark Zuckerberg had  weighed in on this controversial issue sooner.  She also said that they are  laying out strong steps to prevent this from ever happening again and they  are working to earn back consumers' trust.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Julia Boorstin in Menlo Park, California.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  J.P. Eggers joins us now to discuss what a regulated Facebook  would look like.  He is a professor of management at New York University's  Stern School of Business.</p><p>Professor, welcome back.  It's always good to have you here.  </p><p>J.P. EGGERS, PROFESSOR OF MANAGEMENT, NEW YORK UNIVERSITY'S STERN SCHOOL OF  BUSINESS:  Thank you very much.  </p><p>HERERA:  You know, one of the clips that was not in Julia's piece was the  question of regulation.  And Ms. Sandberg basically was open to the concept  of regulation, as was Mark Zuckerberg yesterday, which surprised a lot of  people.  It seems to me they think it is a foregone conclusion that that is  coming their way.  </p><p>What do you think?  </p><p>EGGERS:  Well, I think the recognition in a there is obviously been this --  as Ms. Sandberg said, kind of a breach of trust and the implications that  the government and policymakers may want to try and weigh in on that and  the implications of that, I think this becomes real question, can Facebook  kind of help to co-create the regulations that would be put in place that  would govern some degree of control over both advertising and the  management of social media on line?  To me, the real question is, you know,  how deep those regulations would actually go if they were to be put in  place, and how enforceable they would be.  </p><p>There's been discussions around things like transparency in advertising.   But it's unclear how that would work, who would verify that, how that would  be done in any way that would be reliable.  Certainly, the government  doesn't have the resources to go do that, and it's not on Facebook's  interest to take on that responsibility.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  You anticipated my question, J.P., because I was going to ask  what exactly you need to regulate.  And Mark Zuckerberg acknowledged that  it was transparency in advertising that he felt would be the target there.   But it's not going to be just about Facebook.  We're talking about perhaps  all social media that would be subject to these regulations, right?  </p><p>EGGERS:  Social media and just kind of online media in general.  Look, I  mean, Google is one -- Google is the biggest seller of advertising online.   And if we are talking about ways to try and regulate transparency in  advertising, it would certainly affect Google at least as much if not more  than it would affect Facebook in this way.  Obviously, those two big  players are going to feel kind of a disproportionate volume of any sort of  regulations that gets put in place because they are the main ones who are  selling ads online.  </p><p>But, yes, I think this is the way in which Mark Zuckerberg is trying to  push for this co-creation.  You never want the regulators to come just  after your business.  You want them to be coming after the entire sector so  that there's a level playing field as close as possible for all the firms.  </p><p>HERERA:  Now, a number of these companies, obviously, do business globally  and different countries have different rules about how they can function in  their countries.  The European models are much more conservative than the  U.S. regulations.  Might the companies try and avoid regulation by adopting  some of those European regulations or European rules?  </p><p>EGGERS:  I think certainly the risk would become that if -- if the  companies resisted this sort of regulation, that the most stringent form  available might be the one that's put in place, which would definitely be  bad for their business.  The ability to engage in micro-targeting, even if  they're not selling data externally, but to help and facilitate micro- targeting for advertisers is a huge portion of what makes Facebook  successful.  And to the extent that there are data privacy limits that go  beyond simply disclosure of how your data is used, but actual regulation of  exactly how the data could and couldn't be used, that would be much more  significant for Facebook's bottom line.  </p><p>HERERA:  All right.  J.P. Eggers, thanks so much for joining us again.  </p><p>EGGERS:  Thank you.</p><p>HERERA:  J.P. is with the New York University's Stern School of Business.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  By the way, Commerce Bank and Mozilla are temporarily pulling  their advertising from Facebook because of this user data controversy.   Commerce Bank cited brand safety and data security.  And in a blog post,  browser maker Mozilla said despite promises from Facebook executives, it  takes issue with the social media company's default privacy setting.   Mozilla said that when Facebook takes stronger action in how it shares  customer data, it will consider returning.  </p><p>HERERA:  It is time to look at some of today's upgrades and downgrades.  </p><p>The auto parts maker Visteon was downgraded two notches to underweight from  overweight at Morgan Stanley.  That's Wall Street's only sell rating on the  stock.  The firm says Visteon could be an acquisition target but the level  of insider selling suggests the deal is unlikely in the near term.  Price  target was cut to $110 a share.  The shares dropped 6 percent to $113.45.  </p><p>Trivago shares were cut to underweight from neutral at J.P. Morgan.  The  analyst there says its hotel search business remains challenged.  The price  target is now $8.  Trivago shares fell 5 percent to $7.40 -- Bill.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  J.P. Morgan also downgraded online car shopping service provider  TrueCar to under weight from neutral.  The firm is concerned about weak  automotive industry trends overall and the price target, they cut down to  $10 a share.  The stock fell 1 percent to $9.80, just below that.  </p><p>Ralph Lauren's rating was raised to outperform from market perform at Cowen  and Company.  The analyst says that the luxury brand growth could  accelerate as a result of its marketing and digital strategy.  The price  target was raised to $122 a share.  Shares, though, were down along with  the rest of the market, closing 1 percent lower to $107.66.  </p><p>HERERA:  Still ahead, Nike just does it, reporting better than expected  earnings.  And that could set the tone for trading tomorrow.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Late today, cloud storage company Dropbox priced its IPO above  expectations.  According to CNBC, the highly anticipated offering priced at  $21 a share.  The range was anywhere between $18 and $20.  Dropbox is  expected to start trading tomorrow.  It will be the largest tech IPO since  Snap started trading more than a year ago -- Sue.</p><p>HERERA:  Bill, the Dow component Nike reported better than expected  earnings and revenue fueled by growth in its international sales and its  momentum in China.  The CEO said he sees a sales slump though in the U.S.  reversing.  And that sent the stock initially higher in afterhours trading.  </p><p>Courtney Reagan has more on Nike's results.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>COURTNEY REAGAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Nike's strong  third quarter results driven by strong international sales.  Sales coming  in stronger than expected in Europe, greater China, and Asia Pacific,  though Nike's North America's sales disappoint.  </p><p>CEO Mark Parker says sales direct to consumers rather than through retail  partner like a department store grew double digits internationally, with  China leading the way.  It is been a difficult week for Nike after Parker  sent a memo to employees revealing allegations of inappropriate workplace  behavior had been reported and two executives left in the wake of that  announcement, though Nike didn't directly tie them to those allegations.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Courtney Reagan.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Chip maker Micron beats expectations.  And that's where we begin  tonight's \"Market Focus\".  </p><p>After the bell, the company said that broad-based demand for its memory and  storage products led to a strong quarter.  The company expects that to  continue.  That's why it gave guidance for the current quarter above  estimates.  Shares were volatile in the after-hours.  They finished the  regular session, though, down more than 3 percent at $58.92.</p><p>Higher selling prices helped earnings topped estimates at home builder KB  Home.  Orders rose and they were also stronger than expected.  But  investors focused on revenue which came in late.  Shares were volatile in  after-hours and finished the regular session down 3 percent at $28.84.</p><p>Darden said that an increase in the number of restaurants in operation  helped profits topped expectations.  The owner of Olive Garden and LongHorn  Steakhouse said that it raised its earnings guidance for the rest of the  year.  Overall sales, though, were a sore spot for this quarter.  They rose  less than anticipated.  Darden shares off nearly 8 percent today to $85.94.</p><p>HERERA:  New product launches helped G-III apparel grow sales and profit  above street expectations.  But the owner of brands like Tommy Hilfiger and  Calvin Klein gave guidance for 2019 that was below street estimates.   Shares of G-III plunged 12 percent today to $33.01.  </p><p>Carnival said a rise onboard spending helped that cruise line topped both  sales and profit expectations.  The company said demand remains strong.   Carnival shares fell 1 percent to $66.20.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  Coming up, AT&amp;T spars with the U.S. government.  At stake, $85  billion, and Time Warner.  We head to court, next.  </p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GRIFFEH:  The biggest antitrust case in a generation is finally gotten  underway.  The Justice Department, as you know, is suing to block AT&amp;T's  $85 billion merger with Time Warner.  </p><p>Hampton Pearson is at the courthouse for us tonight -- Hampton.  </p><p>HAMPTON PEARSON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Well, Bill, this  was like really opening day of that long awaited legal battle between the  Department of Justice antitrust and AT&amp;T Time Warner.  Opening arguments  attended by, among others, AT&amp;T's CEO Randall Stephenson, as well as his  Time Warner colleague Jeff Bewkes.  What they heard once they were in court  is the government in essence saying that this merger would see consumers  paying higher prices and less innovation going forward for all of the video  however they choose to receive it, whether it's on a TV, smart phone, or  tablet going forward.  </p><p>The lead government lawyer even said in court that AT&amp;T would use Time  Warner as a weapon against its competitors and to some degree against  consumers in future negotiations going forward because Time Warner is  considered to be must-have content.  </p><p>On the flip side, AT&amp;T says the government has it backwards.  They have to  get in the game because of the likes of Facebook, Netflix, Amazon and  Google that are getting more and more subscribers in their online formats  and frankly twinning to win the war with advertisers.  This trial is  expected to last six to eight weeks.  We're just getting started.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  All right.  Hampton Pearson for us in Washington tonight --  thank you, Hampton.  </p><p>And there's more sad news from the Toys \"R\" Us world tonight.  The founder  of the toy retailer has passed away at the age of 84.  The great Charles  Lazarus, he founded the company 70 years ago.  He rightly anticipated that  the post-war baby boom would create demand for baby supplies and toys.   Boy, was he right.  </p><p>He remained CEO of the company until 1994, and the man who succeeded him  called Charles Lazarus the father of the toy business.  </p><p>HERERA:  Before we go, here's another look at today's selloff on Wall  Street.  And it accelerated as we went into the close.  The Dow Jones  Industrial Average finished down 724 points to 23,957.  The Nasdaq lost  178, almost 179 points to 7,166.  And the S&amp;P lost 68 points.  </p><p>So, quite a day on the street.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  Indeed.  </p><p>HERERA:  That does it for us tonight.  I'm Sue Herera.  Thanks for joining  us.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  I'm Bill Griffeth.  Have a great evening.

PAUL RYAN </nameText></person>(R-WI), SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE: Obamacare is the law of the land. It`s going to remain the law of the land until it`s replaced. We did not have quite the votes to replace this law bill.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SUE HERERA, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR: Bill pulled. House Republicans yank their health bill minutes before it was due for a vote, leaving investors scratching their heads.</p><p>TYLER MATHISEN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR: Affordable housing. Why some investors may be starting to get cold feet.</p><p>HERERA: Gridlock on the ground. What`s being done to alleviate traffic jams on the tarmac?</p><p>Those stories and more tonight a NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Friday, March 24th.</p><p>MATHISEN: Good evening, everyone. And what a day it has been.</p><p>Drama in Washington minutes before the Republican health care bill was due for a vote on the House floor, leadership pulled it, unable to garner enough support and marking the first legislative setback for the <person><nameText>Trump administration </nameText></person>and House Speaker Ryan.</p><p>Speaker Ryan now telling fellow Republicans they`re moving on, but it won`t be easy.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RYAN: Yes, this does make tax reform more difficult, but it does not in any way make it impossible. We will proceed with tax reform, we will continue with tax reform. That`s an issue I know quite a bit about. I used to run that committee.</p><p>I spoke with the president, the treasury secretary and his economic advisors earlier today about tax reform. So, we are going to proceed with tax reform. This makes it clearly more difficult.</p><p>MATHISEN: John Harwood is following the story from Washington.</p><p>I don`t remember, John, a day quite like this one in decades. Is there any possibility that this health care repeal and replace gets resurrected later this here even before the midterms next year?</p><p>JOHN HARWOOD, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Yes, but I think expectations are going to be quite low for what that produces this was the moment when you had a new Republican Congress, a new president at the peak of his influence and I should say, it`s not a high peak because his approval ratings are pretty low. But nevertheless, your greatest clout is when you begin your presidency. This was a top promise for Republicans and when they outlined this plan they simply could not get a majority of their caucus even with a large majority in the House.</p><p>What that suggests and <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>alluded to this after the defeat was that whatever they come up with later might involve Democrats, which necessarily means it would be a much smaller revision that could be categorized as a fix to Obamacare, and interestingly that is precisely what former House Speaker John Boehner predicted a couple of months ago would be the outcome.</p><p>HERERA: Now, Paul Ryan, the president got praise for Paul right or gave praise to Paul Ryan for working so hard. However, he wasn`t able to deliver the votes. What does -- what does that mean for his leadership going forward as they start to tackle tax reform and infrastructure?</p><p>HARWOOD: It`s a blow, Sue, to the prestige of both Paul Ryan, the leader of this Republican House, and to <person><nameText>President Trump. </nameText></person>He said he was the master negotiator, the closer. His aides had confidently predicted that he would get the votes for this. They both failed to do that.</p><p>Now, each issue is different. Tax reform inspires a lot more consensus within the Republican Party. I still believe they will be able to pass a corporate tax cut later this year, may not be able to get the broad comprehensive reform. Infrastructure will be a tricky challenge, sort of like health care because he may need some Democratic support to push it through.</p><p>MATHISEN: His gridlock bed or is gridlock alive and kicking when a minority of the majority can really control what gets done and what can?</p><p>HARWOOD: It`s a very good question, Tyler, and it`s relevant because we have seen this modern Republican Party have a faction within it that is so anti-government that is very difficult for them to get to yes on any government program. So, while we`ve talked in the past about Republican Democrat gridlock under President Obama and under President George W. Bush before that, we could have a situation here with this idiosyncratic new president where he can`t get a consensus within his party on important things. That is a new territory for us.</p><p>MATHISEN: All right. The weekend shows are going to be fascinating.</p><p>John Harwood, thanks so much.</p><p>HERERA: Well, the drama in Washington rippled through Wall Street. Shares of hospital operators finished higher on relief that the benefits that sector has seen from Obamacare will not go away, at least not for now.</p><p>Medicaid-focused insurers also rose. Stocks like Centene (NYSE:CNC) and Molina Health and WellCare.</p><p>But the broader market appeared confused after the vote was pulled moving down then up and then down again. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed lower by 59 points to 20,596, the NASDAQ rose 11, and the S&amp;P 500 fell nearly two.</p><p>And today`s action capped the biggest weekly percentage loss of the year for the major indexes.</p><p>Bob Pisani explains the late day market moves.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BOB PISANI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Stocks ended modestly weaker with the Dow down just 59 points. But that small drop does not subscribe the high drama we saw today. The markets dip when it looked like the bill would fail if it went to a vote, but then rallied would were leaked out that the president was pulling the bill rather than call a vote.</p><p>Why the rally? Traders said that keeping the Obamacare repeal bill alive even if nothing will happen for months was important because getting rid of the taxes embedded in Obamacare would help offset the corporate tax cuts the president is proposing.</p><p>Now for the week, the Dow was down one and a half percent. That`s its worst week since September 9th. Now, traders right now are very eager to move on to two other topics. First, a tax cut and then earnings. Next week, it`s the last week of the quarter and with earnings of ten percent, the best showing in nearly six years, traders are eager to change the subject to an improving economy.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Bob Pisani at the New York Stock Exchange.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: The CEO of Charter Communications (NASDAQ:CHTR) was at the White House today to announce its decision to invest in broadband infrastructure move offshore call centers back to the U.S. and create 20,000 jobs.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TOM RUTLEDGE, CHARTER COMMUNICATIONS CEO: We also committed to spend $25 billion in infrastructure capital over the next four years. That`s the deployment of new infrastructure which also creates jobs. And the whole thing is really predicated on an opportunity to live in a better regulatory climate with more consistency that our tax climate, which is really conducive to making investments both in people and an infrastructure.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HERERA: The second largest U.S. cable company had previously disclosed plans to hire 20,000 workers as part of its acquisitions of Time Warner (NYSE:TWX) Cable and Bright House Networks.</p><p>MATHISEN: Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) is also making investment in U.S. operations. The drug company plans to spend more than $800 million on its research labs in manufacturing sites. According to the company, the investments are being driven by demand for Lilly products, as well as its pipeline of medicines that target things like cancer, diabetes.</p><p>HERERA: <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>formerly green-lighted the construction of the controversial Keystone XL Pipeline, reversing an earlier decision by the Obama administration. The president called it part of a new era of American energy policy that he says will lower costs and create jobs.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Today, I`m pleased to announce the official approval of the presidential permit for the Keystone XL Pipeline. TransCanada will finally be allowed to complete this long- overdue project with efficiency and with speed. We`re working out the final details, as we speak. It`s going to be an incredible pipeline, greatest technology known to man or woman, and frankly, we`re very proud of it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HERERA: Shares of TransCanada, the company behind the pipeline, fell just slightly.</p><p>MATHISEN: So, while much of the focus has been on Washington politics down there the U.S. does find itself awash in oil. U.S. crude stockpiles record levels, leading some to predict that the nation will be oil independent within a decade. If so, what will this mean for the U.S. and our ties to the Middle East?</p><p>Kyle Cooper is director of research at IAF Advisors and he joins us now to discuss.</p><p>What would it mean if the United States were finally, once and for all, to achieve something that was talked about back in the `70s, true independence from foreign oil?</p><p>KYLE COOPER, IAF ADVISORS DIR. OF RESEARCH: Well, certainly, it changes the geopolitics significantly, right? For the last 10 years or 20 years, 20-30 years, our focus has been on Middle East stability because we relied so much on the oil coming from there. Now with the Keystone pipeline being approved, with additional supplies presumably coming from Canada`s as a result of that, and then obviously most importantly, the development of the U.S. shale oil.</p><p>The North America is really on the verge or certainly has the possibility of becoming energy independent in a decade or so.</p><p>HERERA: And does that necessarily translate to kind of permanently lower oil and gasoline prices or not?</p><p>COOPER: I would certainly think so. The U.S -- the U.S. E&amp;P companies have made tremendous strides since 2014, the last time we saw oil above a hundred in reducing their costs and increasing their efficiencies. Many companies now report that even at $45 and $50, they`re actually more profitable today than they were when prices were above a hundred.</p><p>So, it certainly seems that we have the opportunity for much longer time of oil in the s$50 or, you know, right around this area because the improvements and efficiency and the oil that they can supply at these levels.</p><p>MATHISEN: What investable U.S. companies are benefiting from this, Kyle?</p><p>COOPER: Certainly, the mid-caps that already have exposure in the seven U.S. shale regions that the EIA`s drilling productivity report focuses on, those for oil primarily being the Bakken and the Permian. But really the ones that are probably most in store for additional business and revenues are the service companies. Regardless of whether or not the E&amp;P is small or large, they still have to go to the service companies for the fracking technology, the sand, the pipe the steel to put in these, you know --</p><p>MATHISEN: Those service companies include who -- name a couple of `em.</p><p>COOPER: Well, certainly, like the Baker Hughes (NYSE:BHI).</p><p>MATHISEN: Right.</p><p>COOPER: The Halliburton`s, the Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB), some of the sand companies. Those types of companies that specialize in the actual services to the oil company into the drilling projects, those are the ones that every company has to go to. So, certainly, those types of companies are really poised for an increase in their business in the coming years.</p><p>HERERA: Does it also change our relationship with Canada, you know, our northern neighbor?</p><p>COOPER: Absolutely, with obviously Trump`s now permitting of the Keystone pipeline, this helps the Canadian oil sands producer because just as the U.S. producers lowered their service costs primarily through lower service costs, a pipeline generally is much less expensive to transport on, and thus the net back for the Canadian oil producer, for the Canadian oil sands producer gets lower -- or gets increased because of transportation costs are lower.</p><p>MATHISEN: OK.</p><p>COOPER: So, their economics improve because now they have less cost to get their oil all the way down to the Gulf Coast going into the U.S.</p><p>MATHISEN: Kyle, you`re always clear and concise. I appreciate it. Kyle Cooper, IAF Advisors.</p><p>COOPER: Thank you. You have a great weekend.</p><p>MATHISEN: You too, sir.</p><p>HERERA: Some new insight today into the health of the U.S. economy. Order for durable goods, products designed to last at least three years, rose 1.7 percent in February from the prior month. That was more than expected. Market watchers say that this report is the latest evidence that the recent pick up and confidence has translated into stronger capital spending overall.</p><p>MATHISEN: The president of New York Fed says the economy is in a pretty good place right now as it inches closer to full employment. Bill Dudley, an influential Fed official, has a permanent vote on interest rates, added that rising interest rates will be a delicate adjustment for the economy.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BILL DUDLEY, NEW YORK FED PRESIDENT: By taking out a little bit of that accommodations, moving up interest rates just a little bit, we think it`s more likely that will achieve a soft landing and keep the economy about where it is today in terms of employment and inflation. So, it`s a delicate adjustment. It`s not something that`s very harsh. We think it`s appropriate and necessary.</p><p>But, you know, I think it`s -- you know, I think the economy will be able to adjust to this just fine.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MATHISEN: He also said that the unemployment rate is pretty close to its lowest level without sparking too much inflation.</p><p>HERERA: Still ahead, are you looking for growth? Our market monitor says it`s time to invest your money in some very well-known company.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>HERERA: The Senate voted to undo Internet privacy rules. Those rules were approved by the Federal Communications Commission last fall and had not yet gone into effect. The regulation would have required Internet service providers to get permission before collecting and sharing your information, like your web browsing history, or your location. Senator Jeff Flake introduced the resolution to repeal the rules, calling them unnecessary.</p><p>MATHISEN: Well, the market has high hopes that the corporate tax rate will be lowered. It is a different story for some real estate developers, just the idea of a tax cut is rattling the low income housing market.</p><p>Aditi Roy explains why from East Palo Alto, California.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ADITI ROY, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: This low-income housing project in San Jose, California, just broke ground, but it almost didn`t happen. Developer Jeffrey Morgan says it took years for him to line up the investors, partners and builders for the Second Street Studios, a housing development for the homeless where residents of 134 units with paid 30 percent of their income towards rent, a typical one-bedroom apartment in San Jose goes for about $2,000. Then, came Election Day.</p><p>GEOFFREY MORGAN, FIRST COMMUNITY HOUSING EXEC. DIRECTOR: In a nutshell, we got Trump.</p><p>ROY: By that, he means President Trump`s election victory rattled the low- income housing market, that`s because once Donald Trump won the election, a cut in the corporate tax rate became more likely. If that happens, investors won`t get as much financial benefit from buying low income housing tax credits.</p><p>So, housing developers are saying some investors are getting cold feet, including the one behind the Second Street Studios.</p><p>MORGAN: We were literally driving through the title office after signing documents with the city of San Jose, and when we were ready to go, they backed off. And our lenders committed anyway and we wound up meeting with the investors later on, but it was a really scary time.</p><p>ROY: Eventually, the investor stayed in the projects but renegotiated the financing, leading Morgan with a two and a half million dollar funding gap. The city of San Jose stepped in and paid the shortfall, saving the project.</p><p>Morgan isn`t alone. Experts say shovel-ready low-income housing projects across the country are in jeopardy of losing funding because of uncertainty in the affordable housing tax credit market. Public accounting and consulting firms Novogradac estimates a low income housing tax credit market could lose ten to fifteen percent of its value, the problem could be especially acute in California, where the housing market is tight.</p><p>In the Bay Area, skyrocketing rents and low inventory have prompted some companies like Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) to step in. The social media company launched a $20 million initiative for affordable housing.</p><p>The good news is most developers say the uncertainty around where the corporate tax rate will end up it`s just a temporary disruption in the market, one that will likely smooth out once we find out what the corporate tax rate will be under the <person><nameText>Trump administration.</nameText></person></p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Aditi Roy, East Palo Alto, California.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: Finish Line shares plunged to their lowest level in more than six years, and that is where we begin tonight`s \"Market Focus\".</p><p>The athletic wear retailer posted a wider than expected loss, a drop in same-store sales and poor profit margins. The company`s CEO blamed the poor results on some footwear products that didn`t resonate with customers, along with difficulties in the overall retail environment. Shares of Finish Line fell nearly 20 percent to $12.93.</p><p>Blackstone sold its 21 percent stake in SeaWorld to a Chinese investment firm. As part of the deal, SeaWorld will provide support for developing theme parts in China, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau. Shares of SeaWorld rose nearly 5 percent to $18.13.</p><p>And Twitter is reportedly considering a paid subscription option. The social media platform is conducting surveys to assess interest in an enhanced version of its Tweetdeck feature aimed at professionals. Twitter shares up more than one percent today to $15.14.</p><p>MATHISEN: Medicare patients with diabetes will be eligible to receive reimbursement for Dexcom`s continuous glucose monitoring system. The U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services clarified criteria for coverage of Dexcom`s device yesterday. On the news, the company up nearly 9 percent to $82.62.</p><p>Moving the other way, U.S. Concrete said its CFO will resign effective July 1st and the company is also replacing Grant Thornton as its primary accounting firm. Additionally, a private law firm is investigating on behalf of shareholders whether the company`s officers or directors have engaged in securities fraud or other unlawful business practices. All of this adds up to a 9 percent drop concrete overshoes in U.S. Concrete. Those shares closed at $60.80 today.</p><p>HERERA: This week`s market monitor is finding opportunities in some big tech names he says are leading the way in both cloud computing and mobile advertising, and who could see their stocks rise as much as twenty percent over the next year and a half. He is Tim Courtney. He`s chief investment officer at Exencial Wealth Advisors.</p><p>Tim, welcome back. Nice to see you again.</p><p>TIM COURTNEY, EXENCIAL WEALTH ADVISORS CIO: Yes, thank you very much.</p><p>HERERA: Let`s get right to your picks. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is number one, a very large cap company.</p><p>COURTNEY: It is. It is. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) really missed some of the move, some of the movement out of PCs and into mobile. But the current leadership there is really trying to position the company to get in front of some current trends and cloud computing is one of those. It currently is the second largest provider of cloud services, behind Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and they spend $12 billion last year in research and development, and they`re a leading firm in terms of artificial intelligence and deep thinking software.</p><p>So, their most recent price to earnings is less than 20. They`ve got very good cash flow. They have $120 billion of cash overseas that if repatriated could be very useful in buying back shares.</p><p>MATHISEN: Let`s move on, Tim, to another company that really nobody else would have heard of but you and me another small one, Google`s parent Alphabet. My question -- you like it, but, you know, Alphabet has been in the news this week over the concern that many big companies have pulled ads because they are worried about adjacencies of their ads with content that many would find objectionable.</p><p>That isn`t a real problem in your mind or is it?</p><p>COURTNEY: Well, it is and I think that also speaks to the footprint that Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) has. They are they`re probably one of the most innovative companies. They have such a huge reach that they are going to run into these problems. And so, I think that their growth however and in their current valuation more than makes up for some of the problems that they`re seeing.</p><p>They also are in cloud computing. They`re the third largest provider in cloud computing, a huge growth market. And Waymo, their self driving car units, they`re either in the lead or very close to the lead among their rivals in that, which is a future growth area.</p><p>So, they`re very large. They`re going to run into some bumps. But they`re trading at a less than 20 price to earnings -- future price to earnings. Very little debt, very good cash flow, and they look OK appropriately priced.</p><p>HERERA: And another mega-cap will finish up with Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).</p><p>COURTNEY: Yes, the undisputed online advertising leader. They -- in fact, almost all their revenue comes from online advertising. I think they and Alphabet together make up about 70 percent of the market in online advertising, and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) is approaching about 2 billion active users each month.</p><p>So, they have $10 billion of free cash flow each year and their earnings are growing faster than their share price has grown over the last several years. So, their price is just slightly above a twenty price-to-earnings but very reasonable for the growth of the generating.</p><p>HERERA: All right. Tim, we`ll leave it there. Thank you so much.</p><p>COURTNEY: All right. Thank you.</p><p>HERERA: Tim Courtney with Exencial Wealth Advisors.</p><p>MATHISEN: And coming up, cutting airport congestion.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PHIL LEBEAU, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Tired of those traffic jams keeping your flight from taking off? I`m Phil LeBeau in Chicago with the story of one airline making changes so that you can get off the ground sooner. That story coming up on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MATHISEN: Credit reporting company Experian has been fined $3 million. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau alleges that the firm misrepresented the credit scores it marketed to consumers. The federal regulator said in some cases, there were significant differences between what the company provided the consumers and the score used by lenders. Experian has not admitted to any of the agency`s allegation.</p><p>HERERA: As the spring vacation season picks up, it brings with it a chronic problem at many airports -- congestion and delays. But the <person><nameText>Trump administration </nameText></person>says renovating many of America`s airports and upgrading the country`s air traffic control system could use those backups.</p><p>Phil LeBeau has more from Chicago`s O`Hare Airport.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>LEBEAU: It is frustrating and all too common -- your flight leaves the gate, but you`re stuck in a traffic jam on the tarmac.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You see a lot of people out there cell phone that saying, well, I have this meeting and we need to reschedule.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: No, it`s not very fun. Usually, there`s not a lot you can do. You just have to sit there and wait.</p><p>LEBEAU: While the FAA has been upgrading its systems to improve the flow of flights in the U.S., the reality is airlines have been patting their schedules so planes have a better chance of taking off and landing on time. That means the time set aside for flights like those from Washington to New York or Las Vegas to Los Angeles is up more than 10 percent.</p><p>Those longer schedules are due in part to congestion in the air and on the tarmac at some of America`s busiest airports -- a problem many airlines believe can be fixed by upgrading America`s air traffic control system.</p><p>LORNE CASS, AMERICAN AIRLINES: Ultimately, we want the pilot of the airplane, the air traffic controller, the dispatchers at the airline, to all have the same information at the same time with which to make the best decisions.</p><p>LEBEAU: American Airlines is already trying new approaches to improving the flow of flights at its hubs.</p><p>But the big improvement for all airlines could come if <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>can convince Congress to spend billions to fix America`s airports, and by extension, the epic jams clogging up airspace over America`s busiest airport.</p><p>CASS: I think there`s a lot of work underway today and the things that are coming out in the next two to three years, there`s some technologies that can make a huge difference that have probably planned out over a 10 or so years period.</p><p>LEBEAU: Fixing airport and air traffic so travelers spend less time in a plane and more time at their destination.</p><p>Phil LeBeau, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Chicago.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN: And finally tonight, have you been distracted by March Madness while you`re at work? You`re not alone. A new study by Challenger Gray &amp; Christmas estimates that for every hour spent rooting for a team or analyzing a bracket, employers lose a collective $2 billion.</p><p>I`m not paid $2 billion an hour.</p><p>HERERA: Yes.</p><p>MATHISEN: I don`t know how that works. But trust me, it works.</p><p>March Madness also considered the third biggest digital distraction at work. The first, texting, Sue. The second time spent on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).</p><p>HERERA: I don`t text. And I`m not on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).</p><p>MATHISEN: I`m not on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) either.</p><p>HERERA: I do look at a bracket every once in a while.</p><p>OK. That does it for us tonight. I`m Sue Herera. Thanks for joining us.</p><p>MATHISEN: I`m Tyler Mathisen. Have a great weekend, everyone. We`ll see you Monday. I`ll text you, Sue.</p><p>HERERA: You got it.

PAUL RYAN (R-WI), SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE:  Obamacare is the law of the  land.  It's going to remain the law of the land until it's replaced.  We  did not have quite the votes to replace this law bill.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> SUE HERERA, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR:  Bill pulled.  House  Republicans yank their health bill minutes before it was due for a vote,  leaving investors scratching their heads.</p><p> TYLER MATHISEN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR:  Affordable housing.  Why  some investors may be starting to get cold feet.</p><p> HERERA:  Gridlock on the ground.  What's being done to alleviate traffic  jams on the tarmac?</p><p> Those stories and more tonight a NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Friday, March  24th.</p><p> MATHISEN:  Good evening, everyone.  And what a day it has been.  </p><p> Drama in Washington minutes before the Republican health care bill was due  for a vote on the House floor, leadership pulled it, unable to garner  enough support and marking the first legislative setback for the Trump  administration and House Speaker Ryan.</p><p> Speaker Ryan now telling fellow Republicans they're moving on, but it won't  be easy.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> RYAN:  Yes, this does make tax reform more difficult, but it does not in  any way make it impossible.  We will proceed with tax reform, we will  continue with tax reform.  That's an issue I know quite a bit about.  I  used to run that committee.</p><p> I spoke with the president, the treasury secretary and his economic  advisors earlier today about tax reform.  So, we are going to proceed with  tax reform.  This makes it clearly more difficult.</p><p> MATHISEN:  John Harwood is following the story from Washington.  </p><p> I don't remember, John, a day quite like this one in decades.  Is there any  possibility that this health care repeal and replace gets resurrected later  this here even before the midterms next year?</p><p> JOHN HARWOOD, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, but I think  expectations are going to be quite low for what that produces this was the  moment when you had a new Republican Congress, a new president at the peak  of his influence and I should say, it's not a high peak because his  approval ratings are pretty low.  But nevertheless, your greatest clout is  when you begin your presidency.  This was a top promise for Republicans and  when they outlined this plan they simply could not get a majority of their  caucus even with a large majority in the House.  </p><p> What that suggests and President Trump alluded to this after the defeat was  that whatever they come up with later might involve Democrats, which  necessarily means it would be a much smaller revision that could be  categorized as a fix to Obamacare, and interestingly that is precisely what  former House Speaker John Boehner predicted a couple of months ago would be  the outcome.</p><p> HERERA:  Now, Paul Ryan, the president got praise for Paul right or gave  praise to Paul Ryan for working so hard.  However, he wasn't able to  deliver the votes.  What does -- what does that mean for his leadership  going forward as they start to tackle tax reform and infrastructure?</p><p> HARWOOD:  It's a blow, Sue, to the prestige of both Paul Ryan, the leader  of this Republican House, and to President Trump.  He said he was the  master negotiator, the closer.  His aides had confidently predicted that he  would get the votes for this.  They both failed to do that.</p><p> Now, each issue is different.  Tax reform inspires a lot more consensus  within the Republican Party.  I still believe they will be able to pass a  corporate tax cut later this year, may not be able to get the broad  comprehensive reform.  Infrastructure will be a tricky challenge, sort of  like health care because he may need some Democratic support to push it  through.</p><p> MATHISEN:  His gridlock bed or is gridlock alive and kicking when a  minority of the majority can really control what gets done and what can?</p><p> HARWOOD:  It's a very good question, Tyler, and it's relevant because we  have seen this modern Republican Party have a faction within it that is so  anti-government that is very difficult for them to get to yes on any  government program.  So, while we've talked in the past about Republican  Democrat gridlock under President Obama and under President George W. Bush  before that, we could have a situation here with this idiosyncratic new  president where he can't get a consensus within his party on important  things.  That is a new territory for us.</p><p> MATHISEN:  All right.  The weekend shows are going to be fascinating.</p><p> John Harwood, thanks so much.</p><p> HERERA:  Well, the drama in Washington rippled through Wall Street.  Shares  of hospital operators finished higher on relief that the benefits that  sector has seen from Obamacare will not go away, at least not for now.</p><p> Medicaid-focused insurers also rose.  Stocks like Centene (NYSE:CNC) and  Molina Health and WellCare.  </p><p> But the broader market appeared confused after the vote was pulled moving  down then up and then down again.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed  lower by 59 points to 20,596, the NASDAQ rose 11, and the S&amp;P 500 fell  nearly two.</p><p> And today's action capped the biggest weekly percentage loss of the year  for the major indexes.</p><p> Bob Pisani explains the late day market moves.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> BOB PISANI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Stocks ended modestly  weaker with the Dow down just 59 points.  But that small drop does not  subscribe the high drama we saw today.  The markets dip when it looked like  the bill would fail if it went to a vote, but then rallied would were  leaked out that the president was pulling the bill rather than call a vote.  </p><p> Why the rally?  Traders said that keeping the Obamacare repeal bill alive  even if nothing will happen for months was important because getting rid of  the taxes embedded in Obamacare would help offset the corporate tax cuts  the president is proposing.</p><p> Now for the week, the Dow was down one and a half percent.  That's its  worst week since September 9th.  Now, traders right now are very eager to  move on to two other topics.  First, a tax cut and then earnings.  Next  week, it's the last week of the quarter and with earnings of ten percent,  the best showing in nearly six years, traders are eager to change the  subject to an improving economy.</p><p> For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Bob Pisani at the New York Stock Exchange. </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> HERERA:  The CEO of Charter Communications (NASDAQ:CHTR) was at the White  House today to announce its decision to invest in broadband infrastructure  move offshore call centers back to the U.S. and create 20,000 jobs.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> TOM RUTLEDGE, CHARTER COMMUNICATIONS CEO:  We also committed to spend $25  billion in infrastructure capital over the next four years.  That's the  deployment of new infrastructure which also creates jobs.  And the whole  thing is really predicated on an opportunity to live in a better regulatory  climate with more consistency that our tax climate, which is really  conducive to making investments both in people and an infrastructure.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> HERERA:  The second largest U.S. cable company had previously disclosed  plans to hire 20,000 workers as part of its acquisitions of Time Warner  (NYSE:TWX) Cable and Bright House Networks.</p><p> MATHISEN:  Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) is also making investment in U.S.  operations.  The drug company plans to spend more than $800 million on its  research labs in manufacturing sites.  According to the company, the  investments are being driven by demand for Lilly products, as well as its  pipeline of medicines that target things like cancer, diabetes.</p><p> HERERA:  President Trump formerly green-lighted the construction of the  controversial Keystone XL Pipeline, reversing an earlier decision by the  Obama administration.  The president called it part of a new era of  American energy policy that he says will lower costs and create jobs.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Today, I'm pleased to  announce the official approval of the presidential permit for the Keystone  XL Pipeline.  TransCanada will finally be allowed to complete this long- overdue project with efficiency and with speed.  We're working out the  final details, as we speak.  It's going to be an incredible pipeline,  greatest technology known to man or woman, and frankly, we're very proud of  it.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> HERERA:  Shares of TransCanada, the company behind the pipeline, fell just  slightly.</p><p> MATHISEN:  So, while much of the focus has been on Washington politics down  there the U.S. does find itself awash in oil.  U.S. crude stockpiles record  levels, leading some to predict that the nation will be oil independent  within a decade.  If so, what will this mean for the U.S. and our ties to  the Middle East?</p><p> Kyle Cooper is director of research at IAF Advisors and he joins us now to  discuss.</p><p> What would it mean if the United States were finally, once and for all, to  achieve something that was talked about back in the '70s, true independence  from foreign oil?</p><p> KYLE COOPER, IAF ADVISORS DIR. OF RESEARCH:  Well, certainly, it changes  the geopolitics significantly, right?  For the last 10 years or 20 years,  20-30 years, our focus has been on Middle East stability because we relied  so much on the oil coming from there.  Now with the Keystone pipeline being  approved, with additional supplies presumably coming from Canada's as a  result of that, and then obviously most importantly, the development of the  U.S. shale oil.  </p><p> The North America is really on the verge or certainly has the possibility  of becoming energy independent in a decade or so.</p><p> HERERA:  And does that necessarily translate to kind of permanently lower  oil and gasoline prices or not?</p><p> COOPER:  I would certainly think so.  The U.S -- the U.S. E&amp;P companies  have made tremendous strides since 2014, the last time we saw oil above a  hundred in reducing their costs and increasing their efficiencies.  Many  companies now report that even at $45 and $50, they're actually more  profitable today than they were when prices were above a hundred.  </p><p> So, it certainly seems that we have the opportunity for much longer time of  oil in the $50s or, you know, right around this area because the  improvements and efficiency and the oil that they can supply at these  levels.</p><p> MATHISEN:  What investable U.S. companies are benefiting from this, Kyle?</p><p> COOPER:  Certainly, the mid-caps that already have exposure in the seven  U.S. shale regions that the EIA's drilling productivity report focuses on,  those for oil primarily being the Bakken and the Permian.  But really the  ones that are probably most in store for additional business and revenues  are the service companies.  Regardless of whether or not the E&amp;P is small  or large, they still have to go to the service companies for the fracking  technology, the sand, the pipe the steel to put in these, you know --  </p><p> MATHISEN:  Those service companies include who -- name a couple of 'em.</p><p> COOPER:  Well, certainly, like the Baker Hughes (NYSE:BHI).</p><p> MATHISEN:  Right.</p><p> COOPER:  The Halliburton's, the Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB), some of the sand  companies.  Those types of companies that specialize in the actual services  to the oil company into the drilling projects, those are the ones that  every company has to go to.  So, certainly, those types of companies are  really poised for an increase in their business in the coming years.</p><p> HERERA:  Does it also change our relationship with Canada, you know, our  northern neighbor?</p><p> COOPER:  Absolutely, with obviously Trump's now permitting of the Keystone  pipeline, this helps the Canadian oil sands producer because just as the  U.S. producers lowered their service costs primarily through lower service  costs, a pipeline generally is much less expensive to transport on, and  thus the net back for the Canadian oil producer, for the Canadian oil sands  producer gets lower -- or gets increased because of transportation costs  are lower.  </p><p> MATHISEN:  OK.</p><p> COOPER:  So, their economics improve because now they have less cost to get  their oil all the way down to the Gulf Coast going into the U.S.</p><p> MATHISEN:  Kyle, you're always clear and concise.  I appreciate it.  Kyle  Cooper, IAF Advisors.</p><p> COOPER:  Thank you.  You have a great weekend.</p><p> MATHISEN:  You too, sir.</p><p> HERERA:  Some new insight today into the health of the U.S. economy.  Order  for durable goods, products designed to last at least three years, rose 1.7  percent in February from the prior month.  That was more than expected.   Market watchers say that this report is the latest evidence that the recent  pick up and confidence has translated into stronger capital spending  overall.  </p><p> MATHISEN:  The president of New York Fed says the economy is in a pretty  good place right now as it inches closer to full employment.  Bill Dudley,  an influential Fed official, has a permanent vote on interest rates, added  that rising interest rates will be a delicate adjustment for the economy.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BILL DUDLEY, NEW YORK FED PRESIDENT:  By taking out a little bit of that  accommodations, moving up interest rates just a little bit, we think it's  more likely that will achieve a soft landing and keep the economy about  where it is today in terms of employment and inflation.  So, it's a  delicate adjustment.  It's not something that's very harsh.  We think it's  appropriate and necessary.  </p><p> But, you know, I think it's -- you know, I think the economy will be able  to adjust to this just fine.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MATHISEN:  He also said that the unemployment rate is pretty close to its  lowest level without sparking too much inflation.</p><p> HERERA:  Still ahead, are you looking for growth?  Our market monitor says  it's time to invest your money in some very well-known company.</p><p> (MUSIC)</p><p> HERERA:  The Senate voted to undo Internet privacy rules.  Those rules were  approved by the Federal Communications Commission last fall and had not yet  gone into effect.  The regulation would have required Internet service  providers to get permission before collecting and sharing your information,  like your web browsing history, or your location.  Senator Jeff Flake  introduced the resolution to repeal the rules, calling them unnecessary.</p><p> MATHISEN:  Well, the market has high hopes that the corporate tax rate will  be lowered.  It is a different story for some real estate developers, just  the idea of a tax cut is rattling the low income housing market.</p><p> Aditi Roy explains why from East Palo Alto, California.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> ADITI ROY, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  This low-income housing  project in San Jose, California, just broke ground, but it almost didn't  happen.  Developer Jeffrey Morgan says it took years for him to line up the  investors, partners and builders for the Second Street Studios, a housing  development for the homeless where residents of 134 units with paid 30  percent of their income towards rent, a typical one-bedroom apartment in  San Jose goes for about $2,000.  Then, came Election Day.</p><p> GEOFFREY MORGAN, FIRST COMMUNITY HOUSING EXEC. DIRECTOR:  In a nutshell, we  got Trump.</p><p> ROY:  By that, he means President Trump's election victory rattled the low- income housing market, that's because once Donald Trump won the election, a  cut in the corporate tax rate became more likely.  If that happens,  investors won't get as much financial benefit from buying low income  housing tax credits.  </p><p> So, housing developers are saying some investors are getting cold feet,  including the one behind the Second Street Studios.</p><p> MORGAN:  We were literally driving through the title office after signing  documents with the city of San Jose, and when we were ready to go, they  backed off.  And our lenders committed anyway and we wound up meeting with  the investors later on, but it was a really scary time.</p><p> ROY:  Eventually, the investor stayed in the projects but renegotiated the  financing, leading Morgan with a two and a half million dollar funding gap.   The city of San Jose stepped in and paid the shortfall, saving the project.</p><p> Morgan isn't alone.  Experts say shovel-ready low-income housing projects  across the country are in jeopardy of losing funding because of uncertainty  in the affordable housing tax credit market.  Public accounting and  consulting firms Novogradac estimates a low income housing tax credit  market could lose ten to fifteen percent of its value, the problem could be  especially acute in California, where the housing market is tight.  </p><p> In the Bay Area, skyrocketing rents and low inventory have prompted some  companies like Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) to step in.  The social media company  launched a $20 million initiative for affordable housing.  </p><p> The good news is most developers say the uncertainty around where the  corporate tax rate will end up it's just a temporary disruption in the  market, one that will likely smooth out once we find out what the corporate  tax rate will be under the Trump administration.</p><p> For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Aditi Roy, East Palo Alto, California.</p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> HERERA:  Finish Line shares plunged to their lowest level in more than six  years, and that is where we begin tonight's \"Market Focus\".</p><p> The athletic wear retailer posted a wider than expected loss, a drop in  same-store sales and poor profit margins.  The company's CEO blamed the  poor results on some footwear products that didn't resonate with customers,  along with difficulties in the overall retail environment.  Shares of  Finish Line fell nearly 20 percent to $12.93.</p><p> Blackstone sold its 21 percent stake in SeaWorld to a Chinese investment  firm.  As part of the deal, SeaWorld will provide support for developing  theme parts in China, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau.  Shares of SeaWorld rose  nearly 5 percent to $18.13.</p><p> And Twitter is reportedly considering a paid subscription option.  The  social media platform is conducting surveys to assess interest in an  enhanced version of its Tweetdeck feature aimed at professionals.  Twitter  shares up more than one percent today to $15.14.</p><p> MATHISEN:  Medicare patients with diabetes will be eligible to receive  reimbursement for Dexcom's continuous glucose monitoring system.  The U.S.  Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services clarified criteria for coverage  of Dexcom's device yesterday.  On the news, the company up nearly 9 percent  to $82.62.</p><p> Moving the other way, U.S. Concrete said its CFO will resign effective July  1st and the company is also replacing Grant Thornton as its primary  accounting firm.  Additionally, a private law firm is investigating on  behalf of shareholders whether the company's officers or directors have  engaged in securities fraud or other unlawful business practices.  All of  this adds up to a 9 percent drop concrete overshoes in U.S. Concrete.   Those shares closed at $60.80 today.</p><p> HERERA:  This week's market monitor is finding opportunities in some big  tech names he says are leading the way in both cloud computing and mobile  advertising, and who could see their stocks rise as much as twenty percent  over the next year and a half.  He is Tim Courtney.  He's chief investment  officer at Exencial Wealth Advisors.</p><p> Tim, welcome back.  Nice to see you again.</p><p> TIM COURTNEY, EXENCIAL WEALTH ADVISORS CIO:  Yes, thank you very much.</p><p> HERERA:  Let's get right to your picks.  Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is number  one, a very large cap company.</p><p> COURTNEY:  It is.  It is.  Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) really missed some of  the move, some of the movement out of PCs and into mobile.  But the current  leadership there is really trying to position the company to get in front  of some current trends and cloud computing is one of those.  It currently  is the second largest provider of cloud services,  behind Amazon  (NASDAQ:AMZN) and they spend $12 billion last year in research and  development, and they're a leading firm in terms of artificial intelligence  and deep thinking software.</p><p> So, their most recent price to earnings is less than 20.  They've got very  good cash flow.  They have $120 billion of cash overseas that if  repatriated could be very useful in buying back shares.</p><p> MATHISEN:  Let's move on, Tim, to another company that really nobody else  would have heard of but you and me another small one, Google's parent  Alphabet.  My question -- you like it, but, you know, Alphabet has been in  the news this week over the concern that many big companies have pulled ads  because they are worried about adjacencies of their ads with content that  many would find objectionable.  </p><p> That isn't a real problem in your mind or is it?</p><p> COURTNEY:  Well, it is and I think that also speaks to the footprint that  Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) has.  They are they're probably one of the most  innovative companies.  They have such a huge reach that they are going to  run into these problems.  And so, I think that their growth however and in  their current valuation more than makes up for some of the problems that  they're seeing.  </p><p> They also are in cloud computing.  They're the third largest provider in  cloud computing, a huge growth market.  And Waymo, their self driving car  units, they're either in the lead or very close to the lead among their  rivals in that, which is a future growth area.</p><p> So, they're very large.  They're going to run into some bumps.  But they're  trading at a less than 20 price to earnings -- future price to earnings.   Very little debt, very good cash flow, and they look OK appropriately  priced.</p><p> HERERA:  And another mega-cap will finish up with Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).</p><p> COURTNEY:  Yes, the undisputed online advertising leader.  They -- in fact,  almost all their revenue comes from online advertising.  I think they and  Alphabet together make up about 70 percent of the market in online  advertising, and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) is approaching about 2 billion active  users each month.  </p><p> So, they have $10 billion of free cash flow each year and their earnings  are growing faster than their share price has grown over the last several  years.  So, their price is just slightly above a twenty price-to-earnings  but very reasonable for the growth of the generating.</p><p> HERERA:  All right.  Tim, we'll leave it there.  Thank you so much.  </p><p> COURTNEY:  All right.  Thank you.</p><p> HERERA:  Tim Courtney with Exencial Wealth Advisors.</p><p> MATHISEN:  And coming up, cutting airport congestion. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> PHIL LEBEAU, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Tired of those traffic  jams keeping your flight from taking off?  I'm Phil LeBeau in Chicago with  the story of one airline making changes so that you can get off the ground  sooner.  That story coming up on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MATHISEN:  Credit reporting company Experian has been fined $3 million.   The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau alleges that the firm  misrepresented the credit scores it marketed to consumers.  The federal  regulator said in some cases, there were significant differences between  what the company provided the consumers and the score used by lenders.   Experian has not admitted to any of the agency's allegation.</p><p> HERERA:  As the spring vacation season picks up, it brings with it a  chronic problem at many airports -- congestion and delays.  But the Trump  administration says renovating many of America's airports and upgrading the  country's air traffic control system could use those backups.</p><p> Phil LeBeau has more from Chicago's O'Hare Airport.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> LEBEAU:  It is frustrating and all too common -- your flight leaves the  gate, but you're stuck in a traffic jam on the tarmac. </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You see a lot of people out there cell phone that  saying, well, I have this meeting and we need to reschedule.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  No, it's not very fun.  Usually, there's not a lot  you can do.  You just have to sit there and wait.</p><p> LEBEAU:  While the FAA has been upgrading its systems to improve the flow  of flights in the U.S., the reality is airlines have been patting their  schedules so planes have a better chance of taking off and landing on time.   That means the time set aside for flights like those from Washington to New  York or Las Vegas to Los Angeles is up more than 10 percent.  </p><p> Those longer schedules are due in part to congestion in the air and on the  tarmac at some of America's busiest airports -- a problem many airlines  believe can be fixed by upgrading America's air traffic control system.</p><p> LORNE CASS, AMERICAN AIRLINES:  Ultimately, we want the pilot of the  airplane, the air traffic controller, the dispatchers at the airline, to  all have the same information at the same time with which to make the best  decisions.</p><p> LEBEAU:  American Airlines is already trying new approaches to improving  the flow of flights at its hubs.  </p><p> But the big improvement for all airlines could come if President Trump can  convince Congress to spend billions to fix America's airports, and by  extension, the epic jams clogging up airspace over America's busiest  airport.</p><p> CASS:  I think there's a lot of work underway today and the things that are  coming out in the next two to three years, there's some technologies that  can make a huge difference that have probably planned out over a 10 or so  years period.</p><p> LEBEAU:  Fixing airport and air traffic so travelers spend less time in a  plane and more time at their destination.</p><p> Phil LeBeau, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Chicago.</p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> MATHISEN:  And finally tonight, have you been distracted by March Madness  while you're at work?  You're not alone.  A new study by Challenger Gray &amp;  Christmas estimates that for every hour spent rooting for a team or  analyzing a bracket, employers lose a collective $2 billion.</p><p> I'm not paid $2 billion an hour.  </p><p> HERERA:  Yes.</p><p> MATHISEN:  I don't know how that works.  But trust me, it works.</p><p> March Madness also considered the third biggest digital distraction at  work.  The first, texting, Sue.  The second time spent on Facebook  (NASDAQ:FB).</p><p> HERERA:  I don't text.  And I'm not on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).  </p><p> MATHISEN:  I'm not on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) either.</p><p> HERERA:  I do look at a bracket every once in a while.</p><p> OK.  That does it for us tonight.  I'm Sue Herera.  Thanks for joining us.</p><p> MATHISEN:  I'm Tyler Mathisen.  Have a great weekend, everyone.  We'll see  you Monday.  I'll text you, Sue.</p><p> HERERA:  You got it.  I'll text you right back.</p><p> MATHISEN:  All right.</p><p> END</p><p> Nightly Business Report transcripts and video are available on-line post  broadcast at <url normalizedValue=\"http://nbr.com\">http://nbr.com</url>.

And what a day it has been.  </p><p>Drama in Washington minutes before the Republican health care bill was due  for a vote on the House floor, leadership pulled it, unable to garner  enough support and marking the first legislative setback for the Trump  administration and House Speaker Ryan.</p><p>Speaker Ryan now telling fellow Republicans they're moving on, but it won't  be easy.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RYAN:  Yes, this does make tax reform more difficult, but it does not in  any way make it impossible.  We will proceed with tax reform, we will  continue with tax reform.  That's an issue I know quite a bit about.  I  used to run that committee.</p><p>I spoke with the president, the treasury secretary and his economic  advisors earlier today about tax reform.  So, we are going to proceed with  tax reform.  This makes it clearly more difficult.</p><p>MATHISEN:  John Harwood is following the story from Washington.  </p><p>I don't remember, John, a day quite like this one in decades.  Is there any  possibility that this health care repeal and replace gets resurrected later  this here even before the midterms next year?</p><p>JOHN HARWOOD, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, but I think  expectations are going to be quite low for what that produces this was the  moment when you had a new Republican Congress, a new president at the peak  of his influence and I should say, it's not a high peak because his  approval ratings are pretty low.  But nevertheless, your greatest clout is  when you begin your presidency.  This was a top promise for Republicans and  when they outlined this plan they simply could not get a majority of their  caucus even with a large majority in the House.  </p><p>What that suggests and President Trump alluded to this after the defeat was  that whatever they come up with later might involve Democrats, which  necessarily means it would be a much smaller revision that could be  categorized as a fix to Obamacare, and interestingly that is precisely what  former House Speaker John Boehner predicted a couple of months ago would be  the outcome.</p><p>HERERA:  Now, Paul Ryan, the president got praise for Paul right or gave  praise to Paul Ryan for working so hard.  However, he wasn't able to  deliver the votes.  What does -- what does that mean for his leadership  going forward as they start to tackle tax reform and infrastructure?</p><p>HARWOOD:  It's a blow, Sue, to the prestige of both Paul Ryan, the leader  of this Republican House, and to President Trump.  He said he was the  master negotiator, the closer.  His aides had confidently predicted that he  would get the votes for this.  They both failed to do that.</p><p>Now, each issue is different.  Tax reform inspires a lot more consensus  within the Republican Party.  I still believe they will be able to pass a  corporate tax cut later this year, may not be able to get the broad  comprehensive reform.  Infrastructure will be a tricky challenge, sort of  like health care because he may need some Democratic support to push it  through.</p><p>MATHISEN:  His gridlock bed or is gridlock alive and kicking when a  minority of the majority can really control what gets done and what can?</p><p>HARWOOD:  It's a very good question, Tyler, and it's relevant because we  have seen this modern Republican Party have a faction within it that is so  anti-government that is very difficult for them to get to yes on any  government program.  So, while we've talked in the past about Republican  Democrat gridlock under President Obama and under President George W. Bush  before that, we could have a situation here with this idiosyncratic new  president where he can't get a consensus within his party on important  things.  That is a new territory for us.</p><p>MATHISEN:  All right.  The weekend shows are going to be fascinating.</p><p>John Harwood, thanks so much.</p><p>HERERA:  Well, the drama in Washington rippled through Wall Street.  Shares  of hospital operators finished higher on relief that the benefits that  sector has seen from Obamacare will not go away, at least not for now.</p><p>Medicaid-focused insurers also rose.  Stocks like Centene (NYSE:CNC) and  Molina Health and WellCare.  </p><p>But the broader market appeared confused after the vote was pulled moving  down then up and then down again.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed  lower by 59 points to 20,596, the NASDAQ rose 11, and the S&amp;P 500 fell  nearly two.</p><p>And today's action capped the biggest weekly percentage loss of the year  for the major indexes.</p><p>Bob Pisani explains the late day market moves.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BOB PISANI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Stocks ended modestly  weaker with the Dow down just 59 points.  But that small drop does not  subscribe the high drama we saw today.  The markets dip when it looked like  the bill would fail if it went to a vote, but then rallied would were  leaked out that the president was pulling the bill rather than call a vote.  </p><p>Why the rally?  Traders said that keeping the Obamacare repeal bill alive  even if nothing will happen for months was important because getting rid of  the taxes embedded in Obamacare would help offset the corporate tax cuts  the president is proposing.</p><p>Now for the week, the Dow was down one and a half percent.  That's its  worst week since September 9th.  Now, traders right now are very eager to  move on to two other topics.  First, a tax cut and then earnings.  Next  week, it's the last week of the quarter and with earnings of ten percent,  the best showing in nearly six years, traders are eager to change the  subject to an improving economy.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Bob Pisani at the New York Stock Exchange. </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  The CEO of Charter Communications (NASDAQ:CHTR) was at the White  House today to announce its decision to invest in broadband infrastructure  move offshore call centers back to the U.S. and create 20,000 jobs.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TOM RUTLEDGE, CHARTER COMMUNICATIONS CEO:  We also committed to spend $25  billion in infrastructure capital over the next four years.  That's the  deployment of new infrastructure which also creates jobs.  And the whole  thing is really predicated on an opportunity to live in a better regulatory  climate with more consistency that our tax climate, which is really  conducive to making investments both in people and an infrastructure.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HERERA:  The second largest U.S. cable company had previously disclosed  plans to hire 20,000 workers as part of its acquisitions of Time Warner  (NYSE:TWX) Cable and Bright House Networks.</p><p>MATHISEN:  Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) is also making investment in U.S.  operations.  The drug company plans to spend more than $800 million on its  research labs in manufacturing sites.  According to the company, the  investments are being driven by demand for Lilly products, as well as its  pipeline of medicines that target things like cancer, diabetes.</p><p>HERERA:  President Trump formerly green-lighted the construction of the  controversial Keystone XL Pipeline, reversing an earlier decision by the  Obama administration.  The president called it part of a new era of  American energy policy that he says will lower costs and create jobs.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Today, I'm pleased to  announce the official approval of the presidential permit for the Keystone  XL Pipeline.  TransCanada will finally be allowed to complete this long- overdue project with efficiency and with speed.  We're working out the  final details, as we speak.  It's going to be an incredible pipeline,  greatest technology known to man or woman, and frankly, we're very proud of  it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HERERA:  Shares of TransCanada, the company behind the pipeline, fell just  slightly.</p><p>MATHISEN:  So, while much of the focus has been on Washington politics down  there the U.S. does find itself awash in oil.  U.S. crude stockpiles record  levels, leading some to predict that the nation will be oil independent  within a decade.  If so, what will this mean for the U.S. and our ties to  the Middle East?</p><p>Kyle Cooper is director of research at IAF Advisors and he joins us now to  discuss.</p><p>What would it mean if the United States were finally, once and for all, to  achieve something that was talked about back in the '70s, true independence  from foreign oil?</p><p>KYLE COOPER, IAF ADVISORS DIR. OF RESEARCH:  Well, certainly, it changes  the geopolitics significantly, right?  For the last 10 years or 20 years,  20-30 years, our focus has been on Middle East stability because we relied  so much on the oil coming from there.  Now with the Keystone pipeline being  approved, with additional supplies presumably coming from Canada's as a  result of that, and then obviously most importantly, the development of the  U.S. shale oil.  </p><p>The North America is really on the verge or certainly has the possibility  of becoming energy independent in a decade or so.</p><p>HERERA:  And does that necessarily translate to kind of permanently lower  oil and gasoline prices or not?</p><p>COOPER:  I would certainly think so.  The U.S -- the U.S. E&amp;P companies  have made tremendous strides since 2014, the last time we saw oil above a  hundred in reducing their costs and increasing their efficiencies.  Many  companies now report that even at $45 and $50, they're actually more  profitable today than they were when prices were above a hundred.  </p><p>So, it certainly seems that we have the opportunity for much longer time of  oil in the $50s or, you know, right around this area because the  improvements and efficiency and the oil that they can supply at these  levels.</p><p>MATHISEN:  What investable U.S. companies are benefiting from this, Kyle?</p><p>COOPER:  Certainly, the mid-caps that already have exposure in the seven  U.S. shale regions that the EIA's drilling productivity report focuses on,  those for oil primarily being the Bakken and the Permian.  But really the  ones that are probably most in store for additional business and revenues  are the service companies.  Regardless of whether or not the E&amp;P is small  or large, they still have to go to the service companies for the fracking  technology, the sand, the pipe the steel to put in these, you know --  </p><p>MATHISEN:  Those service companies include who -- name a couple of 'em.</p><p>COOPER:  Well, certainly, like the Baker Hughes (NYSE:BHI).</p><p>MATHISEN:  Right.</p><p>COOPER:  The Halliburton's, the Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB), some of the sand  companies.  Those types of companies that specialize in the actual services  to the oil company into the drilling projects, those are the ones that  every company has to go to.  So, certainly, those types of companies are  really poised for an increase in their business in the coming years.</p><p>HERERA:  Does it also change our relationship with Canada, you know, our  northern neighbor?</p><p>COOPER:  Absolutely, with obviously Trump's now permitting of the Keystone  pipeline, this helps the Canadian oil sands producer because just as the  U.S. producers lowered their service costs primarily through lower service  costs, a pipeline generally is much less expensive to transport on, and  thus the net back for the Canadian oil producer, for the Canadian oil sands  producer gets lower -- or gets increased because of transportation costs  are lower.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  OK.</p><p>COOPER:  So, their economics improve because now they have less cost to get  their oil all the way down to the Gulf Coast going into the U.S. </p><p>MATHISEN:  Kyle, you're always clear and concise.  I appreciate it.  Kyle  Cooper, IAF Advisors.</p><p>COOPER:  Thank you.  You have a great weekend.</p><p>MATHISEN:  You too, sir.</p><p>HERERA:  Some new insight today into the health of the U.S. economy.  Order  for durable goods, products designed to last at least three years, rose 1.7  percent in February from the prior month.  That was more than expected.   Market watchers say that this report is the latest evidence that the recent  pick up and confidence has translated into stronger capital spending  overall.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  The president of New York Fed says the economy is in a pretty  good place right now as it inches closer to full employment.  Bill Dudley,  an influential Fed official, has a permanent vote on interest rates, added  that rising interest rates will be a delicate adjustment for the economy.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BILL DUDLEY, NEW YORK FED PRESIDENT:  By taking out a little bit of that  accommodations, moving up interest rates just a little bit, we think it's  more likely that will achieve a soft landing and keep the economy about  where it is today in terms of employment and inflation.  So, it's a  delicate adjustment.  It's not something that's very harsh.  We think it's  appropriate and necessary.  </p><p>But, you know, I think it's -- you know, I think the economy will be able  to adjust to this just fine.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MATHISEN:  He also said that the unemployment rate is pretty close to its  lowest level without sparking too much inflation.</p><p>HERERA:  Still ahead, are you looking for growth?  Our market monitor says  it's time to invest your money in some very well-known company.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>HERERA:  The Senate voted to undo Internet privacy rules.  Those rules were  approved by the Federal Communications Commission last fall and had not yet  gone into effect.  The regulation would have required Internet service  providers to get permission before collecting and sharing your information,  like your web browsing history, or your location.  Senator Jeff Flake  introduced the resolution to repeal the rules, calling them unnecessary.</p><p>MATHISEN:  Well, the market has high hopes that the corporate tax rate will  be lowered.  It is a different story for some real estate developers, just  the idea of a tax cut is rattling the low income housing market.</p><p>Aditi Roy explains why from East Palo Alto, California.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ADITI ROY, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  This low-income housing  project in San Jose, California, just broke ground, but it almost didn't  happen.  Developer Jeffrey Morgan says it took years for him to line up the  investors, partners and builders for the Second Street Studios, a housing  development for the homeless where residents of 134 units with paid 30  percent of their income towards rent, a typical one-bedroom apartment in  San Jose goes for about $2,000.  Then, came Election Day.</p><p>GEOFFREY MORGAN, FIRST COMMUNITY HOUSING EXEC. DIRECTOR:  In a nutshell, we  got Trump.</p><p>ROY:  By that, he means President Trump's election victory rattled the low- income housing market, that's because once Donald Trump won the election, a  cut in the corporate tax rate became more likely.  If that happens,  investors won't get as much financial benefit from buying low income  housing tax credits.  </p><p>So, housing developers are saying some investors are getting cold feet,  including the one behind the Second Street Studios.</p><p>MORGAN:  We were literally driving through the title office after signing  documents with the city of San Jose, and when we were ready to go, they  backed off.  And our lenders committed anyway and we wound up meeting with  the investors later on, but it was a really scary time.</p><p>ROY:  Eventually, the investor stayed in the projects but renegotiated the  financing, leading Morgan with a two and a half million dollar funding gap.   The city of San Jose stepped in and paid the shortfall, saving the project.</p><p>Morgan isn't alone.  Experts say shovel-ready low-income housing projects  across the country are in jeopardy of losing funding because of uncertainty  in the affordable housing tax credit market.  Public accounting and  consulting firms Novogradac estimates a low income housing tax credit  market could lose ten to fifteen percent of its value, the problem could be  especially acute in California, where the housing market is tight.  </p><p>In the Bay Area, skyrocketing rents and low inventory have prompted some  companies like Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) to step in.  The social media company  launched a $20 million initiative for affordable housing.  </p><p>The good news is most developers say the uncertainty around where the  corporate tax rate will end up it's just a temporary disruption in the  market, one that will likely smooth out once we find out what the corporate  tax rate will be under the Trump administration.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Aditi Roy, East Palo Alto, California.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  Finish Line shares plunged to their lowest level in more than six  years, and that is where we begin tonight's \"Market Focus\".</p><p>The athletic wear retailer posted a wider than expected loss, a drop in  same-store sales and poor profit margins.  The company's CEO blamed the  poor results on some footwear products that didn't resonate with customers,  along with difficulties in the overall retail environment.  Shares of  Finish Line fell nearly 20 percent to $12.93.</p><p>Blackstone sold its 21 percent stake in SeaWorld to a Chinese investment  firm.  As part of the deal, SeaWorld will provide support for developing  theme parts in China, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau.  Shares of SeaWorld rose  nearly 5 percent to $18.13.</p><p>And Twitter is reportedly considering a paid subscription option.  The  social media platform is conducting surveys to assess interest in an  enhanced version of its Tweetdeck feature aimed at professionals.  Twitter  shares up more than one percent today to $15.14.</p><p>MATHISEN:  Medicare patients with diabetes will be eligible to receive  reimbursement for Dexcom's continuous glucose monitoring system.  The U.S.  Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services clarified criteria for coverage  of Dexcom's device yesterday.  On the news, the company up nearly 9 percent  to $82.62.</p><p>Moving the other way, U.S. Concrete said its CFO will resign effective July  1st and the company is also replacing Grant Thornton as its primary  accounting firm.  Additionally, a private law firm is investigating on  behalf of shareholders whether the company's officers or directors have  engaged in securities fraud or other unlawful business practices.  All of  this adds up to a 9 percent drop concrete overshoes in U.S. Concrete.   Those shares closed at $60.80 today.</p><p>HERERA:  This week's market monitor is finding opportunities in some big  tech names he says are leading the way in both cloud computing and mobile  advertising, and who could see their stocks rise as much as twenty percent  over the next year and a half.  He is Tim Courtney.  He's chief investment  officer at Exencial Wealth Advisors.</p><p>Tim, welcome back.  Nice to see you again.</p><p>TIM COURTNEY, EXENCIAL WEALTH ADVISORS CIO:  Yes, thank you very much.</p><p>HERERA:  Let's get right to your picks.  Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is number  one, a very large cap company.</p><p>COURTNEY:  It is.  It is.  Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) really missed some of  the move, some of the movement out of PCs and into mobile.  But the current  leadership there is really trying to position the company to get in front  of some current trends and cloud computing is one of those.  It currently  is the second largest provider of cloud services,  behind Amazon  (NASDAQ:AMZN) and they spend $12 billion last year in research and  development, and they're a leading firm in terms of artificial intelligence  and deep thinking software.</p><p>So, their most recent price to earnings is less than 20.  They've got very  good cash flow.  They have $120 billion of cash overseas that if  repatriated could be very useful in buying back shares.</p><p>MATHISEN:  Let's move on, Tim, to another company that really nobody else  would have heard of but you and me another small one, Google's parent  Alphabet.  My question -- you like it, but, you know, Alphabet has been in  the news this week over the concern that many big companies have pulled ads  because they are worried about adjacencies of their ads with content that  many would find objectionable.  </p><p>That isn't a real problem in your mind or is it?</p><p>COURTNEY:  Well, it is and I think that also speaks to the footprint that  Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) has.  They are they're probably one of the most  innovative companies.  They have such a huge reach that they are going to  run into these problems.  And so, I think that their growth however and in  their current valuation more than makes up for some of the problems that  they're seeing.  </p><p>They also are in cloud computing.  They're the third largest provider in  cloud computing, a huge growth market.  And Waymo, their self driving car  units, they're either in the lead or very close to the lead among their  rivals in that, which is a future growth area.</p><p>So, they're very large.  They're going to run into some bumps.  But they're  trading at a less than 20 price to earnings -- future price to earnings.   Very little debt, very good cash flow, and they look OK appropriately  priced.</p><p>HERERA:  And another mega-cap will finish up with Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).</p><p>COURTNEY:  Yes, the undisputed online advertising leader.  They -- in fact,  almost all their revenue comes from online advertising.  I think they and  Alphabet together make up about 70 percent of the market in online  advertising, and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) is approaching about 2 billion active  users each month.  </p><p>So, they have $10 billion of free cash flow each year and their earnings  are growing faster than their share price has grown over the last several  years.  So, their price is just slightly above a twenty price-to-earnings  but very reasonable for the growth of the generating.</p><p>HERERA:  All right.  Tim, we'll leave it there.  Thank you so much.  </p><p>COURTNEY:  All right.  Thank you.</p><p>HERERA:  Tim Courtney with Exencial Wealth Advisors.</p><p>MATHISEN:  And coming up, cutting airport congestion. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PHIL LEBEAU, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Tired of those traffic  jams keeping your flight from taking off?  I'm Phil LeBeau in Chicago with  the story of one airline making changes so that you can get off the ground  sooner.  That story coming up on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MATHISEN:  Credit reporting company Experian has been fined $3 million.   The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau alleges that the firm  misrepresented the credit scores it marketed to consumers.  The federal  regulator said in some cases, there were significant differences between  what the company provided the consumers and the score used by lenders.   Experian has not admitted to any of the agency's allegation.</p><p>HERERA:  As the spring vacation season picks up, it brings with it a  chronic problem at many airports -- congestion and delays.  But the Trump  administration says renovating many of America's airports and upgrading the  country's air traffic control system could use those backups.</p><p>Phil LeBeau has more from Chicago's O'Hare Airport.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>LEBEAU:  It is frustrating and all too common -- your flight leaves the  gate, but you're stuck in a traffic jam on the tarmac. </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You see a lot of people out there cell phone that  saying, well, I have this meeting and we need to reschedule.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  No, it's not very fun.  Usually, there's not a lot  you can do.  You just have to sit there and wait.</p><p>LEBEAU:  While the FAA has been upgrading its systems to improve the flow  of flights in the U.S., the reality is airlines have been patting their  schedules so planes have a better chance of taking off and landing on time.   That means the time set aside for flights like those from Washington to New  York or Las Vegas to Los Angeles is up more than 10 percent.  </p><p>Those longer schedules are due in part to congestion in the air and on the  tarmac at some of America's busiest airports -- a problem many airlines  believe can be fixed by upgrading America's air traffic control system.</p><p>LORNE CASS, AMERICAN AIRLINES:  Ultimately, we want the pilot of the  airplane, the air traffic controller, the dispatchers at the airline, to  all have the same information at the same time with which to make the best  decisions.</p><p>LEBEAU:  American Airlines is already trying new approaches to improving  the flow of flights at its hubs.  </p><p>But the big improvement for all airlines could come if President Trump can  convince Congress to spend billions to fix America's airports, and by  extension, the epic jams clogging up airspace over America's busiest  airport.</p><p>CASS:  I think there's a lot of work underway today and the things that are  coming out in the next two to three years, there's some technologies that  can make a huge difference that have probably planned out over a 10 or so  years period.</p><p>LEBEAU:  Fixing airport and air traffic so travelers spend less time in a  plane and more time at their destination.</p><p>Phil LeBeau, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Chicago.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN:  And finally tonight, have you been distracted by March Madness  while you're at work?  You're not alone.  A new study by Challenger Gray &amp;  Christmas estimates that for every hour spent rooting for a team or  analyzing a bracket, employers lose a collective $2 billion.</p><p>I'm not paid $2 billion an hour.  </p><p>HERERA:  Yes.</p><p>MATHISEN:  I don't know how that works.  But trust me, it works.</p><p>March Madness also considered the third biggest digital distraction at  work.  The first, texting, Sue.  The second time spent on Facebook  (NASDAQ:FB).</p><p>HERERA:  I don't text.

I'm Sue Herera.  Thanks for joining us.</p><p>MATHISEN:  I'm Tyler Mathisen.  Have a great weekend, everyone.  We'll see  you Monday.  I'll text you, Sue.</p><p>HERERA:  You got it.

Stocks surge.   The Dow has its third biggest point gain on record as trade tensions ease  and investors pour money into the market.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SUE HERERA, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR:  Where to invest.  It is a  question a lot of investors are asking lately as they try to navigate the  volatility.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">GRIFFETH:  Disappearing deductions.  A handful of tax breaks are vanishing,  but there are a few credits you may be able to grab on to.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Those stories and much more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for a  Monday, March the 26th.  </p><p>HERERA:  Good evening, everybody.  And welcome.  </p><p>Stocks start the week with a jolt.  The Dow has its biggest point gain in a  decade, leaving last week's rout in the rear-view mirror.  Investors were  encouraged by the cooling of trade tensions and reports the talks were  under way to avert a global trade war.  </p><p>So, let's get you right to the closing numbers.  The Dow Jones Industrial  Average soared, 669 points to 24,202, the Nasdaq climbed 227 and the S&amp;P  500 rose 70.  For the Dow and the S&amp;P, it was their best one-day percentage  gain since mid-2015.  </p><p>Bob Pisani leads us off tonight from the New York Stock Exchange.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BOB PISANI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Stocks surged following  reports that the U.S. and China are holding quiet talks to ease the trade  rift between them recouping almost half of last week's losses.  Now, there  was a modest blip midday right before the European markets closed brought  on by news of rising tensions with Russia over Europe.  But once Europe  closed, it was smooth sailing to session highs.  The Dow rose more than 600  points, the S&amp;P spiked more than 2 percent.  </p><p>So, why exactly did we get this rally?  Well, trade tensions have eased  with China and South Korea and thanks to last week's selloff, the market is  much cheaper than it was at the start of the year.  </p><p>The S&amp;P 500 is trading about 16 times forward earnings.  That's about the  historical average.  It's a lot cheaper than in January when we were  trading at more than 18 times forward earnings.  In other words, the  correction helped reset an overheated market.  </p><p>The key leadership is back.  That's important.  Tech and financials led the  charge.  </p><p>Remember, they're more than 40 percent of the S&amp;P 500 together.  It's hard  to keep the markets down when you have those two sectors this strong.  In  fact, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft  (NASDAQ:MSFT), they're the three largest stocks in the S&amp;P, they were up 3  to 7 percent today.  That's huge.  Together these three stocks are 10  percent of the whole weight in the S&amp;P 500.  </p><p>All 11 sectors ended higher on the day.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Bob Pisani at the New York Stock Exchange.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  And White House trade adviser Peter Navarro today confirmed  those reports of trade talks between the U.S. and China.  He said he's  hopeful the two countries can work together.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PETER NAVARRO, NATIONAL TRADE COUNCIL DIRECTOR:  Ambassador Lighthizer and  Secretary Mnuchin, at the president's direction and personal direction, is  talking -- they are talking with the Chinese, as we've been doing since day  one.  And we will continue to do that.  And I think we're hopeful that  China will work with us to basically address some of these practices.  So,  I see nothing but bullish times ahead.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Last week as you know, the White House announced plans to impose  tariffs on up to $60 billion of Chinese products.  </p><p>HERERA:  In Beijing this weekend were some very well known and influential  American CEOs, including Apple's Tim Cook and Blackstone's Steve  Schwarzman.  And they were attending the China Development Forum.  As you  can imagine, the hot topic was trade.  </p><p>Eunice Yoon has our story.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>EUNICE YOON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Fears of a trade war  dominated the forum.  As co-chair of the event, Apple's Tim Cook called for  calmer heads and for President Trump to support policies that promote free  trade.  </p><p>TIM COOK, APPLE CEO:  What I've seen over my lifetime is that countries  that embrace openness, that embrace trade, that embrace diversity are the  countries that do exceptional.  And the countries that don't, don't.  </p><p>YOON:  Other CEOs shared cook's concerns including Blackstone's Steve  Schwarzman.  </p><p>STEPHEN SCHWARZMAN, THE BLACKSTONE GROUP CHAIRMAN &amp; CEO:  There needs to be  negotiated arrangement between the two countries, and I think it's  important to note that most of the types of things that are being discussed  from the U.S. side can be delayed in terms of their implementation and  hopefully will be.  </p><p>YOON:  Despite the aggressive rhetoric from both sides, there are reports  the two or negotiating behind the scenes.  The Trump administration has  reportedly handed the Chinese a to-do list that includes a reduction of  Chinese tariffs on U.S. autos, more Chinese purchases of American  semiconductors and greater access to the financial sector.  </p><p>I spoke to a source familiar with the discussions who said China's  officials seem willing to cooperate on these issues.  They're offering to  buy more U.S. semiconductors and accelerate the timeline for greater  foreign ownership in security.  Chinese officials also said that President  Xi Jinping would highlight more financial reforms at a business forum in  mid-April.  </p><p>Today, the foreign ministry reiterated again that Beijing is willing to  hold talks to resolve differences with the United States.  Tomorrow, a  small group of American CEOs is going to be meeting with the vice  president, Wang Qishan, a very close ally of President Xi Jinping.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Eunice Yoon in Beijing.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  The other big story in the market, it's still Facebook  (NASDAQ:FB).  A number of developments there.  The social media company is  now the target of an FTC probe.  The agency is looking into Facebook's data  and privacy practices.  </p><p>Separately, the company has acknowledged now that it does save extensive  call and text data made by Android users when those users opt-in to the  feature.  And CEO Mark Zuckerberg has now been asked to testify by the  Senate Judiciary Committee.  </p><p>The stocks spent much of the day lower.  In fact, it was down 5 or 6  percent but it finally eked out a small gain at the close to $160.06.  </p><p>HERERA:  The tech sector overall bounced back today, but it's had a hard  run of late.  </p><p>And as Mike Santoli reports, it may be time to rethink the way we invest in  this group.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MIKE SANTOLI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  The stock market has  almost never been as reliant on the technology sector as it is today.  And  suddenly, big tech is suspect.  The industry is under fresh regulatory  pressure over misuse of customer data with Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) at the  center, and tech stocks are being newly scrutinized by investors who spent  the past years paying up aggressively for shares of the most powerful  Internet company excited for a digital feature that's now looking less  clear and bright.  </p><p>Facebook's role to enable information to be used as target election ads has  driven a nasty selloff in its stock and caused investors to rethink the  value of leading Internet platforms.  The reason Facebook (NASDAQ:FB),  Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) were  so popular on Wall Street in recent years was their natural dominance where  the winners take most of the rewards.  </p><p>Now that very dominance is making these companies targets.  The stock  market implications are significant.  The tech sector including Amazon  (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) which are technically in the  consumer category now makes up about 30 percent of the S&amp;P 500 index.  And  big tech over the past year has become valued at a substantial 20 percent  premium to the overall market based on stock price to earnings multiples.   So, if investors become less willing to accept less risk valuations, the  broader market would be held back or weighed down.  </p><p>Of course, this could simply be a temporary market panic over alarming but  fleeting headlines.  Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) stock for one thing has never  been as cheap based on its expected profits which are still set to grow  close to 20 percent this year.  And the good news is that outside of tech,  large cap stocks look quite a bit less expensive than they did just two  months ago before the market pullback.  </p><p>When the clear driver of the market runs into trouble as tech has lately,  rallying around new leadership can be a nervous and messy process.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Mike Santoli.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  And joining us right now to talk more about the markets where  he's finding opportunities following last week's sell-off, Barry James back  with us, president and portfolio manager at James Investment Research.  </p><p>Good to see you again.  Welcome back, Barry.</p><p>BARRY JAMES, JAMES INVESTMENT RESEARCH PRESIDENT:  Hi.  Great to be with  you.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  Mike mentioned new leadership.  You feel like the smaller caps  are the new leadership for this market.  Why?  </p><p>JAMES:  Well, it's like what Yogi Berra said that, given directions to his  house, when you come to the fork in the road, take it.  I think we've hit  that fork in the road right now.  What we've seen up to this point it's  been all large cap all growth, all tech all the time.  And we've seen a bit  of a change this year.  </p><p>We just look through the end of last week, small cap stocks haven't gone  down as much as the large cap.  And as we look at small caps, there's a  couple of important things that I think are different.  </p><p>One is valuation.  If I look at really small companies versus really big  companies, they're cheaper by valuation methodologies.  Secondarily,  they're not impacted by all this tariff stuff quite as much because they  don't necessarily do that much exporting and have those problems.  And  lastly is this tax reform.  If you look at the effective tax rates on  companies, small companies have had higher effective tax rates, so they'll  get more of a benefit.  </p><p>So you got those three things.  And just one other thing I'd add is when we  come to these forks in the road in the past, I look back at 1999 and then  in the year 2000, all the tech stocks running, the Nasdaq fell 39 percent  in 2000 while the small cap index was up.  And you heard me right, it was  up 22 percent, the value component of the Russell 2000.  </p><p>So, there are opportunities out there and maybe we're rolling over into the  small area.  </p><p>HERERA:  Well, speaking of which, we asked you for some opportunities, and  you gave us a few stocks.  </p><p>Western Digital (NYSE:WDC), that's a tech place for you.  Why do you like  it?  </p><p>JAMES:  Well, it is in the tech space, but it's not expensive.  It's only  running, I think, around 11 times earnings.  The earnings are very strong.   It's been at new highs earlier this year then recently pulled back.  </p><p>So, we've got a little bit of an entry opportunity.  It does the steady  state and other, you know, hard disk types of drives and everybody needs  more disk space, that's for sure.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  You got the Radian Group (NYSE:RDN).  They're the largest PMI  insurance company.  So, you like the insurance component for interest rates  and also the mortgage component, huh?  </p><p>JAMES:  That's right.  Not many people pay 20 percent down and can avoid  that insurance.  So that is something that we think is going to go really  well.  As you said, they are the largest and last year was a record year, I  think, for them.  </p><p>We might run into a few problems with the rising interest rates maybe  slowing down some purchases, but I think there's a built-up demand there  and they've had really solid earnings up to this point.  So, this little  bit of a pullback may be a good opportunity.  Again, cheap company with  solid earnings.  </p><p>HERERA:  You also like gold, physical gold in particular, and it's been  performing quite well.  It moved up above what has been considered a key  technical level, what they call the 200-day moving average.  But you also  point out it can be held in IRAs.  </p><p>JAMES:  It can.  These exchange-traded funds offer you something that's  maybe a little harder to do with the physical components and all the  headaches and hassles and so forth that come with it.  </p><p>And, of course, you have incredible liquidity with it as well.  One of the  reasons we like gold is it moves typically the opposite direction of the  dollar.  And the dollar has been, you know, that week or so, gold has been  in an up trend.  </p><p>And when you get these times of turmoil, gold tends to hold up pretty well.   It does tend to anticipate future inflation and some of this tariff stuff  is inflationary.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  Barry, always good to see you, thanks.  </p><p>Barry James -- </p><p>JAMES:  Good to be with you.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  -- with James Investment Research joining us.  </p><p>HERERA:  It is time to take a look at today's upgrades and downgrades.  </p><p>Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) is raising its price target on Microsoft  (NASDAQ:MSFT) to $130 a share, the highest level on the street.  That price  indicates a 50 percent rise in the stock price and a $1 trillion valuation.   The firm expects Microsoft's dominant share of the cloud market to grow.   The shares rose 7.5 percent today, making it the best performing stock on  the Dow index.  </p><p>Fellow down component Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) saw its rating upgraded to market  perform from underperform over at Raymond James.  That firm cites a  strengthening of underlying business conditions.  The analysts there does  have some longer term concerns, including the return on Intel's investments  and the steady decline of the PC market.  </p><p>But nonetheless, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) was the second best performing stock  on the Dow index, up more than 6 percent.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  Elsewhere, Advanced Micro Devices (NYSE:AMD) saw its rating cut  to negative from neutral over at Susquehanna.  The firm says that AMD faces  increased competition from a cryptocurrency chip from China.  Price target  cut to $7.50.  Shares fell nearly 2 percent to $10.44.  </p><p>And Dollar Tree (NASDAQ:DLTR) saw its rating raised to overweight from  neutral at Piper Jaffray.  The firm saying the dollar tree is making what  it called sensible investments in its family dollar unit.  Price target was  lifted to $112 a share.  The stock rose more than 3 percent to $95.21.  </p><p>HERERA:  Still ahead, despite a cooling of those trade tension, some  farmers still don't feel any better.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ADITI ROY, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  I'm Aditi Roy in Romney,  Indiana, where some soybean farmers are getting increasingly nervous about  the trade tensions between the U.S. and China.  I'll have that story coming  up.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  There are reports tonight that San Francisco Fed president is  the top candidate to become the New York Fed president.  John Williams must  first be formally nominated by the New York Fed Board, then approved by the  board of governors.  His views do fall in line with the current approach of  gradual interest rate increases.  The New York Fed president serves as vice  chair of the policy making committee and supervises the big money center  banks.  It is considered one of the most powerful positions in the  financial sector.  </p><p>HERERA:  Despite a cooling of trade tensions, at least today, some farmers  are nervous.  </p><p>Aditi Roy has the story from the heartland.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ROY:  Welcome to Romney, Indiana, where you'll be hard pressed to find a  traffic light or anyone out on a Sunday afternoon.  </p><p>Homes and businesses are decorated by American flags, and the region is  blanketed by farm fields which produce soybeans, making this bucolic town  an epicenter for the trade tensions with China.  Brent Bible owns  Stillwater Farms on the west side of town.  </p><p>When will you start planting?  </p><p>BRENT BIBLE, OWNER, STILLWATER FARMS:  We hope to start planting in about  two weeks.  </p><p>ROY:  Once the snow recedes and spring gets under way, half his fields will  be filled with soybeans.  </p><p>BIBLE:  Essentially, this is one of the bins that we store our soybeans in.  </p><p>ROY:  But he's rethinking his crop plan amid chatter about China lowering  its soybean imports from the U.S. to retaliate against U.S. tariffs.  </p><p>BIBLE:  It's frustrating to think about the government can have -- can  affect policy that's going to negatively impact our price.  It's the  different between a profit for the year and a loss for the year.  </p><p>ROY:  The stakes are high for American soybean farmers like him.  China is  the top importer of U.S. soybeans, buying $14.5 billion worth of the  product which makes up a staggering 61 percent of all U.S. soybean exports.  </p><p>The war of words has become increasingly heated.  Just over the weekend,  China's former finance minister reportedly told a public audience, if I run  the government, I would hit soybeans first.  </p><p>And U.S. agricultural groups like the American Farm Bureau Federation are  speaking out, too, saying farming has fallen by about 50 percent over the  past four years.  Retaliation in the trade arena makes the outlook even  worse.  </p><p>But some analysts who follow soybean futures aren't as worried, saying  China's demand for soybeans is so large it cannot shut out U.S. supplies in  the long run.  That's little consolation for Bible who is now closely  monitoring events half a world away.  </p><p>BIBLE:  What we see is that the ag industry, the ag economy is very likely  going to be the first casualty of the trade war.  </p><p>ROY:  Besides soybeans, fruit, wine and pork are some of the other  agricultural products mentioned by China as possible retaliation targets.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Aditi Roy, Romney, Indiana.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Lowe's CEO is retiring, and that's where we begin tonight's  \"Market Focus\".  </p><p>After a 13-year stretch as chief executive, Robert Niblock says he plans to  retire from the company once a successor has been found.  The home  improvement retailer has struggled to keep up with Home Depot's performance  and recently added three new directors to its board following calls by an  activist investor.  Shares of Lowe's rose 6 percent to $89.30.  </p><p>Hedge fund Third Point which is run by billionaire investor Dan Loeb has  taken a stake in United Technologies (NYSE:UTX), that according to a  regulatory filing.  Earlier this year, United Tech said it was explores  whether to keep the company intact or break it up.  Shares today rose by  3.5 percent to $126.64.  </p><p>And construction materials company USG (NYSE:USG) said that it has turned  down a nearly $6 billion unsolicited takeover offer from German rival  Knuth.  USG (NYSE:USG) said that the offer significantly undervalued the  company.  By the way, Knuth is USG's second largest shareholder.  Share of  USG (NYSE:USG) jumped on the news by 19 percent to $40.03.  </p><p>HERERA:  The retailer Finish Line said it will sell itself to Britain's JD  Sports Fashion for more than $500 million.  Finish Line said the merger  gives it a stronger position in the athletic apparel space.  Shares  finished strong, up 31 percent to $13.83.  </p><p>Shares of General Electric (NYSE:GE) fell today, hitting a near nine-year  low at one point.  There was no announcement by the company that prompted  the drop, but a \"Wall Street Journal\" article published last night raised  questions about risks that could stand in the way of the company's  turnaround.  The report said investors could face risks stemming from GE's  former lending businesses and the company's exposure to subprime loans.  GE  shares finished down 1 percent to $12.89.  </p><p>And Campbell's Soup has completed its $6 billion acquisition of the snack  maker Snyder's-Lance (NASDAQ:LNCE).  The deal will shift Campbell's focus  away from meals to snack products.  To reflect the change, the company is  changing its name to Campbell's Snacks.  Campbell's Soup rose a fraction  today to $42.47. </p><p>GRIFFETH:  Wow, changing the name.  </p><p>HERERA:  Yes.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  The nation's oldest gun maker Remington has filed for bankruptcy  protection.  The company's sales have been declining since the 2016  presidential election.  They're thinking apparently being that gun control  regulations would be less likely under President Trump.  </p><p>Last year alone, Remington sales were down more than 30 percent.  Remington  is facing a heavy debt load and a number of lawsuits.  </p><p>HERERA:  And as overall gun sales slow, so does business at America's gun  shows.  </p><p>Jane Wells picks up the story from Costa Mesa, California.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JANE WELLS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  As many Americans  marched across the country Saturday demanding new gun restrictions,  including tens of thousands in Los Angeles, not one protester showed up at  California's largest annual gun show, the Crossroads of the West Show.  But  in the gun showdown, gun show traffic appeared down.  </p><p>MICHAEL BLANCHARD, GUN SHOW PATRON:  When we drove up today, I thought,  wow, where is everybody?  I actually thought maybe it was canceled.  </p><p>BOB TEMPLETON, CROSSROADS OF THE WEST GUN SHOW:  It's a little bit slow  starting.  We only had a 15-minute ticket line, but it's very busy inside.  </p><p>WELLS:  Inside the show, merchandise ran the gamut from collectibles to, in  one corner, Nazi memorabilia.  But the most popular attractions were the  assault rifles, AR-10s and AR-15s which face the greatest risk of being  banned.  </p><p>There's a new law in California that bans AR-15 from having magazines,  which attached easily from the outside.  You have to take apart the gun.   It slows you down.  And so, one of the hottest new products here are these  kits which allow you to take your existing AR-15 and convert them to be  compliant under state law.  </p><p>The owner of the show says traffic has been down generally since Donald  Trump became president as gun owners are less fearful about more  legislation, though some of that fear is now returning.  </p><p>RICK SALAZAR, NRA VOLUNTEER:  We're getting quite a few people that are  interested in joining because they're interested in protecting their gun  rights.  </p><p>WELLS:  That's especially true in California though some believe compromise  might be inevitable.  </p><p>TEMPLETON:  There's common ground and we need to seek that so we can begin,  I think begin a dialogue with -- between the two sides, but such a  polarizing issue.  </p><p>GENE GRAVETT, GUN SHOW PATRON:  You know, California is, in my mind, a  little bit overregulated, but my opinion is that if the rest of the country  was as regulated as this, we'd have fewer problems.  </p><p>WELLS:  That's probably not the most popular opinion here, but one that may  signal change could be coming.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Jane Wells, Costa Mesa, California.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Now that new legislation is in place, several significant tax  breaks are going to disappear.  And your 2017 returns will be the last time  you can grab them.  </p><p>Coming up, what's going and what's still in play for you to claim.  </p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Despite experiencing one of the longest bull markets in recent  memory, state and local pension systems are still underfunded.  Investment  returns have been uneven and funding levels have not yet recovered as a  result.  According to \"Reuters\" which cited analysis by Wilshire Funding,  back in 2007, the median funded level was 92 percent for state retirement  plans.  In 2016, that had fallen to 68 percent.  Lower funding levels, of  course, mean that more money is required to meet future obligations.  </p><p>HERERA:  Favorite time of year.  The countdown is on for the April 17th tax  filing deadline.  And it's the final call to claim several tax deductions  that will be going away after this year.  </p><p>So, Sharon Epperson joins us as she always does at this time of year.  </p><p>Great to see you, Sharon.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  This is a good news.</p><p>SHARON EPPERSON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, a great news,  a great news.</p><p>HERERA:  This is the last time taxpayers can file their federal returns  under the old tax law.  So as they do that and they compile the paperwork,  what did they need to remember?  </p><p>EPPERSON:  Well, we know there's been a big overhaul of the tax code.  And  one of the most important parts, of course, is going to be the doubling of  the standard deduction going forward.  That means a lot of folks may decide  not to itemize.  </p><p>But on top of that, itemized deductions will be less generous than they  have in the past.  And you add to that the personal exemptions that are  going away, there are a lot of changes that are taking place that people  need to be aware of.  So, now is the time to look at those tax breaks that  are still here and take full advantage of them.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  All right.  So, which breaks go away?  </p><p>EPPERSON:  Personal exemptions and dependent exemptions.  That's $4,050 for  you and your spouse or if you're taking care of someone else.  So, that's  significant and that's going away.  </p><p>The other is a number of miscellaneous itemized deductions, those that  exceed 2 percent of your adjusted gross income or the ones that you can  deduct now.  Things like job expenses, things like tax prep fees,  investment related fees, these are things that people don't always  consider.  Hobby expenses, if you actually get income from a hobby you're  doing.  </p><p>So, those are the ones that you want to take a look at again.  If you've  moved for a new job in 2017, at least 50 miles away, that is something that  you could also deduct and it could be above the line deduction, but going  forward you can only do it if you're in the active military, if you're  active duty and doing it because of military orders.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  Because they ordered you, yes.  There are other deductions that  we thought were going away and they are eventually, just not this year.  </p><p>EPPERSON:  They're back again for 2017.  So, that's a good -- we have to  look at some silver lining here.  So, if you pay mortgage insurance --  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  We have to because those of us who haven't finished our tax  returns have to do this.  </p><p>And exclusion for foreign debt, that's another thing to consider.  But if  you had a short sale or loan modification, normally, you know, you would  have to count that as income.  You don't have to do that in this regard.  </p><p>Tuition and fees for college expenses, that's up to $4,000 that you could  possibly get a tax break on there.  And if you have done some home  improvements and there's an energy efficient window you put in or door, you  can get up to a $500 tax credit, even better than a deduction.  </p><p>HERERA:  Can you follow me around, it's like do my tax --  </p><p>EPPERSON:  Can you help me and remind me to do mine?  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  You are always the last one.  </p><p>EPPERSON:  I'm always the last one, I'm always the last one.  But I will  get it in.  </p><p>HERERA:  Thanks, Sharon.  </p><p>EPPERSON:  All right.  Take care.  </p><p>HERERA:  And that will do it for us on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT.  For all of  us, including Sharon, thanks for joining us.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  I'm Bill Griffeth.  Enjoy your evening putting your taxes  together.  </p><p>HERERA:  Yes, exactly.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  We'll see you tomorrow.</p><p>END</p><p>Nightly Business Report transcripts and video are available on-line post  broadcast at <url normalizedValue=\"http://nbr.com\">http://nbr.com</url>.

Stocks surge.   The Dow has its third biggest point gain on record as trade tensions ease  and investors pour money into the market.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> SUE HERERA, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR:  Where to invest.  It is a  question a lot of investors are asking lately as they try to navigate the  volatility.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> GRIFFETH:  Disappearing deductions.  A handful of tax breaks are vanishing,  but there are a few credits you may be able to grab on to.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Those stories and much more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for a  Monday, March the 26th.  </p><p> HERERA:  Good evening, everybody.  And welcome.  </p><p> Stocks start the week with a jolt.  The Dow has its biggest point gain in a  decade, leaving last week's rout in the rear-view mirror.  Investors were  encouraged by the cooling of trade tensions and reports the talks were  under way to avert a global trade war.  </p><p> So, let's get you right to the closing numbers.  The Dow Jones Industrial  Average soared, 669 points to 24,202, the Nasdaq climbed 227 and the S&amp;P  500 rose 70.  For the Dow and the S&amp;P, it was their best one-day percentage  gain since mid-2015.  </p><p> Bob Pisani leads us off tonight from the New York Stock Exchange.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> BOB PISANI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Stocks surged following  reports that the U.S. and China are holding quiet talks to ease the trade  rift between them recouping almost half of last week's losses.  Now, there  was a modest blip midday right before the European markets closed brought  on by news of rising tensions with Russia over Europe.  But once Europe  closed, it was smooth sailing to session highs.  The Dow rose more than 600  points, the S&amp;P spiked more than 2 percent.  </p><p> So, why exactly did we get this rally?  Well, trade tensions have eased  with China and South Korea and thanks to last week's selloff, the market is  much cheaper than it was at the start of the year.  </p><p> The S&amp;P 500 is trading about 16 times forward earnings.  That's about the  historical average.  It's a lot cheaper than in January when we were  trading at more than 18 times forward earnings.  In other words, the  correction helped reset an overheated market.  </p><p> The key leadership is back.  That's important.  Tech and financials led the  charge.  </p><p> Remember, they're more than 40 percent of the S&amp;P 500 together.  It's hard  to keep the markets down when you have those two sectors this strong.  In  fact, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft  (NASDAQ:MSFT), they're the three largest stocks in the S&amp;P, they were up 3  to 7 percent today.  That's huge.  Together these three stocks are 10  percent of the whole weight in the S&amp;P 500.  </p><p> All 11 sectors ended higher on the day.  </p><p> For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Bob Pisani at the New York Stock Exchange.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> GRIFFETH:  And White House trade adviser Peter Navarro today confirmed  those reports of trade talks between the U.S. and China.  He said he's  hopeful the two countries can work together.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> PETER NAVARRO, NATIONAL TRADE COUNCIL DIRECTOR:  Ambassador Lighthizer and  Secretary Mnuchin, at the president's direction and personal direction, is  talking -- they are talking with the Chinese, as we've been doing since day  one.  And we will continue to do that.  And I think we're hopeful that  China will work with us to basically address some of these practices.  So,  I see nothing but bullish times ahead.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> GRIFFETH:  Last week as you know, the White House announced plans to impose  tariffs on up to $60 billion of Chinese products.  </p><p> HERERA:  In Beijing this weekend were some very well known and influential  American CEOs, including Apple's Tim Cook and Blackstone's Steve  Schwarzman.  And they were attending the China Development Forum.  As you  can imagine, the hot topic was trade.  </p><p> Eunice Yoon has our story.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> EUNICE YOON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Fears of a trade war  dominated the forum.  As co-chair of the event, Apple's Tim Cook called for  calmer heads and for President Trump to support policies that promote free  trade.  </p><p> TIM COOK, APPLE CEO:  What I've seen over my lifetime is that countries  that embrace openness, that embrace trade, that embrace diversity are the  countries that do exceptional.  And the countries that don't, don't.  </p><p> YOON:  Other CEOs shared cook's concerns including Blackstone's Steve  Schwarzman.  </p><p> STEPHEN SCHWARZMAN, THE BLACKSTONE GROUP CHAIRMAN &amp; CEO:  There needs to be  negotiated arrangement between the two countries, and I think it's  important to note that most of the types of things that are being discussed  from the U.S. side can be delayed in terms of their implementation and  hopefully will be.  </p><p> YOON:  Despite the aggressive rhetoric from both sides, there are reports  the two or negotiating behind the scenes.  The Trump administration has  reportedly handed the Chinese a to-do list that includes a reduction of  Chinese tariffs on U.S. autos, more Chinese purchases of American  semiconductors and greater access to the financial sector.  </p><p> I spoke to a source familiar with the discussions who said China's  officials seem willing to cooperate on these issues.  They're offering to  buy more U.S. semiconductors and accelerate the timeline for greater  foreign ownership in security.  Chinese officials also said that President  Xi Jinping would highlight more financial reforms at a business forum in  mid-April.  </p><p> Today, the foreign ministry reiterated again that Beijing is willing to  hold talks to resolve differences with the United States.  Tomorrow, a  small group of American CEOs is going to be meeting with the vice  president, Wang Qishan, a very close ally of President Xi Jinping.  </p><p> For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Eunice Yoon in Beijing.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> GRIFFETH:  The other big story in the market, it's still Facebook  (NASDAQ:FB).  A number of developments there.  The social media company is  now the target of an FTC probe.  The agency is looking into Facebook's data  and privacy practices.  </p><p> Separately, the company has acknowledged now that it does save extensive  call and text data made by Android users when those users opt-in to the  feature.  And CEO Mark Zuckerberg has now been asked to testify by the  Senate Judiciary Committee.  </p><p> The stocks spent much of the day lower.  In fact, it was down 5 or 6  percent but it finally eked out a small gain at the close to $160.06.  </p><p> HERERA:  The tech sector overall bounced back today, but it's had a hard  run of late.  </p><p> And as Mike Santoli reports, it may be time to rethink the way we invest in  this group.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> MIKE SANTOLI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  The stock market has  almost never been as reliant on the technology sector as it is today.  And  suddenly, big tech is suspect.  The industry is under fresh regulatory  pressure over misuse of customer data with Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) at the  center, and tech stocks are being newly scrutinized by investors who spent  the past years paying up aggressively for shares of the most powerful  Internet company excited for a digital feature that's now looking less  clear and bright.  </p><p> Facebook's role to enable information to be used as target election ads has  driven a nasty selloff in its stock and caused investors to rethink the  value of leading Internet platforms.  The reason Facebook (NASDAQ:FB),  Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) were  so popular on Wall Street in recent years was their natural dominance where  the winners take most of the rewards.  </p><p> Now that very dominance is making these companies targets.  The stock  market implications are significant.  The tech sector including Amazon  (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) which are technically in the  consumer category now makes up about 30 percent of the S&amp;P 500 index.  And  big tech over the past year has become valued at a substantial 20 percent  premium to the overall market based on stock price to earnings multiples.   So, if investors become less willing to accept less risk valuations, the  broader market would be held back or weighed down.  </p><p> Of course, this could simply be a temporary market panic over alarming but  fleeting headlines.  Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) stock for one thing has never  been as cheap based on its expected profits which are still set to grow  close to 20 percent this year.  And the good news is that outside of tech,  large cap stocks look quite a bit less expensive than they did just two  months ago before the market pullback.  </p><p> When the clear driver of the market runs into trouble as tech has lately,  rallying around new leadership can be a nervous and messy process.  </p><p> For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Mike Santoli.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> GRIFFETH:  And joining us right now to talk more about the markets where  he's finding opportunities following last week's sell-off, Barry James back  with us, president and portfolio manager at James Investment Research.  </p><p> Good to see you again.  Welcome back, Barry.</p><p> BARRY JAMES, JAMES INVESTMENT RESEARCH PRESIDENT:  Hi.  Great to be with  you.  </p><p> GRIFFETH:  Mike mentioned new leadership.  You feel like the smaller caps  are the new leadership for this market.  Why?  </p><p>JAMES:  Well, it's like what Yogi Berra said that, given directions to his  house, when you come to the fork in the road, take it.  I think we've hit  that fork in the road right now.  What we've seen up to this point it's  been all large cap all growth, all tech all the time.  And we've seen a bit  of a change this year.  </p><p> We just look through the end of last week, small cap stocks haven't gone  down as much as the large cap.  And as we look at small caps, there's a  couple of important things that I think are different.  </p><p> One is valuation.  If I look at really small companies versus really big  companies, they're cheaper by valuation methodologies.  Secondarily,  they're not impacted by all this tariff stuff quite as much because they  don't necessarily do that much exporting and have those problems.  And  lastly is this tax reform.  If you look at the effective tax rates on  companies, small companies have had higher effective tax rates, so they'll  get more of a benefit.  </p><p> So you got those three things.  And just one other thing I'd add is when we  come to these forks in the road in the past, I look back at 1999 and then  in the year 2000, all the tech stocks running, the Nasdaq fell 39 percent  in 2000 while the small cap index was up.  And you heard me right, it was  up 22 percent, the value component of the Russell 2000.  </p><p> So, there are opportunities out there and maybe we're rolling over into the  small area.  </p><p> HERERA:  Well, speaking of which, we asked you for some opportunities, and  you gave us a few stocks.  </p><p> Western Digital (NYSE:WDC), that's a tech place for you.  Why do you like  it?  </p><p>JAMES:  Well, it is in the tech space, but it's not expensive.  It's only  running, I think, around 11 times earnings.  The earnings are very strong.   It's been at new highs earlier this year then recently pulled back.  </p><p> So, we've got a little bit of an entry opportunity.  It does the steady  state and other, you know, hard disk types of drives and everybody needs  more disk space, that's for sure.  </p><p> GRIFFETH:  You got the Radian Group (NYSE:RDN).  They're the largest PMI  insurance company.  So, you like the insurance component for interest rates  and also the mortgage component, huh?  </p><p>JAMES:  That's right.  Not many people pay 20 percent down and can avoid  that insurance.  So that is something that we think is going to go really  well.  As you said, they are the largest and last year was a record year, I  think, for them.  </p><p> We might run into a few problems with the rising interest rates maybe  slowing down some purchases, but I think there's a built-up demand there  and they've had really solid earnings up to this point.  So, this little  bit of a pullback may be a good opportunity.  Again, cheap company with  solid earnings.  </p><p> HERERA:  You also like gold, physical gold in particular, and it's been  performing quite well.  It moved up above what has been considered a key  technical level, what they call the 200-day moving average.  But you also  point out it can be held in IRAs.  </p><p>JAMES:  It can.  These exchange-traded funds offer you something that's  maybe a little harder to do with the physical components and all the  headaches and hassles and so forth that come with it.  </p><p> And, of course, you have incredible liquidity with it as well.  One of the  reasons we like gold is it moves typically the opposite direction of the  dollar.  And the dollar has been, you know, that week or so, gold has been  in an up trend.  </p><p> And when you get these times of turmoil, gold tends to hold up pretty well.   It does tend to anticipate future inflation and some of this tariff stuff  is inflationary.  </p><p> GRIFFETH:  Barry, always good to see you, thanks.  </p><p> Barry James -- </p><p>JAMES:  Good to be with you.  </p><p> GRIFFETH:  -- with James Investment Research joining us.  </p><p> HERERA:  It is time to take a look at today's upgrades and downgrades.  </p><p> Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) is raising its price target on Microsoft  (NASDAQ:MSFT) to $130 a share, the highest level on the street.  That price  indicates a 50 percent rise in the stock price and a $1 trillion valuation.   The firm expects Microsoft's dominant share of the cloud market to grow.   The shares rose 7.5 percent today, making it the best performing stock on  the Dow index.  </p><p> Fellow down component Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) saw its rating upgraded to market  perform from underperform over at Raymond James.  That firm cites a  strengthening of underlying business conditions.  The analysts there does  have some longer term concerns, including the return on Intel's investments  and the steady decline of the PC market.  </p><p> But nonetheless, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) was the second best performing stock  on the Dow index, up more than 6 percent.  </p><p> GRIFFETH:  Elsewhere, Advanced Micro Devices (NYSE:AMD) saw its rating cut  to negative from neutral over at Susquehanna.  The firm says that AMD faces  increased competition from a cryptocurrency chip from China.  Price target  cut to $7.50.  Shares fell nearly 2 percent to $10.44.  </p><p> And Dollar Tree (NASDAQ:DLTR) saw its rating raised to overweight from  neutral at Piper Jaffray.  The firm saying the dollar tree is making what  it called sensible investments in its family dollar unit.  Price target was  lifted to $112 a share.  The stock rose more than 3 percent to $95.21.  </p><p> HERERA:  Still ahead, despite a cooling of those trade tension, some  farmers still don't feel any better.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> ADITI ROY, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  I'm Aditi Roy in Romney,  Indiana, where some soybean farmers are getting increasingly nervous about  the trade tensions between the U.S. and China.  I'll have that story coming  up.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> (MUSIC)</p><p> GRIFFETH:  There are reports tonight that San Francisco Fed president is  the top candidate to become the New York Fed president.  John Williams must  first be formally nominated by the New York Fed Board, then approved by the  board of governors.  His views do fall in line with the current approach of  gradual interest rate increases.  The New York Fed president serves as vice  chair of the policy making committee and supervises the big money center  banks.  It is considered one of the most powerful positions in the  financial sector.  </p><p> HERERA:  Despite a cooling of trade tensions, at least today, some farmers  are nervous.  </p><p> Aditi Roy has the story from the heartland.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> ROY:  Welcome to Romney, Indiana, where you'll be hard pressed to find a  traffic light or anyone out on a Sunday afternoon.  </p><p> Homes and businesses are decorated by American flags, and the region is  blanketed by farm fields which produce soybeans, making this bucolic town  an epicenter for the trade tensions with China.  Brent Bible owns  Stillwater Farms on the west side of town.  </p><p> When will you start planting?  </p><p> BRENT BIBLE, OWNER, STILLWATER FARMS:  We hope to start planting in about  two weeks.  </p><p> ROY:  Once the snow recedes and spring gets under way, half his fields will  be filled with soybeans.  </p><p> BIBLE:  Essentially, this is one of the bins that we store our soybeans in.  </p><p> ROY:  But he's rethinking his crop plan amid chatter about China lowering  its soybean imports from the U.S. to retaliate against U.S. tariffs.  </p><p> BIBLE:  It's frustrating to think about the government can have -- can  affect policy that's going to negatively impact our price.  It's the  different between a profit for the year and a loss for the year.  </p><p> ROY:  The stakes are high for American soybean farmers like him.  China is  the top importer of U.S. soybeans, buying $14.5 billion worth of the  product which makes up a staggering 61 percent of all U.S. soybean exports.  </p><p> The war of words has become increasingly heated.  Just over the weekend,  China's former finance minister reportedly told a public audience, if I run  the government, I would hit soybeans first.  </p><p> And U.S. agricultural groups like the American Farm Bureau Federation are  speaking out, too, saying farming has fallen by about 50 percent over the  past four years.  Retaliation in the trade arena makes the outlook even  worse.  </p><p> But some analysts who follow soybean futures aren't as worried, saying  China's demand for soybeans is so large it cannot shut out U.S. supplies in  the long run.  That's little consolation for Bible who is now closely  monitoring events half a world away.  </p><p> BIBLE:  What we see is that the ag industry, the ag economy is very likely  going to be the first casualty of the trade war.  </p><p> ROY:  Besides soybeans, fruit, wine and pork are some of the other  agricultural products mentioned by China as possible retaliation targets.  </p><p> For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Aditi Roy, Romney, Indiana.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> GRIFFETH:  Lowe's CEO is retiring, and that's where we begin tonight's  \"Market Focus\".  </p><p> After a 13-year stretch as chief executive, Robert Niblock says he plans to  retire from the company once a successor has been found.  The home  improvement retailer has struggled to keep up with Home Depot's performance  and recently added three new directors to its board following calls by an  activist investor.  Shares of Lowe's rose 6 percent to $89.30.  </p><p> Hedge fund Third Point which is run by billionaire investor Dan Loeb has  taken a stake in United Technologies (NYSE:UTX), that according to a  regulatory filing.  Earlier this year, United Tech said it was explores  whether to keep the company intact or break it up.  Shares today rose by  3.5 percent to $126.64.  </p><p> And construction materials company USG (NYSE:USG) said that it has turned  down a nearly $6 billion unsolicited takeover offer from German rival  Knuth.  USG (NYSE:USG) said that the offer significantly undervalued the  company.  By the way, Knuth is USG's second largest shareholder.  Share of  USG (NYSE:USG) jumped on the news by 19 percent to $40.03.  </p><p> HERERA:  The retailerFinish Line said it will sell itself to Britain's JD  Sports Fashion for more than $500 million.  Finish Line said the merger  gives it a stronger position in the athletic apparel space.  Shares  finished strong, up 31 percent to $13.83.  </p><p> Shares of General Electric (NYSE:GE) fell today, hitting a near nine-year  low at one point.  There was no announcement by the company that prompted  the drop, but a \"Wall Street Journal\" article published last night raised  questions about risks that could stand in the way of the company's  turnaround.  The report said investors could face risks stemming from GE's  former lending businesses and the company's exposure to subprime loans.  GE  shares finished down 1 percent to $12.89.  </p><p> And Campbell's Soup has completed its $6 billion acquisition of the snack  maker Snyder's-Lance (NASDAQ:LNCE).  The deal will shift Campbell's focus  away from meals to snack products.  To reflect the change, the company is  changing its name to Campbell's Snacks.  Campbell's Soup rose a fraction  today to $42.47. </p><p> GRIFFETH:  Wow, changing the name.  </p><p> HERERA:  Yes.</p><p> GRIFFETH:  The nation's oldest gun maker Remington has filed for bankruptcy  protection.  The company's sales have been declining since the 2016  presidential election.  They're thinking apparently being that gun control  regulations would be less likely under President Trump.  </p><p> Last year alone, Remington sales were down more than 30 percent.  Remington  is facing a heavy debt load and a number of lawsuits.  </p><p> HERERA:  And as overall gun sales slow, so does business at America's gun  shows.  </p><p> Jane Wells picks up the story from Costa Mesa, California.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> JANE WELLS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  As many Americans  marched across the country Saturday demanding new gun restrictions,  including tens of thousands in Los Angeles, not one protester showed up at  California's largest annual gun show, the Crossroads of the West Show.  But  in the gun showdown, gun show traffic appeared down.  </p><p> MICHAEL BLANCHARD, GUN SHOW PATRON:  When we drove up today, I thought,  wow, where is everybody?  I actually thought maybe it was canceled.  </p><p> BOB TEMPLETON, CROSSROADS OF THE WEST GUN SHOW:  It's a little bit slow  starting.  We only had a 15-minute ticket line, but it's very busy inside.  </p><p> WELLS:  Inside the show, merchandise ran the gamut from collectibles to, in  one corner, Nazi memorabilia.  But the most popular attractions were the  assault rifles, AR-10s and AR-15s which face the greatest risk of being  banned.  </p><p> There's a new law in California that bans AR-15 from having magazines,  which attached easily from the outside.  You have to take apart the gun.   It slows you down.  And so, one of the hottest new products here are these  kits which allow you to take your existing AR-15 and convert them to be  compliant under state law.  </p><p> The owner of the show says traffic has been down generally since Donald  Trump became president as gun owners are less fearful about more  legislation, though some of that fear is now returning.  </p><p> RICK SALAZAR, NRA VOLUNTEER:  We're getting quite a few people that are  interested in joining because they're interested in protecting their gun  rights.  </p><p> WELLS:  That's especially true in California though some believe compromise  might be inevitable.  </p><p> TEMPLETON:  There's common ground and we need to seek that so we can begin,  I think begin a dialogue with -- between the two sides, but such a  polarizing issue.  </p><p> GENE GRAVETT, GUN SHOW PATRON:  You know, California is, in my mind, a  little bit overregulated, but my opinion is that if the rest of the country  was as regulated as this, we'd have fewer problems.  </p><p> WELLS:  That's probably not the most popular opinion here, but one that may  signal change could be coming.  </p><p> For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Jane Wells, Costa Mesa, California.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> GRIFFETH:  Now that new legislation is in place, several significant tax  breaks are going to disappear.  And your 2017 returns will be the last time  you can grab them.  </p><p> Coming up, what's going and what's still in play for you to claim.  </p><p> (MUSIC)</p><p> GRIFFETH:  Despite experiencing one of the longest bull markets in recent  memory, state and local pension systems are still underfunded.  Investment  returns have been uneven and funding levels have not yet recovered as a  result.  According to \"Reuters\" which cited analysis by Wilshire Funding,  back in 2007, the median funded level was 92 percent for state retirement  plans.  In 2016, that had fallen to 68 percent.  Lower funding levels, of  course, mean that more money is required to meet future obligations.  </p><p> HERERA:  Favorite time of year.  The countdown is on for the April 17th tax  filing deadline.  And it's the final call to claim several tax deductions  that will be going away after this year.  </p><p> So, Sharon Epperson joins us as she always does at this time of year.  </p><p> Great to see you, Sharon.  </p><p> GRIFFETH:  This is a good news.</p><p> SHARON EPPERSON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, a great news,  a great news.</p><p> HERERA:  This is the last time taxpayers can file their federal returns  under the old tax law.  So as they do that and they compile the paperwork,  what did they need to remember?  </p><p> EPPERSON:  Well, we know there's been a big overhaul of the tax code.  And  one of the most important parts, of course, is going to be the doubling of  the standard deduction going forward.  That means a lot of folks may decide  not to itemize.  </p><p> But on top of that, itemized deductions will be less generous than they  have in the past.  And you add to that the personal exemptions that are  going away, there are a lot of changes that are taking place that people  need to be aware of.  So, now is the time to look at those tax breaks that  are still here and take full advantage of them.  </p><p> GRIFFETH:  All right.  So, which breaks go away?  </p><p> EPPERSON:  Personal exemptions and dependent exemptions.  That's $4,050 for  you and your spouse or if you're taking care of someone else.  So, that's  significant and that's going away.  </p><p> The other is a number of miscellaneous itemized deductions, those that  exceed 2 percent of your adjusted gross income or the ones that you can  deduct now.  Things like job expenses, things like tax prep fees,  investment related fees, these are things that people don't always  consider.  Hobby expenses, if you actually get income from a hobby you're  doing.  </p><p> So, those are the ones that you want to take a look at again.  If you've  moved for a new job in 2017, at least 50 miles away, that is something that  you could also deduct and it could be above the line deduction, but going  forward you can only do it if you're in the active military, if you're  active duty and doing it because of military orders.  </p><p> GRIFFETH:  Because they ordered you, yes.  There are other deductions that  we thought were going away and they are eventually, just not this year.  </p><p> EPPERSON:  They're back again for 2017.  So, that's a good -- we have to  look at some silver lining here.  So, if you pay mortgage insurance --  </p><p> GRIFFETH:  We have to because those of us who haven't finished our tax  returns have to do this.  </p><p> And exclusion for foreign debt, that's another thing to consider.  But if  you had a short sale or loan modification, normally, you know, you would  have to count that as income.  You don't have to do that in this regard.  </p><p> Tuition and fees for college expenses, that's up to $4,000 that you could  possibly get a tax break on there.  And if you have done some home  improvements and there's an energy efficient window you put in or door, you  can get up to a $500 tax credit, even better than a deduction.  </p><p> HERERA:  Can you follow me around, it's like do my tax --  </p><p> EPPERSON:  Can you help me and remind me to do mine?  </p><p> GRIFFETH:  You are always the last one.  </p><p> EPPERSON:  I'm always the last one, I'm always the last one.  But I will  get it in.  </p><p> HERERA:  Thanks, Sharon.  </p><p> EPPERSON:  All right.  Take care.  </p><p> HERERA:  And that will do it for us on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT.  For all of  us, including Sharon, thanks for joining us.  </p><p> GRIFFETH:  I'm Bill Griffeth.  Enjoy your evening putting your taxes  together.  </p><p> HERERA:  Yes, exactly.</p><p> GRIFFETH:  We'll see you tomorrow.</p><p> END</p><p> Nightly Business Report transcripts and video are available on-line post  broadcast at <url normalizedValue=\"http://nbr.com\">http://nbr.com</url>.

Stocks surge. The Dow has its third biggest point gain on record as trade tensions ease and investors pour money into the market.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SUE HERERA, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR: Where to invest. It is a question a lot of investors are asking lately as they try to navigate the volatility.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">GRIFFETH: Disappearing deductions. A handful of tax breaks are vanishing, but there are a few credits you may be able to grab on to.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Those stories and much more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for a Monday, March the 26th.</p><p>HERERA: Good evening, everybody. And welcome.</p><p>Stocks start the week with a jolt. The Dow has its biggest point gain in a decade, leaving last week`s rout in the rear-view mirror. Investors were encouraged by the cooling of trade tensions and reports the talks were under way to avert a global trade war.</p><p>So, let`s get you right to the closing numbers. The Dow Jones Industrial Average soared, 669 points to 24,202, the Nasdaq climbed 227 and the S&amp;P 500 rose 70. For the Dow and the S&amp;P, it was their best one-day percentage gain since mid-2015.</p><p>Bob Pisani leads us off tonight from the New York Stock Exchange.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BOB PISANI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Stocks surged following reports that the U.S. and China are holding quiet talks to ease the trade rift between them recouping almost half of last week`s losses. Now, there was a modest blip midday right before the European markets closed brought on by news of rising tensions with Russia over Europe. But once Europe closed, it was smooth sailing to session highs. The Dow rose more than 600 points, the S&amp;P spiked more than 2 percent.</p><p>So, why exactly did we get this rally? Well, trade tensions have eased with China and South Korea and thanks to last week`s selloff, the market is much cheaper than it was at the start of the year.</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 is trading about 16 times forward earnings. That`s about the historical average. It`s a lot cheaper than in January when we were trading at more than 18 times forward earnings. In other words, the correction helped reset an overheated market.</p><p>The key leadership is back. That`s important. Tech and financials led the charge.</p><p>Remember, they`re more than 40 percent of the S&amp;P 500 together. It`s hard to keep the markets down when you have those two sectors this strong. In fact, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), they`re the three largest stocks in the S&amp;P, they were up 3 to 7 percent today. That`s huge. Together these three stocks are 10 percent of the whole weight in the S&amp;P 500.</p><p>All 11 sectors ended higher on the day.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Bob Pisani at the New York Stock Exchange.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH: And White House trade adviser Peter Navarro today confirmed those reports of trade talks between the U.S. and China. He said he`s hopeful the two countries can work together.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PETER NAVARRO, NATIONAL TRADE COUNCIL DIRECTOR: Ambassador Lighthizer and Secretary Mnuchin, at the president`s direction and personal direction, is talking -- they are talking with the Chinese, as we`ve been doing since day one. And we will continue to do that. And I think we`re hopeful that China will work with us to basically address some of these practices. So, I see nothing but bullish times ahead.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GRIFFETH: Last week as you know, the White House announced plans to impose tariffs on up to $60 billion of Chinese products.</p><p>HERERA: In Beijing this weekend were some very well known and influential American CEOs, including Apple`s Tim Cook and Blackstone`s Steve Schwarzman. And they were attending the China Development Forum. As you can imagine, the hot topic was trade.</p><p>Eunice Yoon has our story.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>EUNICE YOON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Fears of a trade war dominated the forum. As co-chair of the event, Apple`s Tim Cook called for calmer heads and for President Trump to support policies that promote free trade.</p><p>TIM COOK, APPLE CEO: What I`ve seen over my lifetime is that countries that embrace openness, that embrace trade, that embrace diversity are the countries that do exceptional. And the countries that don`t, don`t.</p><p>YOON: Other CEOs shared cook`s concerns including Blackstone`s Steve Schwarzman.</p><p>STEPHEN SCHWARZMAN, THE BLACKSTONE GROUP CHAIRMAN &amp; CEO: There needs to be negotiated arrangement between the two countries, and I think it`s important to note that most of the types of things that are being discussed from the U.S. side can be delayed in terms of their implementation and hopefully will be.</p><p>YOON: Despite the aggressive rhetoric from both sides, there are reports the two or negotiating behind the scenes. The Trump administration has reportedly handed the Chinese a to-do list that includes a reduction of Chinese tariffs on U.S. autos, more Chinese purchases of American semiconductors and greater access to the financial sector.</p><p>I spoke to a source familiar with the discussions who said China`s officials seem willing to cooperate on these issues. They`re offering to buy more U.S. semiconductors and accelerate the timeline for greater foreign ownership in security. Chinese officials also said that President Xi Jinping would highlight more financial reforms at a business forum in mid-April.</p><p>Today, the foreign ministry reiterated again that Beijing is willing to hold talks to resolve differences with the United States. Tomorrow, a small group of American CEOs is going to be meeting with the vice president, Wang Qishan, a very close ally of President Xi Jinping.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Eunice Yoon in Beijing.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH: The other big story in the market, it`s still Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). A number of developments there. The social media company is now the target of an FTC probe. The agency is looking into Facebook`s data and privacy practices.</p><p>Separately, the company has acknowledged now that it does save extensive call and text data made by Android users when those users opt-in to the feature. And CEO Mark Zuckerberg has now been asked to testify by the Senate Judiciary Committee.</p><p>The stocks spent much of the day lower. In fact, it was down 5 or 6 percent but it finally eked out a small gain at the close to $160.06.</p><p>HERERA: The tech sector overall bounced back today, but it`s had a hard run of late.</p><p>And as Mike Santoli reports, it may be time to rethink the way we invest in this group.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MIKE SANTOLI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: The stock market has almost never been as reliant on the technology sector as it is today. And suddenly, big tech is suspect. The industry is under fresh regulatory pressure over misuse of customer data with Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) at the center, and tech stocks are being newly scrutinized by investors who spent the past years paying up aggressively for shares of the most powerful Internet company excited for a digital feature that`s now looking less clear and bright.</p><p>Facebook`s role to enable information to be used as target election ads has driven a nasty selloff in its stock and caused investors to rethink the value of leading Internet platforms. The reason Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) were so popular on Wall Street in recent years was their natural dominance where the winners take most of the rewards.</p><p>Now that very dominance is making these companies targets. The stock market implications are significant. The tech sector including Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) which are technically in the consumer category now makes up about 30 percent of the S&amp;P 500 index. And big tech over the past year has become valued at a substantial 20 percent premium to the overall market based on stock price to earnings multiples. So, if investors become less willing to accept less risk valuations, the broader market would be held back or weighed down.</p><p>Of course, this could simply be a temporary market panic over alarming but fleeting headlines. Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) stock for one thing has never been as cheap based on its expected profits which are still set to grow close to 20 percent this year. And the good news is that outside of tech, large cap stocks look quite a bit less expensive than they did just two months ago before the market pullback.</p><p>When the clear driver of the market runs into trouble as tech has lately, rallying around new leadership can be a nervous and messy process.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Mike Santoli.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH: And joining us right now to talk more about the markets where he`s finding opportunities following last week`s sell-off, Barry James back with us, president and portfolio manager at James Investment Research.</p><p>Good to see you again. Welcome back, Barry.</p><p>BARRY JAMES, JAMES INVESTMENT RESEARCH PRESIDENT: Hi. Great to be with you.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Mike mentioned new leadership. You feel like the smaller caps are the new leadership for this market. Why?</p><p>JAMES: Well, it`s like what Yogi Berra said that, given directions to his house, when you come to the fork in the road, take it. I think we`ve hit that fork in the road right now. What we`ve seen up to this point it`s been all large cap all growth, all tech all the time. And we`ve seen a bit of a change this year.</p><p>We just look through the end of last week, small cap stocks haven`t gone down as much as the large cap. And as we look at small caps, there`s a couple of important things that I think are different.</p><p>One is valuation. If I look at really small companies versus really big companies, they`re cheaper by valuation methodologies. Secondarily, they`re not impacted by all this tariff stuff quite as much because they don`t necessarily do that much exporting and have those problems. And lastly is this tax reform. If you look at the effective tax rates on companies, small companies have had higher effective tax rates, so they`ll get more of a benefit.</p><p>So you got those three things. And just one other thing I`d add is when we come to these forks in the road in the past, I look back at 1999 and then in the year 2000, all the tech stocks running, the Nasdaq fell 39 percent in 2000 while the small cap index was up. And you heard me right, it was up 22 percent, the value component of the Russell 2000.</p><p>So, there are opportunities out there and maybe we`re rolling over into the small area.</p><p>HERERA: Well, speaking of which, we asked you for some opportunities, and you gave us a few stocks.</p><p>Western Digital (NYSE:WDC), that`s a tech place for you. Why do you like it?</p><p>JAMES: Well, it is in the tech space, but it`s not expensive. It`s only running, I think, around 11 times earnings. The earnings are very strong. It`s been at new highs earlier this year then recently pulled back.</p><p>So, we`ve got a little bit of an entry opportunity. It does the steady state and other, you know, hard disk types of drives and everybody needs more disk space, that`s for sure.</p><p>GRIFFETH: You got the Radian Group (NYSE:RDN). They`re the largest PMI insurance company. So, you like the insurance component for interest rates and also the mortgage component, huh?</p><p>JAMES: That`s right. Not many people pay 20 percent down and can avoid that insurance. So that is something that we think is going to go really well. As you said, they are the largest and last year was a record year, I think, for them.</p><p>We might run into a few problems with the rising interest rates maybe slowing down some purchases, but I think there`s a built-up demand there and they`ve had really solid earnings up to this point. So, this little bit of a pullback may be a good opportunity. Again, cheap company with solid earnings.</p><p>HERERA: You also like gold, physical gold in particular, and it`s been performing quite well. It moved up above what has been considered a key technical level, what they call the 200-day moving average. But you also point out it can be held in IRAs.</p><p>JAMES: It can. These exchange-traded funds offer you something that`s maybe a little harder to do with the physical components and all the headaches and hassles and so forth that come with it.</p><p>And, of course, you have incredible liquidity with it as well. One of the reasons we like gold is it moves typically the opposite direction of the dollar. And the dollar has been, you know, that week or so, gold has been in an up trend.</p><p>And when you get these times of turmoil, gold tends to hold up pretty well. It does tend to anticipate future inflation and some of this tariff stuff is inflationary.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Barry, always good to see you, thanks.</p><p>Barry James --</p><p>JAMES: Good to be with you.</p><p>GRIFFETH: -- with James Investment Research joining us.</p><p>HERERA: It is time to take a look at today`s upgrades and downgrades.</p><p>Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) is raising its price target on Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) to $130 a share, the highest level on the street. That price indicates a 50 percent rise in the stock price and a $1 trillion valuation. The firm expects Microsoft`s dominant share of the cloud market to grow. The shares rose 7.5 percent today, making it the best performing stock on the Dow index.</p><p>Fellow down component Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) saw its rating upgraded to market perform from underperform over at Raymond James. That firm cites a strengthening of underlying business conditions. The analysts there does have some longer term concerns, including the return on Intel`s investments and the steady decline of the PC market.</p><p>But nonetheless, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) was the second best performing stock on the Dow index, up more than 6 percent.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Elsewhere, Advanced Micro Devices (NYSE:AMD) saw its rating cut to negative from neutral over at Susquehanna. The firm says that AMD faces increased competition from a cryptocurrency chip from China. Price target cut to $7.50. Shares fell nearly 2 percent to $10.44.</p><p>And Dollar Tree (NASDAQ:DLTR) saw its rating raised to overweight from neutral at Piper Jaffray. The firm saying the dollar tree is making what it called sensible investments in its family dollar unit. Price target was lifted to $112 a share. The stock rose more than 3 percent to $95.21.</p><p>HERERA: Still ahead, despite a cooling of those trade tension, some farmers still don`t feel any better.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ADITI ROY, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: I`m Aditi Roy in Romney, Indiana, where some soybean farmers are getting increasingly nervous about the trade tensions between the U.S. and China. I`ll have that story coming up.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GRIFFETH: There are reports tonight that San Francisco Fed president is the top candidate to become the New York Fed president. John Williams must first be formally nominated by the New York Fed Board, then approved by the board of governors. His views do fall in line with the current approach of gradual interest rate increases. The New York Fed president serves as vice chair of the policy making committee and supervises the big money center banks. It is considered one of the most powerful positions in the financial sector.</p><p>HERERA: Despite a cooling of trade tensions, at least today, some farmers are nervous.</p><p>Aditi Roy has the story from the heartland.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ROY: Welcome to Romney, Indiana, where you`ll be hard pressed to find a traffic light or anyone out on a Sunday afternoon.</p><p>Homes and businesses are decorated by American flags, and the region is blanketed by farm fields which produce soybeans, making this bucolic town an epicenter for the trade tensions with China. Brent Bible owns Stillwater Farms on the west side of town.</p><p>When will you start planting?</p><p>BRENT BIBLE, OWNER, STILLWATER FARMS: We hope to start planting in about two weeks.</p><p>ROY: Once the snow recedes and spring gets under way, half his fields will be filled with soybeans.</p><p>BIBLE: Essentially, this is one of the bins that we store our soybeans in.</p><p>ROY: But he`s rethinking his crop plan amid chatter about China lowering its soybean imports from the U.S. to retaliate against U.S. tariffs.</p><p>BIBLE: It`s frustrating to think about the government can have -- can affect policy that`s going to negatively impact our price. It`s the different between a profit for the year and a loss for the year.</p><p>ROY: The stakes are high for American soybean farmers like him. China is the top importer of U.S. soybeans, buying $14.5 billion worth of the product which makes up a staggering 61 percent of all U.S. soybean exports.</p><p>The war of words has become increasingly heated. Just over the weekend, China`s former finance minister reportedly told a public audience, if I run the government, I would hit soybeans first.</p><p>And U.S. agricultural groups like the American Farm Bureau Federation are speaking out, too, saying farming has fallen by about 50 percent over the past four years. Retaliation in the trade arena makes the outlook even worse.</p><p>But some analysts who follow soybean futures aren`t as worried, saying China`s demand for soybeans is so large it cannot shut out U.S. supplies in the long run. That`s little consolation for Bible who is now closely monitoring events half a world away.</p><p>BIBLE: What we see is that the ag industry, the ag economy is very likely going to be the first casualty of the trade war.</p><p>ROY: Besides soybeans, fruit, wine and pork are some of the other agricultural products mentioned by China as possible retaliation targets.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Aditi Roy, Romney, Indiana.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH: Lowe`s CEO is retiring, and that`s where we begin tonight`s \"Market Focus\".</p><p>After a 13-year stretch as chief executive, Robert Niblock says he plans to retire from the company once a successor has been found. The home improvement retailer has struggled to keep up with Home Depot`s performance and recently added three new directors to its board following calls by an activist investor. Shares of Lowe`s rose 6 percent to $89.30.</p><p>Hedge fund Third Point which is run by billionaire investor Dan Loeb has taken a stake in United Technologies (NYSE:UTX), that according to a regulatory filing. Earlier this year, United Tech said it was explores whether to keep the company intact or break it up. Shares today rose by 3.5 percent to $126.64.</p><p>And construction materials company USG (NYSE:USG) said that it has turned down a nearly $6 billion unsolicited takeover offer from German rival Knuth. USG (NYSE:USG) said that the offer significantly undervalued the company. By the way, Knuth is USG`s second largest shareholder. Share of USG (NYSE:USG) jumped on the news by 19 percent to $40.03.</p><p>HERERA: The retailerFinish Line said it will sell itself to Britain`s JD Sports Fashion for more than $500 million. Finish Line said the merger gives it a stronger position in the athletic apparel space. Shares finished strong, up 31 percent to $13.83.</p><p>Shares of General Electric (NYSE:GE) fell today, hitting a near nine-year low at one point. There was no announcement by the company that prompted the drop, but a \"Wall Street Journal\" article published last night raised questions about risks that could stand in the way of the company`s turnaround. The report said investors could face risks stemming from GE`s former lending businesses and the company`s exposure to subprime loans. GE shares finished down 1 percent to $12.89.</p><p>And Campbell`s Soup has completed its $6 billion acquisition of the snack maker Snyder`s-Lance (NASDAQ:LNCE). The deal will shift Campbell`s focus away from meals to snack products. To reflect the change, the company is changing its name to Campbell`s Snacks. Campbell`s Soup rose a fraction today to $42.47.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Wow, changing the name.</p><p>HERERA: Yes.</p><p>GRIFFETH: The nation`s oldest gun maker Remington has filed for bankruptcy protection. The company`s sales have been declining since the 2016 presidential election. They`re thinking apparently being that gun control regulations would be less likely under President Trump.</p><p>Last year alone, Remington sales were down more than 30 percent. Remington is facing a heavy debt load and a number of lawsuits.</p><p>HERERA: And as overall gun sales slow, so does business at America`s gun shows.</p><p>Jane Wells picks up the story from Costa Mesa, California.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JANE WELLS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: As many Americans marched across the country Saturday demanding new gun restrictions, including tens of thousands in Los Angeles, not one protester showed up at California`s largest annual gun show, the Crossroads of the West Show. But in the gun showdown, gun show traffic appeared down.</p><p>MICHAEL BLANCHARD, GUN SHOW PATRON: When we drove up today, I thought, wow, where is everybody? I actually thought maybe it was canceled.</p><p>BOB TEMPLETON, CROSSROADS OF THE WEST GUN SHOW: It`s a little bit slow starting. We only had a 15-minute ticket line, but it`s very busy inside.</p><p>WELLS: Inside the show, merchandise ran the gamut from collectibles to, in one corner, Nazi memorabilia. But the most popular attractions were the assault rifles, AR-10s and AR-15s which face the greatest risk of being banned.</p><p>There`s a new law in California that bans AR-15 from having magazines, which attached easily from the outside. You have to take apart the gun. It slows you down. And so, one of the hottest new products here are these kits which allow you to take your existing AR-15 and convert them to be compliant under state law.</p><p>The owner of the show says traffic has been down generally since Donald Trump became president as gun owners are less fearful about more legislation, though some of that fear is now returning.</p><p>RICK SALAZAR, NRA VOLUNTEER: We`re getting quite a few people that are interested in joining because they`re interested in protecting their gun rights.</p><p>WELLS: That`s especially true in California though some believe compromise might be inevitable.</p><p>TEMPLETON: There`s common ground and we need to seek that so we can begin, I think begin a dialogue with -- between the two sides, but such a polarizing issue.</p><p>GENE GRAVETT, GUN SHOW PATRON: You know, California is, in my mind, a little bit overregulated, but my opinion is that if the rest of the country was as regulated as this, we`d have fewer problems.</p><p>WELLS: That`s probably not the most popular opinion here, but one that may signal change could be coming.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Jane Wells, Costa Mesa, California.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH: Now that new legislation is in place, several significant tax breaks are going to disappear. And your 2017 returns will be the last time you can grab them.</p><p>Coming up, what`s going and what`s still in play for you to claim.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GRIFFETH: Despite experiencing one of the longest bull markets in recent memory, state and local pension systems are still underfunded. Investment returns have been uneven and funding levels have not yet recovered as a result. According to \"Reuters\" which cited analysis by Wilshire Funding, back in 2007, the median funded level was 92 percent for state retirement plans. In 2016, that had fallen to 68 percent. Lower funding levels, of course, mean that more money is required to meet future obligations.</p><p>HERERA: Favorite time of year. The countdown is on for the April 17th tax filing deadline. And it`s the final call to claim several tax deductions that will be going away after this year.</p><p>So, Sharon Epperson joins us as she always does at this time of year.</p><p>Great to see you, Sharon.</p><p>GRIFFETH: This is a good news.</p><p>SHARON EPPERSON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Yes, a great news, a great news.</p><p>HERERA: This is the last time taxpayers can file their federal returns under the old tax law. So as they do that and they compile the paperwork, what did they need to remember?</p><p>EPPERSON: Well, we know there`s been a big overhaul of the tax code. And one of the most important parts, of course, is going to be the doubling of the standard deduction going forward. That means a lot of folks may decide not to itemize.</p><p>But on top of that, itemized deductions will be less generous than they have in the past. And you add to that the personal exemptions that are going away, there are a lot of changes that are taking place that people need to be aware of. So, now is the time to look at those tax breaks that are still here and take full advantage of them.</p><p>GRIFFETH: All right. So, which breaks go away?</p><p>EPPERSON: Personal exemptions and dependent exemptions. That`s $4,050 for you and your spouse or if you`re taking care of someone else. So, that`s significant and that`s going away.</p><p>The other is a number of miscellaneous itemized deductions, those that exceed 2 percent of your adjusted gross income or the ones that you can deduct now. Things like job expenses, things like tax prep fees, investment related fees, these are things that people don`t always consider. Hobby expenses, if you actually get income from a hobby you`re doing.</p><p>So, those are the ones that you want to take a look at again. If you`ve moved for a new job in 2017, at least 50 miles away, that is something that you could also deduct and it could be above the line deduction, but going forward you can only do it if you`re in the active military, if you`re active duty and doing it because of military orders.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Because they ordered you, yes. There are other deductions that we thought were going away and they are eventually, just not this year.</p><p>EPPERSON: They`re back again for 2017. So, that`s a good -- we have to look at some silver lining here. So, if you pay mortgage insurance --</p><p>GRIFFETH: We have to because those of us who haven`t finished our tax returns have to do this.</p><p>And exclusion for foreign debt, that`s another thing to consider. But if you had a short sale or loan modification, normally, you know, you would have to count that as income. You don`t have to do that in this regard.</p><p>Tuition and fees for college expenses, that`s up to $4,000 that you could possibly get a tax break on there. And if you have done some home improvements and there`s an energy efficient window you put in or door, you can get up to a $500 tax credit, even better than a deduction.</p><p>HERERA: Can you follow me around, it`s like do my tax --</p><p>EPPERSON: Can you help me and remind me to do mine?</p><p>GRIFFETH: You are always the last one.</p><p>EPPERSON: I`m always the last one, I`m always the last one. But I will get it in.</p><p>HERERA: Thanks, Sharon.</p><p>EPPERSON: All right. Take care.</p><p>HERERA: And that will do it for us on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT. For all of us, including Sharon, thanks for joining us.</p><p>GRIFFETH: I`m Bill Griffeth. Enjoy your evening putting your taxes together.</p><p>HERERA: Yes, exactly.</p><p>GRIFFETH: We`ll see you tomorrow.</p><p>Nightly Business Report transcripts and video are available on-line post broadcast at <url normalizedValue=\"http://nbr.com\">http://nbr.com</url>.

That`s a significant gap and <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>needs to set about reducing some of those unfavorable ratings with women, with Hispanics, with college- educated voters that potentially could be real anchors on his bid in the fall.</p><p>MATHISEN: I`m going to dense pack a question here, so I`m warning you. How fractured is the Republican Party and how wounded is <person><nameText>Hillary Clinton </nameText></person>from the contest she`s had to fight with Mr. Sanders, and could there, will there be a third-party candidate?</p><p>HARWOOD: <person><nameText>Hillary Clinton </nameText></person>is wounded by her campaign against sanders which is exacerbated her negatives. A lot of people don`t trust her, but her problems are not as severe as Donald Trump`s. <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>in that NBC/\"Wall Street Journal\" poll is only getting 72 percent of Republicans.</p><p>And one of the questions now is whether movement conservatives decide to back a third-party candidate. Interestingly, <person><nameText>Ted Cruz </nameText></person>when he got out last night didn`t say anything about <person><nameText>Donald Trump.</nameText></person></p><p>There`s talk about a potential third-party candidacy to uphold the banner of true conservatism. A lot of conservatives say that <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>really is kind of a renegade, he`s a party unto himself. That`s going to be one of questions. Ultimately, parties in our system tend to coalesce around each other, but <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>has more of a deficit in that regard than anybody else and he`s vulnerable if somebody wants to run a third-party candidacy to big erosion within his party.</p><p>HARWOOD: All right. John, thank you very much. John Harwood reporting from Washington.</p><p>Well, speaking of <person><nameText>Donald Trump, </nameText></person>who has broken all the rules on the campaign trail has also turned campaign finance and spending upside down. Trump has spent just $47 million according to the latest Federal Election Commission fundraising reports that went through the end of March. Cruz meantime spent $70 million, Clinton $158 million, and Sanders, the biggest spender of them all, at $168 million.</p><p>So, how will a Trump/Clinton race affect your investments this summer around which candidate might investors prefer?</p><p>Here with some insights is John Canally, investment strategist with LPL Financial.</p><p>John, good to have you with us. Let`s talk first about how the campaign is going to go. I would guess that the markets on some level are a little bit relieved that it won`t be a brokered convention in Cleveland for the GOP.</p><p>JOHN CANALLY, LPL FINANCIAL INVESTMENT STRATEGIST: That is. That`s a short-term relief. There was a lot of fear in the marketplace about that week in Cleveland in July and what would happen after that first ballot. There would have been a lot of traders pausing during their days to see what happened in Cleveland. So, I think that now is off the table.</p><p>But there are other risks out there in terms of the third party. Mr. Harwood talked about those. I think that`s a pretty narrow path and that would add to the uncertainty.</p><p>I think, Tyler, the lens to view this through in terms of markets is certainty versus uncertainty in general. Mr. Trump is the uncertain candidate. Senator Clinton is sort of the certainty candidate, but there`s a lot of nuisances.</p><p>HARWOOD: Yes. You know, historically, the period from May to November is a treading water time of year for equities. Most of the games go from November forward. Do you expect that to be that pattern to hold this year particularly in light of the campaign?</p><p>CANALLY: Yes, that`s sell in May and go away is indeed persistent in election years, and also is even a little more negative when you take a look at what happened in the prior six months. So, from November to April, that period is down. You also tend to get a down period from May to November.</p><p>So, we did have a down period in the last six months that even August was even more downward momentum for stocks, but not too much. I think ultimately, stocks are driven by earnings, but there`s a lot of noise out there certainly.</p><p>HARWOOD: So, let`s fast forward the tape and it is past Election Day. Do investors -- are investors likely to favor one candidate over another? Are they going to fair better under Clinton or under Trump, or do we just not know?</p><p>CANALLY: I think there`s one area under which investors don`t know. On the trade front, most -- the last 20 or 30 years has been a period where global trade has burgeoned. Mr. Trump has come out and said that he`s against free trade in general, and although Senator Clinton has generally been pro-trade, she`s lately come out against the President Obama`s TPP, Trans Pacific Partnership, bill. So, that`s a real concern regardless of who wins.</p><p>Now, if Mr. Trump wins, what he suggested he would do would be to strengthen the military, cut taxes, cut the deficit and then stop free trade. Those things aren`t along the same axis as most Republican candidates. Most Republican candidates will do things that are not like that. Senator Clinton, though, is pretty much going to play down the middle, that`s more regulation, more government spending and a lot more government oversight into certain industry groups.</p><p>HARWOOD: All right. John Canally with LPL Financial, thank you very much.</p><p>It was meantime a down day on Wall Street, after a week of unexpected read on private sector job creation. More on that in just a minute.</p><p>Concerns about economic growth around the world also making investors skittish today. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped nearly 100 points to 17,651, NASDAQ lost 37, the S&amp;P 500 off 12.</p><p>More now on that private sector jobs report, which showed a cooling off last month. Private payrolls rose 156,000 in April according to ADP, but that was fewer than expected and that increase is the smallest monthly number since April 2013. The government releases its monthly employment report Friday. It`s expected to show the economy added about 200,000 jobs last month.</p><p>Worker productivity fell in the first quarter by 1 percent. Expectations were for a slightly steeper decline but the report signaled some progress on wage growth as hourly compensation increased at a 3 percent annual rate.</p><p>Well, positive news in the factory sector to tell you about tonight. It accounts for about 12 percent of the economy. New orders for goods made in factories rose more than expected in March, up a little more than 1 percent. Shipments and inventories also increased after eight straight months of decline. A separate report showed the services sector which makes up the bulk of the economy grew more than expected in April.</p><p>In Washington, the Internal Revenue Service is hiring up to 700 employees for tax enforcement. It is the first significant enforcement hiring in more than five years despite all the budget constraints.</p><p>Eamon Javers is following the story.</p><p>Eamon, isn`t there a hiring freeze at the IRS?</p><p>EAMON JAVERS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Yes, Tyler, they say, as you point out, this is the first time in five years they`ve been able to do what they call significant hiring and they say based on the pace of the retirements and attrition that they have in the workforce, they`ll be down about 17,000 employees from where they were back in 2010. That is a big hit that the IRS has taken and John Koskinen, the IRS commissioner, telling IRS employees in a note yesterday that these 600 to 700 people will help fill some of that gap, and, of course, they`re in enforcement which means they`re going after tax cheats which means this is a bit of bad news if you`re a tax cheat out there.</p><p>MATHISEN: If you`re one of these people, I assume the IRS wants you to bring in more than they pay you.</p><p>JAVERS: Yes, absolutely. The average IRS employee brings in about $4 for every $1 spent on that person to the U.S. treasury. But for enforcement employees, it`s a much bigger bang for the IRS. In fact, they say they get about $10 for every dollar they spend on enforcement employees.</p><p>So, this is the most lucrative thing the IRS can do and they say they`ll have a couple of different waves of hiring this year. They hope they`ll be able to bring in a lot more money to the treasury and then at some point next year, they`ll get a new budget which will enable to hire a lot more people going forward.</p><p>MATHISEN: All right. Eamon, thank you very much.</p><p>Eamon Javers in Washington tonight.</p><p>JAVERS: You bet.</p><p>MATHISEN: And still ahead, a new twist on shuttle service for long distance travel in a Tesla.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>MATHISEN: The Takata air bag recall has more than doubled in the U.S. Last night, we told you the announcement would come soon. Today, regulators ordered automakers to recall up to another 40 million potentially faultily air bags. The defect has been linked to 11 death and more than 100 injuries globally. Tens of millions of other Takata air bags have not been recalled yet.</p><p>Tesla gave a very optimistic outlook vehicle production as it reported a narrower than expected quarterly loss. The electric carmaker did lose 57 cents a share. Revenue of more than $1.5 billion was 45 percent higher than a year ago. Despite production concerns, Tesla says it is on track to deliver 80,000 to 90,000 vehicles this year, and it will, it says, produce 500,000 by 2018, two years ahead of schedule. Shares rose following the report in initial after hours trading.</p><p>Well, as Tesla expands it`s lineup of electric cars and its super charger network of recharging stations a new company is playing off of that to start a long distance ride service. It`s called Tesloop.</p><p>Phil LeBeau from Los Angeles.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PHIL LEBEAU, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Sam and Ann Webb, along with their son, are headed from Los Angeles to Palm Springs. They could drive themselves, but instead they`re paying $35 each to be shuttled in a Tesla Model X driven by the company Tesloop.</p><p>ANN WEBB, TESLOOP CUSTOMER: I`ve done Tesloop twice now. I recently took a trip to Vegas. I`m in a Model S and I was in love. So, I wanted to drive my family along and to do it again.</p><p>LEBEAU: This is the Tesloop, a ride service based here in L.A. that shuttles people to Las Vegas or Palm Springs, in a Tesla.</p><p>The company was started last summer by Rahul Sonnad and his son Haydn, who lease a Tesla Model S, believing people traveling between L.A. and Las Vegas would want to make the trip in a luxury electric car for $85, slightly more than what it costs to fly one way L.A. to Vegas.</p><p>RAHUL SONNAD, TESLOOP CEO: What surprised me is how much people like the experience. I think it`s a combination of the car and the convenience of driving and getting dropped off really close to where you need to be.</p><p>LEBEAU: One key to Tesloop`s business plan is not paying to power its fleet, that`s because Tesloop, like all Tesla owners, can recharge for free at Tesla super charging stations. And as Tesla CEO Elon Musk looks to add more super charger stations around the country, Tesloop plans to expand with it, targeting routes where it can offer one to five hour rides between cities with a steady supply of commuters.</p><p>HAYDN SONNAD, TESLOOP CO-FOUNDER: There`s a huge market there. There`s so many people that commute from one city to another, daily or weekly, and all we have to do is get a small fraction of that market in our cars to become profitable.</p><p>LEBEAU: Tesloop has yet to turn a profit, but the owners believe discount prices for rides in these electric cars will drive more people to become customers.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Well, it`s really nice. You know, it`s a Tesla and that`s a lot fun. I always wanted to ride the Model X and this is my chance to do that.</p><p>LEBEAU: A new ride and a new way to look at longer commutes.</p><p>Phil LeBeau, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Los Angeles.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN: And we reached out to Tesla to see what they think of the service and we haven`t heard back from them.</p><p>Well, Priceline warns its growth will slow next quarter, and that is where we begin \"Market Focus\".</p><p>Despite better than expected first quarter results, the online travel booking company says earnings will fall below estimates in the second quarter as an increase in advertising spending and weak demand in some international markets are expected to affect results. Shares of Priceline down 7.5 percent today, still though at a whopping $1,253.04 a share.</p><p>Recent acquisitions and strong sales in the U.S. and Europe help Hain Celestial post solid quarterly revenue growth. Earnings were up 9 percent and in line with estimates, shares rose 9 percent to $44.88.</p><p>HBO`s \"Game of Thrones\" and college basketball helped drive Time Warner`s earnings and revenue higher. The media agent saw gains in its Turner unit, thanks in part to its first time coverage of the NCAA men`s basketball championship final game. In addition, Time Warner (NYSE:TWX) reaffirmed earnings forecast for the year, shares up over 1.5 percent to $74.80.</p><p>Health insurer Humana (NYSE:HUM) reported a 46 percent drop in profit because of costs associated with the company`s pending Aetna (NYSE:AET) merger and lower membership in its Affordable Care Act exchanges. Humana (NYSE:HUM) says it remains cautious on the public exchanges and anticipates exiting some of those state markets next year, in 2017. Shares finished the day down a fraction at $175.70.</p><p>MATHISEN: Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Google`s parent company Alphabet are focusing on the world`s second most populated country, India.</p><p>But as Josh Lipton reports, both companies have different strategies to potentially win a bigger slice of this very lucrative market.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JOSH LIPTON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: India is the new battleground for big tech and that`s because China has become a challenge. In its most recent quarter, Apple`s revenue in China slipped due in part to weaker economic growth and Google`s search business is blocked in China.</p><p>So, both companies are making moves to win more market share in this fast growing economy. This week, Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) announced that it will allow users in India to access Apps from telephone carriers rather than billing their credit card companies, and that`s a big deal to Indian consumers because credit card use there isn`t as popular as it is there. Less than 5 percent of the population use credit cards, even as smartphone adoption is surging.</p><p>India is now the third largest market for smartphones. Last year alone, 102 million smartphones were shipped there and that was a 49 percent jump in the previous year. Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) is making this move just as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is also targeting the Indian consumer more aggressively.</p><p>CEO Tim Cook told CNBC why he`s so excited about that market, where iPhone sales are surging, though Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) right now only does control about 2 percent of the market.</p><p>TIM COOK, APPLE CEO: India today has 50 percent of their population at 25 years of age or younger. It`s a very young country. People really want smartphones there, really want smartphones. This year, the first year, LTE begins to roll out.</p><p>LIPTON: The two tech titans have very different tactics when it comes to winning in India. For Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), it`s about apps and getting customers to buy them more easily. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is focused on selling devices.</p><p>The companies also served different demographics. IPhones can cost more than Android phones. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) wants to import and sell pre- owned iPhones to lower the price, but the Indian government hasn`t made an official decision whether to allow that. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), like other tech companies, can`t just open a store in India without government approval. The government right now is evaluating Apple`s request.</p><p>Still while the strategies might be different, the goal is the same: win over new fans in one of the fastest growing markets in the world.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Josh Lipton in San Francisco.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN: Coming up, a sneak peek at how the greatest basketball player who ever lived lives.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>MATHISEN: Here`s a look at what to watch tomorrow. Jobless claims are up. Final piece of data on the labor market, ahead of Friday`s big employment report. Dow component Merck (NYSE:MRK) will report its earnings. Sales of its hepatitis C drug and cancer immunotherapy will be the focus there.</p><p>And the president of St. Louis Fed, Mr. Bullard, will speak on the economy. And that is what to watch for Thursday.</p><p>Adidas wants to sell parts of its golf business, including one of the best known brands in the world, TaylorMade. It is also selling its Adams and Ashworth brands. The German sports wear maker says it plans instead to focus on golf footwear and apparel.</p><p>Meantime, the sports apparel maker Under Armor is giving Nike (NYSE:NKE) a run for its money when it comes to endorsement deals. On its rooster are top young athletes like the NBA player Steph Curry, golf pro Jordan Spieth, the NFL`s Cam Newton, and they`ve now signed Bryce Harper, the baseball player, to a ten-year extension that might turn out to be the biggest endorsement deal for the baseball player.</p><p>So, how is the upstart Under Armour (NYSE:UA) convincing some of the biggest names in sports to come on board?</p><p>John Kell is a senior writer at Fortune Magazine and he`s got some answers.</p><p>John, I assume they`re just paying more.</p><p>JOHN KELL, FORTUNE SR. WRITER: They are paying more, but they`re also able to kind of sell the story that at Under Armour (NYSE:UA), which is a much smaller athletic apparel company than Nike (NYSE:NKE), that some of these athletes will be viewed as a marquee name in their sport rather than just one out of a huge crowd of athletes that Nike (NYSE:NKE) works with in the NFL or in the NBA for example.</p><p>MATHISEN: In other words, Steph Curry is going to stand out more because there`s not going to be a whole stable of other ball players around him?</p><p>KELL: The FM (ph) kind of reported about that earlier this year, that that was kind of a selling point that they reported that Nike (NYSE:NKE), when they presented their contract renewal to Steph Curry that the slide actually had the name Kevin Durant, which another NBA player.</p><p>MATHISEN: Oops.</p><p>KELL: Yes. So, there was the kind of left a bad taste in the mouth of Curry and his family and his representative and so that could be part of the reason why he decided to move to Under Armour (NYSE:UA), where he is the big name. They`re building a really big shoe program around him, kind of like Jordan or LeBron James. He might not have gotten that much attention if he had stayed with Nike (NYSE:NKE).</p><p>MATHISEN: And their footwear sales have gone way up and they have sold a pair to my son, by the way, who is crazy for the Steph Curry shoes.</p><p>But let`s be clear here, Under Armor is a fraction of -- though fast growing -- a fraction of the size of Nike (NYSE:NKE).</p><p>KELL: They are. They`re only $4 billion in revenue business. Nike (NYSE:NKE) is a little over $30 billion and Nike (NYSE:NKE) is still growing fast.</p><p>A lot of people forget that when they talk about Under Armour (NYSE:UA) strong growth and it is very strong. They forgot that Nike (NYSE:NKE) is still growing, too. It`s a Dow component that is still growing. Niki is expecting to hit $50 billion in sales in five years. That`s huge.</p><p>Under Armour (NYSE:UA) is not going to ever be able to catch -- is not going to ever able to catch up to that in a foreseeable future. But ten years ago, Under Armour (NYSE:UA) did not sell a single pair of shoes, and now, they sell 700 million. So, ten years later, that`s a huge grown business for them.</p><p>MATHISEN: Some people would say that Under Armor has the younger, hotter players, but they`ve also got Tom Brady (NYSE:BRC) who is certainly hot to many people`s estimation, but he`s not young.</p><p>KELL: You know, they want to have mix. They work with Misty Copeland, she`s a ballerina, but she`s on her 30s. They`re working with the U.S. gymnastics team, the women`s team. That`s a younger kind of play.</p><p>They`re really well known for doing an endorsement deal with Friday night lights. That helped them get into the high school, college crowd. They signed a deal with U.C. Berkeley, another way to kind of get into the college crowd. So, they definitely do want to have a mix of younger and older athletes because with younger athletes really kind of a guess as to how successful they will be, will injury play a role and how long they can play.</p><p>MATHISEN: All right. John, we`ve got to leave it there, I`m sorry to say. John Kell, with Fortune Magazine.</p><p>Meantime, Nike (NYSE:NKE) and Michael Jordan do go hand in hand. He was one of Nike`s highest athletes, still is here. Jordan line set the bar high for basketball sneakers.</p><p>Now, the greatest basketball player that ever lived is selling his Chicago home and Robert Frank takes us on a tour inside and out.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>KOFI NARTEY, REALTOR: So, this is Michael Jordan`s house. I almost don`t need to say that. Numbers 23 behind me on the gate say it all. It`s a number that`s recognized worldwide to symbolize success, championships and this is the estate he built on that success.</p><p>ROBERT FRANK, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: The listing price, $14,855,000. If you add each number in the price tag together, it equals 23.</p><p>Realtor Kofi Nartey specializes in selling homes for athletes, the Air Jordan`s he`s wearing show how important Michael is to his sales pitch.</p><p>NARTEY: This outdoor area is one of Michael`s favorite places to hang out.</p><p>FRANK: Everything on the property reflects Jordan`s taste. There`s a round infinity pool designed to look like a ball going into a net. Nearby, the golf-crazed Jordan made room for a spacious putting green, and installed a tennis court suitable for night play.</p><p>NARTEY: He wanted to build something that was outside of the city, just as a getaway.</p><p>FRANK: A getaway with lots of privacy so the legendary baller and a tight circle of friends could relax in their element out of spotlight. These giant doors came from the Playboy Mansion. Behind them, there`s a billiard room. Jordan also built a wine cellar and an enormous gentleman`s lounge to indulge his fashion for cigars and playing cards.</p><p>NARTEY: This is where he spent a lot of time hanging out with his friends, playing cards, epic card battles, and he had a full walk-in humidor where he had his cigar collection, spent lots of times smoking cigar and talking trash.</p><p>FRANK: The hoops legend entertained pals in an open bar with TVs to watch games. Put them up in a swank three bedroom guest house and, of course, worked them out on this ultimate regulation size home court. The jump man logo is surrounded by the names of Jordan`s kids and special cushioning under the wood eased the wear and tier on the superstar`s knees.</p><p>Next door, MJ designed a full gym for his hardcore workouts and even put in a locker room to accommodate his famous Bulls teammates.</p><p>NARTEY: The year before Michael won his first championship, he decided to start inviting a few of his teammates to come workout, practice and train. They would meet here in the morning, eat breakfast with his private chef, and that camaraderie actually led to their very first championship.</p><p>FRANK: For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Robert Frank.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN: And for more on Michael Jordan`s home, head to our website NBR.com.</p><p>And that is NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for tonight. I`m Tyler Mathisen. Thanks for watching. Have a great evening, everybody. We hope to see you back here tomorrow night.</p><p>Nightly Business Report transcripts and video are available on-line post broadcast at <url normalizedValue=\"http://nbr.com\">http://nbr.com</url>.

The  race for the White House comes into focus.  But what a Trump/Clinton  contest means for the market remains very foggy.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A new ride.  A man, his Tesla, and a new twist on long distance ride- sharing.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And looking for growth.  Why the next big battleground for two of the  nearest tech companies is half way around the world.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">All that and more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Wednesday, May  4th.  </p><p>Good evening, everyone, and welcome.  I'm Tyler Mathisen.  Sue Herera is  off this evening.</p><p>Well, and then there was one.  Billionaire businessman Donald Trump is now  the probable, even the presumptive Republican nominee for the White House  following his win in the Indiana primary.  Ohio Governor John Kasich  dropped out of the race today, following Senator Ted Cruz's departure last  night.  </p><p>And with that, the focus is now centered on Trump and Democratic front- runner Hillary Clinton who despite last night's loss to Bernie Sanders  continues to maintain a big delegate lead.  And investors are watching all  of this very closely and so is John Harwood, who joins us now from  Washington.  </p><p>John, I have to say after how personal it got just yesterday with Mr. Cruz  and Mr. Trump, I was a little surprised that he got out last night.  Why  did he and Kasich decide to leave now?</p><p>JOHN HARWOOD, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  I was surprised to,  Tyler.  It hadn't gotten so vitriolic at the end, I took Ted Cruz at his  word that he was going to fight on through California.  But that size of  that victory in Indiana simply broke the will of Ted Cruz to continue, and  the same with John Kasich.  John Kasich never rose up despite his appeal as  the moderate in the race, never rose up to seriously threatened.  Both of  them realized in it wasn't going to work for them, decided to get out now  and set up this general election contrast between Trump and Clinton.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  Last night, you said that the general election would likely  start today.  How are things shaping up as it gets underway?  </p><p>HARWOOD:  As it starts, Hillary Clinton has got a lead.  If you look at the  average in real clearpolitics.com, she's got a seven-point lead.  In the  NBC/\"Wall Street Journal\" poll, she's got a larger lead of 11 points.   That's a significant gap and Donald Trump needs to set about reducing some  of those unfavorable ratings with women, with Hispanics, with college- educated voters that potentially could be real anchors on his bid in the  fall.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  I'm going to dense pack a question here, so I'm warning you.   How fractured is the Republican Party and how wounded is Hillary Clinton  from the contest she's had to fight with Mr. Sanders, and could there, will  there be a third-party candidate?  </p><p>HARWOOD:  Hillary Clinton is wounded by her campaign against sanders which  is exacerbated her negatives.  A lot of people don't trust her, but her  problems are not as severe as Donald Trump's.  Donald Trump in that  NBC/\"Wall Street Journal\" poll is only getting 72 percent of Republicans.  </p><p>And one of the questions now is whether movement conservatives decide to  back a third-party candidate.  Interestingly, Ted Cruz when he got out last  night didn't say anything about Donald Trump.  </p><p>There's talk about a potential third-party candidacy to uphold the banner  of true conservatism.  A lot of conservatives say that Donald Trump really  is kind of a renegade, he's a party unto himself.  That's going to be one  of questions.  Ultimately, parties in our system tend to coalesce around  each other, but Donald Trump has more of a deficit in that regard than  anybody else and he's vulnerable if somebody wants to run a third-party  candidacy to big erosion within his party.  </p><p>HARWOOD:  All right.  John, thank you very much.  John Harwood reporting  from Washington.</p><p>Well, speaking of Donald Trump, who has broken all the rules on the  campaign trail has also turned campaign finance and spending upside down.   Trump has spent just $47 million according to the latest Federal Election  Commission fundraising reports that went through the end of March.  Cruz  meantime spent $70 million, Clinton $158 million, and Sanders, the biggest  spender of them all, at $168 million.  </p><p>So, how will a Trump/Clinton race affect your investments this summer  around which candidate might investors prefer?  </p><p>Here with some insights is John Canally, investment strategist with LPL  Financial.  </p><p>John, good to have you with us.  Let's talk first about how the campaign is  going to go.  I would guess that the markets on some level are a little bit  relieved that it won't be a brokered convention in Cleveland for the GOP.  </p><p>JOHN CANALLY, LPL FINANCIAL INVESTMENT STRATEGIST:  That is.  That's a  short-term relief.  There was a lot of fear in the marketplace about that  week in Cleveland in July and what would happen after that first ballot.   There would have been a lot of traders pausing during their days to see  what happened in Cleveland.  So, I think that now is off the table.</p><p>But there are other risks out there in terms of the third party.  Mr.  Harwood talked about those.  I think that's a pretty narrow path and that  would add to the uncertainty.  </p><p>I think, Tyler, the lens to view this through in terms of markets is  certainty versus uncertainty in general.  Mr. Trump is the uncertain  candidate.  Senator Clinton is sort of the certainty candidate, but there's  a lot of nuisances.</p><p>HARWOOD:  Yes.  You know, historically, the period from May to November is  a treading water time of year for equities.  Most of the games go from  November forward.  Do you expect that to be that pattern to hold this year  particularly in light of the campaign?  </p><p>CANALLY:  Yes, that's sell in May and go away is indeed persistent in  election years, and also is even a little more negative when you take a  look at what happened in the prior six months.  So, from November to April,  that period is down.  You also tend to get a down period from May to  November.  </p><p>So, we did have a down period in the last six months that even August was  even more downward momentum for stocks, but not too much.  I think  ultimately, stocks are driven by earnings, but there's a lot of noise out  there certainly.  </p><p>HARWOOD:  So, let's fast forward the tape and it is past Election Day.  Do  investors -- are investors likely to favor one candidate over another?  Are  they going to fair better under Clinton or under Trump, or do we just not  know?  </p><p>CANALLY:  I think there's one area under which investors don't know.  On  the trade front, most -- the last 20 or 30 years has been a period where  global trade has burgeoned.  Mr. Trump has come out and said that he's  against free trade in general, and although Senator Clinton has generally  been pro-trade, she's lately come out against the President Obama's TPP,  Trans Pacific Partnership, bill.  So, that's a real concern regardless of  who wins.  </p><p>Now, if Mr. Trump wins, what he suggested he would do would be to  strengthen the military, cut taxes, cut the deficit and then stop free  trade.  Those things aren't along the same axis as most Republican  candidates.  Most Republican candidates will do things that are not like  that.  Senator Clinton, though, is pretty much going to play down the  middle, that's more regulation, more government spending and a lot more  government oversight into certain industry groups.  </p><p>HARWOOD:  All right.  John Canally with LPL Financial, thank you very much.  </p><p>It was meantime a down day on Wall Street, after a week of unexpected read  on private sector job creation.  More on that in just a minute.</p><p>Concerns about economic growth around the world also making investors  skittish today.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped nearly 100 points  to 17,651, NASDAQ lost 37, the S&amp;P 500 off 12.  </p><p>More now on that private sector jobs report, which showed a cooling off  last month.  Private payrolls rose 156,000 in April according to ADP, but  that was fewer than expected and that increase is the smallest monthly  number since April 2013.  The government releases its monthly employment  report Friday.  It's expected to show the economy added about 200,000 jobs  last month.  </p><p>Worker productivity fell in the first quarter by 1 percent.  Expectations  were for a slightly steeper decline but the report signaled some progress  on wage growth as hourly compensation increased at a 3 percent annual rate.  </p><p>Well, positive news in the factory sector to tell you about tonight.  It  accounts for about 12 percent of the economy.  New orders for goods made in  factories rose more than expected in March, up a little more than 1  percent.  Shipments and inventories also increased after eight straight  months of decline.  A separate report showed the services sector which  makes up the bulk of the economy grew more than expected in April.  </p><p>In Washington, the Internal Revenue Service is hiring up to 700 employees  for tax enforcement.  It is the first significant enforcement hiring in  more than five years despite all the budget constraints.  </p><p>Eamon Javers is following the story.  </p><p>Eamon, isn't there a hiring freeze at the IRS?  </p><p>EAMON JAVERS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, Tyler, they say,  as you point out, this is the first time in five years they've been able to  do what they call significant hiring and they say based on the pace of the  retirements and attrition that they have in the workforce, they'll be down  about 17,000 employees from where they were back in 2010.  That is a big  hit that the IRS has taken and John Koskinen, the IRS commissioner, telling  IRS employees in a note yesterday that these 600 to 700 people will help  fill some of that gap, and, of course, they're in enforcement which means  they're going after tax cheats which means this is a bit of bad news if  you're a tax cheat out there.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  If you're one of these people, I assume the IRS wants you to  bring in more than they pay you.  </p><p>JAVERS:  Yes, absolutely.  The average IRS employee brings in about $4 for  every $1 spent on that person to the U.S. treasury.  But for enforcement  employees, it's a much bigger bang for the IRS.  In fact, they say they get  about $10 for every dollar they spend on enforcement employees.  </p><p>So, this is the most lucrative thing the IRS can do and they say they'll  have a couple of different waves of hiring this year.  They hope they'll be  able to bring in a lot more money to the treasury and then at some point  next year, they'll get a new budget which will enable to hire a lot more  people going forward.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  All right.  Eamon, thank you very much.  </p><p>Eamon Javers in Washington tonight.</p><p>JAVERS:  You bet.</p><p>MATHISEN:  And still ahead, a new twist on shuttle service for long  distance travel in a Tesla.  </p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>MATHISEN:  The Takata air bag recall has more than doubled in the U.S.   Last night, we told you the announcement would come soon.  Today,  regulators ordered automakers to recall up to another 40 million  potentially faultily air bags.  The defect has been linked to 11 death and  more than 100 injuries globally.  Tens of millions of other Takata air bags  have not been recalled yet.  </p><p>Tesla gave a very optimistic outlook vehicle production as it reported a  narrower than expected quarterly loss.  The electric carmaker did lose 57  cents a share.  Revenue of more than $1.5 billion was 45 percent higher  than a year ago.  Despite production concerns, Tesla says it is on track to  deliver 80,000 to 90,000 vehicles this year, and it will, it says, produce  500,000 by 2018, two years ahead of schedule.  Shares rose following the  report in initial after hours trading.  </p><p>Well, as Tesla expands it's lineup of electric cars and its super charger  network of recharging stations a new company is playing off of that to  start a long distance ride service.  It's called Tesloop.  </p><p>Phil LeBeau from Los Angeles.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PHIL LEBEAU, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Sam and Ann Webb,  along with their son, are headed from Los Angeles to Palm Springs.  They  could drive themselves, but instead they're paying $35 each to be shuttled  in a Tesla Model X driven by the company Tesloop.  </p><p>ANN WEBB, TESLOOP CUSTOMER:  I've done Tesloop twice now.  I recently took  a trip to Vegas.  I'm in a Model S and I was in love.  So, I wanted to  drive my family along and to do it again.</p><p>LEBEAU:  This is the Tesloop, a ride service based here in L.A. that  shuttles people to Las Vegas or Palm Springs, in a Tesla.  </p><p>The company was started last summer by Rahul Sonnad and his son Haydn, who  lease a Tesla Model S, believing people traveling between L.A. and Las  Vegas would want to make the trip in a luxury electric car for $85,  slightly more than what it costs to fly one way L.A. to Vegas.  </p><p>RAHUL SONNAD, TESLOOP CEO:  What surprised me is how much people like the  experience.  I think it's a combination of the car and the convenience of  driving and getting dropped off really close to where you need to be.  </p><p>LEBEAU:  One key to Tesloop's business plan is not paying to power its  fleet, that's because Tesloop, like all Tesla owners, can recharge for free  at Tesla super charging stations.  And as Tesla CEO Elon Musk looks to add  more super charger stations around the country, Tesloop plans to expand  with it, targeting routes where it can offer one to five hour rides between  cities with a steady supply of commuters.  </p><p>HAYDN SONNAD, TESLOOP CO-FOUNDER:  There's a huge market there.  There's so  many people that commute from one city to another, daily or weekly, and all  we have to do is get a small fraction of that market in our cars to become  profitable.  </p><p>LEBEAU:  Tesloop has yet to turn a profit, but the owners believe discount  prices for rides in these electric cars will drive more people to become  customers.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Well, it's really nice.  You know, it's a Tesla and  that's a lot fun.  I always wanted to ride the Model X and this is my  chance to do that.  </p><p>LEBEAU:  A new ride and a new way to look at longer commutes.  </p><p>Phil LeBeau, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Los Angeles.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN:  And we reached out to Tesla to see what they think of the  service and we haven't heard back from them.  </p><p>Well, Priceline warns its growth will slow next quarter, and that is where  we begin \"Market Focus\". </p><p>Despite better than expected first quarter results, the online travel  booking company says earnings will fall below estimates in the second  quarter as an increase in advertising spending and weak demand in some  international markets are expected to affect results.  Shares of Priceline  down 7.5 percent today, still though at a whopping $1,253.04 a share.  </p><p>Recent acquisitions and strong sales in the U.S. and Europe help Hain  Celestial post solid quarterly revenue growth.  Earnings were up 9 percent  and in line with estimates, shares rose 9 percent to $44.88.  </p><p>HBO's \"Game of Thrones\" and college basketball helped drive Time Warner's  earnings and revenue higher.  The media agent saw gains in its Turner unit,  thanks in part to its first time coverage of the NCAA men's basketball  championship final game.  In addition, Time Warner (NYSE:TWX) reaffirmed  earnings forecast for the year, shares up over 1.5 percent to $74.80.  </p><p>Health insurer Humana (NYSE:HUM) reported a 46 percent drop in profit  because of costs associated with the company's pending Aetna (NYSE:AET)  merger and lower membership in its Affordable Care Act exchanges.  Humana  (NYSE:HUM) says it remains cautious on the public exchanges and anticipates  exiting some of those state markets next year, in 2017.  Shares finished  the day down a fraction at $175.70.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Google's parent company Alphabet are  focusing on the world's second most populated country, India.  </p><p>But as Josh Lipton reports, both companies have different strategies to  potentially win a bigger slice of this very lucrative market.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JOSH LIPTON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  India is the new  battleground for big tech and that's because China has become a challenge.   In its most recent quarter, Apple's revenue in China slipped due in part to  weaker economic growth and Google's search business is blocked in China.  </p><p>So, both companies are making moves to win more market share in this fast  growing economy.  This week, Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) announced that it will  allow users in India to access Apps from telephone carriers rather than  billing their credit card companies, and that's a big deal to Indian  consumers because credit card use there isn't as popular as it is there.   Less than 5 percent of the population use credit cards, even as smartphone  adoption is surging.</p><p>India is now the third largest market for smartphones.  Last year alone,  102 million smartphones were shipped there and that was a 49 percent jump  in the previous year.  Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) is making this move just as  Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is also targeting the Indian consumer more  aggressively.  </p><p>CEO Tim Cook told CNBC why he's so excited about that market, where iPhone  sales are surging, though Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) right now only does control  about 2 percent of the market.  </p><p>TIM COOK, APPLE CEO:  India today has 50 percent of their population at 25  years of age or younger.  It's a very young country.  People really want  smartphones there, really want smartphones.  This year, the first year, LTE  begins to roll out.  </p><p>LIPTON:  The two tech titans have very different tactics when it comes to  winning in India.  For Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), it's about apps and getting  customers to buy them more easily.  Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is focused on  selling devices.  </p><p>The companies also served different demographics.  IPhones can cost more  than Android phones.  Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) wants to import and sell pre- owned iPhones to lower the price, but the Indian government hasn't made an  official decision whether to allow that.  Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), like other  tech companies, can't just open a store in India without government  approval.  The government right now is evaluating Apple's request.  </p><p>Still while the strategies might be different, the goal is the same: win  over new fans in one of the fastest growing markets in the world.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Josh Lipton in San Francisco.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN:  Coming up, a sneak peek at how the greatest basketball player  who ever lived lives.  </p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>MATHISEN:  Here's a look at what to watch tomorrow.  Jobless claims are up.   Final piece of data on the labor market, ahead of Friday's big employment  report.  Dow component Merck (NYSE:MRK) will report its earnings.  Sales of  its hepatitis C drug and cancer immunotherapy will be the focus there.  </p><p>And the president of St. Louis Fed, Mr. Bullard, will speak on the economy.   And that is what to watch for Thursday.</p><p>Adidas wants to sell parts of its golf business, including one of the best  known brands in the world, TaylorMade.  It is also selling its Adams and  Ashworth brands.  The German sports wear maker says it plans instead to  focus on golf footwear and apparel.  </p><p>Meantime, the sports apparel maker Under Armor is giving Nike (NYSE:NKE) a  run for its money when it comes to endorsement deals.  On its rooster are  top young athletes like the NBA player Steph Curry, golf pro Jordan Spieth,  the NFL's Cam Newton, and they've now signed Bryce Harper, the baseball  player, to a ten-year extension that might turn out to be the biggest  endorsement deal for the baseball player.  </p><p>So, how is the upstart Under Armour (NYSE:UA) convincing some of the  biggest names in sports to come on board?</p><p>John Kell is a senior writer at Fortune Magazine and he's got some answers.</p><p>John, I assume they're just paying more.  </p><p>JOHN KELL, FORTUNE SR. WRITER:  They are paying more, but they're also able  to kind of sell the story that at Under Armour (NYSE:UA), which is a much  smaller athletic apparel company than Nike (NYSE:NKE), that some of these  athletes will be viewed as a marquee name in their sport rather than just  one out of a huge crowd of athletes that Nike (NYSE:NKE) works with in the  NFL or in the NBA for example.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  In other words, Steph Curry is going to stand out more because  there's not going to be a whole stable of other ball players around him?  </p><p>KELL:  The FM (ph) kind of reported about that earlier this year, that that  was kind of a selling point that they reported that Nike (NYSE:NKE), when  they presented their contract renewal to Steph Curry that the slide  actually had the name Kevin Durant, which another NBA player.</p><p>MATHISEN:  Oops.</p><p>KELL:  Yes.  So, there was the kind of left a bad taste in the mouth of  Curry and his family and his representative and so that could be part of  the reason why he decided to move to Under Armour (NYSE:UA), where he is  the big name.  They're building a really big shoe program around him, kind  of like Jordan or LeBron James.  He might not have gotten that much  attention if he had stayed with Nike (NYSE:NKE).  </p><p>MATHISEN:  And their footwear sales have gone way up and they have sold a  pair to my son, by the way, who is crazy for the Steph Curry shoes.  </p><p>But let's be clear here, Under Armor is a fraction of -- though fast  growing -- a fraction of the size of Nike (NYSE:NKE).  </p><p>KELL:  They are.  They're only $4 billion in revenue business.  Nike  (NYSE:NKE) is a little over $30 billion and Nike (NYSE:NKE) is still  growing fast.  </p><p>A lot of people forget that when they talk about Under Armour (NYSE:UA)  strong growth and it is very strong.  They forgot that Nike (NYSE:NKE) is  still growing, too.  It's a Dow component that is still growing.  Niki is  expecting to hit $50 billion in sales in five years.  That's huge.  </p><p>Under Armour (NYSE:UA) is not going to ever be able to catch -- is not  going to ever able to catch up to that in a foreseeable future.  But ten  years ago, Under Armour (NYSE:UA) did not sell a single pair of shoes, and  now, they sell 700 million.  So, ten years later, that's a huge grown  business for them.</p><p>MATHISEN:  Some people would say that Under Armor has the younger, hotter  players, but they've also got Tom Brady (NYSE:BRC) who is certainly hot to  many people's estimation, but he's not young.</p><p>KELL:  You know, they want to have mix.  They work with Misty Copeland,  she's a ballerina, but she's on her 30s.  They're working with the U.S.  gymnastics team, the women's team.  That's a younger kind of play.  </p><p>They're really well known for doing an endorsement deal with Friday night  lights.  That helped them get into the high school, college crowd.  They  signed a deal with U.C. Berkeley, another way to kind of get into the  college crowd.  So, they definitely do want to have a mix of younger and  older athletes because with younger athletes really kind of a guess as to  how successful they will be, will injury play a role and how long they can  play.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  All right.  John, we've got to leave it there, I'm sorry to say.   John Kell, with Fortune Magazine.</p><p>Meantime, Nike (NYSE:NKE) and Michael Jordan do go hand in hand.  He was  one of Nike's highest athletes, still is here.  Jordan line set the bar  high for basketball sneakers.  </p><p>Now, the greatest basketball player that ever lived is selling his Chicago  home and Robert Frank takes us on a tour inside and out.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>KOFI NARTEY, REALTOR:  So, this is Michael Jordan's house.  I almost don't  need to say that.  Numbers 23 behind me on the gate say it all.  It's a  number that's recognized worldwide to symbolize success, championships and  this is the estate he built on that success.  </p><p>ROBERT FRANK, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  The listing price,  $14,855,000.  If you add each number in the price tag together, it equals  23.  </p><p>Realtor Kofi Nartey specializes in selling homes for athletes, the Air  Jordan's he's wearing show how important Michael is to his sales pitch.  </p><p>NARTEY:  This outdoor area is one of Michael's favorite places to hang out.  </p><p>FRANK:  Everything on the property reflects Jordan's taste.  There's a  round infinity pool designed to look like a ball going into a net.  Nearby,  the golf-crazed Jordan made room for a spacious putting green, and  installed a tennis court suitable for night play.  </p><p>NARTEY:  He wanted to build something that was outside of the city, just as  a getaway.  </p><p>FRANK:  A getaway with lots of privacy so the legendary baller and a tight  circle of friends could relax in their element out of spotlight.  These  giant doors came from the Playboy Mansion.  Behind them, there's a billiard  room.  Jordan also built a wine cellar and an enormous gentleman's lounge  to indulge his fashion for cigars and playing cards.</p><p>NARTEY:  This is where he spent a lot of time hanging out with his friends,  playing cards, epic card battles, and he had a full walk-in humidor where  he had his cigar collection, spent lots of times smoking cigar and talking  trash.  </p><p>FRANK:  The hoops legend entertained pals in an open bar with TVs to watch  games.  Put them up in a swank three bedroom guest house and, of course,  worked them out on this ultimate regulation size home court.  The jump man  logo is surrounded by the names of Jordan's kids and special cushioning  under the wood eased the wear and tier on the superstar's knees.  </p><p>Next door, MJ designed a full gym for his hardcore workouts and even put in  a locker room to accommodate his famous Bulls teammates.  </p><p>NARTEY:  The year before Michael won his first championship, he decided to  start inviting a few of his teammates to come workout, practice and train.   They would meet here in the morning, eat breakfast with his private chef,  and that camaraderie actually led to their very first championship.  </p><p>FRANK:  For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Robert Frank.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN:  And for more on Michael Jordan's home, head to our website  NBR.com. </p><p>And that is NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for tonight.  I'm Tyler Mathisen.   Thanks for watching.  Have a great evening, everybody.

The  race for the White House comes into focus.  But what a Trump/Clinton  contest means for the market remains very foggy.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A new ride.  A man, his Tesla, and a new twist on long distance ride- sharing.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And looking for growth.  Why the next big battleground for two of the  nearest tech companies is half way around the world.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">All that and more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Wednesday, May  4th.  </p><p>Good evening, everyone, and welcome.  I'm Tyler Mathisen.  Sue Herera is  off this evening.</p><p>Well, and then there was one.  Billionaire businessman Donald Trump is now  the probable, even the presumptive Republican nominee for the White House  following his win in the Indiana primary.  Ohio Governor John Kasich  dropped out of the race today, following Senator Ted Cruz's departure last  night.  </p><p>And with that, the focus is now centered on Trump and Democratic front- runner Hillary Clinton who despite last night's loss to Bernie Sanders  continues to maintain a big delegate lead.  And investors are watching all  of this very closely and so is John Harwood, who joins us now from  Washington.  </p><p>John, I have to say after how personal it got just yesterday with Mr. Cruz  and Mr. Trump, I was a little surprised that he got out last night.  Why  did he and Kasich decide to leave now?</p><p>JOHN HARWOOD, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  I was surprised to,  Tyler.  It hadn't gotten so vitriolic at the end, I took Ted Cruz at his  word that he was going to fight on through California.  But that size of  that victory in Indiana simply broke the will of Ted Cruz to continue, and  the same with John Kasich.  John Kasich never rose up despite his appeal as  the moderate in the race, never rose up to seriously threatened.  Both of  them realized in it wasn't going to work for them, decided to get out now  and set up this general election contrast between Trump and Clinton.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  Last night, you said that the general election would likely  start today.  How are things shaping up as it gets underway?  </p><p>HARWOOD:  As it starts, Hillary Clinton has got a lead.  If you look at the  average in real clearpolitics.com, she's got a seven-point lead.  In the  NBC/\"Wall Street Journal\" poll, she's got a larger lead of 11 points.   That's a significant gap and Donald Trump needs to set about reducing some  of those unfavorable ratings with women, with Hispanics, with college- educated voters that potentially could be real anchors on his bid in the  fall.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  I'm going to dense pack a question here, so I'm warning you.   How fractured is the Republican Party and how wounded is Hillary Clinton  from the contest she's had to fight with Mr. Sanders, and could there, will  there be a third-party candidate?  </p><p>HARWOOD:  Hillary Clinton is wounded by her campaign against sanders which  is exacerbated her negatives.  A lot of people don't trust her, but her  problems are not as severe as Donald Trump's.  Donald Trump in that  NBC/\"Wall Street Journal\" poll is only getting 72 percent of Republicans.  </p><p>And one of the questions now is whether movement conservatives decide to  back a third-party candidate.  Interestingly, Ted Cruz when he got out last  night didn't say anything about Donald Trump.  </p><p>There's talk about a potential third-party candidacy to uphold the banner  of true conservatism.  A lot of conservatives say that Donald Trump really  is kind of a renegade, he's a party unto himself.  That's going to be one  of questions.  Ultimately, parties in our system tend to coalesce around  each other, but Donald Trump has more of a deficit in that regard than  anybody else and he's vulnerable if somebody wants to run a third-party  candidacy to big erosion within his party.  </p><p>HARWOOD:  All right.  John, thank you very much.  John Harwood reporting  from Washington.</p><p>Well, speaking of Donald Trump, who has broken all the rules on the  campaign trail has also turned campaign finance and spending upside down.   Trump has spent just $47 million according to the latest Federal Election  Commission fundraising reports that went through the end of March.  Cruz  meantime spent $70 million, Clinton $158 million, and Sanders, the biggest  spender of them all, at $168 million.  </p><p>So, how will a Trump/Clinton race affect your investments this summer  around which candidate might investors prefer?  </p><p>Here with some insights is John Canally, investment strategist with LPL  Financial.  </p><p>John, good to have you with us.  Let's talk first about how the campaign is  going to go.  I would guess that the markets on some level are a little bit  relieved that it won't be a brokered convention in Cleveland for the GOP.  </p><p>JOHN CANALLY, LPL FINANCIAL INVESTMENT STRATEGIST:  That is.  That's a  short-term relief.  There was a lot of fear in the marketplace about that  week in Cleveland in July and what would happen after that first ballot.   There would have been a lot of traders pausing during their days to see  what happened in Cleveland.  So, I think that now is off the table.</p><p>But there are other risks out there in terms of the third party.  Mr.  Harwood talked about those.  I think that's a pretty narrow path and that  would add to the uncertainty.  </p><p>I think, Tyler, the lens to view this through in terms of markets is  certainty versus uncertainty in general.  Mr. Trump is the uncertain  candidate.  Senator Clinton is sort of the certainty candidate, but there's  a lot of nuisances.</p><p>HARWOOD:  Yes.  You know, historically, the period from May to November is  a treading water time of year for equities.  Most of the games go from  November forward.  Do you expect that to be that pattern to hold this year  particularly in light of the campaign?  </p><p>CANALLY:  Yes, that's sell in May and go away is indeed persistent in  election years, and also is even a little more negative when you take a  look at what happened in the prior six months.  So, from November to April,  that period is down.  You also tend to get a down period from May to  November.  </p><p>So, we did have a down period in the last six months that even August was  even more downward momentum for stocks, but not too much.  I think  ultimately, stocks are driven by earnings, but there's a lot of noise out  there certainly.  </p><p>HARWOOD:  So, let's fast forward the tape and it is past Election Day.  Do  investors -- are investors likely to favor one candidate over another?  Are  they going to fair better under Clinton or under Trump, or do we just not  know?  </p><p>CANALLY:  I think there's one area under which investors don't know.  On  the trade front, most -- the last 20 or 30 years has been a period where  global trade has burgeoned.  Mr. Trump has come out and said that he's  against free trade in general, and although Senator Clinton has generally  been pro-trade, she's lately come out against the President Obama's TPP,  Trans Pacific Partnership, bill.  So, that's a real concern regardless of  who wins.  </p><p>Now, if Mr. Trump wins, what he suggested he would do would be to  strengthen the military, cut taxes, cut the deficit and then stop free  trade.  Those things aren't along the same axis as most Republican  candidates.  Most Republican candidates will do things that are not like  that.  Senator Clinton, though, is pretty much going to play down the  middle, that's more regulation, more government spending and a lot more  government oversight into certain industry groups.  </p><p>HARWOOD:  All right.  John Canally with LPL Financial, thank you very much.  </p><p>It was meantime a down day on Wall Street, after a week of unexpected read  on private sector job creation.  More on that in just a minute.</p><p>Concerns about economic growth around the world also making investors  skittish today.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped nearly 100 points  to 17,651, NASDAQ lost 37, the S&amp;P 500 off 12.  </p><p>More now on that private sector jobs report, which showed a cooling off  last month.  Private payrolls rose 156,000 in April according to ADP, but  that was fewer than expected and that increase is the smallest monthly  number since April 2013.  The government releases its monthly employment  report Friday.  It's expected to show the economy added about 200,000 jobs  last month.  </p><p>Worker productivity fell in the first quarter by 1 percent.  Expectations  were for a slightly steeper decline but the report signaled some progress  on wage growth as hourly compensation increased at a 3 percent annual rate.  </p><p>Well, positive news in the factory sector to tell you about tonight.  It  accounts for about 12 percent of the economy.  New orders for goods made in  factories rose more than expected in March, up a little more than 1  percent.  Shipments and inventories also increased after eight straight  months of decline.  A separate report showed the services sector which  makes up the bulk of the economy grew more than expected in April.  </p><p>In Washington, the Internal Revenue Service is hiring up to 700 employees  for tax enforcement.  It is the first significant enforcement hiring in  more than five years despite all the budget constraints.  </p><p>Eamon Javers is following the story.  </p><p>Eamon, isn't there a hiring freeze at the IRS?  </p><p>EAMON JAVERS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, Tyler, they say,  as you point out, this is the first time in five years they've been able to  do what they call significant hiring and they say based on the pace of the  retirements and attrition that they have in the workforce, they'll be down  about 17,000 employees from where they were back in 2010.  That is a big  hit that the IRS has taken and John Koskinen, the IRS commissioner, telling  IRS employees in a note yesterday that these 600 to 700 people will help  fill some of that gap, and, of course, they're in enforcement which means  they're going after tax cheats which means this is a bit of bad news if  you're a tax cheat out there.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  If you're one of these people, I assume the IRS wants you to  bring in more than they pay you.  </p><p>JAVERS:  Yes, absolutely.  The average IRS employee brings in about $4 for  every $1 spent on that person to the U.S. treasury.  But for enforcement  employees, it's a much bigger bang for the IRS.  In fact, they say they get  about $10 for every dollar they spend on enforcement employees.  </p><p>So, this is the most lucrative thing the IRS can do and they say they'll  have a couple of different waves of hiring this year.  They hope they'll be  able to bring in a lot more money to the treasury and then at some point  next year, they'll get a new budget which will enable to hire a lot more  people going forward.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  All right.  Eamon, thank you very much.  </p><p>Eamon Javers in Washington tonight.</p><p>JAVERS:  You bet.</p><p>MATHISEN:  And still ahead, a new twist on shuttle service for long  distance travel in a Tesla.  </p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>MATHISEN:  The Takata air bag recall has more than doubled in the U.S.   Last night, we told you the announcement would come soon.  Today,  regulators ordered automakers to recall up to another 40 million  potentially faultily air bags.  The defect has been linked to 11 death and  more than 100 injuries globally.  Tens of millions of other Takata air bags  have not been recalled yet.  </p><p>Tesla gave a very optimistic outlook vehicle production as it reported a  narrower than expected quarterly loss.  The electric carmaker did lose 57  cents a share.  Revenue of more than $1.5 billion was 45 percent higher  than a year ago.  Despite production concerns, Tesla says it is on track to  deliver 80,000 to 90,000 vehicles this year, and it will, it says, produce  500,000 by 2018, two years ahead of schedule.  Shares rose following the  report in initial after hours trading.  </p><p>Well, as Tesla expands it's lineup of electric cars and its super charger  network of recharging stations a new company is playing off of that to  start a long distance ride service.  It's called Tesloop.  </p><p>Phil LeBeau from Los Angeles.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PHIL LEBEAU, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Sam and Ann Webb,  along with their son, are headed from Los Angeles to Palm Springs.  They  could drive themselves, but instead they're paying $35 each to be shuttled  in a Tesla Model X driven by the company Tesloop.  </p><p>ANN WEBB, TESLOOP CUSTOMER:  I've done Tesloop twice now.  I recently took  a trip to Vegas.  I'm in a Model S and I was in love.  So, I wanted to  drive my family along and to do it again.</p><p>LEBEAU:  This is the Tesloop, a ride service based here in L.A. that  shuttles people to Las Vegas or Palm Springs, in a Tesla.  </p><p>The company was started last summer by Rahul Sonnad and his son Haydn, who  lease a Tesla Model S, believing people traveling between L.A. and Las  Vegas would want to make the trip in a luxury electric car for $85,  slightly more than what it costs to fly one way L.A. to Vegas.  </p><p>RAHUL SONNAD, TESLOOP CEO:  What surprised me is how much people like the  experience.  I think it's a combination of the car and the convenience of  driving and getting dropped off really close to where you need to be.  </p><p>LEBEAU:  One key to Tesloop's business plan is not paying to power its  fleet, that's because Tesloop, like all Tesla owners, can recharge for free  at Tesla super charging stations.  And as Tesla CEO Elon Musk looks to add  more super charger stations around the country, Tesloop plans to expand  with it, targeting routes where it can offer one to five hour rides between  cities with a steady supply of commuters.  </p><p>HAYDN SONNAD, TESLOOP CO-FOUNDER:  There's a huge market there.  There's so  many people that commute from one city to another, daily or weekly, and all  we have to do is get a small fraction of that market in our cars to become  profitable.  </p><p>LEBEAU:  Tesloop has yet to turn a profit, but the owners believe discount  prices for rides in these electric cars will drive more people to become  customers.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Well, it's really nice.  You know, it's a Tesla and  that's a lot fun.  I always wanted to ride the Model X and this is my  chance to do that.  </p><p>LEBEAU:  A new ride and a new way to look at longer commutes.  </p><p>Phil LeBeau, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Los Angeles.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN:  And we reached out to Tesla to see what they think of the  service and we haven't heard back from them.  </p><p>Well, Priceline warns its growth will slow next quarter, and that is where  we begin \"Market Focus\". </p><p>Despite better than expected first quarter results, the online travel  booking company says earnings will fall below estimates in the second  quarter as an increase in advertising spending and weak demand in some  international markets are expected to affect results.  Shares of Priceline  down 7.5 percent today, still though at a whopping $1,253.04 a share.  </p><p>Recent acquisitions and strong sales in the U.S. and Europe help Hain  Celestial post solid quarterly revenue growth.  Earnings were up 9 percent  and in line with estimates, shares rose 9 percent to $44.88.  </p><p>HBO's \"Game of Thrones\" and college basketball helped drive Time Warner's  earnings and revenue higher.  The media agent saw gains in its Turner unit,  thanks in part to its first time coverage of the NCAA men's basketball  championship final game.  In addition, Time Warner (NYSE:TWX) reaffirmed  earnings forecast for the year, shares up over 1.5 percent to $74.80.  </p><p>Health insurer Humana (NYSE:HUM) reported a 46 percent drop in profit  because of costs associated with the company's pending Aetna (NYSE:AET)  merger and lower membership in its Affordable Care Act exchanges.  Humana  (NYSE:HUM) says it remains cautious on the public exchanges and anticipates  exiting some of those state markets next year, in 2017.  Shares finished  the day down a fraction at $175.70.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Google's parent company Alphabet are  focusing on the world's second most populated country, India.  </p><p>But as Josh Lipton reports, both companies have different strategies to  potentially win a bigger slice of this very lucrative market.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JOSH LIPTON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  India is the new  battleground for big tech and that's because China has become a challenge.   In its most recent quarter, Apple's revenue in China slipped due in part to  weaker economic growth and Google's search business is blocked in China.  </p><p>So, both companies are making moves to win more market share in this fast  growing economy.  This week, Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) announced that it will  allow users in India to access Apps from telephone carriers rather than  billing their credit card companies, and that's a big deal to Indian  consumers because credit card use there isn't as popular as it is there.   Less than 5 percent of the population use credit cards, even as smartphone  adoption is surging.</p><p>India is now the third largest market for smartphones.  Last year alone,  102 million smartphones were shipped there and that was a 49 percent jump  in the previous year.  Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) is making this move just as  Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is also targeting the Indian consumer more  aggressively.  </p><p>CEO Tim Cook told CNBC why he's so excited about that market, where iPhone  sales are surging, though Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) right now only does control  about 2 percent of the market.  </p><p>TIM COOK, APPLE CEO:  India today has 50 percent of their population at 25  years of age or younger.  It's a very young country.  People really want  smartphones there, really want smartphones.  This year, the first year, LTE  begins to roll out.  </p><p>LIPTON:  The two tech titans have very different tactics when it comes to  winning in India.  For Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), it's about apps and getting  customers to buy them more easily.  Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is focused on  selling devices.  </p><p>The companies also served different demographics.  IPhones can cost more  than Android phones.  Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) wants to import and sell pre- owned iPhones to lower the price, but the Indian government hasn't made an  official decision whether to allow that.  Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), like other  tech companies, can't just open a store in India without government  approval.  The government right now is evaluating Apple's request.  </p><p>Still while the strategies might be different, the goal is the same: win  over new fans in one of the fastest growing markets in the world.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Josh Lipton in San Francisco.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN:  Coming up, a sneak peek at how the greatest basketball player  who ever lived lives.  </p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>MATHISEN:  Here's a look at what to watch tomorrow.  Jobless claims are up.   Final piece of data on the labor market, ahead of Friday's big employment  report.  Dow component Merck (NYSE:MRK) will report its earnings.  Sales of  its hepatitis C drug and cancer immunotherapy will be the focus there.  </p><p>And the president of St. Louis Fed, Mr. Bullard, will speak on the economy.   And that is what to watch for Thursday.</p><p>Adidas wants to sell parts of its golf business, including one of the best  known brands in the world, TaylorMade.  It is also selling its Adams and  Ashworth brands.  The German sports wear maker says it plans instead to  focus on golf footwear and apparel.  </p><p>Meantime, the sports apparel maker Under Armor is giving Nike (NYSE:NKE) a  run for its money when it comes to endorsement deals.  On its rooster are  top young athletes like the NBA player Steph Curry, golf pro Jordan Spieth,  the NFL's Cam Newton, and they've now signed Bryce Harper, the baseball  player, to a ten-year extension that might turn out to be the biggest  endorsement deal for the baseball player.  </p><p>So, how is the upstart Under Armour (NYSE:UA) convincing some of the  biggest names in sports to come on board?</p><p>John Kell is a senior writer at Fortune Magazine and he's got some answers.</p><p>John, I assume they're just paying more.  </p><p>JOHN KELL, FORTUNE SR. WRITER:  They are paying more, but they're also able  to kind of sell the story that at Under Armour (NYSE:UA), which is a much  smaller athletic apparel company than Nike (NYSE:NKE), that some of these  athletes will be viewed as a marquee name in their sport rather than just  one out of a huge crowd of athletes that Nike (NYSE:NKE) works with in the  NFL or in the NBA for example.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  In other words, Steph Curry is going to stand out more because  there's not going to be a whole stable of other ball players around him?  </p><p>KELL:  The FM (ph) kind of reported about that earlier this year, that that  was kind of a selling point that they reported that Nike (NYSE:NKE), when  they presented their contract renewal to Steph Curry that the slide  actually had the name Kevin Durant, which another NBA player.</p><p>MATHISEN:  Oops.</p><p>KELL:  Yes.  So, there was the kind of left a bad taste in the mouth of  Curry and his family and his representative and so that could be part of  the reason why he decided to move to Under Armour (NYSE:UA), where he is  the big name.  They're building a really big shoe program around him, kind  of like Jordan or LeBron James.  He might not have gotten that much  attention if he had stayed with Nike (NYSE:NKE).  </p><p>MATHISEN:  And their footwear sales have gone way up and they have sold a  pair to my son, by the way, who is crazy for the Steph Curry shoes.  </p><p>But let's be clear here, Under Armor is a fraction of -- though fast  growing -- a fraction of the size of Nike (NYSE:NKE).  </p><p>KELL:  They are.  They're only $4 billion in revenue business.  Nike  (NYSE:NKE) is a little over $30 billion and Nike (NYSE:NKE) is still  growing fast.  </p><p>A lot of people forget that when they talk about Under Armour (NYSE:UA)  strong growth and it is very strong.  They forgot that Nike (NYSE:NKE) is  still growing, too.  It's a Dow component that is still growing.  Niki is  expecting to hit $50 billion in sales in five years.  That's huge.  </p><p>Under Armour (NYSE:UA) is not going to ever be able to catch -- is not  going to ever able to catch up to that in a foreseeable future.  But ten  years ago, Under Armour (NYSE:UA) did not sell a single pair of shoes, and  now, they sell 700 million.  So, ten years later, that's a huge grown  business for them.</p><p>MATHISEN:  Some people would say that Under Armor has the younger, hotter  players, but they've also got Tom Brady (NYSE:BRC) who is certainly hot to  many people's estimation, but he's not young.</p><p>KELL:  You know, they want to have mix.  They work with Misty Copeland,  she's a ballerina, but she's on her 30s.  They're working with the U.S.  gymnastics team, the women's team.  That's a younger kind of play.  </p><p>They're really well known for doing an endorsement deal with Friday night  lights.  That helped them get into the high school, college crowd.  They  signed a deal with U.C. Berkeley, another way to kind of get into the  college crowd.  So, they definitely do want to have a mix of younger and  older athletes because with younger athletes really kind of a guess as to  how successful they will be, will injury play a role and how long they can  play.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  All right.  John, we've got to leave it there, I'm sorry to say.   John Kell, with Fortune Magazine.</p><p>Meantime, Nike (NYSE:NKE) and Michael Jordan do go hand in hand.  He was  one of Nike's highest athletes, still is here.  Jordan line set the bar  high for basketball sneakers.  </p><p>Now, the greatest basketball player that ever lived is selling his Chicago  home and Robert Frank takes us on a tour inside and out.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>KOFI NARTEY, REALTOR:  So, this is Michael Jordan's house.  I almost don't  need to say that.  Numbers 23 behind me on the gate say it all.  It's a  number that's recognized worldwide to symbolize success, championships and  this is the estate he built on that success.  </p><p>ROBERT FRANK, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  The listing price,  $14,855,000.  If you add each number in the price tag together, it equals  23.  </p><p>Realtor Kofi Nartey specializes in selling homes for athletes, the Air  Jordan's he's wearing show how important Michael is to his sales pitch.  </p><p>NARTEY:  This outdoor area is one of Michael's favorite places to hang out.  </p><p>FRANK:  Everything on the property reflects Jordan's taste.  There's a  round infinity pool designed to look like a ball going into a net.  Nearby,  the golf-crazed Jordan made room for a spacious putting green, and  installed a tennis court suitable for night play.  </p><p>NARTEY:  He wanted to build something that was outside of the city, just as  a getaway.  </p><p>FRANK:  A getaway with lots of privacy so the legendary baller and a tight  circle of friends could relax in their element out of spotlight.  These  giant doors came from the Playboy Mansion.  Behind them, there's a billiard  room.  Jordan also built a wine cellar and an enormous gentleman's lounge  to indulge his fashion for cigars and playing cards.</p><p>NARTEY:  This is where he spent a lot of time hanging out with his friends,  playing cards, epic card battles, and he had a full walk-in humidor where  he had his cigar collection, spent lots of times smoking cigar and talking  trash.  </p><p>FRANK:  The hoops legend entertained pals in an open bar with TVs to watch  games.  Put them up in a swank three bedroom guest house and, of course,  worked them out on this ultimate regulation size home court.  The jump man  logo is surrounded by the names of Jordan's kids and special cushioning  under the wood eased the wear and tier on the superstar's knees.  </p><p>Next door, MJ designed a full gym for his hardcore workouts and even put in  a locker room to accommodate his famous Bulls teammates.  </p><p>NARTEY:  The year before Michael won his first championship, he decided to  start inviting a few of his teammates to come workout, practice and train.   They would meet here in the morning, eat breakfast with his private chef,  and that camaraderie actually led to their very first championship.  </p><p>FRANK:  For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Robert Frank.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN:  And for more on Michael Jordan's home, head to our website  NBR.com. </p><p>And that is NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for tonight.  I'm Tyler Mathisen.   Thanks for watching.  Have a great evening, everybody.

Chrysler recalls  nearly 5 million vehicles.  The stock falls and it comes at the start of a  busy holiday weekend on the road.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> BILL GRIFFETH, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR:  A matter of trust.   Amazon's Alexa recorded and shared a couple's conversation, raising privacy  concerns about the growing smart device market.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> HERERA:  \"Airbnb: Unwelcome Guests\".  An investigative report inside the  world of illegal short-term rentals and the tense battle with regulators.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Those stories and more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Friday, May  25th.  </p><p> GRIFFETH:  And we do bid you a good Friday evening, everybody.  Welcome.  </p><p> The timing could not be worse for Chrysler -- Fiat Chrysler.  Ahead of a  long weekend when millions of Americans are expected to hit the road, the  automaker issued one of the largest recalls in American automotive history  today.  The company is warning owners to stop using their cruise control  immediately because of a software defect in nearly 5 million vehicles.  And  that sent the stock lower in trading today.  </p><p> And as Phil LeBeau reports right now, the recall also occurs just as the  industry kicks off its summer selling season.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> PHIL LEBEAU, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  It is one of the  largest recalls ever, impacting some of the most popular models in the  U.S., including the Jeep Grand Cherokee (NASDAQ:CHKE) and the Ram 1500  pickup.  They are part of a recall covering 4.8 million Fiat Chrysler  vehicles, 15 different models, covering the last five model years, with  Jeep, Ram, Dodge and Chrysler brands all impacted.  </p><p> The issue: a defect with the cruise control.  In rare circumstances,  drivers may not be able to turn off the cruise control unless they shift  the vehicle into neutral and eventually park it.  While Fiat Chrysler knows  of no accidents or incidents with runaway cruise control, it is warning  drivers not to use cruise control until the software can be updated.  That  warning comes as millions prepare for a road trip over the holiday weekend.  </p><p> It's also a huge weekend for people to buy a new car or truck.  Whether the  recall and headlines impact sales is too hard to tell.  Under CEO Sergio  Marchionne, Fiat Chrysler has more than doubled its U.S. sales in the last  decade.  Jeep and Ram have become hot brands with strong sales.  </p><p> But overall, Fiat Chrysler's track record in reliability and dependability  studies has been lackluster.  </p><p> It's unclear how long it will take Fiat Chrysler to get the updated cruise  control software to dealers and fix all of the recalled vehicles.  But  until the defect is corrected, drivers are being told to steer clear of  cruise control.  </p><p> Phil LeBeau, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Chicago.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> HERERA:  And as drivers hit the road this weekend, they're also paying more  for gas.  A rise in crude oil prices and increased demand for gasoline has  lifted the national average to nearly $3 a gallon.  According to AAA,  that's up about 30 percent from a year ago.  </p><p> GRIFFETH:  And wouldn't you know that oil prices went in the other  direction today.  Two influential oil ministers said some oil-producing  nations could ease production limits that were put in place last year.   Officials in Saudi Arabia and Russia say that there is a need to compensate  for declining production in Venezuela and the anticipated export disruption  from Iran.  </p><p> So, the price of domestic crude settled lower by 4 percent today.  </p><p> HERERA:  On Wall Street, energy stocks followed oil prices lower.  Exxon  and Chevron (NYSE:CVX) were the two worst-performing stocks on the Dow  today and geopolitical risks kept investors cautious ahead of the long  weekend.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 58 to 24,753.  The Nasdaq  was up nine and the S&amp;P 500 dropped six.  For the week, all of the averages  recorded gains.  </p><p> Mike Santoli takes a look at what might happen to stocks in the weeks  ahead.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> MIKE SANTOLI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Stocks are heading  into summer stuck right in the middle of their 2018 range.  And a swirl of  opposing currents threatens to keep the market from making much progress as  the weather heats up and the trading slows down.  The S&amp;P 500 has had an  eventful first five months of the year, but the net movement has been  slight.  </p><p> The index is up a bit less than 2 percent year to date and is almost  exactly halfway between its late January peak and the February lows, just a  bit more than 5 percent away from each extreme.  </p><p> Seasonal factors suggest a choppy path into the summer with June being  among the weaker months of the year.  Historical record of midterm election  years also points to nervous back-and-forth trading in the coming months.   This would fit with the interplay of fundamental factors that have been  driving stocks so far this year.  Corporate profits are growing briskly and  companies are buying back their shares aggressively.  </p><p> Yet the threat of higher interest rates and questions over the durability  of economic growth are constant.  And while Wall Street has tuned out much  of the drama from Washington, the jarring headlines on geopolitical flux,  trade tensions, the Russia collusion investigation and a contentious  congressional campaign might only become more intense.  None of this  suggests stocks are doomed to a summer of discontent.  The market's winter  setback and springtime recovery acted as a sort of stress test to make  stocks less expensive and turn investor expectations more realistic.  </p><p> But the forces that have held the market in check for months continue to  indicate that stocks might be in for a staycation, at least for the start  of summer.  </p><p> For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Mike Santoli.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> GRIFFETH:  To the economy now where orders for durable goods, those long- lasting items like computers and refrigerators, those orders fell last  month.  But much of that decline stemmed from fewer contracts for Boeing  (NYSE:BA) planes.  Otherwise, most businesses did report a modest  improvement in equipment spending in April and again an overall rise in  orders.  </p><p> HERERA:  The Trump administration has reportedly reached a deal that will  allow the Chinese telecom company, ZTE, to remain in business.  As first  reported by \"The New York Times (NYSE:NYT),\" the White House told Congress  that ZTE will pay a bigger fine, hire American compliance officers and  shake up its management team.  In exchange, the Commerce Department will  lift an order under which that company had been cut off from American  suppliers.  It is unclear, however, how firm the reported deal is at this  point.  </p><p> GRIFFETH:  Elsewhere, President Trump said today that the summit with North  Korea is still possible, less than 24 hours after he sent a letter to  Pyongyang cancelling next month's talks.  The president said that the two  countries are talking again and he seemed to like the conciliatory tone of  a statement issued by North Korea offering to meet any time.  </p><p> So what's next?  </p><p> Eunice Yoon picks up the story from there from Beijing tonight.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> EUNICE YOON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  North Korea left the  door ajar on rescheduling a summit.  In a statement in the official KCNA  news agency, the North Koreans describe President Trump's decision as  unexpected and said: We are willing to sit face-to-face to resolve problems  at any time in any way.  </p><p> I spoke to one diplomat here who follows North Korea who said that the  language of the statement suggested that it came directly from Kim Jong-un.   It used the words \"upon authorization\" which is code for Kim.  He said the  two are like a husband and wife who just got into an argument and we're  waiting to see who's going to make the first move to kiss and make up.  </p><p> There are few things, though, that don't bode well for the optimists.  The  North Koreans said that solving the nuclear problem in a phased way would  make the relations get better rather than making them get worse.  This is  not new, but it shows how North Korea wants to approach the nuclear issue  in a step-by-step process.  That happens to be very different from what the  Trump administration wants, a front-loaded, verifiable denuclearization  with major promises of economic relief.  This is where the two are very far  apart on how the process will work.  </p><p> On top of that, North Korea said Trump's decision has caused them to think  over if they were truly right to have made efforts and opted for this new  path.  That raises questions as to whether or not North Korea will continue  with its general outreach to the United States and South Korea.  </p><p> There are also some interesting comments out of China.  The foreign  ministry reiterated today that the two sides should continue with their  dialogue, but the more interesting comments were in response to questions  about President Trump's implied accusation that China is behind North  Korea's more hostile attitude.  To this, the ministry said we have no  secret intention.  </p><p> And the ministry also dismissed the suggestion that China could use its  relationship with North Korea as leverage in trade talks with the United  States, saying: I would say you're overthinking it.  </p><p> For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Eunice Yoon in Beijing.</p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> HERERA:  It is time to take a look at some of today's upgrades and  downgrades.  </p><p> Paypal's rating was upgraded to buy from hold at Stifel Nicolaus.  The  analyst there cites its addition of new financial services and the global  growing payments market.  The price target is $99.  The shares fell  fractionally to $80.96.  </p><p> Colgate-Palmolive's rating was raised to buy from hold over at Argus  Research.  The analyst cites the potential for earnings growth given its  strong focus on emerging markets.  The price target is $72.  The shares  closed up 2 percent to $63.75.  </p><p> GRIFFETH:  Still ahead, the area of retail where there is still a lot of  growth and where our market monitor says might be a good place to invest.  </p><p> (MUSIC)</p><p> HERERA:  As we have been reporting, data privacy laws went into effect in  the European Union today.  It's considered the biggest change to data  privacy in 20 years.  The rules give E.U. citizens more control over their  personal data.  Users will be able to know how their data is being used and  users can also have their data erased.  </p><p> Most analysts say the financial impact on big tech companies will be  minimal, although smaller ones could face more of a challenge with  increased regulatory expenses.  But some American publishers are struggling  with the new law.  Sites like \"The L.A. Times\" and \"Chicago Tribune\" were  taken down in European countries.  </p><p> GRIFFETH:  And another privacy debate is brewing, you've probably heard  about this, over Amazon's smart speaker Alexa, which one couple says  secretly recorded their conversation and sent it to a random contact.  </p><p> Aditi Roy has the details for us tonight.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> ADITI ROY, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Amazon's Alexa devices  are in 40 million homes across the country.  Their job: to always be  listening for voice prompts.</p><p> But in what Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is calling an unlikely chain of events, an  Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Echo device inside a home of a Portland, Oregon,  couple accidentally recorded their private conversation and then sent the  audio file to a phone contact.  The story is unsettling to Echo customers,  like Alyssa Chu (ph).  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: That's not what I would intend it to be used for.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I'm pretty surprised.  I mean, that sounds like a lot  of mistakes to happen.  </p><p> ROY:  According to Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Echo woke up due to a word in  background conversation sounding like Alexa.  Then the subsequent  conversation was heard as a send message request at which point Alexa said  out loud, to whom?  At which point, the background conversation was  interpreted as a name in the customer's contact list.  </p><p> STEPHANIE MEHTA, FAST COMPANY EDITOR-IN-CHIEF:  I think this will have  ramifications for people's trust level for Alexa and other in-home devices.   The creepy factor on this is huge.  </p><p> ROY:  Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is already in a battle for market share in the  home speaker category, and some industry watchers say an incident like this  could tip the scales.  </p><p> According to e-marketer, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) dominates two-thirds of that  market now, but the market research group projects that lead will drop by 6  percent in two years, while products including the Google (NASDAQ:GOOG)  Home will see a corresponding increase.  </p><p> BOB O'DONNELL, TECHNALYSIS:  This is the consumer privacy fear that  everyone was afraid of when Alexa came into people's houses.  </p><p> ROY:  On the other hand, other analysts say what happened to that Oregon  couple is so unlikely that it won't keep people from buying and using their  Alexa devices.  </p><p> GENE MUNSTER, LOUP VENTURES:  I think it should be statistically about one  in a million concern.  </p><p> ROY:  The company says it's working to make sure it doesn't happen again.   And despite her disappointment over the incident, Chu says she's not  unplugging her Echo any time soon.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Probably still use it, just being more aware.  </p><p> ROY:  The case does bring up privacy concerns.  The group consumer watchdog  is already calling on Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) to have a dedicated internal  privacy watchdog at the company.  </p><p> For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Aditi Roy, San Francisco.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> HERERA:  A bit earlier this week, we ran a story about Amazon's Alexa,  teaming up with the home builder Lennar (NYSE:LEN).  Lennar (NYSE:LEN)  issued the following statement following the Alexa privacy story.  Quote,  with all -- as with all new technologies, this is a process of continued  refinement, including the coexistence of things like security and privacy.   That said, we have a lot of respect for Amazon's technology, security and  privacy capabilities.  Homeowners can always remove their Alexa-enabled  device if they choose, end quote.  </p><p> GRIFFETH:  Footlocker (NYSE:FL) raced past earnings expectations and that  is where we begin tonight's \"Market Focus\".  </p><p> Strong demand for Nike (NYSE:NKE) and Adidas shoes helped the retail chain  beat sales estimates by the most in at least two years.  The company also  benefited from its strategy to streamline its inventory.  Shares soared by  20 percent to 55.74, making Footlocker (NYSE:FL) the best performing stock  by far in the S&amp;P 500 today.  </p><p> But it was a different story for sporting goods retailer Hibbett Sports  (NASDAQ:HIBB).  The company missed both earnings and revenue estimates in  the most recent quarter.  Strong online sales were not enough to offset a  decline in comparable store sales.  And as you might imagine, shares  finished lower, the day down 15 percent to $24.43.  </p><p> Meanwhile, a drop in same-store sales caused revenue to miss forecasts at  clothing retailer Buckle (NYSE:BKE).  Net income did rise and those results  beat street targets.  Shares, though, fell nearly 2 percent today to  $25.25.  </p><p> HERERA:  One of AstraZeneca's cancer drugs showed promising results in a  study.  The pharmaceutical company said its immunotherapy medication  improved overall survival in lung cancer patients who were given that  treatment.  The drug is already approved in the U.S. to treat a certain  type of non-small cell lung cancer.  Shares of AstraZeneca were up a  fraction to $37.04.  </p><p> Herbalife's largest investor is reducing his position.  A securities filing  revealed that billionaire investor Carl Icahn is cutting his stake in the  nutrition and weight loss company simply because his investment has become  too large.  Icahn added that he still believes in the business and sees  strong performance ahead.  Herbalife (NYSE:HLF) shares fell 9-1/2 percent  to $48.70.  </p><p> And a federal court late last night handed Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) a legal  victory against its rival, Samsung.  Samsung has been ordered to pay Apple  (NASDAQ:AAPL) $500 million in damages for illegally copying patented  smartphone features.  The two companies have been involved in this patent  lawsuit since 2011.  Shares of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) were up a tick to  $188.58.  Samsung trades in South Korea.  </p><p> GRIFFETH:  Tonight's market monitor says he is finding opportunities in  online retail stocks.  He expects online retail companies to account for 20  percent of all U.S. retail sales within five years.  Right now, that figure  sits just below 10 percent.  </p><p> This is his first time as our market monitor.  He is Christian Magoon,  founder and CEO of Amplify ETFs.  </p><p> Christian, good to see you again.  Thank you for joining us tonight.</p><p> CHRISTIAN MAGOON, AMPLIFY ETFS CEO:  Good to see you as well.  Thanks.</p><p> GRIFFETH:  We're going to talk about three companies here.  You see, what,  20 percent by the end of the year.  What's going to be the catalyst for  those gains, do you think?  </p><p> MAGOON:  Well, most of the catalyst for online retail stocks is really  growth in sales and market share, but then overall growth in online retail  sales.  Right now, online retail sales are growing 16 percent year over  year, whereas department store sales are actually shrinking.  </p><p> So, they're in a sweet spot where they're carving out market share from  brick and mortar, but also increasing their customer penetration rate.  </p><p> HERERA:  And you point out that it's not just Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).  A lot  of people think of online shopping as simply, you know, they always go to  Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), but you picked three stocks that you think are very  interesting niche plays.  </p><p> Etsy is your first pick.  Why do you like it?  </p><p> MAGOON:  Yes, so this is an online platform for handmade and vintage goods.   We think it's a very unique platform to get -- to buy things that really  have an experience with them.  They're not just something you'd find in a  typical brick and mortar store.  They're very unique.  </p><p> And this could be an interesting play for a merger or acquisition, whether  it's a brick and mortar company trying to get their toe wet in online  retail and buying a platform like Etsy or somebody already in the retail  space trying to expand into this handmade and vintage item area.  </p><p> GRIFFETH:  Then there's a company in a very competitive part of the online  world in food and meal delivery, you're talking about Grubhub here.  </p><p> MAGOON:  Yes, Grubhub is definitely in competition with companies like Uber  Eats, for example.  But they have some strategic advantages.  One is this  recent exclusive deal they signed with Yum Brands (NYSE:YUM) to exclusively  deliver KFC, Pizza Hut, Taco Bell, et cetera.  </p><p> They're becoming kind of the largest entity in the U.S., but it's a  competitive space -- it's a competitive space, Bill, and it will be  interesting to see what happens in this marketplace.  But we see it going  higher over the course of the year.  </p><p> HERERA:  And let's finish up with Carvana.  I was stunned with the amount  of revenue growth this company has, up 127 percent year over year.  That's  obviously one of the reasons why you like it.  </p><p> MAGOON:  That's right.  It goes hand in hand with their car sales.  So,  they sold over 18,000 cars, pre-owned cars last quarter.  That was the  growth of about 127 percent year over year.  They're building this online  platform to buy, inspect, finance pre-owned cars.  </p><p> And that's becoming a growing area here in the U.S.  They're national and  we think they can continue to improve.  Their big challenge is they're  still not profitable yet, unlike the other two stocks that we spoke about.  </p><p> GRIFFETH:  Well, that's certainly a big growth area, that's for sure in  online retail.</p><p> Christian, thanks for joining us.  Appreciate it very much.  </p><p> MAGOON:  Thanks, Bill.  </p><p> GRIFFETH:  Christian Magoon with Amplify ETFs.  </p><p> And to read more about his picks, you can head to our Website at NBR.com.  </p><p> HERERA:  Coming up, a months-long exclusive investigation into the emerging  battle between illegal short-term rentals and the law.  </p><p> (MUSIC)</p><p> GRIFFETH:  Here is what to watch next week on Wednesday.  The second  estimate for first quarter GDP will be out.  Also on Wednesday, the Fed  will publish its Beige Book, the anecdotal look at the economic conditions  across the country.  And then on Friday, the all-important jobs report for  the month of May will be on tap first thing in the morning.  That's what  we're watching for next week.  </p><p> HERERA:  An emerging turf battle is under way between cities and upstart  tech companies like Airbnb, for example, that have been capitalizing on the  Wild West landscape of the share economy.  Valued at $31 billion, the  company is currently worth more than most of its publicly traded hotel  rivals.  But gigantic growth means some big growing pains as well.  </p><p> GRIFFETH:  Indeed.  \"Airbnb: Unwelcome Guests\".  That's a CNBC  investigation into that clash between illegal short-term rentals and  restrictive regulations.  </p><p>Airbnb says it has worked with cities around the world to craft reasonable  regulations, but not in Miami Beach, where the fight has no end in sight.  </p><p> Morgan Brennan has our special report for us tonight.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> MORGAN BRENNAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  It's 9:00 on a  Saturday night and we're riding along with Miami Beach code compliance, on  the lookout for illegal short-term rentals.  </p><p> And what are you looking for tonight?  </p><p> VIJMA MAHARAJ, MIAMI BEACH CODE COMPLIANCE:  Hopefully, we can establish  contact if it's occupied and determine whether it's a violation or not.  </p><p> BRENNAN:  Code compliance officer Vijma Maharaj has seen it all.  Large  noisy late-night parties in residential neighborhoods, commercial video  shoots with scantily clad women in a home investigated for short term  rental claims, and unwitting tourists who say they unknowingly booked  Airbnbs in prohibited areas.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  You shouldn't be able to do this.  This is messed up.  </p><p> BRENNAN:  All captured on body camera videos recorded over the past two  years.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Hello.  </p><p> BRENNAN:  Some are so blatant as these house rules show what to do if  someone asks.  They're told to lie by saying they're a friend and certainly  don't mention they rent this place.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  You're not allowed to rent this house for less than  six months and one day.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Everybody has to leave.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  This party needs to clear up.  </p><p> BRENNAN:  At a loud party in Millbrae, California, in the San Francisco Bay  Area, shots rang out.  </p><p> Guests seen on surveillance cameras running down the street.  Airbnb says  it has zero tolerance for this type of behavior and permanently banned the  guests.  Airbnb says these incidents don't represent the overwhelming  number of satisfied hosts and guests in 8,100 cities and 191 countries.   And it has successfully worked with lawmakers around the world.  </p><p> Back on the streets of Miami Beach, it's not long before we roll up on a  group of vacationers.  The building has telltale signs of an illegal  rental.  Two of the units advertised on Airbnb have lockboxes and key pads.  </p><p> Do you live there?  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We do.  </p><p> BRENNAN:  How long have you been living there?  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Actually, we just rented with Airbnb.  </p><p> BRENNAN: Are you guys surprised to hear that it's not legal here?  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Actually, yes, because, I mean, it's something that's,  you know, it's just out there for people.  </p><p> DAN GELBER, MIAMI BEACH MAYOR:  You would say when you hear that story -- </p><p> BRENNAN:  To Miami Beach Mayor Dan Gelber, the issue is clear cut.  </p><p> GELBER:  They may work in some places but they really don't work here,  because at the end of the day, it's not the mom and pops we are seeing  here.  We're seeing commercialized predatory companies that are trying to  commercialize our residential communities.  </p><p> BRENNAN:  Predatory seems like a strong word.  What do you mean by that?  </p><p> GELBER:  It is predatory, because it's not about a mom and pop or  grandmother wanting to bring in a college kid to make him chicken soup at  night.  It's people taking very nice properties, buying them, and turning  them into essentially a flophouse.  </p><p> BRENNAN:  Gelber, a former prosecutor and former state lawmaker, says  Airbnb and other $ home-sharing platforms must abide by the law.  </p><p> Have you spoken to Airbnb or any of the other companies that operate here?  </p><p> GELBER:  I've spoken to some of the representatives before I was elected.   I'd like to send them a message.  I'd like them to be corporately  responsible.  I'd like them to do the right thing.  </p><p> BRENNAN:  Why do you think they haven't done that?  </p><p> GELBER:  Look, these are not charities.  These home-sharing platforms, they  want to make money.  </p><p> BRENNAN:  In an interview at Airbnb's San Francisco headquarters, Chris  Lehane, the head of global policy, strongly defended the company's track  record.  </p><p> CHRIS LEHANE, AIRBNB HEAD OF GLOBAL POLICY:  I have yet to see a program  being run by any mayor, any elected official in this time of economic  inequality that's generating $6,100 for a typical middle class family, all  without the expenditure of a single taxpayer dollar.  That is what Airbnb  is about at its core, trying to use technology to create economic  empowerment.  </p><p> BRENNAN:  Should Airbnb responsible for what is in that market illegal  activity on the platform?  </p><p> LEHANE:  I think what seems to be a common sense solution for Miami Beach,  happy to do this if they want to sit down and have a constructive  conversation, is you can take that 35 percent of the city that's a  residential area, make that an exclusionary zone.  Allow the activity to be  able to take place in the 65 percent of the city that's actually explicitly  zoned for this type of activity.  </p><p> BRENNAN:  In the meantime, you have illegal listings on your site.  </p><p> LEHANE:  Well, first of all, I think if you actually look at the underlying  law in the city in Miami Beach, right, Miami Beach allows for this activity  to take place.  $20,000 fines on someone making their home available a few  times a year to actually help make ends meet?  It doesn't sound like they  want to make this work as well as possible for as many people as possible.  </p><p> BRENNAN:  The American Hotel and Lodging Association tells us that instead  of supporting common sense regulations, Airbnb has opted to deploy a  massive campaign of dirty tactics, deceptive messaging and personal attacks  against anyone who raises a concern.  </p><p> For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Morgan Brennan.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> HERERA:  Whether it is Airbnb or booking.com or HomeAway, which is owned by  Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE), all of these companies have had clashes to varying  degrees with regulators in different cities.  Officials in many cities  across the country, whether it's Boston or Los Angeles or New York say  there are issues.  That said, Morgan found in her reporting, the company  brought up most frequently is Airbnb.  </p><p> GRIFFETH:  Before we go, one more look at the day on Wall Street.  The Dow  fell 58 points today.  The Nasdaq was up nine.  The S&amp;P dropped by six.  </p><p> And for the week, all of the averages recorded gains.  </p><p> HERERA:  And that is NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for tonight.  I'm Sue Herera,  thanks for joining us.  </p><p> GRIFFETH:  I'm Bill Griffeth, have a wonderful long weekend.  We will see  you Monday for a special edition of NBR.  But have a good night.  </p><p> END</p><p> Nightly Business Report transcripts and video are available on-line post  broadcast at <url normalizedValue=\"http://nbr.com\">http://nbr.com</url>.

Chrysler recalls  nearly 5 million vehicles.  The stock falls and it comes at the start of a  busy holiday weekend on the road.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">BILL GRIFFETH, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR:  A matter of trust.   Amazon's Alexa recorded and shared a couple's conversation, raising privacy  concerns about the growing smart device market.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">HERERA:  \"Airbnb: Unwelcome Guests\".  An investigative report inside the  world of illegal short-term rentals and the tense battle with regulators.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Those stories and more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Friday, May  25th.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  And we do bid you a good Friday evening, everybody.  Welcome.  </p><p>The timing could not be worse for Chrysler -- FiatChrysler.  Ahead of a  long weekend when millions of Americans are expected to hit the road, the  automaker issued one of the largest recalls in American automotive history  today.  The company is warning owners to stop using their cruise control  immediately because of a software defect in nearly 5 million vehicles.  And  that sent the stock lower in trading today.  </p><p>And as Phil LeBeau reports right now, the recall also occurs just as the  industry kicks off its summer selling season.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PHIL LEBEAU, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  It is one of the  largest recalls ever, impacting some of the most popular models in the  U.S., including the Jeep Grand Cherokee (NASDAQ:CHKE) and the Ram 1500  pickup.  They are part of a recall covering 4.8 million FiatChrysler  vehicles, 15 different models, covering the last five model years, with  Jeep, Ram, Dodge and Chrysler brands all impacted.  </p><p>The issue: a defect with the cruise control.  In rare circumstances,  drivers may not be able to turn off the cruise control unless they shift  the vehicle into neutral and eventually park it.  While FiatChrysler knows  of no accidents or incidents with runaway cruise control, it is warning  drivers not to use cruise control until the software can be updated.  That  warning comes as millions prepare for a road trip over the holiday weekend.  </p><p>It's also a huge weekend for people to buy a new car or truck.  Whether the  recall and headlines impact sales is too hard to tell.  Under CEO Sergio  Marchionne, FiatChrysler has more than doubled its U.S. sales in the last  decade.  Jeep and Ram have become hot brands with strong sales.  </p><p>But overall, FiatChrysler's track record in reliability and dependability  studies has been lackluster.  </p><p>It's unclear how long it will take FiatChrysler to get the updated cruise  control software to dealers and fix all of the recalled vehicles.  But  until the defect is corrected, drivers are being told to steer clear of  cruise control.  </p><p>Phil LeBeau, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Chicago.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  And as drivers hit the road this weekend, they're also paying more  for gas.  A rise in crude oil prices and increased demand for gasoline has  lifted the national average to nearly $3 a gallon.  According to AAA,  that's up about 30 percent from a year ago.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  And wouldn't you know that oil prices went in the other  direction today.  Two influential oil ministers said some oil-producing  nations could ease production limits that were put in place last year.   Officials in Saudi Arabia and Russia say that there is a need to compensate  for declining production in Venezuela and the anticipated export disruption  from Iran.  </p><p>So, the price of domestic crude settled lower by 4 percent today.  </p><p>HERERA:  On Wall Street, energy stocks followed oil prices lower.  Exxon  and Chevron (NYSE:CVX) were the two worst-performing stocks on the Dow  today and geopolitical risks kept investors cautious ahead of the long  weekend.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 58 to 24,753.  The Nasdaq  was up nine and the S&amp;P 500 dropped six.  For the week, all of the averages  recorded gains.  </p><p>Mike Santoli takes a look at what might happen to stocks in the weeks  ahead.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MIKE SANTOLI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Stocks are heading  into summer stuck right in the middle of their 2018 range.  And a swirl of  opposing currents threatens to keep the market from making much progress as  the weather heats up and the trading slows down.  The S&amp;P 500 has had an  eventful first five months of the year, but the net movement has been  slight.  </p><p>The index is up a bit less than 2 percent year to date and is almost  exactly halfway between its late January peak and the February lows, just a  bit more than 5 percent away from each extreme.  </p><p>Seasonal factors suggest a choppy path into the summer with June being  among the weaker months of the year.  Historical record of midterm election  years also points to nervous back-and-forth trading in the coming months.   This would fit with the interplay of fundamental factors that have been  driving stocks so far this year.  Corporate profits are growing briskly and  companies are buying back their shares aggressively.  </p><p>Yet the threat of higher interest rates and questions over the durability  of economic growth are constant.  And while Wall Street has tuned out much  of the drama from Washington, the jarring headlines on geopolitical flux,  trade tensions, the Russia collusion investigation and a contentious  congressional campaign might only become more intense.  None of this  suggests stocks are doomed to a summer of discontent.  The market's winter  setback and springtime recovery acted as a sort of stress test to make  stocks less expensive and turn investor expectations more realistic.  </p><p>But the forces that have held the market in check for months continue to  indicate that stocks might be in for a staycation, at least for the start  of summer.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Mike Santoli.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  To the economy now where orders for durable goods, those long- lasting items like computers and refrigerators, those orders fell last  month.  But much of that decline stemmed from fewer contracts for Boeing  (NYSE:BA) planes.  Otherwise, most businesses did report a modest  improvement in equipment spending in April and again an overall rise in  orders.  </p><p>HERERA:  The Trump administration has reportedly reached a deal that will  allow the Chinese telecom company, ZTE, to remain in business.  As first  reported by \"The New York Times (NYSE:NYT),\" the White House told Congress  that ZTE will pay a bigger fine, hire American compliance officers and  shake up its management team.  In exchange, the Commerce Department will  lift an order under which that company had been cut off from American  suppliers.  It is unclear, however, how firm the reported deal is at this  point.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  Elsewhere, President Trump said today that the summit with North  Korea is still possible, less than 24 hours after he sent a letter to  Pyongyang cancelling next month's talks.  The president said that the two  countries are talking again and he seemed to like the conciliatory tone of  a statement issued by North Korea offering to meet any time.  </p><p>So what's next?  </p><p>Eunice Yoon picks up the story from there from Beijing tonight.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>EUNICE YOON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  North Korea left the  door ajar on rescheduling a summit.  In a statement in the official KCNA  news agency, the North Koreans describe President Trump's decision as  unexpected and said: We are willing to sit face-to-face to resolve problems  at any time in any way.  </p><p>I spoke to one diplomat here who follows North Korea who said that the  language of the statement suggested that it came directly from Kim Jong-un.   It used the words \"upon authorization\" which is code for Kim.  He said the  two are like a husband and wife who just got into an argument and we're  waiting to see who's going to make the first move to kiss and make up.  </p><p>There are few things, though, that don't bode well for the optimists.  The  North Koreans said that solving the nuclear problem in a phased way would  make the relations get better rather than making them get worse.  This is  not new, but it shows how North Korea wants to approach the nuclear issue  in a step-by-step process.  That happens to be very different from what the  Trump administration wants, a front-loaded, verifiable denuclearization  with major promises of economic relief.  This is where the two are very far  apart on how the process will work.  </p><p>On top of that, North Korea said Trump's decision has caused them to think  over if they were truly right to have made efforts and opted for this new  path.  That raises questions as to whether or not North Korea will continue  with its general outreach to the United States and South Korea.  </p><p>There are also some interesting comments out of China.  The foreign  ministry reiterated today that the two sides should continue with their  dialogue, but the more interesting comments were in response to questions  about President Trump's implied accusation that China is behind North  Korea's more hostile attitude.  To this, the ministry said we have no  secret intention.  </p><p>And the ministry also dismissed the suggestion that China could use its  relationship with North Korea as leverage in trade talks with the United  States, saying: I would say you're overthinking it.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Eunice Yoon in Beijing.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  It is time to take a look at some of today's upgrades and  downgrades.  </p><p>Paypal's rating was upgraded to buy from hold at Stifel Nicolaus.  The  analyst there cites its addition of new financial services and the global  growing payments market.  The price target is $99.  The shares fell  fractionally to $80.96.  </p><p>Colgate-Palmolive's rating was raised to buy from hold over at Argus  Research.  The analyst cites the potential for earnings growth given its  strong focus on emerging markets.  The price target is $72.  The shares  closed up 2 percent to $63.75.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  Still ahead, the area of retail where there is still a lot of  growth and where our market monitor says might be a good place to invest.  </p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>HERERA:  As we have been reporting, data privacy laws went into effect in  the European Union today.  It's considered the biggest change to data  privacy in 20 years.  The rules give E.U. citizens more control over their  personal data.  Users will be able to know how their data is being used and  users can also have their data erased.  </p><p>Most analysts say the financial impact on big tech companies will be  minimal, although smaller ones could face more of a challenge with  increased regulatory expenses.  But some American publishers are struggling  with the new law.  Sites like \"The L.A. Times\" and \"Chicago Tribune\" were  taken down in European countries.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  And another privacy debate is brewing, you've probably heard  about this, over Amazon's smart speaker Alexa, which one couple says  secretly recorded their conversation and sent it to a random contact.  </p><p>Aditi Roy has the details for us tonight.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ADITI ROY, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Amazon's Alexa devices  are in 40 million homes across the country.  Their job: to always be  listening for voice prompts.</p><p>But in what Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is calling an unlikely chain of events, an  Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Echo device inside a home of a Portland, Oregon,  couple accidentally recorded their private conversation and then sent the  audio file to a phone contact.  The story is unsettling to Echo customers,  like Alyssa Chu (ph).  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: That's not what I would intend it to be used for.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I'm pretty surprised.  I mean, that sounds like a lot  of mistakes to happen.  </p><p>ROY:  According to Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Echo woke up due to a word in  background conversation sounding like Alexa.  Then the subsequent  conversation was heard as a send message request at which point Alexa said  out loud, to whom?  At which point, the background conversation was  interpreted as a name in the customer's contact list.  </p><p>STEPHANIE MEHTA, FAST COMPANY EDITOR-IN-CHIEF:  I think this will have  ramifications for people's trust level for Alexa and other in-home devices.   The creepy factor on this is huge.  </p><p>ROY:  Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is already in a battle for market share in the  home speaker category, and some industry watchers say an incident like this  could tip the scales.  </p><p>According to e-marketer, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) dominates two-thirds of that  market now, but the market research group projects that lead will drop by 6  percent in two years, while products including the Google (NASDAQ:GOOG)  Home will see a corresponding increase.  </p><p>BOB O'DONNELL, TECHNALYSIS:  This is the consumer privacy fear that  everyone was afraid of when Alexa came into people's houses.  </p><p>ROY:  On the other hand, other analysts say what happened to that Oregon  couple is so unlikely that it won't keep people from buying and using their  Alexa devices.  </p><p>GENE MUNSTER, LOUP VENTURES:  I think it should be statistically about one  in a million concern.  </p><p>ROY:  The company says it's working to make sure it doesn't happen again.   And despite her disappointment over the incident, Chu says she's not  unplugging her Echo any time soon.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Probably still use it, just being more aware.  </p><p>ROY:  The case does bring up privacy concerns.  The group consumer watchdog  is already calling on Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) to have a dedicated internal  privacy watchdog at the company.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Aditi Roy, San Francisco.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  A bit earlier this week, we ran a story about Amazon's Alexa,  teaming up with the home builder Lennar (NYSE:LEN).  Lennar (NYSE:LEN)  issued the following statement following the Alexa privacy story.  Quote,  with all -- as with all new technologies, this is a process of continued  refinement, including the coexistence of things like security and privacy.   That said, we have a lot of respect for Amazon's technology, security and  privacy capabilities.  Homeowners can always remove their Alexa-enabled  device if they choose, end quote.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  Footlocker (NYSE:FL) raced past earnings expectations and that  is where we begin tonight's \"Market Focus\".  </p><p>Strong demand for Nike (NYSE:NKE) and Adidas shoes helped the retail chain  beat sales estimates by the most in at least two years.  The company also  benefited from its strategy to streamline its inventory.  Shares soared by  20 percent to 55.74, making Footlocker (NYSE:FL) the best performing stock  by far in the S&amp;P 500 today.  </p><p>But it was a different story for sporting goods retailer Hibbett Sports  (NASDAQ:HIBB).  The company missed both earnings and revenue estimates in  the most recent quarter.  Strong online sales were not enough to offset a  decline in comparable store sales.  And as you might imagine, shares  finished lower, the day down 15 percent to $24.43.  </p><p>Meanwhile, a drop in same-store sales caused revenue to miss forecasts at  clothing retailer Buckle (NYSE:BKE).  Net income did rise and those results  beat street targets.  Shares, though, fell nearly 2 percent today to  $25.25.  </p><p>HERERA:  One of AstraZeneca's cancer drugs showed promising results in a  study.  The pharmaceutical company said its immunotherapy medication  improved overall survival in lung cancer patients who were given that  treatment.  The drug is already approved in the U.S. to treat a certain  type of non-small cell lung cancer.  Shares of AstraZeneca were up a  fraction to $37.04.  </p><p>Herbalife's largest investor is reducing his position.  A securities filing  revealed that billionaire investor Carl Icahn is cutting his stake in the  nutrition and weight loss company simply because his investment has become  too large.  Icahn added that he still believes in the business and sees  strong performance ahead.  Herbalife (NYSE:HLF) shares fell 9-1/2 percent  to $48.70.  </p><p>And a federal court late last night handed Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) a legal  victory against its rival, Samsung.  Samsung has been ordered to pay Apple  (NASDAQ:AAPL) $500 million in damages for illegally copying patented  smartphone features.  The two companies have been involved in this patent  lawsuit since 2011.  Shares of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) were up a tick to  $188.58.  Samsung trades in South Korea.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  Tonight's market monitor says he is finding opportunities in  online retail stocks.  He expects online retail companies to account for 20  percent of all U.S. retail sales within five years.  Right now, that figure  sits just below 10 percent.  </p><p>This is his first time as our market monitor.  He is Christian Magoon,  founder and CEO of Amplify ETFs.  </p><p>Christian, good to see you again.  Thank you for joining us tonight.</p><p>CHRISTIAN MAGOON, AMPLIFY ETFS CEO:  Good to see you as well.  Thanks.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  We're going to talk about three companies here.  You see, what,  20 percent by the end of the year.  What's going to be the catalyst for  those gains, do you think?  </p><p>MAGOON:  Well, most of the catalyst for online retail stocks is really  growth in sales and market share, but then overall growth in online retail  sales.  Right now, online retail sales are growing 16 percent year over  year, whereas department store sales are actually shrinking.  </p><p>So, they're in a sweet spot where they're carving out market share from  brick and mortar, but also increasing their customer penetration rate.  </p><p>HERERA:  And you point out that it's not just Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).  A lot  of people think of online shopping as simply, you know, they always go to  Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), but you picked three stocks that you think are very  interesting niche plays.  </p><p>Etsy is your first pick.  Why do you like it?  </p><p>MAGOON:  Yes, so this is an online platform for handmade and vintage goods.   We think it's a very unique platform to get -- to buy things that really  have an experience with them.  They're not just something you'd find in a  typical brick and mortar store.  They're very unique.  </p><p>And this could be an interesting play for a merger or acquisition, whether  it's a brick and mortar company trying to get their toe wet in online  retail and buying a platform like Etsy or somebody already in the retail  space trying to expand into this handmade and vintage item area.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  Then there's a company in a very competitive part of the online  world in food and meal delivery, you're talking about Grubhub here.  </p><p>MAGOON:  Yes, Grubhub is definitely in competition with companies like Uber  Eats, for example.  But they have some strategic advantages.  One is this  recent exclusive deal they signed with Yum Brands (NYSE:YUM) to exclusively  deliver KFC, Pizza Hut, Taco Bell, et cetera.  </p><p>They're becoming kind of the largest entity in the U.S., but it's a  competitive space -- it's a competitive space, Bill, and it will be  interesting to see what happens in this marketplace.  But we see it going  higher over the course of the year.  </p><p>HERERA:  And let's finish up with Carvana.  I was stunned with the amount  of revenue growth this company has, up 127 percent year over year.  That's  obviously one of the reasons why you like it.  </p><p>MAGOON:  That's right.  It goes hand in hand with their car sales.  So,  they sold over 18,000 cars, pre-owned cars last quarter.  That was the  growth of about 127 percent year over year.  They're building this online  platform to buy, inspect, finance pre-owned cars.  </p><p>And that's becoming a growing area here in the U.S.  They're national and  we think they can continue to improve.  Their big challenge is they're  still not profitable yet, unlike the other two stocks that we spoke about.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  Well, that's certainly a big growth area, that's for sure in  online retail.</p><p>Christian, thanks for joining us.  Appreciate it very much.  </p><p>MAGOON:  Thanks, Bill.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  Christian Magoon with Amplify ETFs.  </p><p>And to read more about his picks, you can head to our Website at NBR.com.  </p><p>HERERA:  Coming up, a months-long exclusive investigation into the emerging  battle between illegal short-term rentals and the law.  </p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Here is what to watch next week on Wednesday.  The second  estimate for first quarter GDP will be out.  Also on Wednesday, the Fed  will publish its Beige Book, the anecdotal look at the economic conditions  across the country.  And then on Friday, the all-important jobs report for  the month of May will be on tap first thing in the morning.  That's what  we're watching for next week.  </p><p>HERERA:  An emerging turf battle is under way between cities and upstart  tech companies like Airbnb, for example, that have been capitalizing on the  Wild West landscape of the share economy.  Valued at $31 billion, the  company is currently worth more than most of its publicly traded hotel  rivals.  But gigantic growth means some big growing pains as well.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  Indeed.  \"Airbnb: Unwelcome Guests\".  That's a CNBC  investigation into that clash between illegal short-term rentals and  restrictive regulations.  </p><p>Airbnb says it has worked with cities around the world to craft reasonable  regulations, but not in Miami Beach, where the fight has no end in sight.  </p><p>Morgan Brennan has our special report for us tonight.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MORGAN BRENNAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  It's 9:00 on a  Saturday night and we're riding along with Miami Beach code compliance, on  the lookout for illegal short-term rentals.  </p><p>And what are you looking for tonight?  </p><p>VIJMA MAHARAJ, MIAMI BEACH CODE COMPLIANCE:  Hopefully, we can establish  contact if it's occupied and determine whether it's a violation or not.  </p><p>BRENNAN:  Code compliance officer Vijma Maharaj has seen it all.  Large  noisy late-night parties in residential neighborhoods, commercial video  shoots with scantily clad women in a home investigated for short term  rental claims, and unwitting tourists who say they unknowingly booked  Airbnbs in prohibited areas.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  You shouldn't be able to do this.  This is messed up.  </p><p>BRENNAN:  All captured on body camera videos recorded over the past two  years.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Hello.  </p><p>BRENNAN:  Some are so blatant as these house rules show what to do if  someone asks.  They're told to lie by saying they're a friend and certainly  don't mention they rent this place.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  You're not allowed to rent this house for less than  six months and one day.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Everybody has to leave.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  This party needs to clear up.  </p><p>BRENNAN:  At a loud party in Millbrae, California, in the San Francisco Bay  Area, shots rang out.  </p><p>Guests seen on surveillance cameras running down the street.  Airbnb says  it has zero tolerance for this type of behavior and permanently banned the  guests.  Airbnb says these incidents don't represent the overwhelming  number of satisfied hosts and guests in 8,100 cities and 191 countries.   And it has successfully worked with lawmakers around the world.  </p><p>Back on the streets of Miami Beach, it's not long before we roll up on a  group of vacationers.  The building has telltale signs of an illegal  rental.  Two of the units advertised on Airbnb have lockboxes and key pads.  </p><p>Do you live there?  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We do.  </p><p>BRENNAN:  How long have you been living there?  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Actually, we just rented with Airbnb.  </p><p>BRENNAN: Are you guys surprised to hear that it's not legal here?  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Actually, yes, because, I mean, it's something that's,  you know, it's just out there for people.  </p><p>DAN GELBER, MIAMI BEACH MAYOR:  You would say when you hear that story -- </p><p>BRENNAN:  To Miami Beach Mayor Dan Gelber, the issue is clear cut.  </p><p>GELBER:  They may work in some places but they really don't work here,  because at the end of the day, it's not the mom and pops we are seeing  here.  We're seeing commercialized predatory companies that are trying to  commercialize our residential communities.  </p><p>BRENNAN:  Predatory seems like a strong word.  What do you mean by that?  </p><p>GELBER:  It is predatory, because it's not about a mom and pop or  grandmother wanting to bring in a college kid to make him chicken soup at  night.  It's people taking very nice properties, buying them, and turning  them into essentially a flophouse.  </p><p>BRENNAN:  Gelber, a former prosecutor and former state lawmaker, says  Airbnb and other $ home-sharing platforms must abide by the law.  </p><p>Have you spoken to Airbnb or any of the other companies that operate here?  </p><p>GELBER:  I've spoken to some of the representatives before I was elected.   I'd like to send them a message.  I'd like them to be corporately  responsible.  I'd like them to do the right thing.  </p><p>BRENNAN:  Why do you think they haven't done that?  </p><p>GELBER:  Look, these are not charities.  These home-sharing platforms, they  want to make money.  </p><p>BRENNAN:  In an interview at Airbnb's San Francisco headquarters, Chris  Lehane, the head of global policy, strongly defended the company's track  record.  </p><p>CHRIS LEHANE, AIRBNB HEAD OF GLOBAL POLICY:  I have yet to see a program  being run by any mayor, any elected official in this time of economic  inequality that's generating $6,100 for a typical middle class family, all  without the expenditure of a single taxpayer dollar.  That is what Airbnb  is about at its core, trying to use technology to create economic  empowerment.  </p><p>BRENNAN:  Should Airbnb responsible for what is in that market illegal  activity on the platform?  </p><p>LEHANE:  I think what seems to be a common sense solution for Miami Beach,  happy to do this if they want to sit down and have a constructive  conversation, is you can take that 35 percent of the city that's a  residential area, make that an exclusionary zone.  Allow the activity to be  able to take place in the 65 percent of the city that's actually explicitly  zoned for this type of activity.  </p><p>BRENNAN:  In the meantime, you have illegal listings on your site.  </p><p>LEHANE:  Well, first of all, I think if you actually look at the underlying  law in the city in Miami Beach, right, Miami Beach allows for this activity  to take place.  $20,000 fines on someone making their home available a few  times a year to actually help make ends meet?  It doesn't sound like they  want to make this work as well as possible for as many people as possible.  </p><p>BRENNAN:  The American Hotel and Lodging Association tells us that instead  of supporting common sense regulations, Airbnb has opted to deploy a  massive campaign of dirty tactics, deceptive messaging and personal attacks  against anyone who raises a concern.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Morgan Brennan.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  Whether it is Airbnb or booking.com or HomeAway, which is owned by  Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE), all of these companies have had clashes to varying  degrees with regulators in different cities.  Officials in many cities  across the country, whether it's Boston or Los Angeles or New York say  there are issues.  That said, Morgan found in her reporting, the company  brought up most frequently is Airbnb.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  Before we go, one more look at the day on Wall Street.  The Dow  fell 58 points today.  The Nasdaq was up nine.  The S&amp;P dropped by six.  </p><p>And for the week, all of the averages recorded gains.  </p><p>HERERA:  And that is NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for tonight.  I'm Sue Herera,  thanks for joining us.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  I'm Bill Griffeth, have a wonderful long weekend.  We will see  you Monday for a special edition of NBR.  But have a good night.  </p><p>END</p><p>Nightly Business Report transcripts and video are available on-line post  broadcast at <url normalizedValue=\"http://nbr.com\">http://nbr.com</url>.

Chrysler recalls nearly 5 million vehicles. The stock falls and it comes at the start of a busy holiday weekend on the road.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">BILL GRIFFETH, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR: A matter of trust. Amazon`s Alexa recorded and shared a couple`s conversation, raising privacy concerns about the growing smart device market.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">HERERA: \"Airbnb: Unwelcome Guests\". An investigative report inside the world of illegal short-term rentals and the tense battle with regulators.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Those stories and more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Friday, May 25th.</p><p>GRIFFETH: And we do bid you a good Friday evening, everybody. Welcome.</p><p>The timing could not be worse for Chrysler -- Fiat Chrysler. Ahead of a long weekend when millions of Americans are expected to hit the road, the automaker issued one of the largest recalls in American automotive history today. The company is warning owners to stop using their cruise control immediately because of a software defect in nearly 5 million vehicles. And that sent the stock lower in trading today.</p><p>And as Phil LeBeau reports right now, the recall also occurs just as the industry kicks off its summer selling season.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PHIL LEBEAU, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: It is one of the largest recalls ever, impacting some of the most popular models in the U.S., including the Jeep Grand Cherokee (NASDAQ:CHKE) and the Ram 1500 pickup. They are part of a recall covering 4.8 million Fiat Chrysler vehicles, 15 different models, covering the last five model years, with Jeep, Ram, Dodge and Chrysler brands all impacted.</p><p>The issue: a defect with the cruise control. In rare circumstances, drivers may not be able to turn off the cruise control unless they shift the vehicle into neutral and eventually park it. While Fiat Chrysler knows of no accidents or incidents with runaway cruise control, it is warning drivers not to use cruise control until the software can be updated. That warning comes as millions prepare for a road trip over the holiday weekend.</p><p>It`s also a huge weekend for people to buy a new car or truck. Whether the recall and headlines impact sales is too hard to tell. Under CEO Sergio Marchionne, Fiat Chrysler has more than doubled its U.S. sales in the last decade. Jeep and Ram have become hot brands with strong sales.</p><p>But overall, Fiat Chrysler`s track record in reliability and dependability studies has been lackluster.</p><p>It`s unclear how long it will take Fiat Chrysler to get the updated cruise control software to dealers and fix all of the recalled vehicles. But until the defect is corrected, drivers are being told to steer clear of cruise control.</p><p>Phil LeBeau, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Chicago.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: And as drivers hit the road this weekend, they`re also paying more for gas. A rise in crude oil prices and increased demand for gasoline has lifted the national average to nearly $3 a gallon. According to AAA, that`s up about 30 percent from a year ago.</p><p>GRIFFETH: And wouldn`t you know that oil prices went in the other direction today. Two influential oil ministers said some oil-producing nations could ease production limits that were put in place last year. Officials in Saudi Arabia and Russia say that there is a need to compensate for declining production in Venezuela and the anticipated export disruption from Iran.</p><p>So, the price of domestic crude settled lower by 4 percent today.</p><p>HERERA: On Wall Street, energy stocks followed oil prices lower. Exxon and Chevron (NYSE:CVX) were the two worst-performing stocks on the Dow today and geopolitical risks kept investors cautious ahead of the long weekend. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 58 to 24,753. The Nasdaq was up nine and the S&amp;P 500 dropped six. For the week, all of the averages recorded gains.</p><p>Mike Santoli takes a look at what might happen to stocks in the weeks ahead.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MIKE SANTOLI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Stocks are heading into summer stuck right in the middle of their 2018 range. And a swirl of opposing currents threatens to keep the market from making much progress as the weather heats up and the trading slows down. The S&amp;P 500 has had an eventful first five months of the year, but the net movement has been slight.</p><p>The index is up a bit less than 2 percent year to date and is almost exactly halfway between its late January peak and the February lows, just a bit more than 5 percent away from each extreme.</p><p>Seasonal factors suggest a choppy path into the summer with June being among the weaker months of the year. Historical record of midterm election years also points to nervous back-and-forth trading in the coming months. This would fit with the interplay of fundamental factors that have been driving stocks so far this year. Corporate profits are growing briskly and companies are buying back their shares aggressively.</p><p>Yet the threat of higher interest rates and questions over the durability of economic growth are constant. And while Wall Street has tuned out much of the drama from Washington, the jarring headlines on geopolitical flux, trade tensions, the Russia collusion investigation and a contentious congressional campaign might only become more intense. None of this suggests stocks are doomed to a summer of discontent. The market`s winter setback and springtime recovery acted as a sort of stress test to make stocks less expensive and turn investor expectations more realistic.</p><p>But the forces that have held the market in check for months continue to indicate that stocks might be in for a staycation, at least for the start of summer.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Mike Santoli.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH: To the economy now where orders for durable goods, those long- lasting items like computers and refrigerators, those orders fell last month. But much of that decline stemmed from fewer contracts for Boeing (NYSE:BA) planes. Otherwise, most businesses did report a modest improvement in equipment spending in April and again an overall rise in orders.</p><p>HERERA: The Trump administration has reportedly reached a deal that will allow the Chinese telecom company, ZTE, to remain in business. As first reported by \"The New York Times (NYSE:NYT),\" the White House told Congress that ZTE will pay a bigger fine, hire American compliance officers and shake up its management team. In exchange, the Commerce Department will lift an order under which that company had been cut off from American suppliers. It is unclear, however, how firm the reported deal is at this point.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Elsewhere, President Trump said today that the summit with North Korea is still possible, less than 24 hours after he sent a letter to Pyongyang cancelling next month`s talks. The president said that the two countries are talking again and he seemed to like the conciliatory tone of a statement issued by North Korea offering to meet any time.</p><p>So what`s next?</p><p>Eunice Yoon picks up the story from there from Beijing tonight.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>EUNICE YOON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: North Korea left the door ajar on rescheduling a summit. In a statement in the official KCNA news agency, the North Koreans describe President Trump`s decision as unexpected and said: We are willing to sit face-to-face to resolve problems at any time in any way.</p><p>I spoke to one diplomat here who follows North Korea who said that the language of the statement suggested that it came directly from Kim Jong-un. It used the words \"upon authorization\" which is code for Kim. He said the two are like a husband and wife who just got into an argument and we`re waiting to see who`s going to make the first move to kiss and make up.</p><p>There are few things, though, that don`t bode well for the optimists. The North Koreans said that solving the nuclear problem in a phased way would make the relations get better rather than making them get worse. This is not new, but it shows how North Korea wants to approach the nuclear issue in a step-by-step process. That happens to be very different from what the Trump administration wants, a front-loaded, verifiable denuclearization with major promises of economic relief. This is where the two are very far apart on how the process will work.</p><p>On top of that, North Korea said Trump`s decision has caused them to think over if they were truly right to have made efforts and opted for this new path. That raises questions as to whether or not North Korea will continue with its general outreach to the United States and South Korea.</p><p>There are also some interesting comments out of China. The foreign ministry reiterated today that the two sides should continue with their dialogue, but the more interesting comments were in response to questions about President Trump`s implied accusation that China is behind North Korea`s more hostile attitude. To this, the ministry said we have no secret intention.</p><p>And the ministry also dismissed the suggestion that China could use its relationship with North Korea as leverage in trade talks with the United States, saying: I would say you`re overthinking it.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Eunice Yoon in Beijing.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: It is time to take a look at some of today`s upgrades and downgrades.</p><p>Paypal`s rating was upgraded to buy from hold at Stifel Nicolaus. The analyst there cites its addition of new financial services and the global growing payments market. The price target is $99. The shares fell fractionally to $80.96.</p><p>Colgate-Palmolive`s rating was raised to buy from hold over at Argus Research. The analyst cites the potential for earnings growth given its strong focus on emerging markets. The price target is $72. The shares closed up 2 percent to $63.75.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Still ahead, the area of retail where there is still a lot of growth and where our market monitor says might be a good place to invest.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>HERERA: As we have been reporting, data privacy laws went into effect in the European Union today. It`s considered the biggest change to data privacy in 20 years. The rules give E.U. citizens more control over their personal data. Users will be able to know how their data is being used and users can also have their data erased.</p><p>Most analysts say the financial impact on big tech companies will be minimal, although smaller ones could face more of a challenge with increased regulatory expenses. But some American publishers are struggling with the new law. Sites like \"The L.A. Times\" and \"Chicago Tribune\" were taken down in European countries.</p><p>GRIFFETH: And another privacy debate is brewing, you`ve probably heard about this, over Amazon`s smart speaker Alexa, which one couple says secretly recorded their conversation and sent it to a random contact.</p><p>Aditi Roy has the details for us tonight.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ADITI ROY, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Amazon`s Alexa devices are in 40 million homes across the country. Their job: to always be listening for voice prompts.</p><p>But in what Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is calling an unlikely chain of events, an Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Echo device inside a home of a Portland, Oregon, couple accidentally recorded their private conversation and then sent the audio file to a phone contact. The story is unsettling to Echo customers, like Alyssa Chu (ph).</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: That`s not what I would intend it to be used for.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I`m pretty surprised. I mean, that sounds like a lot of mistakes to happen.</p><p>ROY: According to Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Echo woke up due to a word in background conversation sounding like Alexa. Then the subsequent conversation was heard as a send message request at which point Alexa said out loud, to whom? At which point, the background conversation was interpreted as a name in the customer`s contact list.</p><p>STEPHANIE MEHTA, FAST COMPANY EDITOR-IN-CHIEF: I think this will have ramifications for people`s trust level for Alexa and other in-home devices. The creepy factor on this is huge.</p><p>ROY: Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is already in a battle for market share in the home speaker category, and some industry watchers say an incident like this could tip the scales.</p><p>According to e-marketer, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) dominates two-thirds of that market now, but the market research group projects that lead will drop by 6 percent in two years, while products including the Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) Home will see a corresponding increase.</p><p>BOB O`DONNELL, TECHNALYSIS: This is the consumer privacy fear that everyone was afraid of when Alexa came into people`s houses.</p><p>ROY: On the other hand, other analysts say what happened to that Oregon couple is so unlikely that it won`t keep people from buying and using their Alexa devices.</p><p>GENE MUNSTER, LOUP VENTURES: I think it should be statistically about one in a million concern.</p><p>ROY: The company says it`s working to make sure it doesn`t happen again. And despite her disappointment over the incident, Chu says she`s not unplugging her Echo any time soon.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Probably still use it, just being more aware.</p><p>ROY: The case does bring up privacy concerns. The group consumer watchdog is already calling on Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) to have a dedicated internal privacy watchdog at the company.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Aditi Roy, San Francisco.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: A bit earlier this week, we ran a story about Amazon`s Alexa, teaming up with the home builder Lennar (NYSE:LEN). Lennar (NYSE:LEN) issued the following statement following the Alexa privacy story. Quote, with all -- as with all new technologies, this is a process of continued refinement, including the coexistence of things like security and privacy. That said, we have a lot of respect for Amazon`s technology, security and privacy capabilities. Homeowners can always remove their Alexa-enabled device if they choose, end quote.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Footlocker (NYSE:FL) raced past earnings expectations and that is where we begin tonight`s \"Market Focus\".</p><p>Strong demand for Nike (NYSE:NKE) and Adidas shoes helped the retail chain beat sales estimates by the most in at least two years. The company also benefited from its strategy to streamline its inventory. Shares soared by 20 percent to 55.74, making Footlocker (NYSE:FL) the best performing stock by far in the S&amp;P 500 today.</p><p>But it was a different story for sporting goods retailer Hibbett Sports (NASDAQ:HIBB). The company missed both earnings and revenue estimates in the most recent quarter. Strong online sales were not enough to offset a decline in comparable store sales. And as you might imagine, shares finished lower, the day down 15 percent to $24.43.</p><p>Meanwhile, a drop in same-store sales caused revenue to miss forecasts at clothing retailer Buckle (NYSE:BKE). Net income did rise and those results beat street targets. Shares, though, fell nearly 2 percent today to $25.25.</p><p>HERERA: One of AstraZeneca`s cancer drugs showed promising results in a study. The pharmaceutical company said its immunotherapy medication improved overall survival in lung cancer patients who were given that treatment. The drug is already approved in the U.S. to treat a certain type of non-small cell lung cancer. Shares of AstraZeneca were up a fraction to $37.04.</p><p>Herbalife`s largest investor is reducing his position. A securities filing revealed that billionaire investor Carl Icahn is cutting his stake in the nutrition and weight loss company simply because his investment has become too large. Icahn added that he still believes in the business and sees strong performance ahead. Herbalife (NYSE:HLF) shares fell 9-1/2 percent to $48.70.</p><p>And a federal court late last night handed Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) a legal victory against its rival, Samsung. Samsung has been ordered to pay Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) $500 million in damages for illegally copying patented smartphone features. The two companies have been involved in this patent lawsuit since 2011. Shares of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) were up a tick to $188.58. Samsung trades in South Korea.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Tonight`s market monitor says he is finding opportunities in online retail stocks. He expects online retail companies to account for 20 percent of all U.S. retail sales within five years. Right now, that figure sits just below 10 percent.</p><p>This is his first time as our market monitor. He is Christian Magoon, founder and CEO of Amplify ETFs.</p><p>Christian, good to see you again. Thank you for joining us tonight.</p><p>CHRISTIAN MAGOON, AMPLIFY ETFS CEO: Good to see you as well. Thanks.</p><p>GRIFFETH: We`re going to talk about three companies here. You see, what, 20 percent by the end of the year. What`s going to be the catalyst for those gains, do you think?</p><p>MAGOON: Well, most of the catalyst for online retail stocks is really growth in sales and market share, but then overall growth in online retail sales. Right now, online retail sales are growing 16 percent year over year, whereas department store sales are actually shrinking.</p><p>So, they`re in a sweet spot where they`re carving out market share from brick and mortar, but also increasing their customer penetration rate.</p><p>HERERA: And you point out that it`s not just Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). A lot of people think of online shopping as simply, you know, they always go to Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), but you picked three stocks that you think are very interesting niche plays.</p><p>Etsy is your first pick. Why do you like it?</p><p>MAGOON: Yes, so this is an online platform for handmade and vintage goods. We think it`s a very unique platform to get -- to buy things that really have an experience with them. They`re not just something you`d find in a typical brick and mortar store. They`re very unique.</p><p>And this could be an interesting play for a merger or acquisition, whether it`s a brick and mortar company trying to get their toe wet in online retail and buying a platform like Etsy or somebody already in the retail space trying to expand into this handmade and vintage item area.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Then there`s a company in a very competitive part of the online world in food and meal delivery, you`re talking about Grubhub here.</p><p>MAGOON: Yes, Grubhub is definitely in competition with companies like Uber Eats, for example. But they have some strategic advantages. One is this recent exclusive deal they signed with Yum Brands (NYSE:YUM) to exclusively deliver KFC, Pizza Hut, Taco Bell, et cetera.</p><p>They`re becoming kind of the largest entity in the U.S., but it`s a competitive space -- it`s a competitive space, Bill, and it will be interesting to see what happens in this marketplace. But we see it going higher over the course of the year.</p><p>HERERA: And let`s finish up with Carvana. I was stunned with the amount of revenue growth this company has, up 127 percent year over year. That`s obviously one of the reasons why you like it.</p><p>MAGOON: That`s right. It goes hand in hand with their car sales. So, they sold over 18,000 cars, pre-owned cars last quarter. That was the growth of about 127 percent year over year. They`re building this online platform to buy, inspect, finance pre-owned cars.</p><p>And that`s becoming a growing area here in the U.S. They`re national and we think they can continue to improve. Their big challenge is they`re still not profitable yet, unlike the other two stocks that we spoke about.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Well, that`s certainly a big growth area, that`s for sure in online retail.</p><p>Christian, thanks for joining us. Appreciate it very much.</p><p>MAGOON: Thanks, Bill.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Christian Magoon with Amplify ETFs.</p><p>And to read more about his picks, you can head to our Website at NBR.com.</p><p>HERERA: Coming up, a months-long exclusive investigation into the emerging battle between illegal short-term rentals and the law.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GRIFFETH: Here is what to watch next week on Wednesday. The second estimate for first quarter GDP will be out. Also on Wednesday, the Fed will publish its Beige Book, the anecdotal look at the economic conditions across the country. And then on Friday, the all-important jobs report for the month of May will be on tap first thing in the morning. That`s what we`re watching for next week.</p><p>HERERA: An emerging turf battle is under way between cities and upstart tech companies like Airbnb, for example, that have been capitalizing on the Wild West landscape of the share economy. Valued at $31 billion, the company is currently worth more than most of its publicly traded hotel rivals. But gigantic growth means some big growing pains as well.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Indeed. \"Airbnb: Unwelcome Guests\". That`s a CNBC investigation into that clash between illegal short-term rentals and restrictive regulations.</p><p>Airbnb says it has worked with cities around the world to craft reasonable regulations, but not in Miami Beach, where the fight has no end in sight.</p><p>Morgan Brennan has our special report for us tonight.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MORGAN BRENNAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: It`s 9:00 on a Saturday night and we`re riding along with Miami Beach code compliance, on the lookout for illegal short-term rentals.</p><p>And what are you looking for tonight?</p><p>VIJMA MAHARAJ, MIAMI BEACH CODE COMPLIANCE: Hopefully, we can establish contact if it`s occupied and determine whether it`s a violation or not.</p><p>BRENNAN: Code compliance officer Vijma Maharaj has seen it all. Large noisy late-night parties in residential neighborhoods, commercial video shoots with scantily clad women in a home investigated for short term rental claims, and unwitting tourists who say they unknowingly booked Airbnbs in prohibited areas.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: You shouldn`t be able to do this. This is messed up.</p><p>BRENNAN: All captured on body camera videos recorded over the past two years.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Hello.</p><p>BRENNAN: Some are so blatant as these house rules show what to do if someone asks. They`re told to lie by saying they`re a friend and certainly don`t mention they rent this place.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: You`re not allowed to rent this house for less than six months and one day.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Everybody has to leave.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: This party needs to clear up.</p><p>BRENNAN: At a loud party in Millbrae, California, in the San Francisco Bay Area, shots rang out.</p><p>Guests seen on surveillance cameras running down the street. Airbnb says it has zero tolerance for this type of behavior and permanently banned the guests. Airbnb says these incidents don`t represent the overwhelming number of satisfied hosts and guests in 8,100 cities and 191 countries. And it has successfully worked with lawmakers around the world.</p><p>Back on the streets of Miami Beach, it`s not long before we roll up on a group of vacationers. The building has telltale signs of an illegal rental. Two of the units advertised on Airbnb have lockboxes and key pads.</p><p>Do you live there?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We do.</p><p>BRENNAN: How long have you been living there?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Actually, we just rented with Airbnb.</p><p>BRENNAN: Are you guys surprised to hear that it`s not legal here?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Actually, yes, because, I mean, it`s something that`s, you know, it`s just out there for people.</p><p>DAN GELBER, MIAMI BEACH MAYOR: You would say when you hear that story --</p><p>BRENNAN: To Miami Beach Mayor Dan Gelber, the issue is clear cut.</p><p>GELBER: They may work in some places but they really don`t work here, because at the end of the day, it`s not the mom and pops we are seeing here. We`re seeing commercialized predatory companies that are trying to commercialize our residential communities.</p><p>BRENNAN: Predatory seems like a strong word. What do you mean by that?</p><p>GELBER: It is predatory, because it`s not about a mom and pop or grandmother wanting to bring in a college kid to make him chicken soup at night. It`s people taking very nice properties, buying them, and turning them into essentially a flophouse.</p><p>BRENNAN: Gelber, a former prosecutor and former state lawmaker, says Airbnb and other $ home-sharing platforms must abide by the law.</p><p>Have you spoken to Airbnb or any of the other companies that operate here?</p><p>GELBER: I`ve spoken to some of the representatives before I was elected. I`d like to send them a message. I`d like them to be corporately responsible. I`d like them to do the right thing.</p><p>BRENNAN: Why do you think they haven`t done that?</p><p>GELBER: Look, these are not charities. These home-sharing platforms, they want to make money.</p><p>BRENNAN: In an interview at Airbnb`s San Francisco headquarters, Chris Lehane, the head of global policy, strongly defended the company`s track record.</p><p>CHRIS LEHANE, AIRBNB HEAD OF GLOBAL POLICY: I have yet to see a program being run by any mayor, any elected official in this time of economic inequality that`s generating $6,100 for a typical middle class family, all without the expenditure of a single taxpayer dollar. That is what Airbnb is about at its core, trying to use technology to create economic empowerment.</p><p>BRENNAN: Should Airbnb responsible for what is in that market illegal activity on the platform?</p><p>LEHANE: I think what seems to be a common sense solution for Miami Beach, happy to do this if they want to sit down and have a constructive conversation, is you can take that 35 percent of the city that`s a residential area, make that an exclusionary zone. Allow the activity to be able to take place in the 65 percent of the city that`s actually explicitly zoned for this type of activity.</p><p>BRENNAN: In the meantime, you have illegal listings on your site.</p><p>LEHANE: Well, first of all, I think if you actually look at the underlying law in the city in Miami Beach, right, Miami Beach allows for this activity to take place. $20,000 fines on someone making their home available a few times a year to actually help make ends meet? It doesn`t sound like they want to make this work as well as possible for as many people as possible.</p><p>BRENNAN: The American Hotel and Lodging Association tells us that instead of supporting common sense regulations, Airbnb has opted to deploy a massive campaign of dirty tactics, deceptive messaging and personal attacks against anyone who raises a concern.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Morgan Brennan.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: Whether it is Airbnb or booking.com or HomeAway, which is owned by Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE), all of these companies have had clashes to varying degrees with regulators in different cities. Officials in many cities across the country, whether it`s Boston or Los Angeles or New York say there are issues. That said, Morgan found in her reporting, the company brought up most frequently is Airbnb.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Before we go, one more look at the day on Wall Street. The Dow fell 58 points today. The Nasdaq was up nine. The S&amp;P dropped by six.</p><p>And for the week, all of the averages recorded gains.</p><p>HERERA: And that is NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for tonight. I`m Sue Herera, thanks for joining us.</p><p>GRIFFETH: I`m Bill Griffeth, have a wonderful long weekend. We will see you Monday for a special edition of NBR.

The Dow  soars more than 300 points as the bulls beat back the bears for control of  this market.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SUE HERERA, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR:  Major obstacles.  Why some of  America's most beloved consumer brands are now attached to Wall Street's  most hated stocks.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">GRIFFETH:  Private eye.  The new role investigators are now playing in  boardrooms across the country.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Those stories and much more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for this  Wednesday, May 30th.  </p><p>HERERA:  Good evening, everybody.  And welcome.  </p><p>What a difference a day makes.  Stocks rocketed higher at the opening bell  and really never looked back, recovering much of yesterday's losses.  Bank  stocks rallied, energy shared soared and small caps hit a record, as  investor concerned over a political crisis in Italy faded.  </p><p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 306 points to 24,667, the Nasdaq  was up 65, and the S&amp;P 500 rose 34.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  Oil prices also gained ground, notching their first gain in six  sessions.  A report that OPEC will keep crude production curbs in place at  least until the end of this year helped reverse the commodity's recent  slide on fears about higher production.  Domestic crude rose about 2  percent today, settling above $68 a barrel.  </p><p>HERERA:  Oil prices may have ended higher today, but they're down about 5  percent for the week.  And the rise in rates that we've been telling you  about have also begun to cool.  So, does this quickly-changing narrative  signal a pause or a fundamental shift in the market?  </p><p>Joining us to offer his insights is Sandy Villere, portfolio manager of the  Villere Balanced Fund.  </p><p>Welcome back, Sandy.  Nice to see you again.</p><p>SANDY VILLERE, VILLERE BALANCED FUND PORTFOLIO MANAGER:  Thanks, Sue.</p><p>HERERA:  So, which is it -- is it a pause in an overall upside trajectory  or is it a fundamental shift in the way the market is valuing things?  </p><p>VILLERE:  Now, I think it is a pause.  You remember we started the year at  246 on the 10-year.  We went all the way up to 312.  Now we're back to 285  on the ten-year.  </p><p>So, I think that that's a little bit of a pullback but I think rates as the  Fed continues to raise this year are going to put upward pressure on  interest rates.  I think you're seeing that play out in the market, you're  seeing that with small caps, up about 7-1/2 percent year to date, that tend  to do better in a rising interest rate environment versus large caps, like  the S&amp;P, that's only up about 1-1/2 percent this year.</p><p>Remember, the larger cap multinationals in the S&amp;P tend to export more  expensive good and services.  So when interest rates go up, the dollar goes  up which again favors small caps.  So, I think small caps can be the place  to be for the rest of 2018.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  But, you know, there is a huge difference between investing in a  rising interest rate environment and a declining interest rate environment.   So, especially if you're investing for income.  So, what's an investor who  is looking for income to do right now do you think?  </p><p>VILLERE:  That's a very tough question right now because if you look at, if  you look at the 10-year and it was right around, let's say it's when right  around 3 percent, that's one scenario.  And then you have, on the other  hand, some good income stocks, such as Procter &amp; Gamble (NYSE:PG) and Kraft  (NYSE:KFT) Heinz, these are all are paying 3 percent dividend yields.  But  what you see in 2018 is investors now shifting as rates have come up -- as  bond rates have come up from the Procter &amp; Gambles of the world to bonds.  </p><p>And so, I think, you know, Procter &amp; Gamble (NYSE:PG) is down about 25  percent year to date.  So, I would -- I would have some exposure to stocks  and bonds such as in my balance fund where it's about 70-30 stocks to  bonds.  </p><p>HERERA:  On that note, thanks for the advice, Sandy.  We appreciate it.   Sandy Villere with the Villere Balanced Fund.</p><p>VILLERE:  Thanks, Sue.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  Well, one issue that still gets the market's attention is trade.   And as we reported yesterday, the White House has revived its plan --  revived its plan to move ahead with tariffs on some Chinese goods.  </p><p>And as Eunice Yoon reports for us now, the response from Beijing was swift  and it was sharp.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>EUNICE YOON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  President Trump's  decision on tariffs isn't going down very well in China.  Soon after the  White House issued a statement, the commerce ministry responded, saying, we  are surprised by the strategic statement released by the White House.  At  the same time, it's half expected.  </p><p>And today, the foreign ministry said, an international relationships every  time you change, every time you break a promise, the country's credibility  is damaged.  Officially, both ministries said that China wants the U.S. to  meet them halfway in the spirit of the joint statement.  However, I spoke  with one official on the Chinese side who's familiar with the trade talks  and he said that the most important thing that the U.S. and China need to  do is establish mutual trust, but that this latest move isn't helping.  </p><p>The Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross will be visiting China this weekend to  continue trade talks.  Advanced teams are here in Beijing to work out the  details.  The official said that the Trump administration strategy appears  to be to pressure the Chinese.  </p><p>As for whether China will retaliate, the foreign ministry commented on  that, saying China doesn't want a trade war, but we won't hide from one.   If the U.S. insists on being reckless, China will firmly take action to  safeguard its legitimate interests.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Eunice Yoon in Beijing.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  Meantime, a trade deadline looms with the European Union, another  key trading partner.  Tariffs on steel and aluminum imports are scheduled  to take effect on Friday.  And there are reports tonight that the U.S. will  impose those import tariffs, and it comes as trade officials met on the  sideline of the OECD meeting in Paris.  </p><p>Joumanna Bercetche is there.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JOUMANNA BERCETCHE, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  We're at the  OECD forum in Paris, where today, the OECD released their updated economic  projections for the world economy, showing a growth rebounding to 3.9  percent.  </p><p>Now, this is the strongest period of growth the world economy has  experienced in years.  However, they have cited some clouds on the horizon,  some rifts that policymakers need to be mindful of.  And one of them was  trade wars.  </p><p>Now, this is coming at a very interesting time for Europe because on June  the 1st, the temporary tariff exemptions that were applied from the U.S. on  E.U. imports are set to expire and the expectation is that they may not be  renewed.  Now, on the sidelines of this meeting, we know that Cecilia  Malmstrom, who is the European trade commissioner, also met with her  counterpart, the U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, and did have  discussions.  However, neither one of them have commented on what the final  tariff decision is going to look like.  </p><p>But in remarks earlier today, Mr. Ross did say that the E.U. is the only  trading partner that has said they will not be willing to engage in  discussions so long as tariffs do end up getting applied.  Now, of course,  all of this comes at a time when policymakers have been discussing next  steps on multilateralism and how to improve to multilateralism to make it  more inclusive and to make it more fair.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Joumanna Bercetche, in Paris, France.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Meanwhile, economic growth was revised slightly lower here for  the first quarter of the year.  In its latest revision, the government said  this morning that the economy grew at a 2.2 percent annual rate between  January and March, down from the previous estimate of 2.3 percent.  </p><p>Economists say that businesses and consumers slowed their spending it's  had, but most are expected to see a solid rebound during this current  quarter.  </p><p>HERERA:  U.S. businesses added to their payrolls in May.  According to the  latest ADP survey, private payrolls grew by 178,000, thanks to strong  hiring in construction, education and health care.  That report suggests  that the job market remains healthy, but might be slowing just slightly as  the pool of available workers dwindles.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  The Federal Reserve is refining a rule that governs trading at  bank.  The central bank is proposing a change to the so-called Volcker rule  that makes it less of a one-size-fits-all.  The move would replace -- it  would place the greatest restrictions on banks that do the most trading.   Banks that do less trading would face fewer regulations.  </p><p>This rule, which is, as you know, a part of the Dodd-Frank banking law that  was adopted after the financial crisis, has often been criticized by Wall  Street as being too onerous and harmful to the functioning of the markets.  </p><p>HERERA:  Well, the latest survey from the Federal Reserve casts an upbeat  view on the economy.  The Fed's Beige Book which is an anecdotal look at  the economy across the country points to a moderate pickup in activity this  spring.  </p><p>Hampton Pearson has more.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HAMPTON PEARSON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  The latest Federal  Reserve snapshot, the Beige Book, finds economic activity expanded  moderately in late April and early May.  Manufacturing really leading the  way, shifting into high gear with more than half the districts reporting a  pickup and one-third classifying activity as strong.  </p><p>However, on the other side, overall consumer spending was characterized as  soft.  And there were also some contacts from around the country, nothing  uncertainty about international trade policy.  </p><p>All in all, it's part of what economists see as a mixed economy with some  concerns on the horizon.  </p><p>BILL STONE, STONE INVESTMENT PARTNERS:  The good news is the Fed probably  doesn't have to move super fast to raise rates.  Now, they're going to  almost surely raise rates in June, but of course, if they go too fast,  that's when the market gets nervous.  </p><p>PEARSON:  But it's still all about labor markets.  They remain tight across  the country with reports of difficulties filling jobs across a variety of  skill levels, shortages of qualified workers, including truck drivers,  carpenters, electricians, even information technology professionals.  Of  course, many firms responding to those talent shortages by increasing wages  and compensation packages.  </p><p>But, however, the Fed still says overall wage pressures in the aggregate  remain modest.  That's leading economists to see no alarm bells for the Fed  when it comes to future monetary policy.  </p><p>JOHN STOLTZFUS, OPPENHEIMER ASSET MGMT:  Wage growth has been extremely  modest relative to other times when we've had economic expansion post a  crisis and recovery period.  </p><p>PEARSON:  The next and perhaps most important economic barometer, just two  days away, the all-important jobs report from the Labor Department on  Friday.  </p><p>Hampton Pearson, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, at the Federal Reserve.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Time to take a look now at some of today's upgrades and  downgrades.  </p><p>Dow component Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) was downgraded to hold from buy at Maxim  Group.  The analyst there calls the optimism over Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s  services business overblown and says the company's subscription business  will disappoint investors.  Price target now $200.  That stock fell a  fraction to $187.50.  </p><p>Fellow Dow component ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) saw its ratings raised to  outperform from sector perform at RBC Capital Markets.  The analyst cites  the acceleration of the company's investments in new energy products.  The  price target: $100.  The stock rose nearly 4 percent today to $81.50.  </p><p>HERERA:  AK Steel was downgraded to sell from neutral over at Goldman Sachs  (NYSE:GS).  The analyst there cites increased competition with the  automotive business.  The price target is $4.  The stock closed just above  that level at $4.58.  </p><p>Target (NYSE:TGT) was added to Bank of America (NYSE:BAC)'s top ideas list.   The analyst says the retailer will benefit from aging demographics.  The  price target is $86.  And the stock rose more than 2 percent to $73.47.  </p><p>Still ahead, the future of the media industry according to those who run  it.  </p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>HERERA:  \"Consumer Reports\" reverses its recent decision and will now  recommend the Tesla Model 3.  The recent update improved the car's braking  distance by almost 20 feet.  The Model 3 braking performance prevented the  car from initially getting a \"Consumer Reports\" recommendation.  But  today's move helped lift Tesla's shares nearly 3 percent to finish the  trading day on the upside.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  There is a new perk for Walmart employees.  The retailer is now  offering pay for its workers to go back to school, as long as they get  degrees in business or supply chain management.  </p><p>The country's largest private employer is partnering with three  universities to offer these degrees to nearly 1.5 million part-time and  full-time employees.  As the labor market tightens, Walmart clearly is  hoping that the program will keep those employees at the company.  The  benefit was announced today at the start of Walmart's annual shareholder  meeting.  </p><p>HERERA:  At Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) shareholder meeting, CEO Jeff Bezos  acknowledged that the company has come under intense scrutiny this past  year and that more scrutiny is expected as the company grows.  Protesters  gathered outside the meeting, pushing for the appointment of an independent  director to the board.  A shareholder proposal to split the CEO and board  chair positions failed.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  Twenty-First Century Fox shareholders are going to vote on the  proposed merger with Disney (NYSE:DIS) on July 10th.  That puts pressure on  Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) (NYSE:CCS) to make a formal offer for Fox's assets.   That deal and the future of the fast-changing industry was just one of the  topics at the Code Conference, which brings together the biggest players in  the business.  </p><p>Julia Boorstin is there for us tonight.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JULIA BOORSTIN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  With leaders, the  biggest media and tech companies taking the stage at the Code Conference.   And a range of media megadeals pending, the question of why there's  pressure to consolidate loomed large.  </p><p>Twenty-First Century Fox CEO James Murdoch saying they see so much  opportunity in having greater scale.  When pressed on Comcast  (NASDAQ:CMCSA) (NYSE:CCS)'s plan to make a higher bid for Fox than Disney  (NYSE:DIS), he focused on progress on Disney (NYSE:DIS)'s acquisition.  </p><p>JAMES MURDOCH, 21ST CENTURY FOX CEO:  Essentially, we had an agreement with  Disney (NYSE:DIS) and we have an agreement with Disney (NYSE:DIS) which we  find very attractive for our shareholders.  It's an all stock agreement.   We think the prospects for the new firm are very strong.  </p><p>And we think from a regulatory perspective and we thought as well in  December from a regulatory perspective, that you have a higher certainty of  close.  So, when you weigh up all of those factors, that's really what we  thought was the right thing to do.  Now, whether or not -- whether or not  the board is asked to consider a different offer from somebody else in the  future, we'll deal with that as we go.  </p><p>BOORSTIN: With AT&amp;T (NYSE:T) awaiting a judge's ruling on whether it will  be able to buy Time Warner (NYSE:TWX), AT&amp;T (NYSE:T) CEO Randall Stephenson  saying consolidation is inevitable.  </p><p>RANDALL STEPHENSON, CHAIRMAN AND CEO, AT&amp;T (NYSE:T):  Nobody knows what the  future is going to look like five or six years from now, but I think the  bet most people are making is, premium content is going to be very, very  relevant five or six years from now.  A lot of bandwidth is going to be  required to make all that happen and there are going to be new kind of  business models surrounding this, particularly as it relates to ad-driven  type business models.  </p><p>BOORSTIN:  With AT&amp;T (NYSE:T) looking to grow, it feels pressure from big  tech.  One of those big tech companies, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), is feeling  the heat here at the Code Conference.  </p><p>Fox CEO James Murdoch criticizing Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) ads and how it's  been used as a platform for manipulation.  Snap CEO Evan Spiegel took a dig  at Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) for copying its features but not for copying its  more stringent data protection policy.  </p><p>EVAN SPIEGEL, SNAP CO-FOUNDER &amp; CEO:  What they've done is they changed  their products and I think they've actually changed their mission, right?   But I think fundamentally, they're having a really hard time changing the  DNA of their campaign.  </p><p>And the DNA of their company is all about having people compete with each  other online for attention.  </p><p>BOORSTIN:  Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) COO Sheryl Sandberg on stage with CTO Mike  Schroepfer responding by saying they're taking responsibility and investing  big, even though it will hurt their bottom line, to make sure this doesn't  happen again.  </p><p>SHERYL SANDBERG, COO, FACEBOOK:  We can get better, we can be more  transparent.  We can put a lot more resources and a lot more thought with  technology automation and people.  </p><p>BOORSTIN:  Sandberg and Schroepfer also talking about all the changes  they've made in the past two months and the ways they're complying with new  European privacy regulations.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Julia Boorstin in Rancho Palos Verdes,  California.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  Sales impressed at Dick's Sporting Goods, and that's where we  begin tonight's \"Market Focus\".  </p><p>The retailer reported stronger than expected earnings and revenue, quelling  fears that business performance would be impacted by the company's decision  to stop selling guns.  In fact, Dick's said it thinks new customer visits  have increased as a result of that policy.  The company also raised its  earnings guidance for the full year and the shares jumped nearly 26 percent  to $38.35.  </p><p>Michael Kors has reported earnings that topped expectations.  But the  handbag maker's full year profit outlook sparked some concerns.  The  company said increased investment in its Jimmy Choo brand would be cutting  into earnings growth in 2018.  So, the share sold off, down more than 11  percent to $60.41.  </p><p>And DSW (NYSE:DSW) grew its sales and improved its margins in the latest  quarter.  The shoe retailer also said it launched a new loyalty program  that it hopes will generate additional growth.  The company didn't update  its earnings guidance specifically for the year, however.  And that  disappointed some investors.  DSW (NYSE:DSW) shares finished down more than  5 percent to $24.61.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  Watch maker Movado said that strong demand for many of its  brands helped overall sales edged past expectations.  The company added  that e-commerce performance was a bright spot for the company in the  quarter.  Movado also raised its four-year earnings forecast.  Shares  ticked higher by 16 percent today to finish the day at $49.20.  </p><p>And after the bell tonight, cloud software company Box reported a narrower  than expected loss and higher revenue.  The company also gave guidance for  the current quarter that was ahead of street estimates.  But still, shares  initially traded lower in the extended session, erasing a more than 1  percent gain that we saw when shares ended the regulation session at  $27.78.</p><p>HERERA:  Big consumer brands are facing unprecedented challenges.  We've  been telling you about familiar names, most recently, Campbell's Soup, that  are seeing sales slide as they struggle to keep up with changing consumer  taste.  </p><p>Tonight, Sara Eisen takes a closer look at the stumbles that have put these  well-known companies on the defensive.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SARA EISEN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Many of America's best  known brands are hurting, from Playtex to Palmolive, Cheerios to Velveeta,  they're facing real questions about how to stay relevant.  </p><p>Take Campbell's Soup, which is now in the middle of a strategic review  after the abrupt retirement of its CEO Denise Morrison.  It represents a  lot of what's going wrong at consumer companies, like missing key insights  about their customers, such as shift to eating soup as an appetizer instead  of a main course.  The company didn't innovate enough to address the  change, according to industry insiders.  </p><p>Other companies have tried to catch up by buying successful smaller brands  that are growing, like General Mills (NYSE:GIS) buying Annie's, known for  its organic mac and cheese, or Campbell's Soup buying Bolthouse healthy  drinks.</p><p>But they haven't managed to learn from their acquisitions.  Instead of  integrating the startup cultures into their existing products and  processes, the companies have absorbed the startups into their existing  bureaucratic cultures.  They also haven't been able to hold onto top talent  and founders after a few years of a transition, missing the opportunity to  have successful entrepreneurs who founded disruptive startups.</p><p>And the problem is bigger than just losing touch with their customers.  The  big brands are also getting squeezed by a war between retailers with Amazon  (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s Whole Foods, Kroger (NYSE:KR), Walmart, all slashing prices  to compete, squeezing food margins.  </p><p>But some venerable brands are managing to change with the times.  Conagra,  for instance, has managed to revitalize its frozen food business.  </p><p>KEN GOLDMAN, J.P. MORGAN SENIOR EQUITY ANALYST:  Think about what frozen  entrees were ten years ago, you still call them TV dinners half the time.   Now, look at around, you'll see these power bowls.  Bowls themselves are  made up of biodegradable material.  Companies like Conagra have done a  terrific job of making those brands more relevant.  </p><p>EISEN:  Estee Lauder, Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) and Unilever (NYSE:UN), according  to analyst Ali Dibadj of Bernstein have all managed to stay relevant with  the consumer as well, and have done a better job integrating acquisitions  and learning from them.  </p><p>Unless companies start to adjust, this is a group that experts say could  feel more market pain, see big deals to cut costs and spin off brands and  many will be holding onto the past.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Sara Eisen.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Now, as a result of those missteps, investors no longer love  consumer staple stocks.  They're turning their backs on this once popular  sector.  </p><p>And Mike Santoli has more for us on that tonight.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MIKE SANTOLI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Shares of the biggest  food and household product makers once considered safe and stable blue  chips are among the worst performers this year.  Campbell Soup (NYSE:CPB  (NYSE:CPF)), General Mills (NYSE:GIS) and Kraft (NYSE:KFT) Heinz are down  more than 20 percent in 2018, compared to slight gains for the broad  market.  Only a small minority of analysts are recommending most of these  stocks, worried that recent declines in sales will only worsen as their  commodity costs rise and younger shoppers shun traditional supermarket  brands in favor of trendier, more natural offerings.</p><p>Just two years ago, these consumer staple stocks were favorites of  investors, coveted for their generous dividends compared to a low bond  yields, and cherished for their resilience in a slow growing economy.   Today, the focus is on a humming U.S. economy and companies managing to  grow profits rapidly.  </p><p>This leaves a value minded investor with the question of whether these  stocks have become cheap and neglected enough to represent bargains.  Based  on projected earnings for the coming year, Campbell's, General Mills  (NYSE:GIS), and Kellogg (NYSE:K)'s have not be this inexpensive relative to  the broad market for more than 15 years.  Procter and Gamble and Clorox  (NYSE:CLX) are cheaper than they've been in more than seven years on the  same basis.  </p><p>Looking cheap is no guarantee that the pain is over for investors in these  stocks, of course.  Buying them now is a bet that companies can freshen  their brands to win over younger customers or improve results to mergers  and acquisitions.  And correct or not, that's a bet the Wall Street crowd  is increasingly unwilling to make.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Mike Santoli.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  Coming up, executive search takes on a whole new meaning now that  private investigators are involved.  </p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Sir Martin Sorrell is starting a new venture, the founder and  former CEO of WPP (NASDAQ:WPPGY), has taken control of a shell company in  London with the hopes now of transforming it into a new marketing services  business.  Now, that's the same strategy that he used years ago to build  WPP (NASDAQ:WPPGY), the company from which he resigned abruptly just six  weeks ago.  That departure occurred during an internal company  investigation.  The results have yet to be disclosed.  </p><p>HERERA:  And there is a new player in corporate board rooms, the private  investigator.  They're being used to look into executives' past and by  doing so, they are altering the future of some companies.  </p><p>Leslie Picker explains.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>LESLIE PICKER, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  In the Me Too era,  allegations of predatory behavior bankrupted Harvey Weinstein's company and  forced out Wynn founder Steve Wynn, sending the stock on a rollercoaster  ride.  The stakes are high for corporations failing to root out sexual  harassment.  So, they've turned in droves to private investigators.  </p><p>DAN NARDELLO, NARDELLO &amp; CO. CEO:  An ounce of prevention really is worth a  pound of cure here, because the cost both in terms of potential drop in  stock price, legal and pr costs, possibility of the regulators getting  involved, they're enormous compared with the relatively modest expenditure  in hiring folks like us to -- in order to rule out this behavior.  </p><p>PICKER:  Nardello, a private investigator for 25 years, he says he's seen  about 35 percent more client calls related to sexual misconduct over the  last six months.  </p><p>NARDELLO:  I have never seen a societal phenomenon that has had the impact  on our business as the Me Too movement and the post-Weinstein world.  </p><p>PICKER:  He says corporations and private equity firms are looking for help  in due diligence ahead of acquisitions.  He's also looking into the  background of potential board members and C-suite hires.  And some clients  are seeking possibly predatory behavior in competitors, a move that one of  his clients calls weaponizing feminism.  </p><p>Nardello often gets work through lawyers like Ed Little who recently sought  help clearing the name of a client who had been accused of sexual  misconduct.  </p><p>ED LITTLE, HUGHES HUBBARD PARTNER:  The Me Too movement is a very valid  movement, but there's been overreaction, we believe.  And so, in  representing somebody who's been accused, it's important to find out  whether or not there's any credibility to the accusations.  </p><p>PICKER:  Nardello's number two, Sabina Menschel, walked me through their  client offerings, starting with online searches.  </p><p>SABINA MENSCHEL, NARDELLO &amp; CO. COO:  Databases like these that we have  access to, some of which because we're pretty investigators and they allow  us to search for publicly available information.  But we always complement  that as well with what we call on-site searches.  </p><p>PICKER:  Menschel says on-site searches include sending investigators to  where the subject has lived or worked, searching local databases like  county court records and knocking on doors to interview neighbors and  friends.  </p><p>And the work is making a difference.  Nardello says he's seen private  equity firms walk away from deals and companies decide against hiring  individuals after discovering sexual misconduct.  </p><p>Despite the wave of allegations of predatory behavior during the Me Too  movement, Nardello says we may have only seen the tip of the iceberg.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Leslie Picker.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Before we go, one more look at today's rally on Wall Street.   The Dow was up 306 points, Nasdaq up 65, the S&amp;P up 34.  </p><p>HERERA:  And that does it for us tonight.  I'm Sue Herera.  Thanks for  joining us.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  I'm Bill Griffeth.

A report that OPEC will keep crude production curbs in place at  least until the end of this year helped reverse the commodity's recent  slide on fears about higher production.  Domestic crude rose about 2  percent today, settling above $68 a barrel.  </p><p>HERERA:  Oil prices may have ended higher today, but they're down about 5  percent for the week.  And the rise in rates that we've been telling you  about have also begun to cool.  So, does this quickly-changing narrative  signal a pause or a fundamental shift in the market?  </p><p>Joining us to offer his insights is Sandy Villere, portfolio manager of the  Villere Balanced Fund.  </p><p>Welcome back, Sandy.  Nice to see you again.</p><p>SANDY VILLERE, VILLERE BALANCED FUND PORTFOLIO MANAGER:  Thanks, Sue.</p><p>HERERA:  So, which is it -- is it a pause in an overall upside trajectory  or is it a fundamental shift in the way the market is valuing things?  </p><p>VILLERE:  Now, I think it is a pause.  You remember we started the year at  246 on the 10-year.  We went all the way up to 312.  Now we're back to 285  on the ten-year.  </p><p>So, I think that that's a little bit of a pullback but I think rates as the  Fed continues to raise this year are going to put upward pressure on  interest rates.  I think you're seeing that play out in the market, you're  seeing that with small caps, up about 7-1/2 percent year to date, that tend  to do better in a rising interest rate environment versus large caps, like  the S&amp;P, that's only up about 1-1/2 percent this year.</p><p>Remember, the larger cap multinationals in the S&amp;P tend to export more  expensive good and services.  So when interest rates go up, the dollar goes  up which again favors small caps.  So, I think small caps can be the place  to be for the rest of 2018.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  But, you know, there is a huge difference between investing in a  rising interest rate environment and a declining interest rate environment.   So, especially if you're investing for income.  So, what's an investor who  is looking for income to do right now do you think?  </p><p>VILLERE:  That's a very tough question right now because if you look at, if  you look at the 10-year and it was right around, let's say it's when right  around 3 percent, that's one scenario.  And then you have, on the other  hand, some good income stocks, such as Procter &amp; Gamble (NYSE:PG) and Kraft  (NYSE:KFT) Heinz, these are all are paying 3 percent dividend yields.  But  what you see in 2018 is investors now shifting as rates have come up -- as  bond rates have come up from the Procter &amp; Gambles of the world to bonds.  </p><p>And so, I think, you know, Procter &amp; Gamble (NYSE:PG) is down about 25  percent year to date.  So, I would -- I would have some exposure to stocks  and bonds such as in my balance fund where it's about 70-30 stocks to  bonds.  </p><p>HERERA:  On that note, thanks for the advice, Sandy.  We appreciate it.   Sandy Villere with the Villere Balanced Fund.</p><p>VILLERE:  Thanks, Sue.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  Well, one issue that still gets the market's attention is trade.   And as we reported yesterday, the White House has revived its plan --  revived its plan to move ahead with tariffs on some Chinese goods.  </p><p>And as Eunice Yoon reports for us now, the response from Beijing was swift  and it was sharp.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>EUNICE YOON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  President Trump's  decision on tariffs isn't going down very well in China.  Soon after the  White House issued a statement, the commerce ministry responded, saying, we  are surprised by the strategic statement released by the White House.  At  the same time, it's half expected.  </p><p>And today, the foreign ministry said, an international relationships every  time you change, every time you break a promise, the country's credibility  is damaged.  Officially, both ministries said that China wants the U.S. to  meet them halfway in the spirit of the joint statement.  However, I spoke  with one official on the Chinese side who's familiar with the trade talks  and he said that the most important thing that the U.S. and China need to  do is establish mutual trust, but that this latest move isn't helping.  </p><p>The Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross will be visiting China this weekend to  continue trade talks.  Advanced teams are here in Beijing to work out the  details.  The official said that the Trump administration strategy appears  to be to pressure the Chinese.  </p><p>As for whether China will retaliate, the foreign ministry commented on  that, saying China doesn't want a trade war, but we won't hide from one.   If the U.S. insists on being reckless, China will firmly take action to  safeguard its legitimate interests.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Eunice Yoon in Beijing.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  Meantime, a trade deadline looms with the European Union, another  key trading partner.  Tariffs on steel and aluminum imports are scheduled  to take effect on Friday.  And there are reports tonight that the U.S. will  impose those import tariffs, and it comes as trade officials met on the  sideline of the OECD meeting in Paris.  </p><p>Joumanna Bercetche is there.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JOUMANNA BERCETCHE, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  We're at the  OECD forum in Paris, where today, the OECD released their updated economic  projections for the world economy, showing a growth rebounding to 3.9  percent.  </p><p>Now, this is the strongest period of growth the world economy has  experienced in years.  However, they have cited some clouds on the horizon,  some rifts that policymakers need to be mindful of.  And one of them was  trade wars.  </p><p>Now, this is coming at a very interesting time for Europe because on June  the 1st, the temporary tariff exemptions that were applied from the U.S. on  E.U. imports are set to expire and the expectation is that they may not be  renewed.  Now, on the sidelines of this meeting, we know that Cecilia  Malmstrom, who is the European trade commissioner, also met with her  counterpart, the U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, and did have  discussions.  However, neither one of them have commented on what the final  tariff decision is going to look like.  </p><p>But in remarks earlier today, Mr. Ross did say that the E.U. is the only  trading partner that has said they will not be willing to engage in  discussions so long as tariffs do end up getting applied.  Now, of course,  all of this comes at a time when policymakers have been discussing next  steps on multilateralism and how to improve to multilateralism to make it  more inclusive and to make it more fair.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Joumanna Bercetche, in Paris, France.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Meanwhile, economic growth was revised slightly lower here for  the first quarter of the year.  In its latest revision, the government said  this morning that the economy grew at a 2.2 percent annual rate between  January and March, down from the previous estimate of 2.3 percent.  </p><p>Economists say that businesses and consumers slowed their spending it's  had, but most are expected to see a solid rebound during this current  quarter.  </p><p>HERERA:  U.S. businesses added to their payrolls in May.  According to the  latest ADP survey, private payrolls grew by 178,000, thanks to strong  hiring in construction, education and health care.  That report suggests  that the job market remains healthy, but might be slowing just slightly as  the pool of available workers dwindles.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  The Federal Reserve is refining a rule that governs trading at  bank.  The central bank is proposing a change to the so-called Volcker rule  that makes it less of a one-size-fits-all.  The move would replace -- it  would place the greatest restrictions on banks that do the most trading.   Banks that do less trading would face fewer regulations.  </p><p>This rule, which is, as you know, a part of the Dodd-Frank banking law that  was adopted after the financial crisis, has often been criticized by Wall  Street as being too onerous and harmful to the functioning of the markets.  </p><p>HERERA:  Well, the latest survey from the Federal Reserve casts an upbeat  view on the economy.  The Fed's Beige Book which is an anecdotal look at  the economy across the country points to a moderate pickup in activity this  spring.  </p><p>Hampton Pearson has more.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HAMPTON PEARSON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  The latest Federal  Reserve snapshot, the Beige Book, finds economic activity expanded  moderately in late April and early May.  Manufacturing really leading the  way, shifting into high gear with more than half the districts reporting a  pickup and one-third classifying activity as strong.  </p><p>However, on the other side, overall consumer spending was characterized as  soft.  And there were also some contacts from around the country, nothing  uncertainty about international trade policy.  </p><p>All in all, it's part of what economists see as a mixed economy with some  concerns on the horizon.  </p><p>BILL STONE, STONE INVESTMENT PARTNERS:  The good news is the Fed probably  doesn't have to move super fast to raise rates.  Now, they're going to  almost surely raise rates in June, but of course, if they go too fast,  that's when the market gets nervous.  </p><p>PEARSON:  But it's still all about labor markets.  They remain tight across  the country with reports of difficulties filling jobs across a variety of  skill levels, shortages of qualified workers, including truck drivers,  carpenters, electricians, even information technology professionals.  Of  course, many firms responding to those talent shortages by increasing wages  and compensation packages.  </p><p>But, however, the Fed still says overall wage pressures in the aggregate  remain modest.  That's leading economists to see no alarm bells for the Fed  when it comes to future monetary policy.  </p><p>JOHN STOLTZFUS, OPPENHEIMER ASSET MGMT:  Wage growth has been extremely  modest relative to other times when we've had economic expansion post a  crisis and recovery period.  </p><p>PEARSON:  The next and perhaps most important economic barometer, just two  days away, the all-important jobs report from the Labor Department on  Friday.  </p><p>Hampton Pearson, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, at the Federal Reserve.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Time to take a look now at some of today's upgrades and  downgrades.  </p><p>Dow component Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) was downgraded to hold from buy at Maxim  Group.  The analyst there calls the optimism over Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s  services business overblown and says the company's subscription business  will disappoint investors.  Price target now $200.  That stock fell a  fraction to $187.50.  </p><p>Fellow Dow component ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) saw its ratings raised to  outperform from sector perform at RBC Capital Markets.  The analyst cites  the acceleration of the company's investments in new energy products.  The  price target: $100.  The stock rose nearly 4 percent today to $81.50.  </p><p>HERERA:  AK Steel was downgraded to sell from neutral over at Goldman Sachs  (NYSE:GS).  The analyst there cites increased competition with the  automotive business.  The price target is $4.  The stock closed just above  that level at $4.58.  </p><p>Target (NYSE:TGT) was added to Bank of America (NYSE:BAC)'s top ideas list.   The analyst says the retailer will benefit from aging demographics.  The  price target is $86.  And the stock rose more than 2 percent to $73.47.  </p><p>Still ahead, the future of the media industry according to those who run  it.  </p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>HERERA:  \"Consumer Reports\" reverses its recent decision and will now  recommend the Tesla Model 3.  The recent update improved the car's braking  distance by almost 20 feet.  The Model 3 braking performance prevented the  car from initially getting a \"Consumer Reports\" recommendation.  But  today's move helped lift Tesla's shares nearly 3 percent to finish the  trading day on the upside.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  There is a new perk for Walmart employees.  The retailer is now  offering pay for its workers to go back to school, as long as they get  degrees in business or supply chain management.  </p><p>The country's largest private employer is partnering with three  universities to offer these degrees to nearly 1.5 million part-time and  full-time employees.  As the labor market tightens, Walmart clearly is  hoping that the program will keep those employees at the company.  The  benefit was announced today at the start of Walmart's annual shareholder  meeting.  </p><p>HERERA:  At Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) shareholder meeting, CEO Jeff Bezos  acknowledged that the company has come under intense scrutiny this past  year and that more scrutiny is expected as the company grows.  Protesters  gathered outside the meeting, pushing for the appointment of an independent  director to the board.  A shareholder proposal to split the CEO and board  chair positions failed.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  Twenty-First Century Fox shareholders are going to vote on the  proposed merger with Disney (NYSE:DIS) on July 10th.  That puts pressure on  Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) (NYSE:CCS) to make a formal offer for Fox's assets.   That deal and the future of the fast-changing industry was just one of the  topics at the Code Conference, which brings together the biggest players in  the business.  </p><p>Julia Boorstin is there for us tonight.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JULIA BOORSTIN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  With leaders, the  biggest media and tech companies taking the stage at the Code Conference.   And a range of media megadeals pending, the question of why there's  pressure to consolidate loomed large.  </p><p>Twenty-First Century Fox CEO James Murdoch saying they see so much  opportunity in having greater scale.  When pressed on Comcast  (NASDAQ:CMCSA) (NYSE:CCS)'s plan to make a higher bid for Fox than Disney  (NYSE:DIS), he focused on progress on Disney (NYSE:DIS)'s acquisition.  </p><p>JAMES MURDOCH, 21ST CENTURY FOX CEO:  Essentially, we had an agreement with  Disney (NYSE:DIS) and we have an agreement with Disney (NYSE:DIS) which we  find very attractive for our shareholders.  It's an all stock agreement.   We think the prospects for the new firm are very strong.  </p><p>And we think from a regulatory perspective and we thought as well in  December from a regulatory perspective, that you have a higher certainty of  close.  So, when you weigh up all of those factors, that's really what we  thought was the right thing to do.  Now, whether or not -- whether or not  the board is asked to consider a different offer from somebody else in the  future, we'll deal with that as we go.  </p><p>BOORSTIN: With AT&amp;T (NYSE:T) awaiting a judge's ruling on whether it will  be able to buy Time Warner (NYSE:TWX), AT&amp;T (NYSE:T) CEO Randall Stephenson  saying consolidation is inevitable.  </p><p>RANDALL STEPHENSON, CHAIRMAN AND CEO, AT&amp;T (NYSE:T):  Nobody knows what the  future is going to look like five or six years from now, but I think the  bet most people are making is, premium content is going to be very, very  relevant five or six years from now.  A lot of bandwidth is going to be  required to make all that happen and there are going to be new kind of  business models surrounding this, particularly as it relates to ad-driven  type business models.  </p><p>BOORSTIN:  With AT&amp;T (NYSE:T) looking to grow, it feels pressure from big  tech.  One of those big tech companies, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), is feeling  the heat here at the Code Conference.  </p><p>Fox CEO James Murdoch criticizing Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) ads and how it's  been used as a platform for manipulation.  Snap CEO Evan Spiegel took a dig  at Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) for copying its features but not for copying its  more stringent data protection policy.  </p><p>EVAN SPIEGEL, SNAP CO-FOUNDER &amp; CEO:  What they've done is they changed  their products and I think they've actually changed their mission, right?   But I think fundamentally, they're having a really hard time changing the  DNA of their campaign.  </p><p>And the DNA of their company is all about having people compete with each  other online for attention.  </p><p>BOORSTIN:  Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) COO Sheryl Sandberg on stage with CTO Mike  Schroepfer responding by saying they're taking responsibility and investing  big, even though it will hurt their bottom line, to make sure this doesn't  happen again.  </p><p>SHERYL SANDBERG, COO, FACEBOOK:  We can get better, we can be more  transparent.  We can put a lot more resources and a lot more thought with  technology automation and people.  </p><p>BOORSTIN:  Sandberg and Schroepfer also talking about all the changes  they've made in the past two months and the ways they're complying with new  European privacy regulations.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Julia Boorstin in Rancho Palos Verdes,  California.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  Sales impressed at Dick's Sporting Goods, and that's where we  begin tonight's \"Market Focus\".  </p><p>The retailer reported stronger than expected earnings and revenue, quelling  fears that business performance would be impacted by the company's decision  to stop selling guns.  In fact, Dick's said it thinks new customer visits  have increased as a result of that policy.  The company also raised its  earnings guidance for the full year and the shares jumped nearly 26 percent  to $38.35.  </p><p>Michael Kors has reported earnings that topped expectations.  But the  handbag maker's full year profit outlook sparked some concerns.  The  company said increased investment in its Jimmy Choo brand would be cutting  into earnings growth in 2018.  So, the share sold off, down more than 11  percent to $60.41.  </p><p>And DSW (NYSE:DSW) grew its sales and improved its margins in the latest  quarter.  The shoe retailer also said it launched a new loyalty program  that it hopes will generate additional growth.  The company didn't update  its earnings guidance specifically for the year, however.  And that  disappointed some investors.  DSW (NYSE:DSW) shares finished down more than  5 percent to $24.61.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  Watch maker Movado said that strong demand for many of its  brands helped overall sales edged past expectations.  The company added  that e-commerce performance was a bright spot for the company in the  quarter.  Movado also raised its four-year earnings forecast.  Shares  ticked higher by 16 percent today to finish the day at $49.20.  </p><p>And after the bell tonight, cloud software company Box reported a narrower  than expected loss and higher revenue.  The company also gave guidance for  the current quarter that was ahead of street estimates.  But still, shares  initially traded lower in the extended session, erasing a more than 1  percent gain that we saw when shares ended the regulation session at  $27.78.</p><p>HERERA:  Big consumer brands are facing unprecedented challenges.  We've  been telling you about familiar names, most recently, Campbell's Soup, that  are seeing sales slide as they struggle to keep up with changing consumer  taste.  </p><p>Tonight, Sara Eisen takes a closer look at the stumbles that have put these  well-known companies on the defensive.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SARA EISEN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Many of America's best  known brands are hurting, from Playtex to Palmolive, Cheerios to Velveeta,  they're facing real questions about how to stay relevant.  </p><p>Take Campbell's Soup, which is now in the middle of a strategic review  after the abrupt retirement of its CEO Denise Morrison.  It represents a  lot of what's going wrong at consumer companies, like missing key insights  about their customers, such as shift to eating soup as an appetizer instead  of a main course.  The company didn't innovate enough to address the  change, according to industry insiders.  </p><p>Other companies have tried to catch up by buying successful smaller brands  that are growing, like General Mills (NYSE:GIS) buying Annie's, known for  its organic mac and cheese, or Campbell's Soup buying Bolthouse healthy  drinks.</p><p>But they haven't managed to learn from their acquisitions.  Instead of  integrating the startup cultures into their existing products and  processes, the companies have absorbed the startups into their existing  bureaucratic cultures.  They also haven't been able to hold onto top talent  and founders after a few years of a transition, missing the opportunity to  have successful entrepreneurs who founded disruptive startups.</p><p>And the problem is bigger than just losing touch with their customers.  The  big brands are also getting squeezed by a war between retailers with Amazon  (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s Whole Foods, Kroger (NYSE:KR), Walmart, all slashing prices  to compete, squeezing food margins.  </p><p>But some venerable brands are managing to change with the times.  Conagra,  for instance, has managed to revitalize its frozen food business.  </p><p>KEN GOLDMAN, J.P. MORGAN SENIOR EQUITY ANALYST:  Think about what frozen  entrees were ten years ago, you still call them TV dinners half the time.   Now, look at around, you'll see these power bowls.  Bowls themselves are  made up of biodegradable material.  Companies like Conagra have done a  terrific job of making those brands more relevant.  </p><p>EISEN:  Estee Lauder, Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) and Unilever (NYSE:UN), according  to analyst Ali Dibadj of Bernstein have all managed to stay relevant with  the consumer as well, and have done a better job integrating acquisitions  and learning from them.  </p><p>Unless companies start to adjust, this is a group that experts say could  feel more market pain, see big deals to cut costs and spin off brands and  many will be holding onto the past.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Sara Eisen.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Now, as a result of those missteps, investors no longer love  consumer staple stocks.  They're turning their backs on this once popular  sector.  </p><p>And Mike Santoli has more for us on that tonight.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MIKE SANTOLI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Shares of the biggest  food and household product makers once considered safe and stable blue  chips are among the worst performers this year.  Campbell Soup (NYSE:CPB  (NYSE:CPF)), General Mills (NYSE:GIS) and Kraft (NYSE:KFT) Heinz are down  more than 20 percent in 2018, compared to slight gains for the broad  market.  Only a small minority of analysts are recommending most of these  stocks, worried that recent declines in sales will only worsen as their  commodity costs rise and younger shoppers shun traditional supermarket  brands in favor of trendier, more natural offerings.</p><p>Just two years ago, these consumer staple stocks were favorites of  investors, coveted for their generous dividends compared to a low bond  yields, and cherished for their resilience in a slow growing economy.   Today, the focus is on a humming U.S. economy and companies managing to  grow profits rapidly.  </p><p>This leaves a value minded investor with the question of whether these  stocks have become cheap and neglected enough to represent bargains.  Based  on projected earnings for the coming year, Campbell's, General Mills  (NYSE:GIS), and Kellogg (NYSE:K)'s have not be this inexpensive relative to  the broad market for more than 15 years.  Procter and Gamble and Clorox  (NYSE:CLX) are cheaper than they've been in more than seven years on the  same basis.  </p><p>Looking cheap is no guarantee that the pain is over for investors in these  stocks, of course.  Buying them now is a bet that companies can freshen  their brands to win over younger customers or improve results to mergers  and acquisitions.  And correct or not, that's a bet the Wall Street crowd  is increasingly unwilling to make.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Mike Santoli.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  Coming up, executive search takes on a whole new meaning now that  private investigators are involved.  </p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Sir Martin Sorrell is starting a new venture, the founder and  former CEO of WPP (NASDAQ:WPPGY), has taken control of a shell company in  London with the hopes now of transforming it into a new marketing services  business.  Now, that's the same strategy that he used years ago to build  WPP (NASDAQ:WPPGY), the company from which he resigned abruptly just six  weeks ago.  That departure occurred during an internal company  investigation.  The results have yet to be disclosed.  </p><p>HERERA:  And there is a new player in corporate board rooms, the private  investigator.  They're being used to look into executives' past and by  doing so, they are altering the future of some companies.  </p><p>Leslie Picker explains.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>LESLIE PICKER, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  In the Me Too era,  allegations of predatory behavior bankrupted Harvey Weinstein's company and  forced out Wynn founder Steve Wynn, sending the stock on a rollercoaster  ride.  The stakes are high for corporations failing to root out sexual  harassment.  So, they've turned in droves to private investigators.  </p><p>DAN NARDELLO, NARDELLO &amp; CO. CEO:  An ounce of prevention really is worth a  pound of cure here, because the cost both in terms of potential drop in  stock price, legal and pr costs, possibility of the regulators getting  involved, they're enormous compared with the relatively modest expenditure  in hiring folks like us to -- in order to rule out this behavior.  </p><p>PICKER:  Nardello, a private investigator for 25 years, he says he's seen  about 35 percent more client calls related to sexual misconduct over the  last six months.  </p><p>NARDELLO:  I have never seen a societal phenomenon that has had the impact  on our business as the Me Too movement and the post-Weinstein world.  </p><p>PICKER:  He says corporations and private equity firms are looking for help  in due diligence ahead of acquisitions.  He's also looking into the  background of potential board members and C-suite hires.  And some clients  are seeking possibly predatory behavior in competitors, a move that one of  his clients calls weaponizing feminism.  </p><p>Nardello often gets work through lawyers like Ed Little who recently sought  help clearing the name of a client who had been accused of sexual  misconduct.  </p><p>ED LITTLE, HUGHES HUBBARD PARTNER:  The Me Too movement is a very valid  movement, but there's been overreaction, we believe.  And so, in  representing somebody who's been accused, it's important to find out  whether or not there's any credibility to the accusations.  </p><p>PICKER:  Nardello's number two, Sabina Menschel, walked me through their  client offerings, starting with online searches.  </p><p>SABINA MENSCHEL, NARDELLO &amp; CO. COO:  Databases like these that we have  access to, some of which because we're pretty investigators and they allow  us to search for publicly available information.  But we always complement  that as well with what we call on-site searches.  </p><p>PICKER:  Menschel says on-site searches include sending investigators to  where the subject has lived or worked, searching local databases like  county court records and knocking on doors to interview neighbors and  friends.  </p><p>And the work is making a difference.  Nardello says he's seen private  equity firms walk away from deals and companies decide against hiring  individuals after discovering sexual misconduct.  </p><p>Despite the wave of allegations of predatory behavior during the Me Too  movement, Nardello says we may have only seen the tip of the iceberg.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Leslie Picker.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Before we go, one more look at today's rally on Wall Street.

The Dow soars more than 300 points as the bulls beat back the bears for control of this market.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SUE HERERA, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR: Major obstacles. Why some of America`s most beloved consumer brands are now attached to Wall Street`s most hated stocks.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">GRIFFETH: Private eye. The new role investigators are now playing in boardrooms across the country.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Those stories and much more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for this Wednesday, May 30th.</p><p>HERERA: Good evening, everybody. And welcome.</p><p>What a difference a day makes. Stocks rocketed higher at the opening bell and really never looked back, recovering much of yesterday`s losses. Bank stocks rallied, energy shared soared and small caps hit a record, as investor concerned over a political crisis in Italy faded.</p><p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 306 points to 24,667, the Nasdaq was up 65, and the S&amp;P 500 rose 34.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Oil prices also gained ground, notching their first gain in six sessions. A report that OPEC will keep crude production curbs in place at least until the end of this year helped reverse the commodity`s recent slide on fears about higher production. Domestic crude rose about 2 percent today, settling above $68 a barrel.</p><p>HERERA: Oil prices may have ended higher today, but they`re down about 5 percent for the week. And the rise in rates that we`ve been telling you about have also begun to cool. So, does this quickly-changing narrative signal a pause or a fundamental shift in the market?</p><p>Joining us to offer his insights is Sandy Villere, portfolio manager of the Villere Balanced Fund.</p><p>Welcome back, Sandy. Nice to see you again.</p><p>SANDY VILLERE, VILLERE BALANCED FUND PORTFOLIO MANAGER: Thanks, Sue.</p><p>HERERA: So, which is it -- is it a pause in an overall upside trajectory or is it a fundamental shift in the way the market is valuing things?</p><p>VILLERE: Now, I think it is a pause. You remember we started the year at 246 on the 10-year. We went all the way up to 312. Now we`re back to 285 on the ten-year.</p><p>So, I think that that`s a little bit of a pullback but I think rates as the Fed continues to raise this year are going to put upward pressure on interest rates. I think you`re seeing that play out in the market, you`re seeing that with small caps, up about 7-1/2 percent year to date, that tend to do better in a rising interest rate environment versus large caps, like the S&amp;P, that`s only up about 1-1/2 percent this year.</p><p>Remember, the larger cap multinationals in the S&amp;P tend to export more expensive good and services. So when interest rates go up, the dollar goes up which again favors small caps. So, I think small caps can be the place to be for the rest of 2018.</p><p>GRIFFETH: But, you know, there is a huge difference between investing in a rising interest rate environment and a declining interest rate environment. So, especially if you`re investing for income. So, what`s an investor who is looking for income to do right now do you think?</p><p>VILLERE: That`s a very tough question right now because if you look at, if you look at the 10-year and it was right around, let`s say it`s when right around 3 percent, that`s one scenario. And then you have, on the other hand, some good income stocks, such as Procter &amp; Gamble (NYSE:PG) and Kraft (NYSE:KFT) Heinz, these are all are paying 3 percent dividend yields. But what you see in 2018 is investors now shifting as rates have come up -- as bond rates have come up from the Procter &amp; Gambles of the world to bonds.</p><p>And so, I think, you know, Procter &amp; Gamble (NYSE:PG) is down about 25 percent year to date. So, I would -- I would have some exposure to stocks and bonds such as in my balance fund where it`s about 70-30 stocks to bonds.</p><p>HERERA: On that note, thanks for the advice, Sandy. We appreciate it. Sandy Villere with the Villere Balanced Fund.</p><p>VILLERE: Thanks, Sue.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Well, one issue that still gets the market`s attention is trade. And as we reported yesterday, the White House has revived its plan -- revived its plan to move ahead with tariffs on some Chinese goods.</p><p>And as Eunice Yoon reports for us now, the response from Beijing was swift and it was sharp.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>EUNICE YOON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: President Trump`s decision on tariffs isn`t going down very well in China. Soon after the White House issued a statement, the commerce ministry responded, saying, we are surprised by the strategic statement released by the White House. At the same time, it`s half expected.</p><p>And today, the foreign ministry said, an international relationships every time you change, every time you break a promise, the country`s credibility is damaged. Officially, both ministries said that China wants the U.S. to meet them halfway in the spirit of the joint statement. However, I spoke with one official on the Chinese side who`s familiar with the trade talks and he said that the most important thing that the U.S. and China need to do is establish mutual trust, but that this latest move isn`t helping.</p><p>The Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross will be visiting China this weekend to continue trade talks. Advanced teams are here in Beijing to work out the details. The official said that the Trump administration strategy appears to be to pressure the Chinese.</p><p>As for whether China will retaliate, the foreign ministry commented on that, saying China doesn`t want a trade war, but we won`t hide from one. If the U.S. insists on being reckless, China will firmly take action to safeguard its legitimate interests.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Eunice Yoon in Beijing.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: Meantime, a trade deadline looms with the European Union, another key trading partner. Tariffs on steel and aluminum imports are scheduled to take effect on Friday. And there are reports tonight that the U.S. will impose those import tariffs, and it comes as trade officials met on the sideline of the OECD meeting in Paris.</p><p>Joumanna Bercetche is there.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JOUMANNA BERCETCHE, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: We`re at the OECD forum in Paris, where today, the OECD released their updated economic projections for the world economy, showing a growth rebounding to 3.9 percent.</p><p>Now, this is the strongest period of growth the world economy has experienced in years. However, they have cited some clouds on the horizon, some rifts that policymakers need to be mindful of. And one of them was trade wars.</p><p>Now, this is coming at a very interesting time for Europe because on June the 1st, the temporary tariff exemptions that were applied from the U.S. on E.U. imports are set to expire and the expectation is that they may not be renewed. Now, on the sidelines of this meeting, we know that Cecilia Malmstrom, who is the European trade commissioner, also met with her counterpart, the U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, and did have discussions. However, neither one of them have commented on what the final tariff decision is going to look like.</p><p>But in remarks earlier today, Mr. Ross did say that the E.U. is the only trading partner that has said they will not be willing to engage in discussions so long as tariffs do end up getting applied. Now, of course, all of this comes at a time when policymakers have been discussing next steps on multilateralism and how to improve to multilateralism to make it more inclusive and to make it more fair.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Joumanna Bercetche, in Paris, France.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH: Meanwhile, economic growth was revised slightly lower here for the first quarter of the year. In its latest revision, the government said this morning that the economy grew at a 2.2 percent annual rate between January and March, down from the previous estimate of 2.3 percent.</p><p>Economists say that businesses and consumers slowed their spending it`s had, but most are expected to see a solid rebound during this current quarter.</p><p>HERERA: U.S. businesses added to their payrolls in May. According to the latest ADP survey, private payrolls grew by 178,000, thanks to strong hiring in construction, education and health care. That report suggests that the job market remains healthy, but might be slowing just slightly as the pool of available workers dwindles.</p><p>GRIFFETH: The Federal Reserve is refining a rule that governs trading at bank. The central bank is proposing a change to the so-called Volcker rule that makes it less of a one-size-fits-all. The move would replace -- it would place the greatest restrictions on banks that do the most trading. Banks that do less trading would face fewer regulations.</p><p>This rule, which is, as you know, a part of the Dodd-Frank banking law that was adopted after the financial crisis, has often been criticized by Wall Street as being too onerous and harmful to the functioning of the markets.</p><p>HERERA: Well, the latest survey from the Federal Reserve casts an upbeat view on the economy. The Fed`s Beige Book which is an anecdotal look at the economy across the country points to a moderate pickup in activity this spring.</p><p>Hampton Pearson has more.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HAMPTON PEARSON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: The latest Federal Reserve snapshot, the Beige Book, finds economic activity expanded moderately in late April and early May. Manufacturing really leading the way, shifting into high gear with more than half the districts reporting a pickup and one-third classifying activity as strong.</p><p>However, on the other side, overall consumer spending was characterized as soft. And there were also some contacts from around the country, nothing uncertainty about international trade policy.</p><p>All in all, it`s part of what economists see as a mixed economy with some concerns on the horizon.</p><p>BILL STONE, STONE INVESTMENT PARTNERS: The good news is the Fed probably doesn`t have to move super fast to raise rates. Now, they`re going to almost surely raise rates in June, but of course, if they go too fast, that`s when the market gets nervous.</p><p>PEARSON: But it`s still all about labor markets. They remain tight across the country with reports of difficulties filling jobs across a variety of skill levels, shortages of qualified workers, including truck drivers, carpenters, electricians, even information technology professionals. Of course, many firms responding to those talent shortages by increasing wages and compensation packages.</p><p>But, however, the Fed still says overall wage pressures in the aggregate remain modest. That`s leading economists to see no alarm bells for the Fed when it comes to future monetary policy.</p><p>JOHN STOLTZFUS, OPPENHEIMER ASSET MGMT: Wage growth has been extremely modest relative to other times when we`ve had economic expansion post a crisis and recovery period.</p><p>PEARSON: The next and perhaps most important economic barometer, just two days away, the all-important jobs report from the Labor Department on Friday.</p><p>Hampton Pearson, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, at the Federal Reserve.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH: Time to take a look now at some of today`s upgrades and downgrades.</p><p>Dow component Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) was downgraded to hold from buy at Maxim Group. The analyst there calls the optimism over Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)`s services business overblown and says the company`s subscription business will disappoint investors. Price target now $200. That stock fell a fraction to $187.50.</p><p>Fellow Dow component ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) saw its ratings raised to outperform from sector perform at RBC Capital Markets. The analyst cites the acceleration of the company`s investments in new energy products. The price target: $100. The stock rose nearly 4 percent today to $81.50.</p><p>HERERA: AK Steel was downgraded to sell from neutral over at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS). The analyst there cites increased competition with the automotive business. The price target is $4. The stock closed just above that level at $4.58.</p><p>Target (NYSE:TGT) was added to Bank of America (NYSE:BAC)`s top ideas list. The analyst says the retailer will benefit from aging demographics. The price target is $86. And the stock rose more than 2 percent to $73.47.</p><p>Still ahead, the future of the media industry according to those who run it.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>HERERA: \"Consumer Reports\" reverses its recent decision and will now recommend the Tesla Model 3. The recent update improved the car`s braking distance by almost 20 feet. The Model 3 braking performance prevented the car from initially getting a \"Consumer Reports\" recommendation. But today`s move helped lift Tesla`s shares nearly 3 percent to finish the trading day on the upside.</p><p>GRIFFETH: There is a new perk for Walmart employees. The retailer is now offering pay for its workers to go back to school, as long as they get degrees in business or supply chain management.</p><p>The country`s largest private employer is partnering with three universities to offer these degrees to nearly 1.5 million part-time and full-time employees. As the labor market tightens, Walmart clearly is hoping that the program will keep those employees at the company. The benefit was announced today at the start of Walmart`s annual shareholder meeting.</p><p>HERERA: At Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) shareholder meeting, CEO Jeff Bezos acknowledged that the company has come under intense scrutiny this past year and that more scrutiny is expected as the company grows. Protesters gathered outside the meeting, pushing for the appointment of an independent director to the board. A shareholder proposal to split the CEO and board chair positions failed.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Twenty-First Century Fox shareholders are going to vote on the proposed merger with Disney (NYSE:DIS) on July 10th. That puts pressure on Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) (NYSE:CCS) to make a formal offer for Fox`s assets. That deal and the future of the fast-changing industry was just one of the topics at the Code Conference, which brings together the biggest players in the business.</p><p>Julia Boorstin is there for us tonight.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JULIA BOORSTIN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: With leaders, the biggest media and tech companies taking the stage at the Code Conference. And a range of media megadeals pending, the question of why there`s pressure to consolidate loomed large.</p><p>Twenty-First Century Fox CEO James Murdoch saying they see so much opportunity in having greater scale. When pressed on Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) (NYSE:CCS)`s plan to make a higher bid for Fox than Disney (NYSE:DIS), he focused on progress on Disney (NYSE:DIS)`s acquisition.</p><p>JAMES MURDOCH, 21ST CENTURY FOX CEO: Essentially, we had an agreement with Disney (NYSE:DIS) and we have an agreement with Disney (NYSE:DIS) which we find very attractive for our shareholders. It`s an all stock agreement. We think the prospects for the new firm are very strong.</p><p>And we think from a regulatory perspective and we thought as well in December from a regulatory perspective, that you have a higher certainty of close. So, when you weigh up all of those factors, that`s really what we thought was the right thing to do. Now, whether or not -- whether or not the board is asked to consider a different offer from somebody else in the future, we`ll deal with that as we go.</p><p>BOORSTIN: With AT&amp;T (NYSE:T) awaiting a judge`s ruling on whether it will be able to buy Time Warner (NYSE:TWX), AT&amp;T (NYSE:T) CEO Randall Stephenson saying consolidation is inevitable.</p><p>RANDALL STEPHENSON, CHAIRMAN AND CEO, AT&amp;T (NYSE:T): Nobody knows what the future is going to look like five or six years from now, but I think the bet most people are making is, premium content is going to be very, very relevant five or six years from now. A lot of bandwidth is going to be required to make all that happen and there are going to be new kind of business models surrounding this, particularly as it relates to ad-driven type business models.</p><p>BOORSTIN: With AT&amp;T (NYSE:T) looking to grow, it feels pressure from big tech. One of those big tech companies, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), is feeling the heat here at the Code Conference.</p><p>Fox CEO James Murdoch criticizing Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) ads and how it`s been used as a platform for manipulation. Snap CEO Evan Spiegel took a dig at Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) for copying its features but not for copying its more stringent data protection policy.</p><p>EVAN SPIEGEL, SNAP CO-FOUNDER &amp; CEO: What they`ve done is they changed their products and I think they`ve actually changed their mission, right? But I think fundamentally, they`re having a really hard time changing the DNA of their campaign.</p><p>And the DNA of their company is all about having people compete with each other online for attention.</p><p>BOORSTIN: Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) COO Sheryl Sandberg on stage with CTO Mike Schroepfer responding by saying they`re taking responsibility and investing big, even though it will hurt their bottom line, to make sure this doesn`t happen again.</p><p>SHERYL SANDBERG, COO, FACEBOOK: We can get better, we can be more transparent. We can put a lot more resources and a lot more thought with technology automation and people.</p><p>BOORSTIN: Sandberg and Schroepfer also talking about all the changes they`ve made in the past two months and the ways they`re complying with new European privacy regulations.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Julia Boorstin in Rancho Palos Verdes, California.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: Sales impressed at Dick`s Sporting Goods, and that`s where we begin tonight`s \"Market Focus\".</p><p>The retailer reported stronger than expected earnings and revenue, quelling fears that business performance would be impacted by the company`s decision to stop selling guns. In fact, Dick`s said it thinks new customer visits have increased as a result of that policy. The company also raised its earnings guidance for the full year and the shares jumped nearly 26 percent to $38.35.</p><p>Michael Kors has reported earnings that topped expectations. But the handbag maker`s full year profit outlook sparked some concerns. The company said increased investment in its Jimmy Choo brand would be cutting into earnings growth in 2018. So, the share sold off, down more than 11 percent to $60.41.</p><p>And DSW (NYSE:DSW) grew its sales and improved its margins in the latest quarter. The shoe retailer also said it launched a new loyalty program that it hopes will generate additional growth. The company didn`t update its earnings guidance specifically for the year, however. And that disappointed some investors. DSW (NYSE:DSW) shares finished down more than 5 percent to $24.61.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Watch maker Movado said that strong demand for many of its brands helped overall sales edged past expectations. The company added that e-commerce performance was a bright spot for the company in the quarter. Movado also raised its four-year earnings forecast. Shares ticked higher by 16 percent today to finish the day at $49.20.</p><p>And after the bell tonight, cloud software company Box reported a narrower than expected loss and higher revenue. The company also gave guidance for the current quarter that was ahead of street estimates. But still, shares initially traded lower in the extended session, erasing a more than 1 percent gain that we saw when shares ended the regulation session at $27.78.</p><p>HERERA: Big consumer brands are facing unprecedented challenges. We`ve been telling you about familiar names, most recently, Campbell`s Soup, that are seeing sales slide as they struggle to keep up with changing consumer taste.</p><p>Tonight, Sara Eisen takes a closer look at the stumbles that have put these well-known companies on the defensive.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SARA EISEN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Many of America`s best known brands are hurting, from Playtex to Palmolive, Cheerios to Velveeta, they`re facing real questions about how to stay relevant.</p><p>Take Campbell`s Soup, which is now in the middle of a strategic review after the abrupt retirement of its CEO Denise Morrison. It represents a lot of what`s going wrong at consumer companies, like missing key insights about their customers, such as shift to eating soup as an appetizer instead of a main course. The company didn`t innovate enough to address the change, according to industry insiders.</p><p>Other companies have tried to catch up by buying successful smaller brands that are growing, like General Mills (NYSE:GIS) buying Annie`s, known for its organic mac and cheese, or Campbell`s Soup buying Bolthouse healthy drinks.</p><p>But they haven`t managed to learn from their acquisitions. Instead of integrating the startup cultures into their existing products and processes, the companies have absorbed the startups into their existing bureaucratic cultures. They also haven`t been able to hold onto top talent and founders after a few years of a transition, missing the opportunity to have successful entrepreneurs who founded disruptive startups.</p><p>And the problem is bigger than just losing touch with their customers. The big brands are also getting squeezed by a war between retailers with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN)`s Whole Foods, Kroger (NYSE:KR), Walmart, all slashing prices to compete, squeezing food margins.</p><p>But some venerable brands are managing to change with the times. Conagra, for instance, has managed to revitalize its frozen food business.</p><p>KEN GOLDMAN, J.P. MORGAN SENIOR EQUITY ANALYST: Think about what frozen entrees were ten years ago, you still call them TV dinners half the time. Now, look at around, you`ll see these power bowls. Bowls themselves are made up of biodegradable material. Companies like Conagra have done a terrific job of making those brands more relevant.</p><p>EISEN: Estee Lauder, Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) and Unilever (NYSE:UN), according to analyst Ali Dibadj of Bernstein have all managed to stay relevant with the consumer as well, and have done a better job integrating acquisitions and learning from them.</p><p>Unless companies start to adjust, this is a group that experts say could feel more market pain, see big deals to cut costs and spin off brands and many will be holding onto the past.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Sara Eisen.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH: Now, as a result of those missteps, investors no longer love consumer staple stocks. They`re turning their backs on this once popular sector.</p><p>And Mike Santoli has more for us on that tonight.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MIKE SANTOLI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Shares of the biggest food and household product makers once considered safe and stable blue chips are among the worst performers this year. Campbell Soup (NYSE:CPB (NYSE:CPF)), General Mills (NYSE:GIS) and Kraft (NYSE:KFT) Heinz are down more than 20 percent in 2018, compared to slight gains for the broad market. Only a small minority of analysts are recommending most of these stocks, worried that recent declines in sales will only worsen as their commodity costs rise and younger shoppers shun traditional supermarket brands in favor of trendier, more natural offerings.</p><p>Just two years ago, these consumer staple stocks were favorites of investors, coveted for their generous dividends compared to a low bond yields, and cherished for their resilience in a slow growing economy. Today, the focus is on a humming U.S. economy and companies managing to grow profits rapidly.</p><p>This leaves a value minded investor with the question of whether these stocks have become cheap and neglected enough to represent bargains. Based on projected earnings for the coming year, Campbell`s, General Mills (NYSE:GIS), and Kellogg (NYSE:K)`s have not be this inexpensive relative to the broad market for more than 15 years. Procter and Gamble and Clorox (NYSE:CLX) are cheaper than they`ve been in more than seven years on the same basis.</p><p>Looking cheap is no guarantee that the pain is over for investors in these stocks, of course. Buying them now is a bet that companies can freshen their brands to win over younger customers or improve results to mergers and acquisitions. And correct or not, that`s a bet the Wall Street crowd is increasingly unwilling to make.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Mike Santoli.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: Coming up, executive search takes on a whole new meaning now that private investigators are involved.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GRIFFETH: Sir Martin Sorrell is starting a new venture, the founder and former CEO of WPP (NASDAQ:WPPGY), has taken control of a shell company in London with the hopes now of transforming it into a new marketing services business. Now, that`s the same strategy that he used years ago to build WPP (NASDAQ:WPPGY), the company from which he resigned abruptly just six weeks ago. That departure occurred during an internal company investigation. The results have yet to be disclosed.</p><p>HERERA: And there is a new player in corporate board rooms, the private investigator. They`re being used to look into executives` past and by doing so, they are altering the future of some companies.</p><p>Leslie Picker explains.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>LESLIE PICKER, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: In the Me Too era, allegations of predatory behavior bankrupted Harvey Weinstein`s company and forced out Wynn founder Steve Wynn, sending the stock on a rollercoaster ride. The stakes are high for corporations failing to root out sexual harassment. So, they`ve turned in droves to private investigators.</p><p>DAN NARDELLO, NARDELLO &amp; CO. CEO: An ounce of prevention really is worth a pound of cure here, because the cost both in terms of potential drop in stock price, legal and pr costs, possibility of the regulators getting involved, they`re enormous compared with the relatively modest expenditure in hiring folks like us to -- in order to rule out this behavior.</p><p>PICKER: Nardello, a private investigator for 25 years, he says he`s seen about 35 percent more client calls related to sexual misconduct over the last six months.</p><p>NARDELLO: I have never seen a societal phenomenon that has had the impact on our business as the Me Too movement and the post-Weinstein world.</p><p>PICKER: He says corporations and private equity firms are looking for help in due diligence ahead of acquisitions. He`s also looking into the background of potential board members and C-suite hires. And some clients are seeking possibly predatory behavior in competitors, a move that one of his clients calls weaponizing feminism.</p><p>Nardello often gets work through lawyers like Ed Little who recently sought help clearing the name of a client who had been accused of sexual misconduct.</p><p>ED LITTLE, HUGHES HUBBARD PARTNER: The Me Too movement is a very valid movement, but there`s been overreaction, we believe. And so, in representing somebody who`s been accused, it`s important to find out whether or not there`s any credibility to the accusations.</p><p>PICKER: Nardello`s number two, Sabina Menschel, walked me through their client offerings, starting with online searches.</p><p>SABINA MENSCHEL, NARDELLO &amp; CO. COO: Databases like these that we have access to, some of which because we`re pretty investigators and they allow us to search for publicly available information. But we always complement that as well with what we call on-site searches.</p><p>PICKER: Menschel says on-site searches include sending investigators to where the subject has lived or worked, searching local databases like county court records and knocking on doors to interview neighbors and friends.</p><p>And the work is making a difference. Nardello says he`s seen private equity firms walk away from deals and companies decide against hiring individuals after discovering sexual misconduct.</p><p>Despite the wave of allegations of predatory behavior during the Me Too movement, Nardello says we may have only seen the tip of the iceberg.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Leslie Picker.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH: Before we go, one more look at today`s rally on Wall Street. The Dow was up 306 points, Nasdaq up 65, the S&amp;P up 34.</p><p>HERERA: And that does it for us tonight. I`m Sue Herera. Thanks for joining us.</p><p>GRIFFETH: I`m Bill Griffeth.

Bill Griffeth has the evening off.</p><p>Wall Street ended the week in rally mode.  The S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq  closed at records, thanks to both a much stronger than expected jobs report  and progress on trade negotiations between the U.S. and China.  That  reassured investors about the health of the economy, and it sent stocks  higher.</p><p>Here are the closing numbers for you.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average  rose 301 points to close at 27,347.  The Nasdaq was up 94.  And the S&amp;P 500  added 29.  And it was the fourth straight week of gains for all of the  major averages.</p><p>Bob Pisani has more from the New York Stock Exchange.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BOB PISANI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Stocks were back in  rally mode on the first day of November, both S&amp;P and Nasdaq, record highs  today.  We had a notable shift in the market narrative.  We`ve gone from  fears of a recession in 2020 -- remember that a few months ago, to a belief  that the global economy will be slowing but still growing.</p><p>But today`s data is taking the edge off of even that slowdown narrative.   October jobs, better than expected.  And we had strong revisions from prior  months.</p><p>Elsewhere, the U.S. manufacturing was still weak, but it was better than  feared.  And new orders did not slip.  That`s a critical component.  It  looks ahead the new orders.</p><p>Overseas, even China manufacturing was better than expected.  And trade  sentiment is lifting for the moment.</p><p>So as a result, we`ve got some breakouts, not just the S&amp;P 500 but even on  a global scale, European indexes hitting new highs today.  Japanese indexes  hitting new highs as well.</p><p>Here in the U.S., new highs in the Nasdaq 100, in materials names, health  care names and semiconductors as well.</p><p>So, what`s missing here?  What would move the markets up more, say another  10 percent?</p><p>So, three things would really move the needle.  First, higher bond yields  would move money out of bonds and into stocks.  That`s a help.</p><p>Second, trade.  We need to take the December 15th tariffs that are supposed  to come on off the table.</p><p>And finally, this is probably important, is earnings.  This slow growth  narrative has believed that 2020 earnings would be flat to up mid-single  digits.  But if we get better economic data across the board, that`s going  to force traders to rethink those estimates for 2020 and that means  rethinking them up.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Bob Pisani at the New York Stock Exchange.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  And now to the employment report which as we mentioned was  surprisingly strong despite a cooling economy.</p><p>Steve Liesman takes a closer look at the state of the American labor  market.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>STEVE LIESMAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Even while the  government reported that job growth slowed in October, Wall Street still  saw the report as on the strong side and likely to help keep moderate U.S.  growth humming along.  The government said the unemployment rate ticked up  0.1 to 3.6 percent and that 128,000 jobs were added.  Now, that is the  lowest in five months.</p><p>But job growth bass better than the meager 75,000 that Wall Street had  forecast, and lackluster job growth from the prior two months were revised  upwards by a combined 95,000 jobs.  Finally, the number was depressed by  striking GM workers who have now gone back to work.</p><p>JAN HATZUS, GOLDMAN SACHS:  If you look at the jobs number now you are not  seeing that much slowdown.  It`s a little bit surprising, because other  indicators do show a slowdown over the last year.  But the job market is  just chugging along for now.</p><p>LIESMAN:  There was strong growth in leisure and hospital, up by 61,000.   Education and health services up by nearly 41,000.  Wholesale trade up  nearly 11,000.</p><p>But government down 3,000 because census workers let go and manufacturing  was down by 36,000.  But those manufacturing job losses should turn into  gains this month when striking GM workers return to work.  And that leads  to more upbeat news on the economy.</p><p>JASON FURMAN, PETERSON INSTITUTE FOR INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS:  I don`t think  any one number on jobs should change our view of the economy.  This one  changes mine a bit more than the average month does.  You have the pace of  job growth in the last three months exceeding the pace of job growth we had  in the first seven months of this year.  That`s something that is  surprising given all the increase in uncertainty we have seen.</p><p>LIESMAN:  What`s so important about the report is that global economic  weakness and trade war have plunged the U.S. manufacturing sector into what  some are already calling a recession but better job growth should mean  strong consumer spending that can help growth continue at the recent modest  pace of around 2 percent.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Steve Liesman.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  Let`s turn now to Ethan Harris (NYSE:HRS) to talk more about the  stronger than expected jobs report and the economy as a whole.  He is the  head of global economic research at Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) Merrill  Lynch.</p><p>Ethan, welcome back.  Nice to see you tonight.</p><p>ETHAN HARRIS, BANK OF AMERICA MERRILL LYNCH:  Thank you.</p><p>HERERA:  Let`s start, first of all, with your reaction to the report and  why you think basically these reports and the previous revisions mean the  labor market is so strong.</p><p>HARRIS:  Well, I agree with the other people commenting before me.  I mean,  this is a very strong report, if you take out the distortions due to the  strike and laying off of temporary census workers.  It`s like 185,000 or  something like that gain.  So, it`s a very strong gain.</p><p>I think we need to put it in a broader context.  It is true that the labor  market has held up a lot better than expected.  But if you look across the  economy, you do see tremendous weakness in the manufacturing sector.  You  see it in business investment.</p><p>And so, while the job numbers look great and the service side of the  economy producing most of the jobs look great, the manufacturing side of  the economy does not look so great.  So, it`s still a mixed picture out  there, even with this good data.</p><p>HERERA:  You make the point, as I look at my notes, that`s what`s happening  is you say the companies have responded to things like the trade war by  cutting investment rather than jobs.  Why do that?</p><p>HARRIS:  Well, think about it from a corporate perspective.  You have no  idea where tariffs are going to be two years from now.  And so, if you`re  going to make a commitment to new investment, to buy new plant and  equipment, that`s something you can`t give back.  You know, you have to put  that money in.</p><p>So, you`re not doing capital investment until you have some clarity around  what your future cost structure is going to look like.  On the other hand,  you`ll hire.  If you have business and you have demand for products, you  need to produce products.  So you will add workers.</p><p>If it turns out the trade war is really bad and you need to lower the  employment at one of your the outlets, you do it.  But you can`t return a  factory whereas you can lay off a worker.  So, the factories and the  investment side is much weaker than the labor side.</p><p>HERERA:  The New York Fed and the Atlanta Fed both downgraded forecasts of  economic growth.  Are you at all worried about economic growth overall in  the economy, separate from labor?</p><p>HARRIS:  Well, I mean, the economy is slowing down.  I mean, away from this  report and the recent reports in general have been a little bit better on  payrolls.  There is a broad slowdown going on.  We think that growth will  slow to about 1.3 percent in the fourth quarter down from 1.9 this quarter.   So, it`s a little bit further weakening.</p><p>I`m not worried about a recession or a deeper downturn as long as we do get  a trade deal, because with the trade deal, that intense uncertainty in the  business world will abate a bit.  And the economy should start to stabilize  and improve.  We also have a Fed that is working ready hard to support  growth.</p><p>So, as long as the trade war is under control, growth should pick up early  next year.</p><p>HERERA:  Ethan Harris (NYSE:HRS) with Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Merrill  Lynch -- Ethan, thank you so much.</p><p>HARRIS:  Thank you.</p><p>HERERA:  And as we just discussed, one of the biggest issues for the market  is indeed trade.  President Trump today said a deal with China is coming  along well.</p><p>Kayla Tausche takes a look at the progress being made.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>KAYLA TAUSCHE, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Top negotiators from  the U.S. and China continued talks over a principals-level phone call today  with differing views of what was achieved on trade.  China`s Ministry of  Commerce says a consensus on principles was reached.  The U.S. trade  representative said the call was constructive and that the two sides made  progress in a variety of areas and are in the process of resolving  outstanding issues.</p><p>As discussions continue, so does the search for a venue for President Trump  and President Xi to sign the phase one of the broader deal after Chile  cancelled the APEC summit later this month.  Trump yesterday tweeted the  new location would be announced soon.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Kayla Tausche in Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  The vice chair of the Federal Reserve says monetary policy is in a  good place.  Richard Clarida pointed to the central bank`s three interest  rate cuts this year and said the full effects are yet to be felt.   Economists interpreted the remarks as an indication the Fed is likely to  remain on hold at least for now.</p><p>And now to earnings from big oil.  ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) and Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) posted sharply lower profits despite increases in production.   The two companies cited drops in energy prices.  Exxon profit was nearly  cut in half though it did beat analyst estimates coming in at 75 cents per  share.  Chevron (NYSE:CVX) earnings fell 36 percent to 1.36 per share,  missing estimates of $1.45.  In trading, shares of Exxon rose 3 percent.   Chevron (NYSE:CVX) was up a fraction.</p><p>And now to merger news.  Google`s parent Alphabet is buying Fitbit for more  than $2 billion.  On the surface, the get-together may seem odd since  Fitbit once dominated the wearables market, but no longer does.  But that  doesn`t stop investors from sending shares of both stocks higher, with  Fitbit rising 15 percent.</p><p>Josh Lipton has more.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JOSH LIPTON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Google (NASDAQ:GOOG)  CEO Sundar Pichai has been moving hard into hardware, dedicating time,  money and effort into building out his portfolio, which includes everything  from smartphones to smart speakers.</p><p>Now, Pichai is pushing into wearables with its purchase of smart watch  maker Fitbit.  That company struggled competing with big rivals like Apple  (NASDAQ:AAPL).  Its stock is down nearly 90 percent from its all-time high.   But Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) clearly thinks its talent and technology are  valuable.</p><p>In a statement, Google`s hardware chief saying: By looking closely with  Fitbit`s team of experts and bringing together the best AI, software and  hardware, we can help spur innovation in wearables and build products to  benefit even more people around the world.</p><p>Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) has a long history of making moves in hardware through  acquisitions from Motorola Mobility, to Dropcam to Nest.  Though some argue  the acquisitions haven`t always yielded benefits.</p><p>JOANNA STERN, WALL STREET JOURNAL:  You got fit bit here that probably no  better company -- maybe Garmin (NASDAQ:GRMN), maybe some of the running  companies doing a little bit of a better job in the fitness, workout pace.   But Fitbit is the one to have.</p><p>The issue with Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) is they bought other fitness companies  and wearable companies before.  They bought Fossil (NASDAQ:FOSL) -- some  tech from Fossil (NASDAQ:FOSL) before.  They bought Misfit, a start-up in  the fitness and wearable space.  Nothing came of it.</p><p>LIPTON:  And as Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) pushes into wearables, it faces plenty  of competition from the likes of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).  The iPhone maker  doesn`t break out how many watches it sells.  But analyst estimate that Tim  Cook`s company has now sold 76 million.</p><p>This is a relatively small deal for Google (NASDAQ:GOOG).  But analyst say  it will likely attract scrutiny in Washington too, given that Google  (NASDAQ:GOOG) like other big tech companies is now clearly on the radar of  regulators.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Josh Lipton in San Francisco.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  It`s time to look at some of today`s \"Upgrades and Downgrades\".</p><p>Pinterest was upgraded to buy from neutral at D.A. Davidson, following its  disappointing quarterly results and its weak guidance.  But the analyst  cites Pinterest`s year over year sales growth as an encouraging sign.  The  price target is $28.  But the stock was down 17 percent to $20.86.</p><p>And booking holdings formally known as Priceline was downgraded to neutral  from buy at Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) Merrill Lynch.  The analyst cites  macro concerns from the online travel industry.  The price target is  $2,160.  The stock fell a fraction to $2,032.02.</p><p>Still ahead on this jobs day, the challenges that some companies are facing  when it comes to finding workers to protect against hacks.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>HERERA:  It was a rough week for Boeing (NYSE:BA) and it`s not ending any  better.  Some flight attendants are questioning the safety of the troubled  737 MAX.  Following testimony this we can from Boeing (NYSE:BA) CEO, the  Flight Attendants Union representing American Airlines is questioning  whether the FAA has the resources necessary for oversight moving forward.   American`s 28,000 flight attendants say they will, quote, refuse to walk  onto a plane that may not be safe, end quote.</p><p>Senator Elizabeth Warren released a new outline of her Medicare-for-All  plan.  The single payer program would cost just under $52 trillion over a  decade, which her campaign says is roughly the same as what the current  system costs.  The Democratic presidential hopeful said it would give every  American full health coverage and coverage for long-term care.</p><p>She says her plan would be paid for by corporations and the ultra rich.   Senator Warren added that middle class Americans would not foot the bill.</p><p>In survey after survey, companies say cyber-attacks are one of the biggest  risks to business.  That`s why demand is strong for those who have the  know-thousand to protect networks against hacks but finding those employees  isn`t always easy.</p><p>Kate Rogers (NYSE:ROG) is in Washington with the next installment of \"Help  Wanted\".</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>KATE ROGERS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  As cyber-attacks grow  in frequency and severity around the globe, workers like Mandi Ingersoll  are in high demand.  Ingersoll is an analyst at TDI, a cybersecurity firm  in Washington, D.C., helping clients ensure their networks are safe.</p><p>She began her career in the cyberworld in the Navy, some 20 years ago, and  decided to stick with it after retiring.</p><p>MANDI INGERSOLL, TDI CYBERSECURITY ANALYST:  It`s interesting because it`s  always something new.  You`re never looking at the same thing.  And it`s  important because this is -- I mean, this is not only critical to, you  know, commercial and private sector sites, but also federal government and  military.</p><p>ROGERS:  The firm employed some 70 people in the U.S. and Europe, assessing  and protecting companies, non-governmental organizations and government  agencies from cyber risks.  It`s looking to bring on 15 more workers, a  tall order given the changing cyber workforce.</p><p>Employees are aging out while others simply want to work on shorter term  basis.</p><p>CEO Paul Innella says he has seen a new phenomenon given the low supply of  skilled workers relative to demand</p><p>PAUL INNELLA, TDI CEO:  I learned the term ghosting but we have -- we are  finding that folks will quite genuinely not show up and never return your  call again.  Now, we have found some folks who we have hired who just  didn`t show up and we never heard from them again.  So I do believe there  are some unique challenges that we have never seen before.</p><p>ROGERS:  TDI offers competitive pay and benefits, tuition and certification  stipends, as well as bonuses, but the fight for tech talent is ramping up  particularly here in D.C. as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) moves into the second  headquarters.</p><p>Workers are needed beyond just TDI.  Right now, more than 2.5 million  people are working in cybersecurity jobs around the globe.  Some 4 million  workers are needed close the skills gap and half a million of those workers  are in demand here in the U.S. to properly defend organizations.</p><p>DAVID SHEARER, ISC2 CEO:  We need skilled people right now that can do the  work but we also need to be building that cadre of the next wave of people  coming in to replace those that will be retiring in the not-too-distant  future.</p><p>ROGERS:  And the work has never been more important.</p><p>SHEARER:  The volume of attacks and the sophistication of attacks from  around the world just continue to increase, yet the workforce is  constrained.  The demand for qualified people continues to go up, the  sophistication of the attacks going up.</p><p>ROGERS:  For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Kate Rogers (NYSE:ROG) in  Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  Mixed results for AIG.  And that`s where we begin tonight`s  \"Market Focus\".</p><p>The company missed earnings estimates due to sluggish demand in the  insurer`s life and retirement businesses.  But AIG did report better than  expected revenue and narrowed its loss from last year on smaller  catastrophe losses.  Shares were up about 1.5 percent to $53.76.</p><p>Colgate-Palmolive (NYSE:CL) saw an increase in organic sales, thanks to  volume increases and higher prices.  But the consumer products maker was  also hurt by lower sales in Europe.  And this led to a slight miss on  revenue but Colgate was able to top Wall Street`s earning expectations.   Shares fell more than 2.5 percent to $66.81.</p><p>Strong demand for its cancer drug Imbruvica and a smaller than expected  drop in sales of its blockbuster drug Humira helped AbbVie beat estimates.   The company also raised the lower end of its outlook and it raised its  dividend 10 percent.  Shares rose nearly 3 percent to $81.75.</p><p>It is time now for our weekly market monitor who has a list of stocks he  says you should be buying right now.  He is Mark Lehmann, and he is  president of JMP Securities.</p><p>Mark, welcome.  Nice to have you here.</p><p>MARK LEHMANN, JMP SECURITIES PRESIDENT:  Thanks, Sue.  Appreciate it.</p><p>HERERA:  Let`s get right to your picks.</p><p>Lyft is one of them.  You say they put up a buying quarter.  Why else do  you like the stock?</p><p>LEHMANN:  Well, they did put up a good quarter, the second in a row.   Obviously, it`s controversial like a lot of unicorns but they are gaining  market share.  They`re growing revenue faster than people expected and the  contribution margin means meaning the profit to the bottom line is  accelerating.  I think that bodes well the next couple years.</p><p>They`re putting a good top line.  And I think they`re going to get the  profitability a lot sooner than people thought.  And when that happens, I  expect the stock to take off.</p><p>HERERA:  All right.  Do you have a projection on how much you expect it to  increase?</p><p>LEHMANN:  They`re going to grow revenues -- I think they`re going to  continue to grow revenues close to 40 percent to 50 percent, and they beat  the profit, the bottom line number by 5 percent sequentially in the  quarter.  That`s much bigger than people expected.</p><p>Again, I think this will accelerate faster than people wanted in the  models.  And if that happens by 2022, I think this thing will be very  profitable and you`re going to find the stock taking off.</p><p>HERERA:  All right.  Next on the list is Anaplan and it`s a planning tool  for large organizations.</p><p>LEHMANN:   It is.  It`s a planning software company based in the cloud.   They are replacing legacy vendors.  That too is growing north of 30, 35  percent.</p><p>It`s a rich stock.  This is not a company that`s unfounded.  Meaning the  street paid attention to it.  It`s down about 20 percent of off the all- time high.</p><p>But this is for big organizations to do big planning collaboration.   Companies like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), big, chunky organizations.  And  they`re the best at it.</p><p>And I like the fact that we are replacing legacy systems and they`re in the  cloud.  And we see that growing 35 percent for the next couple, three years  and if that happens, the stock will be a lot a lot higher.</p><p>HERERA:  You mentioned Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and that is your third pick.   You really like that one.</p><p>LEHMANN:  I do.  I mean, they have an interesting quarter and they have an  interesting ten days.  They put up less than stellar quarter at least on  the bottom line recently.  They lost a very large contract from the federal  government that went to Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT).</p><p>But the growth in the cloud is continuing to accelerate.  What they are  doing obviously in the businesses that every consumer knows continues to  accelerate.  They`re gaining market share.  And at the same time, they`re  also investing in the future in the cloud and data storage businesses that  are continuing to accelerate to the cloud.</p><p>That hasn`t even begun to take over from the legacy systems.  That`s why we  like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and that`s why we will continue to see the stock  ascend over the next few years.</p><p>And when you have the chance to buy in dips like this weekend, pay  attention and you should do that.</p><p>HERERA:  All right.  Mark, we`ll leave it there.  Thank you.</p><p>Mark Lehmann with JMP Securities.</p><p>Coming up, secondhand shopping, it`s not a new idea.  But selling used,  hard to find items for men is.  And now, it`s a big business that started  out as a \"Bright Idea\".</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>HERERA:  There are reports tonight that Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) (NYSE:CCS)  NBC is leaning towards making its Peacock streaming service free to  everyone.  According to CNBC, the free service would be the ad-supported  version.  It would be the first free streaming on demand video service from  a major U.S. media provider.</p><p>The report comes on the same day as the launch of Apple`s streaming  service, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) TV.  As you may know, Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA)  (NYSE:CCS) is the parent company of CNBC which also produces this program.</p><p>Well, legend has it that the term metro sexual first appeared in a British  newspaper 25 years ago this month.  Ever since, it seems, men have been  talking fashion.  Not business suits so much but street wear.  Women may  spend more but the men`s market is growing quickly.</p><p>And that`s why a team of New York City entrepreneurs got the \"Bright Idea\"  to create an online marketplace focused on men`s clothing.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  Arun Gupta found a taste for fashion while he was in college at  Yale, but there was one problem.</p><p>ARUN GUPTA, GRAILED CEO AND CO-FOUNDER:  I couldn`t afford any of it,  because it`s pretty expensive.</p><p>HERERA:  Gupta found that guys, yes, guys, were talking fashion online  occasionally, making deals on used, hard to find items.  Holy Grails to  some.</p><p>GUPTA:  It`s like, oh, like this pair of boots came out three years ago,  like I missed it when they came out and now, they`re like impossible to  find anywhere.  So, that`s my grail basically.</p><p>HERERA:  By 2013, sites were selling used cars, furniture, even women`s  fashion.  Men`s fashion was fashionably late to the game.</p><p>GUPTA:  I was like, look, this secondary market thing will be huge.  I want  to get in on this situation.</p><p>HERERA:  So, Gupta built a rudimentary site and began convincing folks in  the chat rooms to use it.</p><p>GUPTA:  Oh, that is sick.</p><p>HERERA:  By 2014, Julian Connor, a software specialist, along with Jake  Metzger who has since moved on teamed with Gupta to cofound Grailed.  It  now boasts some of 4 million users per month.</p><p>Connor used early versions of the site and still shops there today.</p><p>JULIAN CONNOR, GRAILED CTO AND CO-FOUNDER:  I really like avant-garde  fashion and so the jacket and shirt are both from an American-born designer  that now lives in Paris.  His name is Rick Owens.</p><p>GUPTA:  I love that.</p><p>HERERA:  Grailed collects a 6 percent fee on each transaction, 1.2 million  of them in 2018, at an average price of about $150 per unit.  High-end  items can get the rare art treatment, selling for tens of thousands of  dollars.</p><p>GUPTA:  These cool Prada dress shoes for $123.</p><p>HERERA:  Sometimes their vintage goods provide a surprise.</p><p>GUPTA:  This is a rolling stone shirt from the `94, `95 tour.  Super steal.   I got it for 50 bucks.  It was awesome.</p><p>HERERA:  Meticulous curation dictated by customer demand has built a  mystique.</p><p>GUPTA:  It`s like Margiela piece, like Margiela, the super iconic designer,  and the red sleeve is the whole thing.  If you saw the latest first \"Star  Wars\" movie, \"The Force Awakens\", the C-3PO has a red arm, which like may  or may not be of influence by this jacket.</p><p>HERERA:  Some rare items are sold.  Others get archived.</p><p>GUPTA:  This is an Issey Miyaki jacket.  You remember Steve Jobs` iconic,  like black turtle necks.  He`s the guy who designed all his turtle necks,  basically.</p><p>HERERA:  Celebrities will sometimes borrow items to shoot magazine covers.   And musicians have worn their pieces on stage.</p><p>GUPTA:  That is Raf Simons but it`s based off of the New Order album art  cover for \"Power, Corruption &amp; Lies\", where all these details are hand- painted.</p><p>CAM WOLF, GQ STYLE AND FEATURES WRITER:  I think it`s really interesting to  see how fashion now is just as much a hobby for guys as is, you know,  sports or anything else.</p><p>HERERA:  \"GQ\" writer Cam Wolf.</p><p>WOLF:  You have to be well-versed in sort of these archive pieces.  And I  think Grailed has really helped to educate that and serve that consumer.</p><p>GUPTA:  This is another piece.</p><p>HERERA:  And increasingly stylish consumer looking for a deal on high-end,  second-hand stuff.</p><p>CONNOR:  The value proposition that we provide is so salient to many.  I  don`t think we`ve had this same sort of growth challenges that other  businesses have had.</p><p>GUPTA:  It all starts with talking to the consumer and understanding what  it is they want.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  Grailed is constantly expanding its reach.  What started with  about 100 items now has almost 2 million pieces listed for sale from around  the world.  And two years ago, it launched the sister site which focuses on  women`s clothing.</p><p>Before we go, here`s another look at the day`s final numbers on Wall  Street.  The Dow rose 301 points.  The Nasdaq and S&amp;P 500 both finished at  a record.  And it was the fourth straight week of gains for all of the  major averages.</p><p>And that is NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for tonight.

The S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq closed at all-time highs as the job market shows its resilience.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Good fit? Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) buys Fitbit for more than $2 billion, extending Google`s reach into consumer electronics.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Second chances. Used clothing is big business. Tonight, we meet the entrepreneurs who had the bright idea to focus on men and their growing love of fashion.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Those stories and more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Friday, November 1st.</p><p>Good evening, everyone, and welcome. Bill Griffeth has the evening off.</p><p>Wall Street ended the week in rally mode. The S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq closed at records, thanks to both a much stronger than expected jobs report and progress on trade negotiations between the U.S. and China. That reassured investors about the health of the economy, and it sent stocks higher.</p><p>Here are the closing numbers for you. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 301 points to close at 27,347. The Nasdaq was up 94. And the S&amp;P 500 added 29. And it was the fourth straight week of gains for all of the major averages.</p><p>Bob Pisani has more from the New York Stock Exchange.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BOB PISANI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Stocks were back in rally mode on the first day of November, both S&amp;P and Nasdaq, record highs today. We had a notable shift in the market narrative. We`ve gone from fears of a recession in 2020 -- remember that a few months ago, to a belief that the global economy will be slowing but still growing.</p><p>But today`s data is taking the edge off of even that slowdown narrative. October jobs, better than expected. And we had strong revisions from prior months.</p><p>Elsewhere, the U.S. manufacturing was still weak, but it was better than feared. And new orders did not slip. That`s a critical component. It looks ahead the new orders.</p><p>Overseas, even China manufacturing was better than expected. And trade sentiment is lifting for the moment.</p><p>So as a result, we`ve got some breakouts, not just the S&amp;P 500 but even on a global scale, European indexes hitting new highs today. Japanese indexes hitting new highs as well.</p><p>Here in the U.S., new highs in the Nasdaq 100, in materials names, health care names and semiconductors as well.</p><p>So, what`s missing here? What would move the markets up more, say another 10 percent?</p><p>So, three things would really move the needle. First, higher bond yields would move money out of bonds and into stocks. That`s a help.</p><p>Second, trade. We need to take the December 15th tariffs that are supposed to come on off the table.</p><p>And finally, this is probably important, is earnings. This slow growth narrative has believed that 2020 earnings would be flat to up mid-single digits. But if we get better economic data across the board, that`s going to force traders to rethink those estimates for 2020 and that means rethinking them up.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Bob Pisani at the New York Stock Exchange.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: And now to the employment report which as we mentioned was surprisingly strong despite a cooling economy.</p><p>Steve Liesman takes a closer look at the state of the American labor market.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>STEVE LIESMAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Even while the government reported that job growth slowed in October, Wall Street still saw the report as on the strong side and likely to help keep moderate U.S. growth humming along. The government said the unemployment rate ticked up 0.1 to 3.6 percent and that 128,000 jobs were added. Now, that is the lowest in five months.</p><p>But job growth bass better than the meager 75,000 that Wall Street had forecast, and lackluster job growth from the prior two months were revised upwards by a combined 95,000 jobs. Finally, the number was depressed by striking GM workers who have now gone back to work.</p><p>JAN HATZUS, GOLDMAN SACHS: If you look at the jobs number now you are not seeing that much slowdown. It`s a little bit surprising, because other indicators do show a slowdown over the last year. But the job market is just chugging along for now.</p><p>LIESMAN: There was strong growth in leisure and hospital, up by 61,000. Education and health services up by nearly 41,000. Wholesale trade up nearly 11,000.</p><p>But government down 3,000 because census workers let go and manufacturing was down by 36,000. But those manufacturing job losses should turn into gains this month when striking GM workers return to work. And that leads to more upbeat news on the economy.</p><p>JASON FURMAN, PETERSON INSTITUTE FOR INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS: I don`t think any one number on jobs should change our view of the economy. This one changes mine a bit more than the average month does. You have the pace of job growth in the last three months exceeding the pace of job growth we had in the first seven months of this year. That`s something that is surprising given all the increase in uncertainty we have seen.</p><p>LIESMAN: What`s so important about the report is that global economic weakness and trade war have plunged the U.S. manufacturing sector into what some are already calling a recession but better job growth should mean strong consumer spending that can help growth continue at the recent modest pace of around 2 percent.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Steve Liesman.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: Let`s turn now to Ethan Harris (NYSE:HRS) to talk more about the stronger than expected jobs report and the economy as a whole. He is the head of global economic research at Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) Merrill Lynch.</p><p>Ethan, welcome back. Nice to see you tonight.</p><p>ETHAN HARRIS, BANK OF AMERICAMERRILL LYNCH: Thank you.</p><p>HERERA: Let`s start, first of all, with your reaction to the report and why you think basically these reports and the previous revisions mean the labor market is so strong.</p><p>HARRIS: Well, I agree with the other people commenting before me. I mean, this is a very strong report, if you take out the distortions due to the strike and laying off of temporary census workers. It`s like 185,000 or something like that gain. So, it`s a very strong gain.</p><p>I think we need to put it in a broader context. It is true that the labor market has held up a lot better than expected. But if you look across the economy, you do see tremendous weakness in the manufacturing sector. You see it in business investment.</p><p>And so, while the job numbers look great and the service side of the economy producing most of the jobs look great, the manufacturing side of the economy does not look so great. So, it`s still a mixed picture out there, even with this good data.</p><p>HERERA: You make the point, as I look at my notes, that`s what`s happening is you say the companies have responded to things like the trade war by cutting investment rather than jobs. Why do that?</p><p>HARRIS: Well, think about it from a corporate perspective. You have no idea where tariffs are going to be two years from now. And so, if you`re going to make a commitment to new investment, to buy new plant and equipment, that`s something you can`t give back. You know, you have to put that money in.</p><p>So, you`re not doing capital investment until you have some clarity around what your future cost structure is going to look like. On the other hand, you`ll hire. If you have business and you have demand for products, you need to produce products. So you will add workers.</p><p>If it turns out the trade war is really bad and you need to lower the employment at one of your the outlets, you do it. But you can`t return a factory whereas you can lay off a worker. So, the factories and the investment side is much weaker than the labor side.</p><p>HERERA: The New York Fed and the Atlanta Fed both downgraded forecasts of economic growth. Are you at all worried about economic growth overall in the economy, separate from labor?</p><p>HARRIS: Well, I mean, the economy is slowing down. I mean, away from this report and the recent reports in general have been a little bit better on payrolls. There is a broad slowdown going on. We think that growth will slow to about 1.3 percent in the fourth quarter down from 1.9 this quarter. So, it`s a little bit further weakening.</p><p>I`m not worried about a recession or a deeper downturn as long as we do get a trade deal, because with the trade deal, that intense uncertainty in the business world will abate a bit. And the economy should start to stabilize and improve. We also have a Fed that is working ready hard to support growth.</p><p>So, as long as the trade war is under control, growth should pick up early next year.</p><p>HERERA: Ethan Harris (NYSE:HRS) with Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Merrill Lynch -- Ethan, thank you so much.</p><p>HARRIS: Thank you.</p><p>HERERA: And as we just discussed, one of the biggest issues for the market is indeed trade. President Trump today said a deal with China is coming along well.</p><p>Kayla Tausche takes a look at the progress being made.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>KAYLA TAUSCHE, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Top negotiators from the U.S. and China continued talks over a principals-level phone call today with differing views of what was achieved on trade. China`s Ministry of Commerce says a consensus on principles was reached. The U.S. trade representative said the call was constructive and that the two sides made progress in a variety of areas and are in the process of resolving outstanding issues.</p><p>As discussions continue, so does the search for a venue for President Trump and President Xi to sign the phase one of the broader deal after Chile cancelled the APEC summit later this month. Trump yesterday tweeted the new location would be announced soon.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Kayla Tausche in Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: The vice chair of the Federal Reserve says monetary policy is in a good place. Richard Clarida pointed to the central bank`s three interest rate cuts this year and said the full effects are yet to be felt. Economists interpreted the remarks as an indication the Fed is likely to remain on hold at least for now.</p><p>And now to earnings from big oil. ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) and Chevron (NYSE:CVX) posted sharply lower profits despite increases in production. The two companies cited drops in energy prices. Exxon profit was nearly cut in half though it did beat analyst estimates coming in at 75 cents per share. Chevron (NYSE:CVX) earnings fell 36 percent to 1.36 per share, missing estimates of $1.45. In trading, shares of Exxon rose 3 percent. Chevron (NYSE:CVX) was up a fraction.</p><p>And now to merger news. Google`s parent Alphabet is buying Fitbit for more than $2 billion. On the surface, the get-together may seem odd since Fitbit once dominated the wearables market, but no longer does. But that doesn`t stop investors from sending shares of both stocks higher, with Fitbit rising 15 percent.</p><p>Josh Lipton has more.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JOSH LIPTON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) CEO Sundar Pichai has been moving hard into hardware, dedicating time, money and effort into building out his portfolio, which includes everything from smartphones to smart speakers.</p><p>Now, Pichai is pushing into wearables with its purchase of smart watch maker Fitbit. That company struggled competing with big rivals like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). Its stock is down nearly 90 percent from its all-time high. But Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) clearly thinks its talent and technology are valuable.</p><p>In a statement, Google`s hardware chief saying: By looking closely with Fitbit`s team of experts and bringing together the best AI, software and hardware, we can help spur innovation in wearables and build products to benefit even more people around the world.</p><p>Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) has a long history of making moves in hardware through acquisitions from Motorola Mobility, to Dropcam to Nest. Though some argue the acquisitions haven`t always yielded benefits.</p><p>JOANNA STERN, WALL STREET JOURNAL: You got fit bit here that probably no better company -- maybe Garmin (NASDAQ:GRMN), maybe some of the running companies doing a little bit of a better job in the fitness, workout pace. But Fitbit is the one to have.</p><p>The issue with Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) is they bought other fitness companies and wearable companies before. They bought Fossil (NASDAQ:FOSL) -- some tech from Fossil (NASDAQ:FOSL) before. They bought Misfit, a start-up in the fitness and wearable space. Nothing came of it.</p><p>LIPTON: And as Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) pushes into wearables, it faces plenty of competition from the likes of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). The iPhone maker doesn`t break out how many watches it sells. But analyst estimate that Tim Cook`s company has now sold 76 million.</p><p>This is a relatively small deal for Google (NASDAQ:GOOG). But analyst say it will likely attract scrutiny in Washington too, given that Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) like other big tech companies is now clearly on the radar of regulators.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Josh Lipton in San Francisco.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: It`s time to look at some of today`s \"Upgrades and Downgrades\".</p><p>Pinterest was upgraded to buy from neutral at D.A. Davidson, following its disappointing quarterly results and its weak guidance. But the analyst cites Pinterest`s year over year sales growth as an encouraging sign. The price target is $28. But the stock was down 17 percent to $20.86.</p><p>And booking holdings formally known as Priceline was downgraded to neutral from buy at Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) Merrill Lynch. The analyst cites macro concerns from the online travel industry. The price target is $2,160. The stock fell a fraction to $2,032.02.</p><p>Still ahead on this jobs day, the challenges that some companies are facing when it comes to finding workers to protect against hacks.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>HERERA: It was a rough week for Boeing (NYSE:BA) and it`s not ending any better. Some flight attendants are questioning the safety of the troubled 737 MAX. Following testimony this we can from Boeing (NYSE:BA) CEO, the Flight Attendants Union representing American Airlines is questioning whether the FAA has the resources necessary for oversight moving forward. American`s 28,000 flight attendants say they will, quote, refuse to walk onto a plane that may not be safe, end quote.</p><p>Senator Elizabeth Warren released a new outline of her Medicare-for-All plan. The single payer program would cost just under $52 trillion over a decade, which her campaign says is roughly the same as what the current system costs. The Democratic presidential hopeful said it would give every American full health coverage and coverage for long-term care.</p><p>She says her plan would be paid for by corporations and the ultra rich. Senator Warren added that middle class Americans would not foot the bill.</p><p>In survey after survey, companies say cyber-attacks are one of the biggest risks to business. That`s why demand is strong for those who have the know-thousand to protect networks against hacks but finding those employees isn`t always easy.</p><p>Kate Rogers (NYSE:ROG) is in Washington with the next installment of \"Help Wanted\".</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>KATE ROGERS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: As cyber-attacks grow in frequency and severity around the globe, workers like Mandi Ingersoll are in high demand. Ingersoll is an analyst at TDI, a cybersecurity firm in Washington, D.C., helping clients ensure their networks are safe.</p><p>She began her career in the cyberworld in the Navy, some 20 years ago, and decided to stick with it after retiring.</p><p>MANDI INGERSOLL, TDI CYBERSECURITY ANALYST: It`s interesting because it`s always something new. You`re never looking at the same thing. And it`s important because this is -- I mean, this is not only critical to, you know, commercial and private sector sites, but also federal government and military.</p><p>ROGERS: The firm employed some 70 people in the U.S. and Europe, assessing and protecting companies, non-governmental organizations and government agencies from cyber risks. It`s looking to bring on 15 more workers, a tall order given the changing cyber workforce.</p><p>Employees are aging out while others simply want to work on shorter term basis.</p><p>CEO Paul Innella says he has seen a new phenomenon given the low supply of skilled workers relative to demand</p><p>PAUL INNELLA, TDI CEO: I learned the term ghosting but we have -- we are finding that folks will quite genuinely not show up and never return your call again. Now, we have found some folks who we have hired who just didn`t show up and we never heard from them again. So I do believe there are some unique challenges that we have never seen before.</p><p>ROGERS: TDI offers competitive pay and benefits, tuition and certification stipends, as well as bonuses, but the fight for tech talent is ramping up particularly here in D.C. as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) moves into the second headquarters.</p><p>Workers are needed beyond just TDI. Right now, more than 2.5 million people are working in cybersecurity jobs around the globe. Some 4 million workers are needed close the skills gap and half a million of those workers are in demand here in the U.S. to properly defend organizations.</p><p>DAVID SHEARER, ISC2 CEO: We need skilled people right now that can do the work but we also need to be building that cadre of the next wave of people coming in to replace those that will be retiring in the not-too-distant future.</p><p>ROGERS: And the work has never been more important.</p><p>SHEARER: The volume of attacks and the sophistication of attacks from around the world just continue to increase, yet the workforce is constrained. The demand for qualified people continues to go up, the sophistication of the attacks going up.</p><p>ROGERS: For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Kate Rogers (NYSE:ROG) in Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: Mixed results for AIG. And that`s where we begin tonight`s \"Market Focus\".</p><p>The company missed earnings estimates due to sluggish demand in the insurer`s life and retirement businesses. But AIG did report better than expected revenue and narrowed its loss from last year on smaller catastrophe losses. Shares were up about 1.5 percent to $53.76.</p><p>Colgate-Palmolive (NYSE:CL) saw an increase in organic sales, thanks to volume increases and higher prices. But the consumer products maker was also hurt by lower sales in Europe. And this led to a slight miss on revenue but Colgate was able to top Wall Street`s earning expectations. Shares fell more than 2.5 percent to $66.81.</p><p>Strong demand for its cancer drug Imbruvica and a smaller than expected drop in sales of its blockbuster drug Humira helped AbbVie beat estimates. The company also raised the lower end of its outlook and it raised its dividend 10 percent. Shares rose nearly 3 percent to $81.75.</p><p>It is time now for our weekly market monitor who has a list of stocks he says you should be buying right now. He is Mark Lehmann, and he is president of JMP Securities.</p><p>Mark, welcome. Nice to have you here.</p><p>MARK LEHMANN, JMP SECURITIES PRESIDENT: Thanks, Sue. Appreciate it.</p><p>HERERA: Let`s get right to your picks.</p><p>Lyft is one of them. You say they put up a buying quarter. Why else do you like the stock?</p><p>LEHMANN: Well, they did put up a good quarter, the second in a row. Obviously, it`s controversial like a lot of unicorns but they are gaining market share. They`re growing revenue faster than people expected and the contribution margin means meaning the profit to the bottom line is accelerating. I think that bodes well the next couple years.</p><p>They`re putting a good top line. And I think they`re going to get the profitability a lot sooner than people thought. And when that happens, I expect the stock to take off.</p><p>HERERA: All right. Do you have a projection on how much you expect it to increase?</p><p>LEHMANN: They`re going to grow revenues -- I think they`re going to continue to grow revenues close to 40 percent to 50 percent, and they beat the profit, the bottom line number by 5 percent sequentially in the quarter. That`s much bigger than people expected.</p><p>Again, I think this will accelerate faster than people wanted in the models. And if that happens by 2022, I think this thing will be very profitable and you`re going to find the stock taking off.</p><p>HERERA: All right. Next on the list is Anaplan and it`s a planning tool for large organizations.</p><p>LEHMANN: It is. It`s a planning software company based in the cloud. They are replacing legacy vendors. That too is growing north of 30, 35 percent.</p><p>It`s a rich stock. This is not a company that`s unfounded. Meaning the street paid attention to it. It`s down about 20 percent of off the all- time high.</p><p>But this is for big organizations to do big planning collaboration. Companies like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), big, chunky organizations. And they`re the best at it.</p><p>And I like the fact that we are replacing legacy systems and they`re in the cloud. And we see that growing 35 percent for the next couple, three years and if that happens, the stock will be a lot a lot higher.</p><p>HERERA: You mentioned Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and that is your third pick. You really like that one.</p><p>LEHMANN: I do. I mean, they have an interesting quarter and they have an interesting ten days. They put up less than stellar quarter at least on the bottom line recently. They lost a very large contract from the federal government that went to Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT).</p><p>But the growth in the cloud is continuing to accelerate. What they are doing obviously in the businesses that every consumer knows continues to accelerate. They`re gaining market share. And at the same time, they`re also investing in the future in the cloud and data storage businesses that are continuing to accelerate to the cloud.</p><p>That hasn`t even begun to take over from the legacy systems. That`s why we like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and that`s why we will continue to see the stock ascend over the next few years.</p><p>And when you have the chance to buy in dips like this weekend, pay attention and you should do that.</p><p>HERERA: All right. Mark, we`ll leave it there. Thank you.</p><p>Mark Lehmann with JMP Securities.</p><p>Coming up, secondhand shopping, it`s not a new idea. But selling used, hard to find items for men is. And now, it`s a big business that started out as a \"Bright Idea\".</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>HERERA: There are reports tonight that Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) (NYSE:CCS) NBC is leaning towards making its Peacock streaming service free to everyone. According to CNBC, the free service would be the ad-supported version. It would be the first free streaming on demand video service from a major U.S. media provider.</p><p>The report comes on the same day as the launch of Apple`s streaming service, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) TV. As you may know, Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) (NYSE:CCS) is the parent company of CNBC which also produces this program.</p><p>Well, legend has it that the term metro sexual first appeared in a British newspaper 25 years ago this month. Ever since, it seems, men have been talking fashion. Not business suits so much but street wear. Women may spend more but the men`s market is growing quickly.</p><p>And that`s why a team of New York City entrepreneurs got the \"Bright Idea\" to create an online marketplace focused on men`s clothing.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: Arun Gupta found a taste for fashion while he was in college at Yale, but there was one problem.</p><p>ARUN GUPTA, GRAILED CEO AND CO-FOUNDER: I couldn`t afford any of it, because it`s pretty expensive.</p><p>HERERA: Gupta found that guys, yes, guys, were talking fashion online occasionally, making deals on used, hard to find items. Holy Grails to some.</p><p>GUPTA: It`s like, oh, like this pair of boots came out three years ago, like I missed it when they came out and now, they`re like impossible to find anywhere. So, that`s my grail basically.</p><p>HERERA: By 2013, sites were selling used cars, furniture, even women`s fashion. Men`s fashion was fashionably late to the game.</p><p>GUPTA: I was like, look, this secondary market thing will be huge. I want to get in on this situation.</p><p>HERERA: So, Gupta built a rudimentary site and began convincing folks in the chat rooms to use it.</p><p>GUPTA: Oh, that is sick.</p><p>HERERA: By 2014, Julian Connor, a software specialist, along with Jake Metzger who has since moved on teamed with Gupta to cofound Grailed. It now boasts some of 4 million users per month.</p><p>Connor used early versions of the site and still shops there today.</p><p>JULIAN CONNOR, GRAILED CTO AND CO-FOUNDER: I really like avant-garde fashion and so the jacket and shirt are both from an American-born designer that now lives in Paris. His name is Rick Owens.</p><p>GUPTA: I love that.</p><p>HERERA: Grailed collects a 6 percent fee on each transaction, 1.2 million of them in 2018, at an average price of about $150 per unit. High-end items can get the rare art treatment, selling for tens of thousands of dollars.</p><p>GUPTA: These cool Prada dress shoes for $123.</p><p>HERERA: Sometimes their vintage goods provide a surprise.</p><p>GUPTA: This is a rolling stone shirt from the `94, `95 tour. Super steal. I got it for 50 bucks. It was awesome.</p><p>HERERA: Meticulous curation dictated by customer demand has built a mystique.</p><p>GUPTA: It`s like Margiela piece, like Margiela, the super iconic designer, and the red sleeve is the whole thing. If you saw the latest first \"Star Wars\" movie, \"The Force Awakens\", the C-3PO has a red arm, which like may or may not be of influence by this jacket.</p><p>HERERA: Some rare items are sold.

The Trump rally continues, sending the Dow to a record, although not all sectors go along for the ride. What should you do now?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Trumped up. After the election, mortgage rates spike. Is it temporary, or the new normal in housing?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And, taxing question. How much will you get if a Trump tax plan goes through?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">All that and more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Thursday, November 10th.</p><p>Good evening, everyone. And welcome. Sue Herera has the night off.</p><p>Well, call it the Trump rally day two. It is early, very, very early. But all the naysayers and prognosticators who said the Trump win would send stocks down hard have been off the mark. Today, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, supposedly a snapshot of the economy and home of some of the bluest of blue chips rocketed to a record close.</p><p>But not everyone participated. We`ll have more on that in just a moment.</p><p>The Dow rose 218 points to 18,807, a record. The NASDAQ lost 42. And the S&amp;P 500 rose four.</p><p>Bob Pisani has more on the rally.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BOB PISANI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: What a week of trading. We went from rallying on Monday, going into the election, to down 800 points the night of the election, to soaring to record heights just today.</p><p>What`s going on? There`s a new trading mentality on Wall Street right now. Let`s call it the reflation trade. Buy into sectors that will benefit from less regulation and more fiscal stimulus, that means spending. Infrastructure names like Martin Marietta Materials (NYSE:MLM) and Home Depot (NYSE:HD), and bank stocks like J.P. Morgan and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) all hit new highs today.</p><p>Now, on the other side, on the downside, interest rate sensitive groups like telecom, real estate, and utilities are being hit by concerns of higher interest rates. And big tech like Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) are down on trade concerns.</p><p>So, this can this continue these trends? Well, sure they can, but we may be approaching the limits to how far banks and pharmaceuticals, for example, can go without very specific changes in the legislation. We need to see that. We need to hear more on the specifics of less regulation, more stimulus, and tax reform. And that may not happen until January.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Bob Pisani at the New York Stock Exchange.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN: As Bob mentioned, big name tech stocks have not participated in this post-election stock euphoria.</p><p>Deirdre Bosa tells us more now on why this notable group is sitting out the rally.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DEIRDRE BOSA, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Transition begins to a Trump administration, shock waves are reverberating throughout Silicon Valley. Executives are grappling with a new reality.</p><p>This morning, Alphabet`s executive chairman, Eric Schmidt, acknowledged the stakes.</p><p>ERIC SCHMIDT, ALPHABET EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN: The top five most valued companies in America today are Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). So, if the all R team is very focused on big business, there`s five businesses right there.</p><p>What do each and every one of those companies need? High value, high quality, high levels of education immigration. Every one of them is powered completely by those policies, which have been stuck for 20 years.</p><p>BOSA: But those policies may be changing as a new order takes over, one that has become increasingly hostile.</p><p>Never before has the tech industry been so united against a presidential candidate than it was against Donald Trump. Trump took shots at some of the biggest names in tech. He called for a boycott on Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), claimed that IBM was moving jobs outside the U.S., and suggested that Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) was an illegal monopoly.</p><p>In response, Amazon`s CEO Jeff Bezos offered to send Trump to space. But today, he congratulated the president-elect and wished him success.</p><p>In a memo to employees, Apple`s chief Tim Cook said the company`s North Star hasn`t changed and the only way to move forward is to move forward together.</p><p>But some were not as hopeful. Slack CEO Stuart Butterfield said he was heartbroken. While Shervin Pishevar, co-founder of Hyperloop One, suggested that California secede.</p><p>Trump`s hard line stance on immigration is also at odds with the industry`s push for immigration reform, another point Schmidt addressed.</p><p>SCHMIDT: We bring these incredibly intelligent people into our country. We have the best educational system by far, at the college and graduate school level. We kick them out after giving them these incredibly expensive degrees, which we helped subsidized, and then they go and create competitors to our companies, right? Now, come on, guys. Let`s fix that.</p><p>BOSA: There was one prominent in tech who did back Trump -- billionaire investor Peter Thiel. Though his support put him at odds with most Silicon Valley, he is now perhaps ironically one of the few people in tech who will have the new president`s ear.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Deirdre Bosa, San Francisco.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN: Well, the dust hadn`t settled on election night or early morning before bond yields started to rise. And, of course, with rising yields comes rising mortgage rates.</p><p>Diana Olick on what the spike means.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DIANA OLICK, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: As President-elect Donald Trump met with leaders in Washington today, investors around the world continued to back out of the bond market, which in turn pushed U.S. mortgage rates, which loosely followed bond yields to their biggest two-day gain in three years.</p><p>MATTHEW GRAHAM, MORTGAGE NEWS DAILY: In terms of actual interest rates, we moved a quarter of a point higher in two days. And that is relatively unheard of. This is sort of thing we can count without using any of our toes, going back at least a decade. So, it`s definitely a big spike.</p><p>OLICK: The average rate on the popular 30-year fixed mortgages are still historically low, below 4 percent. But the increase would definitely cost buyers in their monthly payment. It could actually keep some buyers from qualifying for a loan. Rising rates also just plain scare buyers.</p><p>GRAHAM: Psychologically, we feel like 3.875 is a much higher rate than 3.625, if that`s what we`re looking at, and that`s what we had access two days ago. So, I think the psychological impact is fairly substantial.</p><p>OLICK: On the larger scale, the rise in interest rates is also hitting the stocks of REITs, which invest in commercial real estate. REITs, which offer high dividends, are a low yield play.</p><p>ALEXANDER GOLDFARB, SANDLER O`NEILL: REITs are derivative of interest rates and the economy. So, if you have interest rates that are going up, that`s going to send REITs down. The flip side of that is that the economy does better, that should help rent growth, which should help REITs.</p><p>OLICK: It really is a grand irony. Donald Trump rode to victory on an electorate looking for a better economy and a better standard of living. But the initial financial market reaction made mortgages more expensive and could push rents even higher.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Diana Olick in Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN: So, can the Trump stock market rally continue? And how did so many get it so wrong? The question of the week, I suppose.</p><p>Joining us now to discuss, David Lebovitz, global strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management, and Brian Rehling, co-head of global fixed income at Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) Investment Institute.</p><p>David, can this rally continue or is it time for a little breather here?</p><p>DAVID LEBOVITZ, J.P. MORGAN ASSET MGMT GLOBAL MARKET STRATEGIST: So, I wouldn`t be surprised to see this rally take a breather. I think there`s a still a lot of uncertainty around what President-elect Trump`s policies will be.</p><p>Obviously, stocks have been rallying on the idea of higher infrastructure spending, you know, decreased regulation, that all sounds very good. But the proof will be in the pudding. We need to get a better sense what his policies are going to look like in order for this rally to be extended.</p><p>So, I wouldn`t be surprised to see stocks, interest rates, take a breather, settle at the levels they`re currently sitting at, and await more information. I mean, that`s really the missing piece to this puzzle.</p><p>MATHISEN: Brian, let`s get some thoughts on bonds. What is the bond market saying?</p><p>BRIAN REHLING, WELLS FARGO INVESTMENT INSTITUTE: Well, the bond market is reacting to all the factors that are occurring in the equity markets. So, both -- when people buy equities, they tend to sell bonds, in simplistic terms. But also on the fiscal outlook, if we get more fiscal spending, we could see growth rates and also inflation increase. That`s a negative for bonds.</p><p>And also on the trade policies, if we have less global trade, we`ll have to buy more things here within the U.S., and that would tend to raise prices, raise inflation. Inflation is not what you want to see if you`re a bond holder.</p><p>So, there`s a lot of nervousness in the bond market, that`s why you see the selling. But there`s not a lot of specifics. So, I do think we`re close to an end to that selling as we await more specifics.</p><p>MATHISEN: Which is sort of a code, Brian, I supposed for saying you think it may be a little overdone here. You know, a lot of people have piled into bonds. Are they ready for what higher interest rates might mean to the total return on bonds and to the value of their shares or their bonds themselves?</p><p>REHLING: Well, if you look at bonds in a portfolio context, if your bonds have not been doing as well, your equities are probably doing better as of late. So, they`re doing what they`re supposed to do, diversify. Also, if you`re thinking of buying bonds and holding them to maturity, that income stream is still good, will still get you the income that you thought. So, there`s no change there.</p><p>But in a total return perspective, bonds alone -- yes, a lot of the policies Trump outlined could increase growth, increase inflation, in general that could be bad for a bond-only holder.</p><p>MATHISEN: David, back to you on stocks, we`ve seen already some of the sectors that have bend or are responding positively to the prospect of the Trump presidency. And some that have reacted negatively. Do you think that`s what we`re going to see going forward, certain sectors doing very well? And talk to me a little bit about technology and why it`s not doing so well.</p><p>LEBOVITZ: So, I think there are a couple of things going on. First, again, I wouldn`t be surprised to see this rally take a bit of a pause. It has been the more cyclical names, the materials, the industrials, the financials, which have led this rally, whereas utilities, telecom, consumer staples, the more defensive parts of the market have been lagging.</p><p>Now, that stands in sharp contrast to what we saw during the first few months of this year when this defensive high dividend, low volatility names were really the name of the game if you will.</p><p>So, do I expect the cyclical leadership to continue? I think as long as the information we get on what the actual policies will be is in line with expectations -- yes, I think cyclicals could continue to outperform. And I would add on top of that, from a valuation standpoint, they look far more attractive than the more defensive sectors.</p><p>On technology, you know, technology is being pushed down, given concerns about what trade agreements may look like going forward. But what I would say the thing to keep in mind about technology is, if we think back to 2015, when we were in a moderate economic growth environment, a little bit of inflation, tech names performed very well, because they have the ability to grow avenues, they have the ability to grow earnings kind of regardless of what the broader macroeconomic backdrop is.</p><p>So, I wouldn`t dismiss the tech names yet. I think that there`s still some opportunity there.</p><p>MATHISEN: David, thank you very much for helping us tonight. Brian, thanks to you as well. We appreciate your insight and your time.</p><p>LEBOVITZ: Thanks for having me.</p><p>REHLING: Thanks.</p><p>MATHISEN: All right. What does a Trump administration mean for the Federal Reserve, as we talk about interest rates?</p><p>Steve Liesman assesses the landscape.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>STEVE LIESMAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: The election of a new president has thrown open questions about the Federal Reserve, ranging from rate policy to personnel. The first hint that Donald Trump could surprise the world by being elected president on Tuesday evening sent the chance of a December rate hike plunging.</p><p>It`s stabilized at lower level the next day and has now come back to be around 63 percent. That`s just about where it was when markets thought Hillary Clinton was likely to be elected.</p><p>Richmond Fed president Jeffrey Lacker today joined other Fed officials in saying the election officials have not changed his view, but the case for raising rates is relatively strong.</p><p>Almost certainly that sense come from a pretty positive stock market reaction to the election. A Dow Jones nosedive could have changed the outlook for a Fed hike. Another area of interest is whether the president- elect will respect the Fed`s independence.</p><p>Trump accused the Fed and Fed Chair Janet Yellen of keeping rates low to help his opponent, levying harsh criticism at the Central Bank.</p><p>Some Fed officials, they felt the need since the election to emphasize the value of independent Fed.</p><p>JOHN WILLIAMS, FEDERAL RESERVE BANK OF SF PRES.: One of the lessons from, you know, 100 years of central banking is that independent central banks tend to perform better, keep inflation low, and that`s something that, you know, most countries, the most successful countries have accepted as the U.S. So, from my perspective, you know, that`s the most important thing, for the Fed to continue to have the ability to make the monetary policy decisions that are best for the long run.</p><p>LIESMAN: Trump economic adviser David Malpass said in an interview this morning that the Fed is independent but didn`t quite stop there.</p><p>DAVID MALPASS, PRES .ELECT TRUMP ADVISOR: The issue, though, is their performance has not been good. We`ve had a really slow growth economy. And so, the question is, will they look inside and see that they`re part of that problem?</p><p>LIESMAN: President Trump will be able to put a large imprint on the Fed in the months and years ahead. Yellen`s term is up in February 2018. And two Fed governorships are vacant now. That means he`ll be able to appoint at least three of the seven members of the board of governors, along with any other governors who might resign.</p><p>The unknown question: now that he`s president, does he want higher rates, or like many who held the Oval Office before him, prefer rates as low as possible?</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Steve Liesman.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN: The lobbying of the Trump administration has begun already. The Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, which represents the major car makers, sent a letter to Trump`s transition team, urging the president- elect to rework fuel economy standards, among other things. Those fuel mandates could cost the industry billions.</p><p>Well, the transition has begun, of course. President Obama and President- elect Trump met face-to-face for the first time at the White House today to discuss policy and life at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.</p><p>John Harwood joins us from Washington.</p><p>John, good evening. How did the meeting go?</p><p>JOHN HARWOOD, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: It went very well. President-elect Trump and President Obama were cordial with one another. They said all the things that the country and the markets wanted to hear about a smooth and peaceful transition. This is just the beginning of it, of course. But they continued the spirit of what Donald Trump expressed on election night, what President Obama expressed yesterday, and I think that`s as much as we can hope for, especially given the fact that Donald Trump is somebody who is taking direct aim at core elements of President Obama`s legacy. If they can work together in that atmosphere, that says something.</p><p>MATHISEN: And the transition from George W. Bush to Mr. Obama went presumably pretty doggone well.</p><p>There was another meeting today, or a couple of them up on Capitol Hill, really almost equally sort of propitious, I suppose, between the president- elect, the speaker, Mr. Ryan, and the majority leader of the Senate, Mr. McConnell.</p><p>What do we know about those meetings?</p><p>HARWOOD: Tyler, that`s one of the unique things about this campaign, is that President-elect Trump had a relationship as strained with leaders of his party, both Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan, that we`ve seen. They kept their distance. He criticized them, especially Paul Ryan, called him weak and ineffective during the campaign.</p><p>But now, they`re going to work together and try to figure out what parts of his agenda and their agenda they can cooperate on. I think Paul Ryan is very hopeful in particular on tax reform, tax cuts, and Donald Trump wants help on immigration. And we will see how they end up.</p><p>But they had a smooth meeting today. They had lunch at the Capitol Hill Club, which is a Republican gathering spot in Washington, adjacent to the national committee. And again, not a lot of substance emerged but cordiality was the rule.</p><p>MATHISEN: How -- quickly, how big a figure will Mr. Pence be in working with Congress?</p><p>HARWOOD: I think a very significant one. One of the things about Donald Trump is that he has not served if government before. Mike Pence has, in particular on Capitol Hill, before becoming a governor. And I think he`s going to exploit his ties with House Republicans to try to mend parts of the relationship that at times has been strained.</p><p>MATHISEN: All right. John, thanks very much. John Harwood in Washington.</p><p>Up next, mouse trapped. Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS) missed Wall Street`s target. We`ll tell you what`s dragging down Mickey, Mini and the crew.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>MATHISEN: The Dow component and widely-held stock Disney (NYSE:DIS) missed expectations in its latest quarter. The media company earned $1.10 a share. That was a full six cents below estimates on just over $13 billion in revenue. That was below a year ago, and Wall Street wanted $13.5 billion. Shares initially fell after hours following the news but then reversed course.</p><p>Julia Boorstin tells us what is hampering Disney (NYSE:DIS).</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JULIA BOORSTIN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Media giant Disney (NYSE:DIS) reported a rare miss of the analysts` expectations of revenue and earnings. The company attributing the miss in part to an extra week in its prior year, skewing this year`s numbers, with the biggest impact on the company`s cable network business. That division and ESPN in particular were in focus in light of growing concerns about the health of the TV bundle. Cable network revenue`s dropped 7 percent in the quarter and operating income dropped 13 percent in the quarter. Dragging on the division: lower advertising and affiliate revenue and higher programming and production costs due to lower ratings and declining subscribers.</p><p>ESPN is certain to be a hot topic for CEO Bob Iger on the company`s earnings call and for Disney (NYSE:DIS) for years to come.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Julia Boorstin in Burbank, California.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN: MetLife (NYSE:MET) launches its largest share buyback ever, and that is where we begin tonight`s \"Market Focus\".</p><p>The nation`s largest life insurer said its board has approved a $3 billion share repurchase program. Earlier this year, the company suspended buybacks to focus on spinning off a part of its life insurance unit, a move that could be completed by early next year. Shares today up nearly 5 percent at $53.74.</p><p>ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) said it will sell $5 billion to $8 billion worth of assets and cut its capital budget by 4 percent next year. The energy giant said moves like this will help it to become profitable when Brent oil prices are at $50 a barrel. The company also launched a $3 billion share buyback. Shares were down nevertheless, 2 percent, $44.78.</p><p>Shares of Fitbit rallied today following unconfirmed reports the maker of the fitness devices received a takeover offer. According to a regulatory filing, China-based ABM Capital proposed to buy the company for $12.50 a share. But Fitbit denies receiving any communication or a bid from any firm. Fitbit shares nevertheless up 3 percent at $8.86.</p><p>A robust back to school shopping season lifted profit and sales of Kohl`s (NYSE:KSS). The department store retailer also reaffirmed its outlook for the year, and increased its share repurchase plan to $2 billion. Shares popped 11.5 percent at $50.97.</p><p>So, what does big business think, really think about a Trump administration? It defends on who you asked, I guess.</p><p>Today in \"New York Times (NYSE:NYT)\" Deal Book Conference, some of the nation`s top executives weighed in.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SCHMIDT: I think we should congratulate the next president of the United States. It`s a significant achievement. Think about, think about most people did not expect this outcome. And it`s a pretty amazing story.</p><p>MARK BERTOLINI, AETNA CEO: Of all the possible outcomes that could have happened in the election, this one wasn`t even on the sheet. And every time somebody brings up and said, what if the Republicans sweep? Get out of the room, that`s not even -- so we started with a fresh piece of paper yesterday, we had no idea how to approach it.</p><p>LLOYD BLANKFEIN, GOLDMAN SACHS CHAIRMAN &amp; CEO: Of course I imagined that he could win. I did not think it was a high probability. But if you told that he was going to win, I would have told you there would have been a rally in the equity markets.</p><p>ROGER GOODELL, NFL COMMISSIONER: Our country has to have more respect for one another. We have to unite. And I saw some very positive signs of that yesterday with our current president, Hillary Clinton`s comments publicly, and others coming together and saying, we have to get together, we have to unite, we have to address some of the issues and work together.</p><p>President-elect Trump is our president. So, let`s get behind him.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MATHISEN: So, how much money might Donald Trump`s proposed tax plan save you? Find out next.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>MATHISEN: President-elect Trump has proposed one of the biggest tax cuts for the wealthy in recent history, while also giving smaller breaks to the middle class.</p><p>Robert Frank breaks down how much money Trump`s plan would put in people`s pockets.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ROBERT FRANK, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Donald Trump`s tax plan would put an average of $2,900 a year back into the pockets of average American taxpayers. The highest earners get the biggest cuts both in dollar and percentage terms. Trump has touted his plan as a way to simplify the tax code and put more spending into the private sector.</p><p>So, the biggest change he`s proposing is to cut the seven current tax rates down to three. It would be 12 percent, 25 percent, and 33 percent. Companies get a big cut too -- the corporate tax rate going from 35 to 15 percent. For those who own their own companies or have partnerships, Trump would allow them to use that 15 percent rate for their personal income tax returns.</p><p>He would also eliminate the estate tax which currently applies to estates worth more than $10 million. And he would cut the capital gains tax.</p><p>So, what does it all mean in dollar terms? Well, if you add in all those tax provisions together, the bottom quintile earns get extra $110 or less than 1 percent of their income. Middle earners get a cut of 2 percent or about a thousand bucks. And the top 1 percent get a cut of 13.5 percent or $214,000 a year. And the top 0.1 percent get a cut of more than 14 percent, giving them an extra $1,066,000 per year.</p><p>Trump`s plan is similar to that put forth by House Speaker Paul Ryan, so it has a good chance of becoming law. And all that extra cash totaling trillions a year could go to consumer spending, investing or saving.</p><p>If there is a price, the Tax Policy Center saying Trump`s plan would add up to $6 trillion to the deficit over the next ten years.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Robert Frank.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN: And finally, Susan Li looks at taxing your sugar intake.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SUSAN LI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: The pop and fizz of soda might be getting more expensive as more cities considered taxing sugary drinks. The latest, Chicago and its surrounding suburbs in Cook County, a population of 5 million.</p><p>The county`s board is proposing a penny an ounce tax on cola, sports drinks, iced tea and energy drinks, and also for the first time, diet sodas. Now, if approved it would be the latest to join six other cities across America that have approved these so-called soda taxes. Four of those cities voting in the levy this week, including in San Francisco.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I think it`s one way to decrease consumption of something that in the end costs a lot more than that tax, because, you know, diabetes is really expensive.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I don`t think we need to tax things we feel are unhealthy. I think people should have the ability to make those types of choices.</p><p>LI: But the soda tax has really worked. One example might be Mexico, which introduced its soda tax nationwide in 2014. In a research study published by medical journal \"BMJ\", during the first year of its act, purchases of sugary drinks fell 6 percent on average each month and reductions were higher among the lower income household which had to suffer the highest levels of obesity.</p><p>Industry group said the cost of the drinks will increase the cost of these drinks by 20 percent. The Cook County Coalition Against Beverage Taxes supports this, saying that \"we remain very concerned that a beverage tax will directly affect working families and small businesses. If this tax passes, consumers will pay more and get less freedom.\"</p><p>Meantime, the world`s largest drink makers say soda levies are not about nutrition at all.</p><p>INDRA NOOYI, PEPSICO CHAIRMAN &amp; CEO: Soda taxes are there to balance budget. It`s got nothing to do with public health issues. If you look at across every one of the jurisdictions, everybody had a budget problem. And everybody, you see taxes coming in, it`s because of budget issues.</p><p>LI: Beverage makers like PepsiCo are also changing their recipes to slash the calorie count. PepsiCo says that at least two-thirds of the company`s beverages will contain 100 calories or less for a 12-ounce serving in less than a decade. Cook County`s vote will be the biggest test yet on the government`s intervention to regulate ones` sugar intake.</p><p>Now, if the ballot gets approved, it would add another city on a growing list of places across America that wants to tax your consumption choices.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Susan Li.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN: Thanks for watching, everybody.

The Trump  rally continues, sending the Dow to a record, although not all sectors go  along for the ride.  What should you do now?  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Trumped up.  After the election, mortgage rates spike.  Is it temporary, or  the new normal in housing?  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And, taxing question.  How much will you get if a Trump tax plan goes  through?  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">All that and more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Thursday, November  10th.  </p><p>Good evening, everyone.  And welcome.  Sue Herera has the night off.  </p><p>Well, call it the Trump rally day two.  It is early, very, very early.  But  all the naysayers and prognosticators who said the Trump win would send  stocks down hard have been off the mark.  Today, the Dow Jones Industrial  Average, supposedly a snapshot of the economy and home of some of the  bluest of blue chips rocketed to a record close.  </p><p>But not everyone participated.  We'll have more on that in just a moment.  </p><p>The Dow rose 218 points to 18,807, a record.  The NASDAQ lost 42.  And the  S&amp;P 500 rose four.  </p><p>Bob Pisani has more on the rally.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BOB PISANI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  What a week of trading.   We went from rallying on Monday, going into the election, to down 800  points the night of the election, to soaring to record heights just today.  </p><p>What's going on?  There's a new trading mentality on Wall Street right now.   Let's call it the reflation trade.  Buy into sectors that will benefit from  less regulation and more fiscal stimulus, that means spending.   Infrastructure names like Martin Marietta Materials (NYSE:MLM) and Home  Depot (NYSE:HD), and bank stocks like J.P. Morgan and Goldman Sachs  (NYSE:GS) all hit new highs today.  </p><p>Now, on the other side, on the downside, interest rate sensitive groups  like telecom, real estate, and utilities are being hit by concerns of  higher interest rates.  And big tech like Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Apple  (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) are down on trade concerns.  </p><p>So, this can this continue these trends?  Well, sure they can, but we may  be approaching the limits to how far banks and pharmaceuticals, for  example, can go without very specific changes in the legislation.  We need  to see that.  We need to hear more on the specifics of less regulation,  more stimulus, and tax reform.  And that may not happen until January.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Bob Pisani at the New York Stock Exchange.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN:   As Bob mentioned, big name tech stocks have not participated in  this post-election stock euphoria.</p><p>Deirdre Bosa tells us more now on why this notable group is sitting out the  rally.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DEIRDRE BOSA, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Transition begins to  a Trump administration, shock waves are reverberating throughout Silicon  Valley.  Executives are grappling with a new reality.  </p><p>This morning, Alphabet's executive chairman, Eric Schmidt, acknowledged the  stakes.  </p><p>ERIC SCHMIDT, ALPHABET EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN:  The top five most valued  companies in America today are Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Google (NASDAQ:GOOG),  Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT).   So, if the all R team is very focused on big business, there's five  businesses right there.</p><p>What do each and every one of those companies need?  High value, high  quality, high levels of education immigration.  Every one of them is  powered completely by those policies, which have been stuck for 20 years.  </p><p>BOSA:  But those policies may be changing as a new order takes over, one  that has become increasingly hostile.  </p><p>Never before has the tech industry been so united against a presidential  candidate than it was against Donald Trump.  Trump took shots at some of  the biggest names in tech.  He called for a boycott on Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL),  claimed that IBM was moving jobs outside the U.S., and suggested that  Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) was an illegal monopoly.  </p><p>In response, Amazon's CEO Jeff Bezos offered to send Trump to space.  But  today, he congratulated the president-elect and wished him success.  </p><p>In a memo to employees, Apple's chief Tim Cook said the company's North  Star hasn't changed and the only way to move forward is to move forward  together.  </p><p>But some were not as hopeful.  Slack CEO Stuart Butterfield said he was  heartbroken.  While Shervin Pishevar, co-founder of Hyperloop One,  suggested that California secede.  </p><p>Trump's hard line stance on immigration is also at odds with the industry's  push for immigration reform, another point Schmidt addressed.  </p><p>SCHMIDT:  We bring these incredibly intelligent people into our country.   We have the best educational system by far, at the college and graduate  school level.  We kick them out after giving them these incredibly  expensive degrees, which we helped subsidized, and then they go and create  competitors to our companies, right?  Now, come on, guys.  Let's fix that.  </p><p>BOSA:  There was one prominent in tech who did back Trump -- billionaire  investor Peter Thiel.  Though his support put him at odds with most Silicon  Valley, he is now perhaps ironically one of the few people in tech who will  have the new president's ear.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Deirdre Bosa, San Francisco.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN:  Well, the dust hadn't settled on election night or early morning  before bond yields started to rise.  And, of course, with rising yields  comes rising mortgage rates.  </p><p>Diana Olick on what the spike means.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DIANA OLICK, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  As President-elect  Donald Trump met with leaders in Washington today, investors around the  world continued to back out of the bond market, which in turn pushed U.S.  mortgage rates, which loosely followed bond yields to their biggest two-day  gain in three years.  </p><p>MATTHEW GRAHAM, MORTGAGE NEWS DAILY:  In terms of actual interest rates, we  moved a quarter of a point higher in two days.  And that is relatively  unheard of.  This is sort of thing we can count without using any of our  toes, going back at least a decade.  So, it's definitely a big spike.</p><p>OLICK:  The average rate on the popular 30-year fixed mortgages are still  historically low, below 4 percent.  But the increase would definitely cost  buyers in their monthly payment.  It could actually keep some buyers from  qualifying for a loan.  Rising rates also just plain scare buyers.  </p><p>GRAHAM:  Psychologically, we feel like 3.875 is a much higher rate than  3.625, if that's what we're looking at, and that's what we had access two  days ago.  So, I think the psychological impact is fairly substantial.  </p><p>OLICK:  On the larger scale, the rise in interest rates is also hitting the  stocks of REITs, which invest in commercial real estate.  REITs, which  offer high dividends, are a low yield play.</p><p>ALEXANDER GOLDFARB, SANDLER O'NEILL:  REITs are derivative of interest  rates and the economy.  So, if you have interest rates that are going up,  that's going to send REITs down.  The flip side of that is that the economy  does better, that should help rent growth, which should help REITs.  </p><p>OLICK:  It really is a grand irony.  Donald Trump rode to victory on an  electorate looking for a better economy and a better standard of living.   But the initial financial market reaction made mortgages more expensive and  could push rents even higher.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Diana Olick in Washington.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN:  So, can the Trump stock market rally continue?  And how did so  many get it so wrong?  The question of the week, I suppose.  </p><p>Joining us now to discuss, David Lebovitz, global strategist at J.P. Morgan  Asset Management, and Brian Rehling, co-head of global fixed income at  Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) Investment Institute.  </p><p>David, can this rally continue or is it time for a little breather here?  </p><p>DAVID LEBOVITZ, J.P. MORGAN ASSET MGMT GLOBAL MARKET STRATEGIST:  So, I  wouldn't be surprised to see this rally take a breather.  I think there's a  still a lot of uncertainty around what President-elect Trump's policies  will be.  </p><p>Obviously, stocks have been rallying on the idea of higher infrastructure  spending, you know, decreased regulation, that all sounds very good.  But  the proof will be in the pudding.  We need to get a better sense what his  policies are going to look like in order for this rally to be extended.  </p><p>So, I wouldn't be surprised to see stocks, interest rates, take a breather,  settle at the levels they're currently sitting at, and await more  information.  I mean, that's really the missing piece to this puzzle.</p><p>MATHISEN:  Brian, let's get some thoughts on bonds.  What is the bond  market saying?  </p><p>BRIAN REHLING, WELLS FARGO INVESTMENT INSTITUTE:  Well, the bond market is  reacting to all the factors that are occurring in the equity markets.  So,  both -- when people buy equities, they tend to sell bonds, in simplistic  terms.  But also on the fiscal outlook, if we get more fiscal spending, we  could see growth rates and also inflation increase.  That's a negative for  bonds.  </p><p>And also on the trade policies, if we have less global trade, we'll have to  buy more things here within the U.S., and that would tend to raise prices,  raise inflation.  Inflation is not what you want to see if you're a bond  holder.  </p><p>So, there's a lot of nervousness in the bond market, that's why you see the  selling.  But there's not a lot of specifics.  So, I do think we're close  to an end to that selling as we await more specifics.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  Which is sort of a code, Brian, I supposed for saying you think  it may be a little overdone here.  You know, a lot of people have piled  into bonds.  Are they ready for what higher interest rates might mean to  the total return on bonds and to the value of their shares or their bonds  themselves?  </p><p>REHLING:  Well, if you look at bonds in a portfolio context, if your bonds  have not been doing as well, your equities are probably doing better as of  late.  So, they're doing what they're supposed to do, diversify.  Also, if  you're thinking of buying bonds and holding them to maturity, that income  stream is still good, will still get you the income that you thought.  So,  there's no change there.  </p><p>But in a total return perspective, bonds alone -- yes, a lot of the  policies Trump outlined could increase growth, increase inflation, in  general that could be bad for a bond-only holder.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  David, back to you on stocks, we've seen already some of the  sectors that have bend or are responding positively to the prospect of the  Trump presidency.  And some that have reacted negatively.  Do you think  that's what we're going to see going forward, certain sectors doing very  well?  And talk to me a little bit about technology and why it's not doing  so well.  </p><p>LEBOVITZ:  So, I think there are a couple of things going on.  First,  again, I wouldn't be surprised to see this rally take a bit of a pause.  It  has been the more cyclical names, the materials, the industrials, the  financials, which have led this rally, whereas utilities, telecom, consumer  staples, the more defensive parts of the market have been lagging.  </p><p>Now, that stands in sharp contrast to what we saw during the first few  months of this year when this defensive high dividend, low volatility names  were really the name of the game if you will.  </p><p>So, do I expect the cyclical leadership to continue?  I think as long as  the information we get on what the actual policies will be is in line with  expectations -- yes, I think cyclicals could continue to outperform.  And I  would add on top of that, from a valuation standpoint, they look far more  attractive than the more defensive sectors.</p><p>On technology, you know, technology is being pushed down, given concerns  about what trade agreements may look like going forward.  But what I would  say the thing to keep in mind about technology is, if we think back to  2015, when we were in a moderate economic growth environment, a little bit  of inflation, tech names performed very well, because they have the ability  to grow avenues, they have the ability to grow earnings kind of regardless  of what the broader macroeconomic backdrop is.  </p><p>So, I wouldn't dismiss the tech names yet.  I think that there's still some  opportunity there.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  David, thank you very much for helping us tonight.  Brian,  thanks to you as well.  We appreciate your insight and your time.  </p><p>LEBOVITZ:  Thanks for having me.  </p><p>REHLING:  Thanks.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  All right. What does a Trump administration mean for the Federal  Reserve, as we talk about interest rates?</p><p>Steve Liesman assesses the landscape.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>STEVE LIESMAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  The election of a  new president has thrown open questions about the Federal Reserve, ranging  from rate policy to personnel.  The first hint that Donald Trump could  surprise the world by being elected president on Tuesday evening sent the  chance of a December rate hike plunging.  </p><p>It's stabilized at lower level the next day and has now come back to be  around 63 percent.  That's just about where it was when markets thought  Hillary Clinton was likely to be elected.  </p><p>Richmond Fed president Jeffrey Lacker today joined other Fed officials in  saying the election officials have not changed his view, but the case for  raising rates is relatively strong.</p><p>Almost certainly that sense come from a pretty positive stock market  reaction to the election.  A Dow Jones nosedive could have changed the  outlook for a Fed hike.  Another area of interest is whether the president- elect will respect the Fed's independence.  </p><p>Trump accused the Fed and Fed Chair Janet Yellen of keeping rates low to  help his opponent, levying harsh criticism at the Central Bank.  </p><p>Some Fed officials, they felt the need since the election to emphasize the  value of independent Fed.</p><p>JOHN WILLIAMS, FEDERAL RESERVE BANK OF SF PRES.:  One of the lessons from,  you know, 100 years of central banking is that independent central banks  tend to perform better, keep inflation low, and that's something that, you  know, most countries, the most successful countries have accepted as the  U.S.  So, from my perspective, you know, that's the most important thing,  for the Fed to continue to have the ability to make the monetary policy  decisions that are best for the long run.  </p><p>LIESMAN:  Trump economic adviser David Malpass said in an interview this  morning that the Fed is independent but didn't quite stop there.  </p><p>DAVID MALPASS, PRES .ELECT TRUMP ADVISOR:  The issue, though, is their  performance has not been good.  We've had a really slow growth economy.   And so, the question is, will they look inside and see that they're part of  that problem?</p><p>LIESMAN:  President Trump will be able to put a large imprint on the Fed in  the months and years ahead.  Yellen's term is up in February 2018.  And two  Fed governorships are vacant now.  That means he'll be able to appoint at  least three of the seven members of the board of governors, along with any  other governors who might resign.</p><p>The unknown question: now that he's president, does he want higher rates,  or like many who held the Oval Office before him, prefer rates as low as  possible?  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Steve Liesman.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN:  The lobbying of the Trump administration has begun already.  The  Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, which represents the major car  makers, sent a letter to Trump's transition team, urging the president- elect to rework fuel economy standards, among other things.  Those fuel  mandates could cost the industry billions.  </p><p>Well, the transition has begun, of course.  President Obama and President- elect Trump met face-to-face for the first time at the White House today to  discuss policy and life at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.  </p><p>John Harwood joins us from Washington.  </p><p>John, good evening.  How did the meeting go?  </p><p>JOHN HARWOOD, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  It went very well.   President-elect Trump and President Obama were cordial with one another.   They said all the things that the country and the markets wanted to hear  about a smooth and peaceful transition.  This is just the beginning of it,  of course.  But they continued the spirit of what Donald Trump expressed on  election night, what President Obama expressed yesterday, and I think  that's as much as we can hope for, especially given the fact that Donald  Trump is somebody who is taking direct aim at core elements of President  Obama's legacy.  If they can work together in that atmosphere, that says  something.</p><p>MATHISEN:  And the transition from George W. Bush to Mr. Obama went  presumably pretty doggone well.  </p><p>There was another meeting today, or a couple of them up on Capitol Hill,  really almost equally sort of propitious, I suppose, between the president- elect, the speaker, Mr. Ryan, and the majority leader of the Senate, Mr.  McConnell.  </p><p>What do we know about those meetings?  </p><p>HARWOOD:  Tyler, that's one of the unique things about this campaign, is  that President-elect Trump had a relationship as strained with leaders of  his party, both Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan, that we've seen.  They kept  their distance.  He criticized them, especially Paul Ryan, called him weak  and ineffective during the campaign.  </p><p>But now, they're going to work together and try to figure out what parts of  his agenda and their agenda they can cooperate on.  I think Paul Ryan is  very hopeful in particular on tax reform, tax cuts, and Donald Trump wants  help on immigration.  And we will see how they end up.  </p><p>But they had a smooth meeting today.  They had lunch at the Capitol Hill  Club, which is a Republican gathering spot in Washington, adjacent to the  national committee.  And again, not a lot of substance emerged but  cordiality was the rule.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  How -- quickly, how big a figure will Mr. Pence be in working  with Congress?  </p><p>HARWOOD:  I think a very significant one.  One of the things about Donald  Trump is that he has not served if government before.  Mike Pence has, in  particular on Capitol Hill, before becoming a governor.  And I think he's  going to exploit his ties with House Republicans to try to mend parts of  the relationship that at times has been strained.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  All right.  John, thanks very much.  John Harwood in Washington.  </p><p>Up next, mouse trapped.  Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS) missed Wall Street's  target.  We'll tell you what's dragging down Mickey, Mini and the crew.  </p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>MATHISEN:  The Dow component and widely-held stock Disney (NYSE:DIS) missed  expectations in its latest quarter.  The media company earned $1.10 a  share.  That was a full six cents below estimates on just over $13 billion  in revenue.  That was below a year ago, and Wall Street wanted $13.5  billion.  Shares initially fell after hours following the news but then  reversed course.  </p><p>Julia Boorstin tells us what is hampering Disney (NYSE:DIS).  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JULIA BOORSTIN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Media giant Disney  (NYSE:DIS) reported a rare miss of the analysts' expectations of revenue  and earnings.  The company attributing the miss in part to an extra week in  its prior year, skewing this year's numbers, with the biggest impact on the  company's cable network business.  That division and ESPN in particular  were in focus in light of growing concerns about the health of the TV  bundle.  Cable network revenue's dropped 7 percent in the quarter and  operating income dropped 13 percent in the quarter.  Dragging on the  division: lower advertising and affiliate revenue and higher programming  and production costs due to lower ratings and declining subscribers.  </p><p>ESPN is certain to be a hot topic for CEO Bob Iger on the company's  earnings call and for Disney (NYSE:DIS) for years to come.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Julia Boorstin in Burbank, California.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN:  MetLife (NYSE:MET) launches its largest share buyback ever, and  that is where we begin tonight's \"Market Focus\".</p><p>The nation's largest life insurer said its board has approved a $3 billion  share repurchase program.  Earlier this year, the company suspended  buybacks to focus on spinning off a part of its life insurance unit, a move  that could be completed by early next year.  Shares today up nearly 5  percent at $53.74.  </p><p>ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) said it will sell $5 billion to $8 billion worth  of assets and cut its capital budget by 4 percent next year.  The energy  giant said moves like this will help it to become profitable when Brent oil  prices are at $50 a barrel.  The company also launched a $3 billion share  buyback.  Shares were down nevertheless, 2 percent, $44.78.  </p><p>Shares of Fitbit rallied today following unconfirmed reports the maker of  the fitness devices received a takeover offer.  According to a regulatory  filing, China-based ABM Capital proposed to buy the company for $12.50 a  share.  But Fitbit denies receiving any communication or a bid from any  firm.  Fitbit shares nevertheless up 3 percent at $8.86.  </p><p>A robust back to school shopping season lifted profit and sales of Kohl's  (NYSE:KSS).  The department store retailer also reaffirmed its outlook for  the year, and increased its share repurchase plan to $2 billion.  Shares  popped 11.5 percent at $50.97.  </p><p>So, what does big business think, really think about a Trump  administration?  It defends on who you asked, I guess.  </p><p>Today in \"New York Times (NYSE:NYT)\" Deal Book Conference, some of the  nation's top executives weighed in.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SCHMIDT:  I think we should congratulate the next president of the United  States.  It's a significant achievement.  Think about, think about most  people did not expect this outcome.  And it's a pretty amazing story.  </p><p>MARK BERTOLINI, AETNA CEO:  Of all the possible outcomes that could have  happened in the election, this one wasn't even on the sheet.  And every  time somebody brings up and said, what if the Republicans sweep?  Get out  of the room, that's not even -- so we started with a fresh piece of paper  yesterday, we had no idea how to approach it.  </p><p>LLOYD BLANKFEIN, GOLDMAN SACHS CHAIRMAN &amp; CEO:  Of course I imagined that  he could win.  I did not think it was a high probability.  But if you told  that he was going to win, I would have told you there would have been a  rally in the equity markets.</p><p>ROGER GOODELL, NFL COMMISSIONER:  Our country has to have more respect for  one another.  We have to unite.  And I saw some very positive signs of that  yesterday with our current president, Hillary Clinton's comments publicly,  and others coming together and saying, we have to get together, we have to  unite, we have to address some of the issues and work together.  </p><p>President-elect Trump is our president.  So, let's get behind him.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MATHISEN:  So, how much money might Donald Trump's proposed tax plan save  you?  Find out next.  </p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>MATHISEN:  President-elect Trump has proposed one of the biggest tax cuts  for the wealthy in recent history, while also giving smaller breaks to the  middle class.  </p><p>Robert Frank breaks down how much money Trump's plan would put in people's  pockets.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ROBERT FRANK, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Donald Trump's tax  plan would put an average of $2,900 a year back into the pockets of average  American taxpayers.  The highest earners get the biggest cuts both in  dollar and percentage terms.  Trump has touted his plan as a way to  simplify the tax code and put more spending into the private sector.  </p><p>So, the biggest change he's proposing is to cut the seven current tax rates  down to three.  It would be 12 percent, 25 percent, and 33 percent.   Companies get a big cut too -- the corporate tax rate going from 35 to 15  percent.  For those who own their own companies or have partnerships, Trump  would allow them to use that 15 percent rate for their personal income tax  returns.  </p><p>He would also eliminate the estate tax which currently applies to estates  worth more than $10 million.  And he would cut the capital gains tax.  </p><p>So, what does it all mean in dollar terms?  Well, if you add in all those  tax provisions together, the bottom quintile earns get extra $110 or less  than 1 percent of their income.  Middle earners get a cut of 2 percent or  about a thousand bucks.  And the top 1 percent get a cut of 13.5 percent or  $214,000 a year.  And the top 0.1 percent get a cut of more than 14  percent, giving them an extra $1,066,000 per year.  </p><p>Trump's plan is similar to that put forth by House Speaker Paul Ryan, so it  has a good chance of becoming law.  And all that extra cash totaling  trillions a year could go to consumer spending, investing or saving.</p><p>If there is a price, the Tax Policy Center saying Trump's plan would add up  to $6 trillion to the deficit over the next ten years.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Robert Frank.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN:  And finally, Susan Li looks at taxing your sugar intake.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SUSAN LI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  The pop and fizz of soda  might be getting more expensive as more cities considered taxing sugary  drinks.  The latest, Chicago and its surrounding suburbs in Cook County, a  population of 5 million.  </p><p>The county's board is proposing a penny an ounce tax on cola, sports  drinks, iced tea and energy drinks, and also for the first time, diet  sodas.  Now, if approved it would be the latest to join six other cities  across America that have approved these so-called soda taxes.  Four of  those cities voting in the levy this week, including in San Francisco.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I think it's one way to decrease consumption of  something that in the end costs a lot more than that tax, because, you  know, diabetes is really expensive.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I don't think we need to tax things we feel are  unhealthy.  I think people should have the ability to make those types of  choices.  </p><p>LI:  But the soda tax has really worked.  One example might be Mexico,  which introduced its soda tax nationwide in 2014.  In a research study  published by medical journal \"BMJ\", during the first year of its act,  purchases of sugary drinks fell 6 percent on average each month and  reductions were higher among the lower income household which had to suffer  the highest levels of obesity.  </p><p>Industry group said the cost of the drinks will increase the cost of these  drinks by 20 percent.  The Cook County Coalition Against Beverage Taxes  supports this, saying that \"we remain very concerned that a beverage tax  will directly affect working families and small businesses.  If this tax  passes, consumers will pay more and get less freedom.\" </p><p>Meantime, the world's largest drink makers say soda levies are not about  nutrition at all.  </p><p>INDRA NOOYI, PEPSICO CHAIRMAN &amp; CEO:  Soda taxes are there to balance  budget.  It's got nothing to do with public health issues.  If you look at  across every one of the jurisdictions, everybody had a budget problem.  And  everybody, you see taxes coming in, it's because of budget issues.  </p><p>LI:  Beverage makers like PepsiCo are also changing their recipes to slash  the calorie count.  PepsiCo says that at least two-thirds of the company's  beverages will contain 100 calories or less for a 12-ounce serving in less  than a decade.  Cook County's vote will be the biggest test yet on the  government's intervention to regulate ones' sugar intake.  </p><p>Now, if the ballot gets approved, it would add another city on a growing  list of places across America that wants to tax your consumption choices.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Susan Li.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN:   Thanks for watching, everybody.  We'll see you back here  tomorrow night.</p><p>END</p><p>Nightly Business Report transcripts and video are available on-line post  broadcast at <url normalizedValue=\"http://nbr.com\">http://nbr.com</url>.

The Trump  rally continues, sending the Dow to a record, although not all sectors go  along for the ride.  What should you do now?  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Trumped up.  After the election, mortgage rates spike.  Is it temporary, or  the new normal in housing?  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And, taxing question.  How much will you get if a Trump tax plan goes  through?  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">All that and more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Thursday, November  10th.  </p><p>Good evening, everyone.  And welcome.  Sue Herera has the night off.  </p><p>Well, call it the Trump rally day two.  It is early, very, very early.  But  all the naysayers and prognosticators who said the Trump win would send  stocks down hard have been off the mark.  Today, the Dow Jones Industrial  Average, supposedly a snapshot of the economy and home of some of the  bluest of blue chips rocketed to a record close.  </p><p>But not everyone participated.  We'll have more on that in just a moment.  </p><p>The Dow rose 218 points to 18,807, a record.  The NASDAQ lost 42.  And the  S&amp;P 500 rose four.  </p><p>Bob Pisani has more on the rally.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BOB PISANI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  What a week of trading.   We went from rallying on Monday, going into the election, to down 800  points the night of the election, to soaring to record heights just today.  </p><p>What's going on?  There's a new trading mentality on Wall Street right now.   Let's call it the reflation trade.  Buy into sectors that will benefit from  less regulation and more fiscal stimulus, that means spending.   Infrastructure names like Martin Marietta Materials (NYSE:MLM) and Home  Depot (NYSE:HD), and bank stocks like J.P. Morgan and Goldman Sachs  (NYSE:GS) all hit new highs today.  </p><p>Now, on the other side, on the downside, interest rate sensitive groups  like telecom, real estate, and utilities are being hit by concerns of  higher interest rates.  And big tech like Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Apple  (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) are down on trade concerns.  </p><p>So, this can this continue these trends?  Well, sure they can, but we may  be approaching the limits to how far banks and pharmaceuticals, for  example, can go without very specific changes in the legislation.  We need  to see that.  We need to hear more on the specifics of less regulation,  more stimulus, and tax reform.  And that may not happen until January.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Bob Pisani at the New York Stock Exchange.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN:   As Bob mentioned, big name tech stocks have not participated in  this post-election stock euphoria.</p><p>Deirdre Bosa tells us more now on why this notable group is sitting out the  rally.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DEIRDRE BOSA, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Transition begins to  a Trump administration, shock waves are reverberating throughout Silicon  Valley.  Executives are grappling with a new reality.  </p><p>This morning, Alphabet's executive chairman, Eric Schmidt, acknowledged the  stakes.  </p><p>ERIC SCHMIDT, ALPHABET EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN:  The top five most valued  companies in America today are Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Google (NASDAQ:GOOG),  Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT).   So, if the all R team is very focused on big business, there's five  businesses right there.</p><p>What do each and every one of those companies need?  High value, high  quality, high levels of education immigration.  Every one of them is  powered completely by those policies, which have been stuck for 20 years.  </p><p>BOSA:  But those policies may be changing as a new order takes over, one  that has become increasingly hostile.  </p><p>Never before has the tech industry been so united against a presidential  candidate than it was against Donald Trump.  Trump took shots at some of  the biggest names in tech.  He called for a boycott on Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL),  claimed that IBM was moving jobs outside the U.S., and suggested that  Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) was an illegal monopoly.  </p><p>In response, Amazon's CEO Jeff Bezos offered to send Trump to space.  But  today, he congratulated the president-elect and wished him success.  </p><p>In a memo to employees, Apple's chief Tim Cook said the company's North  Star hasn't changed and the only way to move forward is to move forward  together.  </p><p>But some were not as hopeful.  Slack CEO Stuart Butterfield said he was  heartbroken.  While Shervin Pishevar, co-founder of Hyperloop One,  suggested that California secede.  </p><p>Trump's hard line stance on immigration is also at odds with the industry's  push for immigration reform, another point Schmidt addressed.  </p><p>SCHMIDT:  We bring these incredibly intelligent people into our country.   We have the best educational system by far, at the college and graduate  school level.  We kick them out after giving them these incredibly  expensive degrees, which we helped subsidized, and then they go and create  competitors to our companies, right?  Now, come on, guys.  Let's fix that.  </p><p>BOSA:  There was one prominent in tech who did back Trump -- billionaire  investor Peter Thiel.  Though his support put him at odds with most Silicon  Valley, he is now perhaps ironically one of the few people in tech who will  have the new president's ear.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Deirdre Bosa, San Francisco.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN:  Well, the dust hadn't settled on election night or early morning  before bond yields started to rise.  And, of course, with rising yields  comes rising mortgage rates.  </p><p>Diana Olick on what the spike means.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DIANA OLICK, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  As President-elect  Donald Trump met with leaders in Washington today, investors around the  world continued to back out of the bond market, which in turn pushed U.S.  mortgage rates, which loosely followed bond yields to their biggest two-day  gain in three years.  </p><p>MATTHEW GRAHAM, MORTGAGE NEWS DAILY:  In terms of actual interest rates, we  moved a quarter of a point higher in two days.  And that is relatively  unheard of.  This is sort of thing we can count without using any of our  toes, going back at least a decade.  So, it's definitely a big spike.</p><p>OLICK:  The average rate on the popular 30-year fixed mortgages are still  historically low, below 4 percent.  But the increase would definitely cost  buyers in their monthly payment.  It could actually keep some buyers from  qualifying for a loan.  Rising rates also just plain scare buyers.  </p><p>GRAHAM:  Psychologically, we feel like 3.875 is a much higher rate than  3.625, if that's what we're looking at, and that's what we had access two  days ago.  So, I think the psychological impact is fairly substantial.  </p><p>OLICK:  On the larger scale, the rise in interest rates is also hitting the  stocks of REITs, which invest in commercial real estate.  REITs, which  offer high dividends, are a low yield play.</p><p>ALEXANDER GOLDFARB, SANDLER O'NEILL:  REITs are derivative of interest  rates and the economy.  So, if you have interest rates that are going up,  that's going to send REITs down.  The flip side of that is that the economy  does better, that should help rent growth, which should help REITs.  </p><p>OLICK:  It really is a grand irony.  Donald Trump rode to victory on an  electorate looking for a better economy and a better standard of living.   But the initial financial market reaction made mortgages more expensive and  could push rents even higher.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Diana Olick in Washington.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN:  So, can the Trump stock market rally continue?  And how did so  many get it so wrong?  The question of the week, I suppose.  </p><p>Joining us now to discuss, David Lebovitz, global strategist at J.P. Morgan  Asset Management, and Brian Rehling, co-head of global fixed income at  Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) Investment Institute.  </p><p>David, can this rally continue or is it time for a little breather here?  </p><p>DAVID LEBOVITZ, J.P. MORGAN ASSET MGMT GLOBAL MARKET STRATEGIST:  So, I  wouldn't be surprised to see this rally take a breather.  I think there's a  still a lot of uncertainty around what President-elect Trump's policies  will be.  </p><p>Obviously, stocks have been rallying on the idea of higher infrastructure  spending, you know, decreased regulation, that all sounds very good.  But  the proof will be in the pudding.  We need to get a better sense what his  policies are going to look like in order for this rally to be extended.  </p><p>So, I wouldn't be surprised to see stocks, interest rates, take a breather,  settle at the levels they're currently sitting at, and await more  information.  I mean, that's really the missing piece to this puzzle.</p><p>MATHISEN:  Brian, let's get some thoughts on bonds.  What is the bond  market saying?  </p><p>BRIAN REHLING, WELLS FARGO INVESTMENT INSTITUTE:  Well, the bond market is  reacting to all the factors that are occurring in the equity markets.  So,  both -- when people buy equities, they tend to sell bonds, in simplistic  terms.  But also on the fiscal outlook, if we get more fiscal spending, we  could see growth rates and also inflation increase.  That's a negative for  bonds.  </p><p>And also on the trade policies, if we have less global trade, we'll have to  buy more things here within the U.S., and that would tend to raise prices,  raise inflation.  Inflation is not what you want to see if you're a bond  holder.  </p><p>So, there's a lot of nervousness in the bond market, that's why you see the  selling.  But there's not a lot of specifics.  So, I do think we're close  to an end to that selling as we await more specifics.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  Which is sort of a code, Brian, I supposed for saying you think  it may be a little overdone here.  You know, a lot of people have piled  into bonds.  Are they ready for what higher interest rates might mean to  the total return on bonds and to the value of their shares or their bonds  themselves?  </p><p>REHLING:  Well, if you look at bonds in a portfolio context, if your bonds  have not been doing as well, your equities are probably doing better as of  late.  So, they're doing what they're supposed to do, diversify.  Also, if  you're thinking of buying bonds and holding them to maturity, that income  stream is still good, will still get you the income that you thought.  So,  there's no change there.  </p><p>But in a total return perspective, bonds alone -- yes, a lot of the  policies Trump outlined could increase growth, increase inflation, in  general that could be bad for a bond-only holder.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  David, back to you on stocks, we've seen already some of the  sectors that have bend or are responding positively to the prospect of the  Trump presidency.  And some that have reacted negatively.  Do you think  that's what we're going to see going forward, certain sectors doing very  well?  And talk to me a little bit about technology and why it's not doing  so well.  </p><p>LEBOVITZ:  So, I think there are a couple of things going on.  First,  again, I wouldn't be surprised to see this rally take a bit of a pause.  It  has been the more cyclical names, the materials, the industrials, the  financials, which have led this rally, whereas utilities, telecom, consumer  staples, the more defensive parts of the market have been lagging.  </p><p>Now, that stands in sharp contrast to what we saw during the first few  months of this year when this defensive high dividend, low volatility names  were really the name of the game if you will.  </p><p>So, do I expect the cyclical leadership to continue?  I think as long as  the information we get on what the actual policies will be is in line with  expectations -- yes, I think cyclicals could continue to outperform.  And I  would add on top of that, from a valuation standpoint, they look far more  attractive than the more defensive sectors.</p><p>On technology, you know, technology is being pushed down, given concerns  about what trade agreements may look like going forward.  But what I would  say the thing to keep in mind about technology is, if we think back to  2015, when we were in a moderate economic growth environment, a little bit  of inflation, tech names performed very well, because they have the ability  to grow avenues, they have the ability to grow earnings kind of regardless  of what the broader macroeconomic backdrop is.  </p><p>So, I wouldn't dismiss the tech names yet.  I think that there's still some  opportunity there.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  David, thank you very much for helping us tonight.  Brian,  thanks to you as well.  We appreciate your insight and your time.  </p><p>LEBOVITZ:  Thanks for having me.  </p><p>REHLING:  Thanks.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  All right. What does a Trump administration mean for the Federal  Reserve, as we talk about interest rates?</p><p>Steve Liesman assesses the landscape.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>STEVE LIESMAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  The election of a  new president has thrown open questions about the Federal Reserve, ranging  from rate policy to personnel.  The first hint that Donald Trump could  surprise the world by being elected president on Tuesday evening sent the  chance of a December rate hike plunging.  </p><p>It's stabilized at lower level the next day and has now come back to be  around 63 percent.  That's just about where it was when markets thought  Hillary Clinton was likely to be elected.  </p><p>Richmond Fed president Jeffrey Lacker today joined other Fed officials in  saying the election officials have not changed his view, but the case for  raising rates is relatively strong.</p><p>Almost certainly that sense come from a pretty positive stock market  reaction to the election.  A Dow Jones nosedive could have changed the  outlook for a Fed hike.  Another area of interest is whether the president- elect will respect the Fed's independence.  </p><p>Trump accused the Fed and Fed Chair Janet Yellen of keeping rates low to  help his opponent, levying harsh criticism at the Central Bank.  </p><p>Some Fed officials, they felt the need since the election to emphasize the  value of independent Fed.</p><p>JOHN WILLIAMS, FEDERAL RESERVE BANK OF SF PRES.:  One of the lessons from,  you know, 100 years of central banking is that independent central banks  tend to perform better, keep inflation low, and that's something that, you  know, most countries, the most successful countries have accepted as the  U.S.  So, from my perspective, you know, that's the most important thing,  for the Fed to continue to have the ability to make the monetary policy  decisions that are best for the long run.  </p><p>LIESMAN:  Trump economic adviser David Malpass said in an interview this  morning that the Fed is independent but didn't quite stop there.  </p><p>DAVID MALPASS, PRES .ELECT TRUMP ADVISOR:  The issue, though, is their  performance has not been good.  We've had a really slow growth economy.   And so, the question is, will they look inside and see that they're part of  that problem?</p><p>LIESMAN:  President Trump will be able to put a large imprint on the Fed in  the months and years ahead.  Yellen's term is up in February 2018.  And two  Fed governorships are vacant now.  That means he'll be able to appoint at  least three of the seven members of the board of governors, along with any  other governors who might resign.</p><p>The unknown question: now that he's president, does he want higher rates,  or like many who held the Oval Office before him, prefer rates as low as  possible?  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Steve Liesman.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN:  The lobbying of the Trump administration has begun already.  The  Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, which represents the major car  makers, sent a letter to Trump's transition team, urging the president- elect to rework fuel economy standards, among other things.  Those fuel  mandates could cost the industry billions.  </p><p>Well, the transition has begun, of course.  President Obama and President- elect Trump met face-to-face for the first time at the White House today to  discuss policy and life at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.  </p><p>John Harwood joins us from Washington.  </p><p>John, good evening.  How did the meeting go?  </p><p>JOHN HARWOOD, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  It went very well.   President-elect Trump and President Obama were cordial with one another.   They said all the things that the country and the markets wanted to hear  about a smooth and peaceful transition.  This is just the beginning of it,  of course.  But they continued the spirit of what Donald Trump expressed on  election night, what President Obama expressed yesterday, and I think  that's as much as we can hope for, especially given the fact that Donald  Trump is somebody who is taking direct aim at core elements of President  Obama's legacy.  If they can work together in that atmosphere, that says  something.</p><p>MATHISEN:  And the transition from George W. Bush to Mr. Obama went  presumably pretty doggone well.  </p><p>There was another meeting today, or a couple of them up on Capitol Hill,  really almost equally sort of propitious, I suppose, between the president- elect, the speaker, Mr. Ryan, and the majority leader of the Senate, Mr.  McConnell.  </p><p>What do we know about those meetings?  </p><p>HARWOOD:  Tyler, that's one of the unique things about this campaign, is  that President-elect Trump had a relationship as strained with leaders of  his party, both Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan, that we've seen.  They kept  their distance.  He criticized them, especially Paul Ryan, called him weak  and ineffective during the campaign.  </p><p>But now, they're going to work together and try to figure out what parts of  his agenda and their agenda they can cooperate on.  I think Paul Ryan is  very hopeful in particular on tax reform, tax cuts, and Donald Trump wants  help on immigration.  And we will see how they end up.  </p><p>But they had a smooth meeting today.  They had lunch at the Capitol Hill  Club, which is a Republican gathering spot in Washington, adjacent to the  national committee.  And again, not a lot of substance emerged but  cordiality was the rule.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  How -- quickly, how big a figure will Mr. Pence be in working  with Congress?  </p><p>HARWOOD:  I think a very significant one.  One of the things about Donald  Trump is that he has not served if government before.  Mike Pence has, in  particular on Capitol Hill, before becoming a governor.  And I think he's  going to exploit his ties with House Republicans to try to mend parts of  the relationship that at times has been strained.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  All right.  John, thanks very much.  John Harwood in Washington.  </p><p>Up next, mouse trapped.  Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS) missed Wall Street's  target.  We'll tell you what's dragging down Mickey, Mini and the crew.  </p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>MATHISEN:  The Dow component and widely-held stock Disney (NYSE:DIS) missed  expectations in its latest quarter.  The media company earned $1.10 a  share.  That was a full six cents below estimates on just over $13 billion  in revenue.  That was below a year ago, and Wall Street wanted $13.5  billion.  Shares initially fell after hours following the news but then  reversed course.  </p><p>Julia Boorstin tells us what is hampering Disney (NYSE:DIS).  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JULIA BOORSTIN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Media giant Disney  (NYSE:DIS) reported a rare miss of the analysts' expectations of revenue  and earnings.  The company attributing the miss in part to an extra week in  its prior year, skewing this year's numbers, with the biggest impact on the  company's cable network business.  That division and ESPN in particular  were in focus in light of growing concerns about the health of the TV  bundle.  Cable network revenue's dropped 7 percent in the quarter and  operating income dropped 13 percent in the quarter.  Dragging on the  division: lower advertising and affiliate revenue and higher programming  and production costs due to lower ratings and declining subscribers.  </p><p>ESPN is certain to be a hot topic for CEO Bob Iger on the company's  earnings call and for Disney (NYSE:DIS) for years to come.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Julia Boorstin in Burbank, California.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN:  MetLife (NYSE:MET) launches its largest share buyback ever, and  that is where we begin tonight's \"Market Focus\".</p><p>The nation's largest life insurer said its board has approved a $3 billion  share repurchase program.  Earlier this year, the company suspended  buybacks to focus on spinning off a part of its life insurance unit, a move  that could be completed by early next year.  Shares today up nearly 5  percent at $53.74.  </p><p>ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) said it will sell $5 billion to $8 billion worth  of assets and cut its capital budget by 4 percent next year.  The energy  giant said moves like this will help it to become profitable when Brent oil  prices are at $50 a barrel.  The company also launched a $3 billion share  buyback.  Shares were down nevertheless, 2 percent, $44.78.  </p><p>Shares of Fitbit rallied today following unconfirmed reports the maker of  the fitness devices received a takeover offer.  According to a regulatory  filing, China-based ABM Capital proposed to buy the company for $12.50 a  share.  But Fitbit denies receiving any communication or a bid from any  firm.  Fitbit shares nevertheless up 3 percent at $8.86.  </p><p>A robust back to school shopping season lifted profit and sales of Kohl's  (NYSE:KSS).  The department store retailer also reaffirmed its outlook for  the year, and increased its share repurchase plan to $2 billion.  Shares  popped 11.5 percent at $50.97.  </p><p>So, what does big business think, really think about a Trump  administration?  It defends on who you asked, I guess.  </p><p>Today in \"New York Times (NYSE:NYT)\" Deal Book Conference, some of the  nation's top executives weighed in.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SCHMIDT:  I think we should congratulate the next president of the United  States.  It's a significant achievement.  Think about, think about most  people did not expect this outcome.  And it's a pretty amazing story.  </p><p>MARK BERTOLINI, AETNA CEO:  Of all the possible outcomes that could have  happened in the election, this one wasn't even on the sheet.  And every  time somebody brings up and said, what if the Republicans sweep?  Get out  of the room, that's not even -- so we started with a fresh piece of paper  yesterday, we had no idea how to approach it.  </p><p>LLOYD BLANKFEIN, GOLDMAN SACHS CHAIRMAN &amp; CEO:  Of course I imagined that  he could win.  I did not think it was a high probability.  But if you told  that he was going to win, I would have told you there would have been a  rally in the equity markets.</p><p>ROGER GOODELL, NFL COMMISSIONER:  Our country has to have more respect for  one another.  We have to unite.  And I saw some very positive signs of that  yesterday with our current president, Hillary Clinton's comments publicly,  and others coming together and saying, we have to get together, we have to  unite, we have to address some of the issues and work together.  </p><p>President-elect Trump is our president.  So, let's get behind him.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MATHISEN:  So, how much money might Donald Trump's proposed tax plan save  you?  Find out next.  </p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>MATHISEN:  President-elect Trump has proposed one of the biggest tax cuts  for the wealthy in recent history, while also giving smaller breaks to the  middle class.  </p><p>Robert Frank breaks down how much money Trump's plan would put in people's  pockets.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ROBERT FRANK, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Donald Trump's tax  plan would put an average of $2,900 a year back into the pockets of average  American taxpayers.  The highest earners get the biggest cuts both in  dollar and percentage terms.  Trump has touted his plan as a way to  simplify the tax code and put more spending into the private sector.  </p><p>So, the biggest change he's proposing is to cut the seven current tax rates  down to three.  It would be 12 percent, 25 percent, and 33 percent.   Companies get a big cut too -- the corporate tax rate going from 35 to 15  percent.  For those who own their own companies or have partnerships, Trump  would allow them to use that 15 percent rate for their personal income tax  returns.  </p><p>He would also eliminate the estate tax which currently applies to estates  worth more than $10 million.  And he would cut the capital gains tax.  </p><p>So, what does it all mean in dollar terms?  Well, if you add in all those  tax provisions together, the bottom quintile earns get extra $110 or less  than 1 percent of their income.  Middle earners get a cut of 2 percent or  about a thousand bucks.  And the top 1 percent get a cut of 13.5 percent or  $214,000 a year.  And the top 0.1 percent get a cut of more than 14  percent, giving them an extra $1,066,000 per year.  </p><p>Trump's plan is similar to that put forth by House Speaker Paul Ryan, so it  has a good chance of becoming law.  And all that extra cash totaling  trillions a year could go to consumer spending, investing or saving.</p><p>If there is a price, the Tax Policy Center saying Trump's plan would add up  to $6 trillion to the deficit over the next ten years.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Robert Frank.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN:  And finally, Susan Li looks at taxing your sugar intake.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SUSAN LI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  The pop and fizz of soda  might be getting more expensive as more cities considered taxing sugary  drinks.  The latest, Chicago and its surrounding suburbs in Cook County, a  population of 5 million.  </p><p>The county's board is proposing a penny an ounce tax on cola, sports  drinks, iced tea and energy drinks, and also for the first time, diet  sodas.  Now, if approved it would be the latest to join six other cities  across America that have approved these so-called soda taxes.  Four of  those cities voting in the levy this week, including in San Francisco.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I think it's one way to decrease consumption of  something that in the end costs a lot more than that tax, because, you  know, diabetes is really expensive.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I don't think we need to tax things we feel are  unhealthy.  I think people should have the ability to make those types of  choices.  </p><p>LI:  But the soda tax has really worked.  One example might be Mexico,  which introduced its soda tax nationwide in 2014.  In a research study  published by medical journal \"BMJ\", during the first year of its act,  purchases of sugary drinks fell 6 percent on average each month and  reductions were higher among the lower income household which had to suffer  the highest levels of obesity.  </p><p>Industry group said the cost of the drinks will increase the cost of these  drinks by 20 percent.  The Cook County Coalition Against Beverage Taxes  supports this, saying that \"we remain very concerned that a beverage tax  will directly affect working families and small businesses.  If this tax  passes, consumers will pay more and get less freedom.\" </p><p>Meantime, the world's largest drink makers say soda levies are not about  nutrition at all.  </p><p>INDRA NOOYI, PEPSICO CHAIRMAN &amp; CEO:  Soda taxes are there to balance  budget.  It's got nothing to do with public health issues.  If you look at  across every one of the jurisdictions, everybody had a budget problem.  And  everybody, you see taxes coming in, it's because of budget issues.  </p><p>LI:  Beverage makers like PepsiCo are also changing their recipes to slash  the calorie count.

The president said today he will now allow insurers to extend their canceled health care policies for one year, maybe even longer, even if the coverage falls short of the new federal minimum standards.</p><p>Now, speaking to reporters at the White House today, Mr. Obama admitted his administration had botched the rollout of the new health care law and he said he regretted that his assurances that Americans could keep their health insurance plans if they liked it, that turned out to be wrong.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>OBAMA: I think it's legitimate for them to expect me to have to win back some credibility on this health care law in particular and on a whole range of these issues in general.

Does Congress at some point have to vote on this?</p><p>I mean, talk us through how the process will work.</p><p>JOHN HARWOOD, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Well, first of all, Susie, I think the thing to remember about this is this is mostly about the president trying to provide political cover for Democrats and for himself to buy time until the exchanges are going to work, the Web site will be fixed.</p><p>He's not compelling any changes, and he's not giving a huge new grant of authority to states. What he's doing is saying that if state insurance commissioners and insurance companies want to extend policies further, they can, but the reality is that most of them don't want to because they want to move into the new world of insurance under the Affordable Care Act. So, it is not clear how much this will change.</p><p>It may extend some policies and at the very latest unless there's an additional decision taken, some of those policies could go to the end of September 2015, but it is not likely so far as I can tell that this is going to make a whole sale change. What the president was trying to resist gutting of Obamacare and this is a minimum fix that he's trying to offer.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Yes, as you mentioned, John, this is providing political cover for those Senate -- Democrats on the House who face reelection next year, but the fact the White House acknowledges that this fix could extend beyond 2014, beyond that election year, that sounds ominous at this point for trying to fix this whole thing.</p><p>HARWOOD: It could, but I think that probably amounts to less than meets the eye, Bill, and the reason is that administration, they said that in their letter that was sent to state insurance commissioners earlier today. So, we've known that for most of the day, but what they are counting on is that the Web site will be working, people will see better options than the extension of these policies, and will be fine with moving over to the new system. That's why I said they are trying to buy time and get over this rough period that they are in right now.</p><p>GRIFFETH: John Harwood in Washington. Thanks for the political angle of that.</p><p>Let's talk about logistics, though. Many insurance companies said today they are worried about the president's fixes, saying that it could destabilize the insurance market and result in higher premiums for consumers.</p><p>Let's turn to Bertha Coombs, who's been following this story all along.</p><p>What do these fixes mean for the insurance industry?</p><p>BERTHA COOMBS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Well, because it's voluntary, it's something that they need to now take a look at. And essentially, the insurers turned a page on these plans. So, they haven't priced what they would be for 2014. So, effectively, they now have a 30- day window that they would have to try to do this because people who want those plans that are expiring on December 31st, to be able to renew them for January 1st, they have to put their premiums in and pay them by the 15th of December.</p><p>So, here are the things they would need to do in the next 30 days, they would need to figure out what the price is on those plans. Calculate all that for 2014. They would need to get approval from state insurance and the state insurance commissioners. Washington state weighing this afternoon saying they don't want to do this, and then they need to be able to get the plans out to their customers and collect their premiums, all in the next 30 days.</p><p>GHARIB: So, it sounds like you're say thing is not feasible to do in 30 days. Will the insurance companies now fight back on this, or are they going to have to do what the White House wants them to do?</p><p>COOMBS: Well, essentially, what's happened here is kind of like when you play your mom off your dad. Your dad kind of says, hey, it's not up to me, ask your mother, she'll make the decision. The president has now shifted the decision to the insurers and the state insurance commissioners.</p><p>Aetna (NYSE:AET) essentially says we can try to do this but we would have to get expedited reviews from all of these state commissioners in order to do that and it is a logistical hurdle for them to do that over the next 30 days.</p><p>Cigna says they are already working with a lot of their clients to try to figure out a way to extend these plans. So, they may be partly along the way. Some of these insurers have actually offered early renewals. One man who I talked whose plan was canceled, he had an early renewal that, in order to sort of skirt the ACA rules, went until December 1st, so that can probably be extended until the end of next year.</p><p>GRIFFETH: There is a bit of a catch-22, though, because the president said he hoped that those who had policies canceled would find a better policy under ACA. But if the Web site is not working, it's tough to do that kind of comparison shopping.</p><p>COOMBS: Well, and it's also tough for the insurers because these are people who already are good about paying their premiums. They already understand insurance and they're already committed to buying insurance. And if they're not buying on the exchange, that really throws into question the viability of that marketplace.</p><p>GHARIB: Real quickly, in just a word or two, what does this mean for premiums if you have your old policy and you want to reinstall it, or new policies? Are they going up, prices?</p><p>COOMBS: I would imagine. I mean, the insurers have to figure out what the price is. They've already seen some prices trends in terms of medical cost going up. So, they would need to raise the plan rates.</p><p>GHARIB: OK. We'll get back to you on that.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Thanks, Bertha.</p><p>GHARIB: Thanks so much, Bertha.</p><p>Well, despite all the changes to the new health law, health care stocks had a strong day, but the big talk on Wall Street was about Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) and Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT). Investors dumped Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) shares, reacting to that bad earnings report we told you about last night and that shaved 15 points off the Dow.</p><p>And Wal-Mart's earnings did little to inspire investors and that Dow stock rose just a bit and we're going to have more analysis on both Wal- Mart (NYSE:WMT) and Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) in just a moment.</p><p>Still, though, the disappointments did not stop the market rally, and new highs for the record books. The Dow added 54 points to a fresh record. The NASDAQ gained seven. And the S&amp;P up 8 1/2 points. It also moved to a new high.</p><p>GRIFFETH: All right. Let's talk about shares of Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) Systems. They were the biggest drag for the Dow today, also for the S&amp;P and for the NASDAQ composite, with the stock tumbling 11 percent after forecasting the continued decline in sales for the rest of the year.</p><p>Jon Fortt has more on what's driving Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) shares lower.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JON FORTT, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): After Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) reported a bad quarter last night and a dismal outlook, the stock had its worst day in almost three years.</p><p>(on camera): The culprit: emerging markets, countries like India, Brazil and Malaysia, that just a few months ago were bastions of growth are turning into a nightmare for big tech companies.</p><p>JOHN CHAMBERS, CISCO SYSTEM CEO: It isn't just high tech. It's the consumer companies of our customers, the people who sell in Brazil or sell in India, or manufacture who sells in those areas, what you're seeing is the GDP slowed. And as they slowed, and you and others have talked about it for almost six months, then confidence began to drop. And if they're looking for the U.S. to lead them out of this scenario, clearly, the last month or two has not instilled a lot of confidence.</p><p>FORTT (voice-over): At Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO), sales from the top five emerging market countries fell 21 percent, and that's on top of a rough sales environment in China that got worse because the NSA spying scandal has buyers favoring local Chinese suppliers.</p><p>All of that led Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) to forecast sales this quarter will be far lower than a year ago. Analysts have been hoping they'd be up.</p><p>And it's not just Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO). IBM cited major trouble in emerging markets during its quarterly report last month and Oracle (NASDAQ:ORCL) has struggled in Asia, too. A small networking player, fast- growing F5, says it's a regional issue.</p><p>JOHN MCADAM, F5 NETWORKS CEO: Asia has been reasonably tough for us. South Asia, Vietnam, Australia, China was particularly tough last quarter and we told (ph) that in our conference call.</p><p>FORTT: Things aren't likely to get better soon analysts fear. What Wall Street would like is a road map for how Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) will steer through this.</p><p>MARK SUE, RBC CAPITAL MARKETS MANAGING DIRECTOR: We do think it's a several quarter issue. We think China I think could be longer than that.</p><p>The next thing to look for is Cisco's analyst day, which comes up in three weeks, and they really have to have some crisp responses in what they're going to do.</p><p>FORTT (on camera): One thing they're probably going to do is keep CEO John Chambers around a little bit longer than some expect it. Chambers tells that he plans to retire sometime in 2016. The board has asked him to stick around and guide the company through this very rough patch.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Jon Fortt.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GHARIB: Well, it looks like Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) is also going through a rough patch. It posted quarterly earnings that were a penny better than estimates for the third quarter but revenues were lower, and its outlook for sales for the all-important holiday shopping period don't look to get much better.</p><p>Courtney Reagan has the story.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>COURTNEY REAGAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The magic of Macy's appears to have been contained to just that retailer. The confident telling (ph) Macy's executive expressed going into the all- important holiday quarter was absent in Wal-Mart's executive commentary in its earnings report. The world's largest retailer did exceed expectations for earnings by one penny per share but sales fell short and the company's forecast isn't inspiring much confidence either.</p><p>DANA TELSEY, TELSEY ADVISORY GROUP CEO: I think it's a very cautious tone. You go into a holiday season where six fewer days, the sense of urgency is greater and level of promotions feel like it's going to be higher than ever.</p><p>REAGAN: Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) U.S. CEO Bill Simon says unemployment and job stability tops the list of consumer concerns and says that while gas prices have fallen, it's still a big piece of the budget for shoppers.</p><p>(on camera): So, is Wal-Mart's sale's weakness due to poor execution by the company or results of the still pressured shopper? Likely, it's a combination of both.</p><p>TELSEY: There is limited amount of dollars to go around. They now are competing as a consumables business in a bigger way, and that's definitely a more competitive space. So, it's the customer and the environment.</p><p>REAGAN (voice-over): However, Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) says the company is encouraged by the momentum coming out of the third quarter, nothing same store sales and traffic improved throughout the quarter. The key now is making sure the trend continues.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Courtney Reagan.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH: And there was more discouraging results at another big discounter, this time, it's Kohl's (NYSE:KSS). Their profits declined by 18 percent last quarter, with fewer customers shopping at their stores. Shares of Khol's dropped sharply today, down 8 percent with the chain cutting its full year earning's forecast as it predicts a pretty tough holiday shopping season.</p><p>GHARIB: And still ahead on the program, Janet Yellen, widely expected to be confirmed as the next Fed chair, breezed through questions from senators on Capitol Hill today. Did her testimony send a message to the stock market and investors?</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GRIFFETH: Janet Yellen did take the first step in the confirmation process to become the next chair of the Federal Reserve. Current vice chair of the central bank sounded positively dovish about the Fed's easy money stimulus plans. She said the U.S. economy still needs the Fed's help and that helped stocks today, but will it win over the support of lawmakers? That's the question.</p><p>Hampton Pearson has more tonight.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HAMPTON PEARSON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): At a Senate Banking Committee on her nomination to become the first woman Fed president --</p><p>JANET YELLIN, FEDERAL RESERVE CHAIR NOMINEE. I do.</p><p>PEARSON: -- Janet Yellen strongly defended the central bank's economic stimulus policy but gave no hint of when tapering might begin.</p><p>YELLEN: While there is no set time, we will decide to reduce the pace of our purchases at each meeting, we are attempting to assess whether or not the outlook is meeting the criterion that we have set out to begin the pace of purchases.</p><p>PEARSON: As Fed vice chairman, Yellen has been a key ally of Bernanke in holding key short term interest rates near zero since late 2008 and quadrupling the Fed's balance sheet to some $3.8 trillion done with massive monthly bond purchases.</p><p>The housing recovery and strong auto sales she says are prime examples of how the stimulus benefitted both Main Street and Wall Street.</p><p>YELLEN: We have seen interest rates fall very substantially. Lower interest rates, lower mortgage rates, particularly I think have been instrumental in -- it's not the only factor, but it has been the positive factor.</p><p>PEARSON: When asked about Fed regulation in the future of banks judged too big to fail, Yellen said, as chairman, one of her highest priorities would be to reduce any advantages enjoyed by the nation's largest banks.</p><p>YELLEN: We have made progress in promoting a strong and stable financial system but here, too, important work lies ahead. I'm committed to using the Fed's supervisory and regulatory role to reduce the threat of another financial crisis.</p><p>PEARSON (on camera): A senior aid tells me, Yellen's strong performance today is paving the way for a full vote by the Senate Banking Committee early next week. The timetable for a full Senate confirmation is still up in the air.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Hampton Pearson on Capitol Hill.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GHARIB: So, what did investors learn about what a Janet Yellen Fed could mean for the stock market?</p><p>Joining us to talk about that, Jeff Kleintop, chief market strategist at LPL Financial.</p><p>So, Jeff, what was the takeaway for investors here? It was very civilized hearing. There was no fireworks. She gave assurances that the Fed is going to keep on stimulating the economy.</p><p>Is this a buy signal for the markets?</p><p>JEFF KLEINTOP, LPL FINANCIAL CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST: Well, it's certainly good news in the sense that she communicated that the Fed is going to remain friendly to the markets, meaning continuing this insurance policy the Fed has put in place through the bond-buying program at the same time she acknowledged better growth in the private sector. She said the best of both worlds, the Fed remaining in the background is ensure against anything going wrong and continuing that stimulus, but at the same time better economic momentum. It sounds like a recipe for continued gains in the stock market.</p><p>GRIFFETH: What about the bond market? Yields fell today. In fact, they fell last night when they first released her testimony to the Senate Banking Committee, and rates have been rising recently, expecting a tapering by the Fed sooner rather than later.</p><p>Do you see yields going even further lower?</p><p>KLEINTOP: You know, I think yields are in a range right now. I don't think anything Janet said today is going to break them out of that. Clearly, we were coming up on this December Fed meeting about a month from now, a little more than a month from now, where, you know, they will be deciding whether they're going to taper. I don't think they'll have enough information to do that.</p><p>I think that's what we heard from Janet today, very much walking the same line Ben has said, which is stayed independent and we're not sure yet. The bond market interestingly has not really -- we haven't seen a dramatically steeper yield curve on the idea that Janet would be much easier in terms of monetary policy risking longer term inflation in the bond market. Instead, we see more continuation of Ben's policies.</p><p>GHARIB: But, you know, Jeff, at some point, this reducing the stimulus is going to happen, whether it's in March or later than that, it's going to happen and a lot of experts have said it's going to be tricky. And today, Alan Greenspan was quoted as saying for Yellen, she faces very daunting problems.</p><p>So, what could that mean for the markets? What could that mean for the economy in terms of something going wrong? It's going to be tough, right?</p><p>KLEINTOP: Absolutely. Communication is going to key. And now that we know who the Fed chairman is going to be through the bulk of 2014, it lends more credibility to the Fed's message on what they're going to do on QE. And that should ease the transition.</p><p>Listen, you're right, there is no surprise that this is coming -- a slowing down of these bond purchases and as long as it's accompanied by better growth, it should be good news for the stock market.</p><p>But we only have to look back to the end of QE1 and QE2 to remember the knee-jerk reactions in the stock market, decline between 15 percent and 20 percent that accompanied those. Now, there were other background factors involved. But that's the knee-jerk reaction and we have to keep that in the back of our minds here, even though we're much more braced and in a better position economically for this transition.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Very quickly --</p><p>KLEINTOP: So, expect some volatility, but ultimately, some gains for the year.</p><p>GRIFFETH: I'm going to try to pin you down a little more than that. I mean, we're sitting here at all time highs for the Dow and the S&amp;P. Do you see us continuing higher even as the Fed continues to talk about no tapering right now?</p><p>KLEINTOP: Yes, I do. We believe here at LPL and the research department that we're going to see substantial gains, maybe double digit gains next year. But, Bill, it comes with a lot more volatility than we saw this year.</p><p>Peak-to-trough decline this year, 5.7 percent, almost nothing. Expect double or triple that next year in terms of the peak-to-trough decline. Those are great opportunities for individual investors who have yet to invest the stock market.</p><p>GHARIB: Well, that's a bullish forecast.</p><p>Thanks a lot, Jeff, for coming on the program. Jeff Kleintop --</p><p>KLEINTOP: My pleasure.</p><p>GHARIB: -- chief market strategist at LPL Financial -- thanks again.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Meantime, Nordstrom's profit slipped in the third quarter, and that's where we begin tonight's \"Market Focus\". The high end retailer's net income was down from last year because the company held its anniversary sale event earlier this year and overhead expenses increased. The chain still topped estimates.</p><p>The stock initially fell on the results which came after the bell. Shares ended the day slightly higher at $63.43.</p><p>Meantime, Viacom (NYSE:VIA) saw a fourth quarter profit jump by 24 percent, driven by strong growth in the advertising, and increased home entertainment revenue. They media giant beat on both the top and the bottom lines, but the company said it expects ad revenue to decelerate this quarter. The weak outlook worried investors, certainly, shares fell almost 3 percent, closed at $80.75.</p><p>And the world's biggest burger chain is getting even better. McDonald's announced today that it plans to spend about $3 billion next year to open more than 1,500 new restaurants and remodeled 1,000 others. The plan is roughly in line with the company's spending forecast for the year. Micky D's finished a fraction lower, though, at $97.56.</p><p>GHARIB: RE/MAX posted its first quarterly report since going public in October. And it wasn't the kind of report that investors expected -- a 38 percent drop in earnings. The real estate brokerage chain blamed higher interest expenses and IPO related costs for the profit missed. Shares tumbled almost 2 percent to $27.75.</p><p>Under Armour (NYSE:UA) is entering the tech world with its first ever acquisition. The sports apparel maker will pay $150 million to buy Map My Fitness. This is a fitness application company. The purchase is an effort to get in on the wearable technology game. As for the shares, Under Armour (NYSE:UA) rose 1 percent to $83.53.</p><p>And Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A) takes a big stake in ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM). According to a piling with regulators, Buffett bought more than 40 million shares of the world's largest publicly traded oil company. Investors brought up ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) shares on the news. Exxon finished the regular session up fractionally to $93.22.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Certainly, Washington budget cuts are having an impact on at least one big defense contractor. That would be Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT). They announced plans to cut 4,000 jobs over the next two years, placing the blames squarely on a sharp drop in spending at the Pentagon. About half those losses will come from attrition, the other half by closing Lockheed facilities in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Texas, Arizona and in California.</p><p>GHARIB: Still ahead on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT: as many families begin their year-end tax planning, there are some strategies that could help you lower your tax bill.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GRIFFETH: Maybe hard to believe, but there are only six weeks left until the end of the year. So this may be a good time to start preparing for your 2013 taxes, just remember who reminded you of this -- especially with new changes to the tax code that could mean you're going to be paying more to Uncle Sam this next year.</p><p>So, what can you do now in the meantime?</p><p>Sharon Epperson has some answers tonight.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SHARON EPPERSON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Most people don't think about taxes in November, after all, tax returns aren't due until next April.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm not even there yet. I'm usually not a last minute person, so it might be mid-March, and then I start to get my stuff together.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I usually do my taxes in February. So we're -- I'm more into the holidays right now, if anything, you know, like Thanksgiving around the corner.</p><p>EPPERSON: But if you've had big changes in work or at home in the past 12 months, some tax moves that's made before the end of the year could result in big tax savings.</p><p>Real estate executive Linda Aronson meets regularly with her financial advisor to review tax-saving options, and make changes by December 31st that will allow her to make the most of her income.</p><p>LINDA ARONSON, TAXPAYER: The biggest change that I made this year was making sure that I was taking full advantage of every pretax opportunity that my firm offered, and trying to lower my taxes in that way.</p><p>EPPERSON: Financial advisor Rich Coppa suggests increasing pretax contributions to a 401(k) or another retire plan which lowers taxable income dollar for dollar.</p><p>RICHARD COPPA, WEALTH HEALTH MANAGING DIRECTOR: If your company is offering it, absolutely try to maximize your 401(k). This is an opportunity for you to reduce your taxes and have money growing for you for your retirement.</p><p>EPPERSON (on camera): It's important to get a handle on your tax situation now, because what you may owe or the refund you may get back from the IRS could be very different this year, particularly for high-income taxpayers.</p><p>(voice-over): Individuals with incomes over $400,000 and couples over $450,000 have been moved up to a 39.6 percent federal income tax bracket, up from 35 percent last year. And they have to pay the maximum 20 percent tax rate on long-term capital gains and qualifying dividends, up from 15 percent in 2012.</p><p>To cut down the tax bill, Coppa suggests deferring income and reviewing investments before the end of the year.</p><p>COPPA: We always look at any tax loss harvesting, which means that you would sell a position that would reduce -- you know, fell in value, take that loss to offset capital gain.</p><p>EPPERSON: With Coppa's guidance, Aronson says she's following some of these strategies --</p><p>ARONSON: I do think that as I've been making these changes, I will see a lesser tax bill.</p><p>EPPERSON: -- giving her some peace of mind.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Sharon Epperson.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GHARIB: And finally tonight, the cost of Thanksgiving dinner will be a little lower this year. The American Farm Bureau Federation says a classic turkey dinner will average $49.04 to feed 10 people. That's down 44 cents from 2012 and still averages less than $5 a serving. The big driver for the decline: turkey prices.</p><p>I love Thanksgiving.</p><p>GRIFFETH: I do, too. And we don't like cranberry sauce in my household, so it's even cheaper --</p><p>GHARIB: Lucky you, Bill.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Yes.</p><p>GHARIB: But keep the pumpkin pie.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Absolutely.</p><p>GHARIB: That's NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for tonight. I'm Susie Gharib. Thanks so much for watching.</p><p>GRIFFETH: I'm Bill Griffeth. Have a great evening. We'll see you tomorrow.</p><p>END</p><p>Nightly Business Report transcripts and video are available on-line post broadcast at <url normalizedValue=\"http://nbr.com\">http://nbr.com</url>.

President Obama says Americans can keep their canceled insurance policies,  changing one of the key provisions in the new health law.  But is it easier  said than done?</p><p>BILL GRIFFETH, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR:  Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO)  skid.  The stock tumbled, its worst dive in almost three years, after  warning a softening demand.  Does this tech bellwether help (ph) plan,  though, to turn things around? </p><p>GHARIB:  And Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) woes.  The world's largest retailer  lowers its annual profit, offering a glimpse into how Americans feel about  their economic well-being. </p><p>We have all that and more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for this  Thursday, November 14th. </p><p>Good evening, everyone.  I'm Susie Gharib. </p><p>GRIFFETH:  And I'm Bill Griffeth, in for Tyler tonight.</p><p>President Obama again trying to fix the Affordable Care Act, bowing to  mounting political pressure.  The president said today he will now allow  insurers to extend their canceled health care policies for one year, maybe  even longer, even if the coverage falls short of the new federal minimum  standards.</p><p>Now, speaking to reporters at the White House today, Mr. Obama  admitted his administration had botched the rollout of the new health care  law and he said he regretted that his assurances that Americans could keep  their health insurance plans if they liked it, that turned out to be wrong.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>OBAMA:  I think it's legitimate for them to expect me to have to win  back some credibility on this health care law in particular and on a whole  range of these issues in general.  And, you know, that's on me.  I mean, we  fumbled the rollout on this health care law.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  And House Speaker John Boehner did not mince words on his  prescription for the health care law.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. JOHN BOEHNER (R-OH), SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE:  Promise after promise  for this administration has turned out to be in the true.  So when it comes  to this health care law, the White House doesn't have much credibility.   And let's be clear: the only way to fully protect the American people is to  scrap this law once and for all. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GHARIB:  John Harwood joins us now from Washington with more on this.</p><p>You know, John, a lot of people wondering and questioning today, can  President Obama make these rule changes?  I mean, after all, the Affordable  Care Act is the law.  Does Congress at some point have to vote on this? </p><p>I mean, talk us through how the process will work. </p><p>JOHN HARWOOD, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Well, first of  all, Susie, I think the thing to remember about this is this is mostly  about the president trying to provide political cover for Democrats and for  himself to buy time until the exchanges are going to work, the Web site  will be fixed. </p><p>He's not compelling any changes, and he's not giving a huge new grant  of authority to states.  What he's doing is saying that if state insurance  commissioners and insurance companies want to extend policies further, they  can, but the reality is that most of them don't want to because they want  to move into the new world of insurance under the Affordable Care Act.  So,  it is not clear how much this will change. </p><p>It may extend some policies and at the very latest unless there's an  additional decision taken, some of those policies could go to the end of  September 2015, but it is not likely so far as I can tell that this is  going to make a whole sale change.  What the president was trying to resist  gutting of Obamacare and this is a minimum fix that he's trying to offer. </p><p>GRIFFETH:  Yes, as you mentioned, John, this is providing political  cover for those Senate -- Democrats on the House who face reelection next  year, but the fact the White House acknowledges that this fix could extend  beyond 2014, beyond that election year, that sounds ominous at this point  for trying to fix this whole thing. </p><p>HARWOOD:  It could, but I think that probably amounts to less than  meets the eye, Bill, and the reason is that administration, they said that  in their letter that was sent to state insurance commissioners earlier  today.  So, we've known that for most of the day, but what they are  counting on is that the Web site will be working, people will see better  options than the extension of these policies, and will be fine with moving  over to the new system.  That's why I said they are trying to buy time and  get over this rough period that they are in right now. </p><p>GRIFFETH:  John Harwood in Washington.  Thanks for the political angle  of that. </p><p>Let's talk about logistics, though.  Many insurance companies said  today they are worried about the president's fixes, saying that it could  destabilize the insurance market and result in higher premiums for  consumers. </p><p>Let's turn to Bertha Coombs, who's been following this story all  along.</p><p>What do these fixes mean for the insurance industry? </p><p>BERTHA COOMBS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Well, because  it's voluntary, it's something that they need to now take a look at.  And  essentially, the insurers turned a page on these plans.  So, they haven't  priced what they would be for 2014.  So, effectively, they now have a 30- day window that they would have to try to do this because people who want  those plans that are expiring on December 31st, to be able to renew them  for January 1st, they have to put their premiums in and pay them by the  15th of December. </p><p>So, here are the things they would need to do in the next 30 days,  they would need to figure out what the price is on those plans.  Calculate  all that for 2014.  They would need to get approval from state insurance  and the state insurance commissioners.  Washington state weighing this  afternoon saying they don't want to do this, and then they need to be able  to get the plans out to their customers and collect their premiums, all in  the next 30 days. </p><p>GHARIB:  So, it sounds like you're say thing is not feasible to do in  30 days.  Will the insurance companies now fight back on this, or are they  going to have to do what the White House wants them to do?</p><p>COOMBS:  Well, essentially, what's happened here is kind of like when  you play your mom off your dad.  Your dad kind of says, hey, it's not up to  me, ask your mother, she'll make the decision.  The president has now  shifted the decision to the insurers and the state insurance commissioners. </p><p>Aetna (NYSE:AET) essentially says we can try to do this but we would  have to get expedited reviews from all of these state commissioners in  order to do that and it is a logistical hurdle for them to do that over the  next 30 days.</p><p>Cigna says they are already working with a lot of their clients to try  to figure out a way to extend these plans.  So, they may be partly along  the way.  Some of these insurers have actually offered early renewals.  One  man who I talked whose plan was canceled, he had an early renewal that, in  order to sort of skirt the ACA rules, went until December 1st, so that can  probably be extended until the end of next year. </p><p>GRIFFETH:  There is a bit of a catch-22, though, because the president  said he hoped that those who had policies canceled would find a better  policy under ACA.  But if the Web site is not working, it's tough to do  that kind of comparison shopping. </p><p>COOMBS:  Well, and it's also tough for the insurers because these are  people who already are good about paying their premiums.  They already  understand insurance and they're already committed to buying insurance.   And if they're not buying on the exchange, that really throws into question  the viability of that marketplace. </p><p>GHARIB:  Real quickly, in just a word or two, what does this mean for  premiums if you have your old policy and you want to reinstall it, or new  policies?  Are they going up, prices? </p><p>COOMBS:  I would imagine.  I mean, the insurers have to figure out  what the price is.  They've already seen some prices trends in terms of  medical cost going up.  So, they would need to raise the plan rates. </p><p>GHARIB:  OK.  We'll get back to you on that. </p><p>GRIFFETH:  Thanks, Bertha. </p><p>GHARIB:  Thanks so much, Bertha.</p><p>Well, despite all the changes to the new health law, health care  stocks had a strong day, but the big talk on Wall Street was about Cisco  (NASDAQ:CSCO) and Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT).  Investors dumped Cisco  (NASDAQ:CSCO) shares, reacting to that bad earnings report we told you  about last night and that shaved 15 points off the Dow.</p><p>And Wal-Mart's earnings did little to inspire investors and that Dow  stock rose just a bit and we're going to have more analysis on both Wal- Mart (NYSE:WMT) and Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) in just a moment. </p><p>Still, though, the disappointments did not stop the market rally, and  new highs for the record books.  The Dow added 54 points to a fresh record.   The NASDAQ gained seven.  And the S&amp;P up 8 1/2 points.  It also moved to a  new high.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  All right.  Let's talk about shares of Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO)  Systems.  They were the biggest drag for the Dow today, also for the S&amp;P  and for the NASDAQ composite, with the stock tumbling 11 percent after  forecasting the continued decline in sales for the rest of the year. </p><p>Jon Fortt has more on what's driving Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) shares lower. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JON FORTT, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  After  Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) reported a bad quarter last night and a dismal outlook,  the stock had its worst day in almost three years. </p><p>(on camera):  The culprit: emerging markets, countries like India,  Brazil and Malaysia, that just a few months ago were bastions of growth are  turning into a nightmare for big tech companies.</p><p>JOHN CHAMBERS, CISCO SYSTEM CEO:  It isn't just high tech.  It's the  consumer companies of our customers, the people who sell in Brazil or sell  in India, or manufacture who sells in those areas, what you're seeing is  the GDP slowed.  And as they slowed, and you and others have talked about  it for almost six months, then confidence began to drop.  And if they're  looking for the U.S. to lead them out of this scenario, clearly, the last  month or two has not instilled a lot of confidence. </p><p>FORTT (voice-over):  At Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO), sales from the top five  emerging market countries fell 21 percent, and that's on top of a rough  sales environment in China that got worse because the NSA spying scandal  has buyers favoring local Chinese suppliers. </p><p>All of that led Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) to forecast sales this quarter  will be far lower than a year ago.  Analysts have been hoping they'd be up.  </p><p>And it's not just Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO).  IBM cited major trouble in  emerging markets during its quarterly report last month and Oracle  (NASDAQ:ORCL) has struggled in Asia, too.  A small networking player, fast- growing F5, says it's a regional issue. </p><p>JOHN MCADAM, F5 NETWORKS CEO:  Asia has been reasonably tough for us.   South Asia, Vietnam, Australia, China was particularly tough last quarter  and we told (ph) that in our conference call.</p><p>FORTT:  Things aren't likely to get better soon analysts fear.  What  Wall Street would like is a road map for how Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) will steer  through this.</p><p>MARK SUE, RBC CAPITAL MARKETS MANAGING DIRECTOR:  We do think it's a  several quarter issue.  We think China I think could be longer than that. </p><p>The next thing to look for is Cisco's analyst day, which comes up in  three weeks, and they really have to have some crisp responses in what  they're going to do. </p><p>FORTT (on camera):  One thing they're probably going to do is keep CEO  John Chambers around a little bit longer than some expect it.  Chambers  tells that he plans to retire sometime in 2016.  The board has asked him to  stick around and guide the company through this very rough patch. </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Jon Fortt.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GHARIB:  Well, it looks like Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) is also going through  a rough patch.  It posted quarterly earnings that were a penny better than  estimates for the third quarter but revenues were lower, and its outlook  for sales for the all-important holiday shopping period don't look to get  much better. </p><p>Courtney Reagan has the story. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>COURTNEY REAGAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):   The magic of Macy's appears to have been contained to just that retailer.   The confident telling (ph) Macy's executive expressed going into the all- important holiday quarter was absent in Wal-Mart's executive commentary in  its earnings report.  The world's largest retailer did exceed expectations  for earnings by one penny per share but sales fell short and the company's  forecast isn't inspiring much confidence either.</p><p>DANA TELSEY, TELSEY ADVISORY GROUP CEO:  I think it's a very cautious  tone.  You go into a holiday season where six fewer days, the sense of  urgency is greater and level of promotions feel like it's going to be  higher than ever.  </p><p>REAGAN:  Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) U.S. CEO Bill Simon says unemployment and  job stability tops the list of consumer concerns and says that while gas  prices have fallen, it's still a big piece of the budget for shoppers. </p><p>(on camera):  So, is Wal-Mart's sale's weakness due to poor execution  by the company or results of the still pressured shopper?  Likely, it's a  combination of both. </p><p>TELSEY:  There is limited amount of dollars to go around.  They now  are competing as a consumables business in a bigger way, and that's  definitely a more competitive space.  So, it's the customer and the  environment. </p><p>REAGAN (voice-over):   However, Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) says the company  is encouraged by the momentum coming out of the third quarter, nothing same  store sales and traffic improved throughout the quarter.  The key now is  making sure the trend continues. </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Courtney Reagan. </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  And there was more discouraging results at another big  discounter, this time, it's Kohl's (NYSE:KSS).  Their profits declined by  18 percent last quarter, with fewer customers shopping at their stores.   Shares of Khol's dropped sharply today, down 8 percent with the chain  cutting its full year earning's forecast as it predicts a pretty tough  holiday shopping season.</p><p>GHARIB:  And still ahead on the program, Janet Yellen, widely expected  to be confirmed as the next Fed chair, breezed through questions from  senators on Capitol Hill today.  Did her testimony send a message to the  stock market and investors? </p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Janet Yellen did take the first step in the confirmation  process to become the next chair of the Federal Reserve.  Current vice  chair of the central bank sounded positively dovish about the Fed's easy  money stimulus plans.  She said the U.S. economy still needs the Fed's help  and that helped stocks today, but will it win over the support of  lawmakers?  That's the question.</p><p>Hampton Pearson has more tonight.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HAMPTON PEARSON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):   At a Senate Banking Committee on her nomination to become the first woman  Fed president --  </p><p>JANET YELLIN, FEDERAL RESERVE CHAIR NOMINEE.  I do. </p><p>PEARSON:  -- Janet Yellen strongly defended the central bank's  economic stimulus policy but gave no hint of when tapering might begin. </p><p>YELLEN:  While there is no set time, we will decide to reduce the pace  of our purchases at each meeting, we are attempting to assess whether or  not the outlook is meeting the criterion that we have set out to begin the  pace of purchases. </p><p>PEARSON:  As Fed vice chairman, Yellen has been a key ally of Bernanke  in holding key short term interest rates near zero since late 2008 and  quadrupling the Fed's balance sheet to some $3.8 trillion done with massive  monthly bond purchases. </p><p>The housing recovery and strong auto sales she says are prime examples  of how the stimulus benefitted both Main Street and Wall Street. </p><p>YELLEN:  We have seen interest rates fall very substantially.  Lower  interest rates, lower mortgage rates, particularly I think have been  instrumental in -- it's not the only factor, but it has been the positive  factor. </p><p>PEARSON:  When asked about Fed regulation in the future of banks  judged too big to fail, Yellen said, as chairman, one of her highest  priorities would be to reduce any advantages enjoyed by the nation's  largest banks.</p><p>YELLEN:  We have made progress in promoting a strong and stable  financial system but here, too, important work lies ahead.  I'm committed  to using the Fed's supervisory and regulatory role to reduce the threat of  another financial crisis. </p><p>PEARSON (on camera):  A senior aid tells me, Yellen's strong  performance today is paving the way for a full vote by the Senate Banking  Committee early next week.  The timetable for a full Senate confirmation is  still up in the air.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Hampton Pearson on Capitol Hill. </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GHARIB:  So, what did investors learn about what a Janet Yellen Fed  could mean for the stock market? </p><p>Joining us to talk about that, Jeff Kleintop, chief market strategist  at LPL Financial. </p><p>So, Jeff, what was the takeaway for investors here?  It was very  civilized hearing.  There was no fireworks.  She gave assurances that the  Fed is going to keep on stimulating the economy.</p><p>Is this a buy signal for the markets? </p><p>JEFF KLEINTOP, LPL FINANCIAL CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST:  Well, it's  certainly good news in the sense that she communicated that the Fed is  going to remain friendly to the markets, meaning continuing this insurance  policy the Fed has put in place through the bond-buying program at the same  time she acknowledged better growth in the private sector.  She said the  best of both worlds, the Fed remaining in the background is ensure against  anything going wrong and continuing that stimulus, but at the same time  better economic momentum.  It sounds like a recipe for continued gains in  the stock market. </p><p>GRIFFETH:  What about the bond market?  Yields fell today.  In fact,  they fell last night when they first released her testimony to the Senate  Banking Committee, and rates have been rising recently, expecting a  tapering by the Fed sooner rather than later. </p><p>Do you see yields going even further lower? </p><p>KLEINTOP:  You know, I think yields are in a range right now.  I don't  think anything Janet said today is going to break them out of that.   Clearly, we were coming up on this December Fed meeting about a month from  now, a little more than a month from now, where, you know, they will be  deciding whether they're going to taper.  I don't think they'll have enough  information to do that. </p><p>I think that's what we heard from Janet today, very much walking the  same line Ben has said, which is stayed independent and we're not sure yet.   The bond market interestingly has not really -- we haven't seen a  dramatically steeper yield curve on the idea that Janet would be much  easier in terms of monetary policy risking longer term inflation in the  bond market.  Instead, we see more continuation of Ben's policies. </p><p>GHARIB:  But, you know, Jeff, at some point, this reducing the  stimulus is going to happen, whether it's in March or later than that, it's  going to happen and a lot of experts have said it's going to be tricky.   And today, Alan Greenspan was quoted as saying for Yellen, she faces very  daunting problems.</p><p>So, what could that mean for the markets?  What could that mean for  the economy in terms of something going wrong?  It's going to be tough,  right? </p><p>KLEINTOP:  Absolutely.  Communication is going to key.  And now that  we know who the Fed chairman is going to be through the bulk of 2014, it  lends more credibility to the Fed's message on what they're going to do on  QE.  And that should ease the transition.</p><p>Listen, you're right, there is no surprise that this is coming -- a  slowing down of these bond purchases and as long as it's accompanied by  better growth, it should be good news for the stock market. </p><p>But we only have to look back to the end of QE1 and QE2 to remember  the knee-jerk reactions in the stock market, decline between 15 percent and  20 percent that accompanied those.  Now, there were other background  factors involved.  But that's the knee-jerk reaction and we have to keep  that in the back of our minds here, even though we're much more braced and  in a better position economically for this transition. </p><p>GRIFFETH:  Very quickly --  </p><p>KLEINTOP:  So, expect some volatility, but ultimately, some gains for  the year.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  I'm going to try to pin you down a little more than that.   I mean, we're sitting here at all time highs for the Dow and the S&amp;P.  Do  you see us continuing higher even as the Fed continues to talk about no  tapering right now?</p><p>KLEINTOP:  Yes, I do.  We believe here at LPL and the research  department that we're going to see substantial gains, maybe double digit  gains next year.  But, Bill, it comes with a lot more volatility than we  saw this year.</p><p>Peak-to-trough decline this year, 5.7 percent, almost nothing.  Expect  double or triple that next year in terms of the peak-to-trough decline.   Those are great opportunities for individual investors who have yet to  invest the stock market. </p><p>GHARIB:  Well, that's a bullish forecast. </p><p>Thanks a lot, Jeff, for coming on the program.  Jeff Kleintop --  </p><p>KLEINTOP:  My pleasure.</p><p>GHARIB:  -- chief market strategist at LPL Financial -- thanks again.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Meantime, Nordstrom's profit slipped in the third quarter,  and that's where we begin tonight's \"Market Focus\".  The high end  retailer's net income was down from last year because the company held its  anniversary sale event earlier this year and overhead expenses increased.   The chain still topped estimates. </p><p>The stock initially fell on the results which came after the bell.   Shares ended the day slightly higher at $63.43. </p><p>Meantime, Viacom (NYSE:VIA) saw a fourth quarter profit jump by 24  percent, driven by strong growth in the advertising, and increased home  entertainment revenue.  They media giant beat on both the top and the  bottom lines, but the company said it expects ad revenue to decelerate this  quarter.  The weak outlook worried investors, certainly, shares fell almost  3 percent, closed at $80.75.</p><p>And the world's biggest burger chain is getting even better.   McDonald's announced today that it plans to spend about $3 billion next  year to open more than 1,500 new restaurants and remodeled 1,000 others.   The plan is roughly in line with the company's spending forecast for the  year.  Micky D's finished a fraction lower, though, at $97.56.</p><p>GHARIB:  RE/MAX posted its first quarterly report since going public  in October.  And it wasn't the kind of report that investors expected -- a  38 percent drop in earnings.  The real estate brokerage chain blamed higher  interest expenses and IPO related costs for the profit missed.  Shares  tumbled almost 2 percent to $27.75.</p><p>Under Armour (NYSE:UA) is entering the tech world with its first ever  acquisition.  The sports apparel maker will pay $150 million to buy Map My  Fitness.  This is a fitness application company.  The purchase is an effort  to get in on the wearable technology game.  As for the shares, Under Armour  (NYSE:UA) rose 1 percent to $83.53.</p><p>And Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A) takes a big stake  in ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM).  According to a piling with regulators, Buffett  bought more than 40 million shares of the world's largest publicly traded  oil company.  Investors brought up ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) shares on the  news.  Exxon finished the regular session up fractionally to $93.22. </p><p>GRIFFETH:  Certainly, Washington budget cuts are having an impact on  at least one big defense contractor.  That would be Lockheed Martin  (NYSE:LMT).  They announced plans to cut 4,000 jobs over the next two  years, placing the blames squarely on a sharp drop in spending at the  Pentagon.  About half those losses will come from attrition, the other half  by closing Lockheed facilities in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Texas, Arizona and in  California.</p><p>GHARIB:  Still ahead on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT: as many families  begin their year-end tax planning, there are some strategies that could  help you lower your tax bill.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Maybe hard to believe, but there are only six weeks left  until the end of the year.  So this may be a good time to start preparing  for your 2013 taxes, just remember who reminded you of this -- especially  with new changes to the tax code that could mean you're going to be paying  more to Uncle Sam this next year.</p><p>So, what can you do now in the meantime? </p><p>Sharon Epperson has some answers tonight.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SHARON EPPERSON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):   Most people don't think about taxes in November, after all, tax returns  aren't due until next April. </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I'm not even there yet.  I'm usually not a last  minute person, so it might be mid-March, and then I start to get my stuff  together.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I usually do my taxes in February.  So we're --  I'm more into the holidays right now, if anything, you know, like  Thanksgiving around the corner. </p><p>EPPERSON:  But if you've had big changes in work or at home in the  past 12 months, some tax moves that's made before the end of the year could  result in big tax savings. </p><p>Real estate executive Linda Aronson meets regularly with her financial  advisor to review tax-saving options, and make changes by December 31st  that will allow her to make the most of her income. </p><p>LINDA ARONSON, TAXPAYER:  The biggest change that I made this year was  making sure that I was taking full advantage of every pretax opportunity  that my firm offered, and trying to lower my taxes in that way. </p><p>EPPERSON:  Financial advisor Rich Coppa suggests increasing pretax  contributions to a 401(k) or another retire plan which lowers taxable  income dollar for dollar. </p><p>RICHARD COPPA, WEALTH HEALTH MANAGING DIRECTOR:  If your company is  offering it, absolutely try to maximize your 401(k).  This is an  opportunity for you to reduce your taxes and have money growing for you for  your retirement. </p><p>EPPERSON (on camera):  It's important to get a handle on your tax  situation now, because what you may owe or the refund you may get back from  the IRS could be very different this year, particularly for high-income  taxpayers. </p><p>(voice-over):  Individuals with incomes over $400,000 and couples over  $450,000 have been moved up to a 39.6 percent federal income tax bracket,  up from 35 percent last year.  And they have to pay the maximum 20 percent  tax rate on long-term capital gains and qualifying dividends, up from 15  percent in 2012. </p><p>To cut down the tax bill, Coppa suggests deferring income and  reviewing investments before the end of the year. </p><p>COPPA:  We always look at any tax loss harvesting, which means that  you would sell a position that would reduce -- you know, fell in value,  take that loss to offset capital gain. </p><p>EPPERSON:  With Coppa's guidance, Aronson says she's following some of  these strategies -- </p><p>ARONSON:  I do think that as I've been making these changes, I will  see a lesser tax bill.</p><p>EPPERSON:  -- giving her some peace of mind. </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Sharon Epperson. </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GHARIB:  And finally tonight, the cost of Thanksgiving dinner will be  a little lower this year.  The American Farm Bureau Federation says a  classic turkey dinner will average $49.04 to feed 10 people.  That's down  44 cents from 2012 and still averages less than $5 a serving.  The big  driver for the decline: turkey prices. </p><p>I love Thanksgiving. </p><p>GRIFFETH:  I do, too.  And we don't like cranberry sauce in my  household, so it's even cheaper --  </p><p>GHARIB:  Lucky you, Bill.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Yes.</p><p>GHARIB:  But keep the pumpkin pie. </p><p>GRIFFETH:  Absolutely.</p><p>GHARIB:  That's NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for tonight.  I'm Susie  Gharib.  Thanks so much for watching. </p><p>GRIFFETH:  I'm Bill Griffeth.  Have a great evening.  We'll see you  tomorrow.</p><p>END</p><p>Nightly Business Report transcripts and video are available on-line post  broadcast at <url normalizedValue=\"http://nbr.com\">http://nbr.com</url>.

Does Congress at some point have to vote on this?</p><p>I mean, talk us through how the process will work.</p><p>JOHN HARWOOD, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Well, first of all, Susie, I think the thing to remember about this is this is mostly about the president trying to provide political cover for Democrats and for himself to buy time until the exchanges are going to work, the Web site will be fixed.</p><p>He`s not compelling any changes, and he`s not giving a huge new grant of authority to states. What he`s doing is saying that if state insurance commissioners and insurance companies want to extend policies further, they can, but the reality is that most of them don`t want to because they want to move into the new world of insurance under the Affordable Care Act. So, it is not clear how much this will change.</p><p>It may extend some policies and at the very latest unless there`s an additional decision taken, some of those policies could go to the end of September 2015, but it is not likely so far as I can tell that this is going to make a whole sale change. What the president was trying to resist gutting of Obamacare and this is a minimum fix that he`s trying to offer.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Yes, as you mentioned, John, this is providing political cover for those Senate -- Democrats on the House who face reelection next year, but the fact the White House acknowledges that this fix could extend beyond 2014, beyond that election year, that sounds ominous at this point for trying to fix this whole thing.</p><p>HARWOOD: It could, but I think that probably amounts to less than meets the eye, Bill, and the reason is that administration, they said that in their letter that was sent to state insurance commissioners earlier today. So, we`ve known that for most of the day, but what they are counting on is that the Web site will be working, people will see better options than the extension of these policies, and will be fine with moving over to the new system. That`s why I said they are trying to buy time and get over this rough period that they are in right now.</p><p>GRIFFETH: John Harwood in Washington. Thanks for the political angle of that.</p><p>Let`s talk about logistics, though. Many insurance companies said today they are worried about the president`s fixes, saying that it could destabilize the insurance market and result in higher premiums for consumers.</p><p>Let`s turn to Bertha Coombs, who`s been following this story all along.</p><p>What do these fixes mean for the insurance industry?</p><p>BERTHA COOMBS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Well, because it`s voluntary, it`s something that they need to now take a look at. And essentially, the insurers turned a page on these plans. So, they haven`t priced what they would be for 2014. So, effectively, they now have a 30- day window that they would have to try to do this because people who want those plans that are expiring on December 31st, to be able to renew them for January 1st, they have to put their premiums in and pay them by the 15th of December.</p><p>So, here are the things they would need to do in the next 30 days, they would need to figure out what the price is on those plans. Calculate all that for 2014. They would need to get approval from state insurance and the state insurance commissioners. Washington state weighing this afternoon saying they don`t want to do this, and then they need to be able to get the plans out to their customers and collect their premiums, all in the next 30 days.</p><p>GHARIB: So, it sounds like you`re say thing is not feasible to do in 30 days. Will the insurance companies now fight back on this, or are they going to have to do what the White House wants them to do?</p><p>COOMBS: Well, essentially, what`s happened here is kind of like when you play your mom off your dad. Your dad kind of says, hey, it`s not up to me, ask your mother, she`ll make the decision. The president has now shifted the decision to the insurers and the state insurance commissioners.</p><p>Aetna (NYSE:AET) essentially says we can try to do this but we would have to get expedited reviews from all of these state commissioners in order to do that and it is a logistical hurdle for them to do that over the next 30 days.</p><p>Cigna says they are already working with a lot of their clients to try to figure out a way to extend these plans. So, they may be partly along the way. Some of these insurers have actually offered early renewals. One man who I talked whose plan was canceled, he had an early renewal that, in order to sort of skirt the ACA rules, went until December 1st, so that can probably be extended until the end of next year.</p><p>GRIFFETH: There is a bit of a catch-22, though, because the president said he hoped that those who had policies canceled would find a better policy under ACA. But if the Web site is not working, it`s tough to do that kind of comparison shopping.</p><p>COOMBS: Well, and it`s also tough for the insurers because these are people who already are good about paying their premiums. They already understand insurance and they`re already committed to buying insurance. And if they`re not buying on the exchange, that really throws into question the viability of that marketplace.</p><p>GHARIB: Real quickly, in just a word or two, what does this mean for premiums if you have your old policy and you want to reinstall it, or new policies? Are they going up, prices?</p><p>COOMBS: I would imagine. I mean, the insurers have to figure out what the price is. They`ve already seen some prices trends in terms of medical cost going up. So, they would need to raise the plan rates.</p><p>GHARIB: OK. We`ll get back to you on that.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Thanks, Bertha.</p><p>GHARIB: Thanks so much, Bertha.</p><p>Well, despite all the changes to the new health law, health care stocks had a strong day, but the big talk on Wall Street was about Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) and Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT). Investors dumped Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) shares, reacting to that bad earnings report we told you about last night and that shaved 15 points off the Dow.</p><p>And Wal-Mart`s earnings did little to inspire investors and that Dow stock rose just a bit and we`re going to have more analysis on both Wal- Mart (NYSE:WMT) and Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) in just a moment.</p><p>Still, though, the disappointments did not stop the market rally, and new highs for the record books. The Dow added 54 points to a fresh record. The NASDAQ gained seven. And the S&amp;P up 8 1/2 points. It also moved to a new high.</p><p>GRIFFETH: All right. Let`s talk about shares of Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) Systems. They were the biggest drag for the Dow today, also for the S&amp;P and for the NASDAQ composite, with the stock tumbling 11 percent after forecasting the continued decline in sales for the rest of the year.</p><p>Jon Fortt has more on what`s driving Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) shares lower.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JON FORTT, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): After Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) reported a bad quarter last night and a dismal outlook, the stock had its worst day in almost three years.</p><p>(on camera): The culprit: emerging markets, countries like India, Brazil and Malaysia, that just a few months ago were bastions of growth are turning into a nightmare for big tech companies.</p><p>JOHN CHAMBERS, CISCO SYSTEM CEO: It isn`t just high tech. It`s the consumer companies of our customers, the people who sell in Brazil or sell in India, or manufacture who sells in those areas, what you`re seeing is the GDP slowed. And as they slowed, and you and others have talked about it for almost six months, then confidence began to drop. And if they`re looking for the U.S. to lead them out of this scenario, clearly, the last month or two has not instilled a lot of confidence.</p><p>FORTT (voice-over): At Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO), sales from the top five emerging market countries fell 21 percent, and that`s on top of a rough sales environment in China that got worse because the NSA spying scandal has buyers favoring local Chinese suppliers.</p><p>All of that led Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) to forecast sales this quarter will be far lower than a year ago. Analysts have been hoping they`d be up.</p><p>And it`s not just Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO). IBM cited major trouble in emerging markets during its quarterly report last month and Oracle (NASDAQ:ORCL) has struggled in Asia, too. A small networking player, fast- growing F5, says it`s a regional issue.</p><p>JOHN MCADAM, F5 NETWORKS CEO: Asia has been reasonably tough for us. South Asia, Vietnam, Australia, China was particularly tough last quarter and we told (ph) that in our conference call.</p><p>FORTT: Things aren`t likely to get better soon analysts fear. What Wall Street would like is a road map for how Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) will steer through this.</p><p>MARK SUE, RBC CAPITAL MARKETS MANAGING DIRECTOR: We do think it`s a several quarter issue. We think China I think could be longer than that.</p><p>The next thing to look for is Cisco`s analyst day, which comes up in three weeks, and they really have to have some crisp responses in what they`re going to do.</p><p>FORTT (on camera): One thing they`re probably going to do is keep CEO John Chambers around a little bit longer than some expect it. Chambers tells that he plans to retire sometime in 2016. The board has asked him to stick around and guide the company through this very rough patch.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Jon Fortt.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GHARIB: Well, it looks like Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) is also going through a rough patch. It posted quarterly earnings that were a penny better than estimates for the third quarter but revenues were lower, and its outlook for sales for the all-important holiday shopping period don`t look to get much better.</p><p>Courtney Reagan has the story.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>COURTNEY REAGAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The magic of Macy`s appears to have been contained to just that retailer. The confident telling (ph) Macy`s executive expressed going into the all- important holiday quarter was absent in Wal-Mart`s executive commentary in its earnings report. The world`s largest retailer did exceed expectations for earnings by one penny per share but sales fell short and the company`s forecast isn`t inspiring much confidence either.</p><p>DANA TELSEY, TELSEY ADVISORY GROUP CEO: I think it`s a very cautious tone. You go into a holiday season where six fewer days, the sense of urgency is greater and level of promotions feel like it`s going to be higher than ever.</p><p>REAGAN: Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) U.S. CEO Bill Simon says unemployment and job stability tops the list of consumer concerns and says that while gas prices have fallen, it`s still a big piece of the budget for shoppers.</p><p>(on camera): So, is Wal-Mart`s sale`s weakness due to poor execution by the company or results of the still pressured shopper? Likely, it`s a combination of both.</p><p>TELSEY: There is limited amount of dollars to go around. They now are competing as a consumables business in a bigger way, and that`s definitely a more competitive space. So, it`s the customer and the environment.</p><p>REAGAN (voice-over): However, Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) says the company is encouraged by the momentum coming out of the third quarter, nothing same store sales and traffic improved throughout the quarter. The key now is making sure the trend continues.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Courtney Reagan.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH: And there was more discouraging results at another big discounter, this time, it`s Kohl`s (NYSE:KSS). Their profits declined by 18 percent last quarter, with fewer customers shopping at their stores. Shares of Khol`s dropped sharply today, down 8 percent with the chain cutting its full year earning`s forecast as it predicts a pretty tough holiday shopping season.</p><p>GHARIB: And still ahead on the program, Janet Yellen, widely expected to be confirmed as the next Fed chair, breezed through questions from senators on Capitol Hill today. Did her testimony send a message to the stock market and investors?</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GRIFFETH: Janet Yellen did take the first step in the confirmation process to become the next chair of the Federal Reserve. Current vice chair of the central bank sounded positively dovish about the Fed`s easy money stimulus plans. She said the U.S. economy still needs the Fed`s help and that helped stocks today, but will it win over the support of lawmakers? That`s the question.</p><p>Hampton Pearson has more tonight.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HAMPTON PEARSON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): At a Senate Banking Committee on her nomination to become the first woman Fed president --</p><p>JANET YELLIN, FEDERAL RESERVE CHAIR NOMINEE. I do.</p><p>PEARSON: -- Janet Yellen strongly defended the central bank`s economic stimulus policy but gave no hint of when tapering might begin.</p><p>YELLEN: While there is no set time, we will decide to reduce the pace of our purchases at each meeting, we are attempting to assess whether or not the outlook is meeting the criterion that we have set out to begin the pace of purchases.</p><p>PEARSON: As Fed vice chairman, Yellen has been a key ally of Bernanke in holding key short term interest rates near zero since late 2008 and quadrupling the Fed`s balance sheet to some $3.8 trillion done with massive monthly bond purchases.</p><p>The housing recovery and strong auto sales she says are prime examples of how the stimulus benefitted both Main Street and Wall Street.</p><p>YELLEN: We have seen interest rates fall very substantially. Lower interest rates, lower mortgage rates, particularly I think have been instrumental in -- it`s not the only factor, but it has been the positive factor.</p><p>PEARSON: When asked about Fed regulation in the future of banks judged too big to fail, Yellen said, as chairman, one of her highest priorities would be to reduce any advantages enjoyed by the nation`s largest banks.</p><p>YELLEN: We have made progress in promoting a strong and stable financial system but here, too, important work lies ahead. I`m committed to using the Fed`s supervisory and regulatory role to reduce the threat of another financial crisis.</p><p>PEARSON (on camera): A senior aid tells me, Yellen`s strong performance today is paving the way for a full vote by the Senate Banking Committee early next week. The timetable for a full Senate confirmation is still up in the air.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Hampton Pearson on Capitol Hill.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GHARIB: So, what did investors learn about what a Janet Yellen Fed could mean for the stock market?</p><p>Joining us to talk about that, Jeff Kleintop, chief market strategist at LPL Financial.</p><p>So, Jeff, what was the takeaway for investors here? It was very civilized hearing. There was no fireworks. She gave assurances that the Fed is going to keep on stimulating the economy.</p><p>Is this a buy signal for the markets?</p><p>JEFF KLEINTOP, LPL FINANCIAL CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST: Well, it`s certainly good news in the sense that she communicated that the Fed is going to remain friendly to the markets, meaning continuing this insurance policy the Fed has put in place through the bond-buying program at the same time she acknowledged better growth in the private sector. She said the best of both worlds, the Fed remaining in the background is ensure against anything going wrong and continuing that stimulus, but at the same time better economic momentum. It sounds like a recipe for continued gains in the stock market.</p><p>GRIFFETH: What about the bond market? Yields fell today. In fact, they fell last night when they first released her testimony to the Senate Banking Committee, and rates have been rising recently, expecting a tapering by the Fed sooner rather than later.</p><p>Do you see yields going even further lower?</p><p>KLEINTOP: You know, I think yields are in a range right now. I don`t think anything Janet said today is going to break them out of that. Clearly, we were coming up on this December Fed meeting about a month from now, a little more than a month from now, where, you know, they will be deciding whether they`re going to taper. I don`t think they`ll have enough information to do that.</p><p>I think that`s what we heard from Janet today, very much walking the same line Ben has said, which is stayed independent and we`re not sure yet. The bond market interestingly has not really -- we haven`t seen a dramatically steeper yield curve on the idea that Janet would be much easier in terms of monetary policy risking longer term inflation in the bond market. Instead, we see more continuation of Ben`s policies.</p><p>GHARIB: But, you know, Jeff, at some point, this reducing the stimulus is going to happen, whether it`s in March or later than that, it`s going to happen and a lot of experts have said it`s going to be tricky. And today, Alan Greenspan was quoted as saying for Yellen, she faces very daunting problems.</p><p>So, what could that mean for the markets? What could that mean for the economy in terms of something going wrong? It`s going to be tough, right?</p><p>KLEINTOP: Absolutely. Communication is going to key. And now that we know who the Fed chairman is going to be through the bulk of 2014, it lends more credibility to the Fed`s message on what they`re going to do on QE. And that should ease the transition.</p><p>Listen, you`re right, there is no surprise that this is coming -- a slowing down of these bond purchases and as long as it`s accompanied by better growth, it should be good news for the stock market.</p><p>But we only have to look back to the end of QE1 and QE2 to remember the knee-jerk reactions in the stock market, decline between 15 percent and 20 percent that accompanied those. Now, there were other background factors involved. But that`s the knee-jerk reaction and we have to keep that in the back of our minds here, even though we`re much more braced and in a better position economically for this transition.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Very quickly --</p><p>KLEINTOP: So, expect some volatility, but ultimately, some gains for the year.</p><p>GRIFFETH: I`m going to try to pin you down a little more than that. I mean, we`re sitting here at all time highs for the Dow and the S&amp;P. Do you see us continuing higher even as the Fed continues to talk about no tapering right now?</p><p>KLEINTOP: Yes, I do. We believe here at LPL and the research department that we`re going to see substantial gains, maybe double digit gains next year. But, Bill, it comes with a lot more volatility than we saw this year.</p><p>Peak-to-trough decline this year, 5.7 percent, almost nothing. Expect double or triple that next year in terms of the peak-to-trough decline. Those are great opportunities for individual investors who have yet to invest the stock market.</p><p>GHARIB: Well, that`s a bullish forecast.</p><p>Thanks a lot, Jeff, for coming on the program. Jeff Kleintop --</p><p>KLEINTOP: My pleasure.</p><p>GHARIB: -- chief market strategist at LPL Financial -- thanks again.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Meantime, Nordstrom`s profit slipped in the third quarter, and that`s where we begin tonight`s \"Market Focus\". The high end retailer`s net income was down from last year because the company held its anniversary sale event earlier this year and overhead expenses increased. The chain still topped estimates.</p><p>The stock initially fell on the results which came after the bell. Shares ended the day slightly higher at $63.43.</p><p>Meantime, Viacom (NYSE:VIA) saw a fourth quarter profit jump by 24 percent, driven by strong growth in the advertising, and increased home entertainment revenue. They media giant beat on both the top and the bottom lines, but the company said it expects ad revenue to decelerate this quarter. The weak outlook worried investors, certainly, shares fell almost 3 percent, closed at $80.75.</p><p>And the world`s biggest burger chain is getting even better. McDonald`s announced today that it plans to spend about $3 billion next year to open more than 1,500 new restaurants and remodeled 1,000 others. The plan is roughly in line with the company`s spending forecast for the year. Micky D`s finished a fraction lower, though, at $97.56.</p><p>GHARIB: RE/MAX posted its first quarterly report since going public in October. And it wasn`t the kind of report that investors expected -- a 38 percent drop in earnings. The real estate brokerage chain blamed higher interest expenses and IPO related costs for the profit missed. Shares tumbled almost 2 percent to $27.75.</p><p>Under Armour (NYSE:UA) is entering the tech world with its first ever acquisition. The sports apparel maker will pay $150 million to buy Map My Fitness. This is a fitness application company. The purchase is an effort to get in on the wearable technology game. As for the shares, Under Armour (NYSE:UA) rose 1 percent to $83.53.</p><p>And Warren Buffett`s Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A) takes a big stake in ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM). According to a piling with regulators, Buffett bought more than 40 million shares of the world`s largest publicly traded oil company. Investors brought up ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) shares on the news. Exxon finished the regular session up fractionally to $93.22.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Certainly, Washington budget cuts are having an impact on at least one big defense contractor. That would be Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT). They announced plans to cut 4,000 jobs over the next two years, placing the blames squarely on a sharp drop in spending at the Pentagon. About half those losses will come from attrition, the other half by closing Lockheed facilities in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Texas, Arizona and in California.</p><p>GHARIB: Still ahead on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT: as many families begin their year-end tax planning, there are some strategies that could help you lower your tax bill.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GRIFFETH: Maybe hard to believe, but there are only six weeks left until the end of the year. So this may be a good time to start preparing for your 2013 taxes, just remember who reminded you of this -- especially with new changes to the tax code that could mean you`re going to be paying more to Uncle Sam this next year.</p><p>So, what can you do now in the meantime?</p><p>Sharon Epperson has some answers tonight.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SHARON EPPERSON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Most people don`t think about taxes in November, after all, tax returns aren`t due until next April.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I`m not even there yet. I`m usually not a last minute person, so it might be mid-March, and then I start to get my stuff together.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I usually do my taxes in February. So we`re -- I`m more into the holidays right now, if anything, you know, like Thanksgiving around the corner.</p><p>EPPERSON: But if you`ve had big changes in work or at home in the past 12 months, some tax moves that`s made before the end of the year could result in big tax savings.</p><p>Real estate executive Linda Aronson meets regularly with her financial advisor to review tax-saving options, and make changes by December 31st that will allow her to make the most of her income.</p><p>LINDA ARONSON, TAXPAYER: The biggest change that I made this year was making sure that I was taking full advantage of every pretax opportunity that my firm offered, and trying to lower my taxes in that way.</p><p>EPPERSON: Financial advisor Rich Coppa suggests increasing pretax contributions to a 401(k) or another retire plan which lowers taxable income dollar for dollar.</p><p>RICHARD COPPA, WEALTH HEALTH MANAGING DIRECTOR: If your company is offering it, absolutely try to maximize your 401(k). This is an opportunity for you to reduce your taxes and have money growing for you for your retirement.</p><p>EPPERSON (on camera): It`s important to get a handle on your tax situation now, because what you may owe or the refund you may get back from the IRS could be very different this year, particularly for high-income taxpayers.</p><p>(voice-over): Individuals with incomes over $400,000 and couples over $450,000 have been moved up to a 39.6 percent federal income tax bracket, up from 35 percent last year. And they have to pay the maximum 20 percent tax rate on long-term capital gains and qualifying dividends, up from 15 percent in 2012.</p><p>To cut down the tax bill, Coppa suggests deferring income and reviewing investments before the end of the year.</p><p>COPPA: We always look at any tax loss harvesting, which means that you would sell a position that would reduce -- you know, fell in value, take that loss to offset capital gain.</p><p>EPPERSON: With Coppa`s guidance, Aronson says she`s following some of these strategies --</p><p>ARONSON: I do think that as I`ve been making these changes, I will see a lesser tax bill.</p><p>EPPERSON: -- giving her some peace of mind.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Sharon Epperson.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GHARIB: And finally tonight, the cost of Thanksgiving dinner will be a little lower this year. The American Farm Bureau Federation says a classic turkey dinner will average $49.04 to feed 10 people. That`s down 44 cents from 2012 and still averages less than $5 a serving. The big driver for the decline: turkey prices.</p><p>I love Thanksgiving.</p><p>GRIFFETH: I do, too. And we don`t like cranberry sauce in my household, so it`s even cheaper --</p><p>GHARIB: Lucky you, Bill.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Yes.</p><p>GHARIB: But keep the pumpkin pie.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Absolutely.</p><p>GHARIB: That`s NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for tonight. I`m Susie Gharib. Thanks so much for watching.</p><p>GRIFFETH: I`m Bill Griffeth. Have a great evening.

President Obama says Americans can keep their canceled insurance policies,  changing one of the key provisions in the new health law.  But is it easier  said than done?</p><p>BILL GRIFFETH, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR:  Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO)  skid.  The stock tumbled, its worst dive in almost three years, after  warning a softening demand.  Does this tech bellwether help (ph) plan,  though, to turn things around? </p><p>GHARIB:  And Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) woes.  The world's largest retailer  lowers its annual profit, offering a glimpse into how Americans feel about  their economic well-being. </p><p>We have all that and more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for this  Thursday, November 14th. </p><p>Good evening, everyone.  I'm Susie Gharib. </p><p>GRIFFETH:  And I'm Bill Griffeth, in for Tyler tonight.</p><p>President Obama again trying to fix the Affordable Care Act, bowing to  mounting political pressure.  The president said today he will now allow  insurers to extend their canceled health care policies for one year, maybe  even longer, even if the coverage falls short of the new federal minimum  standards.</p><p>Now, speaking to reporters at the White House today, Mr. Obama  admitted his administration had botched the rollout of the new health care  law and he said he regretted that his assurances that Americans could keep  their health insurance plans if they liked it, that turned out to be wrong.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>OBAMA:  I think it's legitimate for them to expect me to have to win  back some credibility on this health care law in particular and on a whole  range of these issues in general.  And, you know, that's on me.  I mean, we  fumbled the rollout on this health care law.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  And House Speaker John Boehner did not mince words on his  prescription for the health care law.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. JOHN BOEHNER (R-OH), SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE:  Promise after promise  for this administration has turned out to be in the true.  So when it comes  to this health care law, the White House doesn't have much credibility.   And let's be clear: the only way to fully protect the American people is to  scrap this law once and for all. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GHARIB:  John Harwood joins us now from Washington with more on this.</p><p>You know, John, a lot of people wondering and questioning today, can  President Obama make these rule changes?  I mean, after all, the Affordable  Care Act is the law.  Does Congress at some point have to vote on this? </p><p>I mean, talk us through how the process will work. </p><p>JOHN HARWOOD, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Well, first of  all, Susie, I think the thing to remember about this is this is mostly  about the president trying to provide political cover for Democrats and for  himself to buy time until the exchanges are going to work, the Web site  will be fixed. </p><p>He's not compelling any changes, and he's not giving a huge new grant  of authority to states.  What he's doing is saying that if state insurance  commissioners and insurance companies want to extend policies further, they  can, but the reality is that most of them don't want to because they want  to move into the new world of insurance under the Affordable Care Act.  So,  it is not clear how much this will change. </p><p>It may extend some policies and at the very latest unless there's an  additional decision taken, some of those policies could go to the end of  September 2015, but it is not likely so far as I can tell that this is  going to make a whole sale change.  What the president was trying to resist  gutting of Obamacare and this is a minimum fix that he's trying to offer. </p><p>GRIFFETH:  Yes, as you mentioned, John, this is providing political  cover for those Senate -- Democrats on the House who face reelection next  year, but the fact the White House acknowledges that this fix could extend  beyond 2014, beyond that election year, that sounds ominous at this point  for trying to fix this whole thing. </p><p>HARWOOD:  It could, but I think that probably amounts to less than  meets the eye, Bill, and the reason is that administration, they said that  in their letter that was sent to state insurance commissioners earlier  today.  So, we've known that for most of the day, but what they are  counting on is that the Web site will be working, people will see better  options than the extension of these policies, and will be fine with moving  over to the new system.  That's why I said they are trying to buy time and  get over this rough period that they are in right now. </p><p>GRIFFETH:  John Harwood in Washington.  Thanks for the political angle  of that. </p><p>Let's talk about logistics, though.  Many insurance companies said  today they are worried about the president's fixes, saying that it could  destabilize the insurance market and result in higher premiums for  consumers. </p><p>Let's turn to Bertha Coombs, who's been following this story all  along.</p><p>What do these fixes mean for the insurance industry? </p><p>BERTHA COOMBS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Well, because  it's voluntary, it's something that they need to now take a look at.  And  essentially, the insurers turned a page on these plans.  So, they haven't  priced what they would be for 2014.  So, effectively, they now have a 30- day window that they would have to try to do this because people who want  those plans that are expiring on December 31st, to be able to renew them  for January 1st, they have to put their premiums in and pay them by the  15th of December. </p><p>So, here are the things they would need to do in the next 30 days,  they would need to figure out what the price is on those plans.  Calculate  all that for 2014.  They would need to get approval from state insurance  and the state insurance commissioners.  Washington state weighing this  afternoon saying they don't want to do this, and then they need to be able  to get the plans out to their customers and collect their premiums, all in  the next 30 days. </p><p>GHARIB:  So, it sounds like you're say thing is not feasible to do in  30 days.  Will the insurance companies now fight back on this, or are they  going to have to do what the White House wants them to do?</p><p>COOMBS:  Well, essentially, what's happened here is kind of like when  you play your mom off your dad.  Your dad kind of says, hey, it's not up to  me, ask your mother, she'll make the decision.  The president has now  shifted the decision to the insurers and the state insurance commissioners. </p><p>Aetna (NYSE:AET) essentially says we can try to do this but we would  have to get expedited reviews from all of these state commissioners in  order to do that and it is a logistical hurdle for them to do that over the  next 30 days.</p><p>Cigna says they are already working with a lot of their clients to try  to figure out a way to extend these plans.  So, they may be partly along  the way.  Some of these insurers have actually offered early renewals.  One  man who I talked whose plan was canceled, he had an early renewal that, in  order to sort of skirt the ACA rules, went until December 1st, so that can  probably be extended until the end of next year. </p><p>GRIFFETH:  There is a bit of a catch-22, though, because the president  said he hoped that those who had policies canceled would find a better  policy under ACA.  But if the Web site is not working, it's tough to do  that kind of comparison shopping. </p><p>COOMBS:  Well, and it's also tough for the insurers because these are  people who already are good about paying their premiums.  They already  understand insurance and they're already committed to buying insurance.   And if they're not buying on the exchange, that really throws into question  the viability of that marketplace. </p><p>GHARIB:  Real quickly, in just a word or two, what does this mean for  premiums if you have your old policy and you want to reinstall it, or new  policies?  Are they going up, prices? </p><p>COOMBS:  I would imagine.  I mean, the insurers have to figure out  what the price is.  They've already seen some prices trends in terms of  medical cost going up.  So, they would need to raise the plan rates. </p><p>GHARIB:  OK.  We'll get back to you on that. </p><p>GRIFFETH:  Thanks, Bertha. </p><p>GHARIB:  Thanks so much, Bertha.</p><p>Well, despite all the changes to the new health law, health care  stocks had a strong day, but the big talk on Wall Street was about Cisco  (NASDAQ:CSCO) and Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT).  Investors dumped Cisco  (NASDAQ:CSCO) shares, reacting to that bad earnings report we told you  about last night and that shaved 15 points off the Dow.</p><p>And Wal-Mart's earnings did little to inspire investors and that Dow  stock rose just a bit and we're going to have more analysis on both Wal- Mart (NYSE:WMT) and Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) in just a moment. </p><p>Still, though, the disappointments did not stop the market rally, and  new highs for the record books.  The Dow added 54 points to a fresh record.   The NASDAQ gained seven.  And the S&amp;P up 8 1/2 points.  It also moved to a  new high.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  All right.  Let's talk about shares of Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO)  Systems.  They were the biggest drag for the Dow today, also for the S&amp;P  and for the NASDAQ composite, with the stock tumbling 11 percent after  forecasting the continued decline in sales for the rest of the year. </p><p>Jon Fortt has more on what's driving Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) shares lower. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JON FORTT, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  After  Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) reported a bad quarter last night and a dismal outlook,  the stock had its worst day in almost three years. </p><p>(on camera):  The culprit: emerging markets, countries like India,  Brazil and Malaysia, that just a few months ago were bastions of growth are  turning into a nightmare for big tech companies.</p><p>JOHN CHAMBERS, CISCO SYSTEM CEO:  It isn't just high tech.  It's the  consumer companies of our customers, the people who sell in Brazil or sell  in India, or manufacture who sells in those areas, what you're seeing is  the GDP slowed.  And as they slowed, and you and others have talked about  it for almost six months, then confidence began to drop.  And if they're  looking for the U.S. to lead them out of this scenario, clearly, the last  month or two has not instilled a lot of confidence. </p><p>FORTT (voice-over):  At Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO), sales from the top five  emerging market countries fell 21 percent, and that's on top of a rough  sales environment in China that got worse because the NSA spying scandal  has buyers favoring local Chinese suppliers. </p><p>All of that led Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) to forecast sales this quarter  will be far lower than a year ago.  Analysts have been hoping they'd be up.  </p><p>And it's not just Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO).  IBM cited major trouble in  emerging markets during its quarterly report last month and Oracle  (NASDAQ:ORCL) has struggled in Asia, too.  A small networking player, fast- growing F5, says it's a regional issue. </p><p>JOHN MCADAM, F5 NETWORKS CEO:  Asia has been reasonably tough for us.   South Asia, Vietnam, Australia, China was particularly tough last quarter  and we told (ph) that in our conference call.</p><p>FORTT:  Things aren't likely to get better soon analysts fear.  What  Wall Street would like is a road map for how Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) will steer  through this.</p><p>MARK SUE, RBC CAPITAL MARKETS MANAGING DIRECTOR:  We do think it's a  several quarter issue.  We think China I think could be longer than that. </p><p>The next thing to look for is Cisco's analyst day, which comes up in  three weeks, and they really have to have some crisp responses in what  they're going to do. </p><p>FORTT (on camera):  One thing they're probably going to do is keep CEO  John Chambers around a little bit longer than some expect it.  Chambers  tells that he plans to retire sometime in 2016.  The board has asked him to  stick around and guide the company through this very rough patch. </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Jon Fortt.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GHARIB:  Well, it looks like Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) is also going through  a rough patch.  It posted quarterly earnings that were a penny better than  estimates for the third quarter but revenues were lower, and its outlook  for sales for the all-important holiday shopping period don't look to get  much better. </p><p>Courtney Reagan has the story. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>COURTNEY REAGAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):   The magic of Macy's appears to have been contained to just that retailer.   The confident telling (ph) Macy's executive expressed going into the all- important holiday quarter was absent in Wal-Mart's executive commentary in  its earnings report.  The world's largest retailer did exceed expectations  for earnings by one penny per share but sales fell short and the company's  forecast isn't inspiring much confidence either.</p><p>DANA TELSEY, TELSEY ADVISORY GROUP CEO:  I think it's a very cautious  tone.  You go into a holiday season where six fewer days, the sense of  urgency is greater and level of promotions feel like it's going to be  higher than ever.  </p><p>REAGAN:  Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) U.S. CEO Bill Simon says unemployment and  job stability tops the list of consumer concerns and says that while gas  prices have fallen, it's still a big piece of the budget for shoppers. </p><p>(on camera):  So, is Wal-Mart's sale's weakness due to poor execution  by the company or results of the still pressured shopper?  Likely, it's a  combination of both. </p><p>TELSEY:  There is limited amount of dollars to go around.  They now  are competing as a consumables business in a bigger way, and that's  definitely a more competitive space.  So, it's the customer and the  environment. </p><p>REAGAN (voice-over):   However, Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) says the company  is encouraged by the momentum coming out of the third quarter, nothing same  store sales and traffic improved throughout the quarter.  The key now is  making sure the trend continues. </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Courtney Reagan. </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  And there was more discouraging results at another big  discounter, this time, it's Kohl's (NYSE:KSS).  Their profits declined by  18 percent last quarter, with fewer customers shopping at their stores.   Shares of Khol's dropped sharply today, down 8 percent with the chain  cutting its full year earning's forecast as it predicts a pretty tough  holiday shopping season.</p><p>GHARIB:  And still ahead on the program, Janet Yellen, widely expected  to be confirmed as the next Fed chair, breezed through questions from  senators on Capitol Hill today.  Did her testimony send a message to the  stock market and investors? </p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Janet Yellen did take the first step in the confirmation  process to become the next chair of the Federal Reserve.  Current vice  chair of the central bank sounded positively dovish about the Fed's easy  money stimulus plans.  She said the U.S. economy still needs the Fed's help  and that helped stocks today, but will it win over the support of  lawmakers?  That's the question.</p><p>Hampton Pearson has more tonight.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HAMPTON PEARSON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):   At a Senate Banking Committee on her nomination to become the first woman  Fed president --  </p><p>JANET YELLIN, FEDERAL RESERVE CHAIR NOMINEE.  I do. </p><p>PEARSON:  -- Janet Yellen strongly defended the central bank's  economic stimulus policy but gave no hint of when tapering might begin. </p><p>YELLEN:  While there is no set time, we will decide to reduce the pace  of our purchases at each meeting, we are attempting to assess whether or  not the outlook is meeting the criterion that we have set out to begin the  pace of purchases. </p><p>PEARSON:  As Fed vice chairman, Yellen has been a key ally of Bernanke  in holding key short term interest rates near zero since late 2008 and  quadrupling the Fed's balance sheet to some $3.8 trillion done with massive  monthly bond purchases. </p><p>The housing recovery and strong auto sales she says are prime examples  of how the stimulus benefitted both Main Street and Wall Street. </p><p>YELLEN:  We have seen interest rates fall very substantially.  Lower  interest rates, lower mortgage rates, particularly I think have been  instrumental in -- it's not the only factor, but it has been the positive  factor. </p><p>PEARSON:  When asked about Fed regulation in the future of banks  judged too big to fail, Yellen said, as chairman, one of her highest  priorities would be to reduce any advantages enjoyed by the nation's  largest banks.</p><p>YELLEN:  We have made progress in promoting a strong and stable  financial system but here, too, important work lies ahead.  I'm committed  to using the Fed's supervisory and regulatory role to reduce the threat of  another financial crisis. </p><p>PEARSON (on camera):  A senior aid tells me, Yellen's strong  performance today is paving the way for a full vote by the Senate Banking  Committee early next week.  The timetable for a full Senate confirmation is  still up in the air.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Hampton Pearson on Capitol Hill. </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GHARIB:  So, what did investors learn about what a Janet Yellen Fed  could mean for the stock market? </p><p>Joining us to talk about that, Jeff Kleintop, chief market strategist  at LPL Financial. </p><p>So, Jeff, what was the takeaway for investors here?  It was very  civilized hearing.  There was no fireworks.  She gave assurances that the  Fed is going to keep on stimulating the economy.</p><p>Is this a buy signal for the markets? </p><p>JEFF KLEINTOP, LPL FINANCIAL CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST:  Well, it's  certainly good news in the sense that she communicated that the Fed is  going to remain friendly to the markets, meaning continuing this insurance  policy the Fed has put in place through the bond-buying program at the same  time she acknowledged better growth in the private sector.  She said the  best of both worlds, the Fed remaining in the background is ensure against  anything going wrong and continuing that stimulus, but at the same time  better economic momentum.  It sounds like a recipe for continued gains in  the stock market. </p><p>GRIFFETH:  What about the bond market?  Yields fell today.  In fact,  they fell last night when they first released her testimony to the Senate  Banking Committee, and rates have been rising recently, expecting a  tapering by the Fed sooner rather than later. </p><p>Do you see yields going even further lower? </p><p>KLEINTOP:  You know, I think yields are in a range right now.  I don't  think anything Janet said today is going to break them out of that.   Clearly, we were coming up on this December Fed meeting about a month from  now, a little more than a month from now, where, you know, they will be  deciding whether they're going to taper.  I don't think they'll have enough  information to do that. </p><p>I think that's what we heard from Janet today, very much walking the  same line Ben has said, which is stayed independent and we're not sure yet.   The bond market interestingly has not really -- we haven't seen a  dramatically steeper yield curve on the idea that Janet would be much  easier in terms of monetary policy risking longer term inflation in the  bond market.  Instead, we see more continuation of Ben's policies. </p><p>GHARIB:  But, you know, Jeff, at some point, this reducing the  stimulus is going to happen, whether it's in March or later than that, it's  going to happen and a lot of experts have said it's going to be tricky.   And today, Alan Greenspan was quoted as saying for Yellen, she faces very  daunting problems.</p><p>So, what could that mean for the markets?  What could that mean for  the economy in terms of something going wrong?  It's going to be tough,  right? </p><p>KLEINTOP:  Absolutely.  Communication is going to key.  And now that  we know who the Fed chairman is going to be through the bulk of 2014, it  lends more credibility to the Fed's message on what they're going to do on  QE.  And that should ease the transition.</p><p>Listen, you're right, there is no surprise that this is coming -- a  slowing down of these bond purchases and as long as it's accompanied by  better growth, it should be good news for the stock market. </p><p>But we only have to look back to the end of QE1 and QE2 to remember  the knee-jerk reactions in the stock market, decline between 15 percent and  20 percent that accompanied those.  Now, there were other background  factors involved.  But that's the knee-jerk reaction and we have to keep  that in the back of our minds here, even though we're much more braced and  in a better position economically for this transition. </p><p>GRIFFETH:  Very quickly --  </p><p>KLEINTOP:  So, expect some volatility, but ultimately, some gains for  the year.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  I'm going to try to pin you down a little more than that.   I mean, we're sitting here at all time highs for the Dow and the S&amp;P.  Do  you see us continuing higher even as the Fed continues to talk about no  tapering right now?</p><p>KLEINTOP:  Yes, I do.  We believe here at LPL and the research  department that we're going to see substantial gains, maybe double digit  gains next year.  But, Bill, it comes with a lot more volatility than we  saw this year.</p><p>Peak-to-trough decline this year, 5.7 percent, almost nothing.  Expect  double or triple that next year in terms of the peak-to-trough decline.   Those are great opportunities for individual investors who have yet to  invest the stock market. </p><p>GHARIB:  Well, that's a bullish forecast. </p><p>Thanks a lot, Jeff, for coming on the program.  Jeff Kleintop --  </p><p>KLEINTOP:  My pleasure.</p><p>GHARIB:  -- chief market strategist at LPL Financial -- thanks again.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Meantime, Nordstrom's profit slipped in the third quarter,  and that's where we begin tonight's \"Market Focus\".  The high end  retailer's net income was down from last year because the company held its  anniversary sale event earlier this year and overhead expenses increased.   The chain still topped estimates. </p><p>The stock initially fell on the results which came after the bell.   Shares ended the day slightly higher at $63.43. </p><p>Meantime, Viacom (NYSE:VIA) saw a fourth quarter profit jump by 24  percent, driven by strong growth in the advertising, and increased home  entertainment revenue.  They media giant beat on both the top and the  bottom lines, but the company said it expects ad revenue to decelerate this  quarter.  The weak outlook worried investors, certainly, shares fell almost  3 percent, closed at $80.75.</p><p>And the world's biggest burger chain is getting even better.   McDonald's announced today that it plans to spend about $3 billion next  year to open more than 1,500 new restaurants and remodeled 1,000 others.   The plan is roughly in line with the company's spending forecast for the  year.  Micky D's finished a fraction lower, though, at $97.56.</p><p>GHARIB:  RE/MAX posted its first quarterly report since going public  in October.  And it wasn't the kind of report that investors expected -- a  38 percent drop in earnings.  The real estate brokerage chain blamed higher  interest expenses and IPO related costs for the profit missed.  Shares  tumbled almost 2 percent to $27.75.</p><p>Under Armour (NYSE:UA) is entering the tech world with its first ever  acquisition.  The sports apparel maker will pay $150 million to buy Map My  Fitness.  This is a fitness application company.  The purchase is an effort  to get in on the wearable technology game.  As for the shares, Under Armour  (NYSE:UA) rose 1 percent to $83.53.</p><p>And Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A) takes a big stake  in ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM).  According to a piling with regulators, Buffett  bought more than 40 million shares of the world's largest publicly traded  oil company.  Investors brought up ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) shares on the  news.  Exxon finished the regular session up fractionally to $93.22. </p><p>GRIFFETH:  Certainly, Washington budget cuts are having an impact on  at least one big defense contractor.  That would be Lockheed Martin  (NYSE:LMT).  They announced plans to cut 4,000 jobs over the next two  years, placing the blames squarely on a sharp drop in spending at the  Pentagon.  About half those losses will come from attrition, the other half  by closing Lockheed facilities in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Texas, Arizona and in  California.</p><p>GHARIB:  Still ahead on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT: as many families  begin their year-end tax planning, there are some strategies that could  help you lower your tax bill.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Maybe hard to believe, but there are only six weeks left  until the end of the year.  So this may be a good time to start preparing  for your 2013 taxes, just remember who reminded you of this -- especially  with new changes to the tax code that could mean you're going to be paying  more to Uncle Sam this next year.</p><p>So, what can you do now in the meantime? </p><p>Sharon Epperson has some answers tonight.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SHARON EPPERSON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):   Most people don't think about taxes in November, after all, tax returns  aren't due until next April. </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I'm not even there yet.  I'm usually not a last  minute person, so it might be mid-March, and then I start to get my stuff  together.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I usually do my taxes in February.  So we're --  I'm more into the holidays right now, if anything, you know, like  Thanksgiving around the corner. </p><p>EPPERSON:  But if you've had big changes in work or at home in the  past 12 months, some tax moves that's made before the end of the year could  result in big tax savings. </p><p>Real estate executive Linda Aronson meets regularly with her financial  advisor to review tax-saving options, and make changes by December 31st  that will allow her to make the most of her income. </p><p>LINDA ARONSON, TAXPAYER:  The biggest change that I made this year was  making sure that I was taking full advantage of every pretax opportunity  that my firm offered, and trying to lower my taxes in that way. </p><p>EPPERSON:  Financial advisor Rich Coppa suggests increasing pretax  contributions to a 401(k) or another retire plan which lowers taxable  income dollar for dollar. </p><p>RICHARD COPPA, WEALTH HEALTH MANAGING DIRECTOR:  If your company is  offering it, absolutely try to maximize your 401(k).  This is an  opportunity for you to reduce your taxes and have money growing for you for  your retirement. </p><p>EPPERSON (on camera):  It's important to get a handle on your tax  situation now, because what you may owe or the refund you may get back from  the IRS could be very different this year, particularly for high-income  taxpayers. </p><p>(voice-over):  Individuals with incomes over $400,000 and couples over  $450,000 have been moved up to a 39.6 percent federal income tax bracket,  up from 35 percent last year.  And they have to pay the maximum 20 percent  tax rate on long-term capital gains and qualifying dividends, up from 15  percent in 2012. </p><p>To cut down the tax bill, Coppa suggests deferring income and  reviewing investments before the end of the year. </p><p>COPPA:  We always look at any tax loss harvesting, which means that  you would sell a position that would reduce -- you know, fell in value,  take that loss to offset capital gain. </p><p>EPPERSON:  With Coppa's guidance, Aronson says she's following some of  these strategies -- </p><p>ARONSON:  I do think that as I've been making these changes, I will  see a lesser tax bill.</p><p>EPPERSON:  -- giving her some peace of mind. </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Sharon Epperson. </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GHARIB:  And finally tonight, the cost of Thanksgiving dinner will be  a little lower this year.  The American Farm Bureau Federation says a  classic turkey dinner will average $49.04 to feed 10 people.  That's down  44 cents from 2012 and still averages less than $5 a serving.  The big  driver for the decline: turkey prices. </p><p>I love Thanksgiving. </p><p>GRIFFETH:  I do, too.  And we don't like cranberry sauce in my  household, so it's even cheaper --  </p><p>GHARIB:  Lucky you, Bill.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Yes.</p><p>GHARIB:  But keep the pumpkin pie. </p><p>GRIFFETH:  Absolutely.</p><p>GHARIB:  That's NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for tonight.  I'm Susie  Gharib.  Thanks so much for watching. </p><p>GRIFFETH:  I'm Bill Griffeth.  Have a great evening.  We'll see you  tomorrow.</p><p>END</p><p>Nightly Business Report transcripts and video are available on-line post  broadcast at <url normalizedValue=\"http://nbr.com\">http://nbr.com</url>.

And let's be clear: the only way to fully protect the American people is to scrap this law once and for all.</p><p/><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>GHARIB: John Harwood joins us now from Washington with more on this.</p><p/><p>You know, John, a lot of people wondering and questioning today, can <person><nameText>President Obama </nameText></person>make these rule changes? I mean, after all, the Affordable Care Act is the law. Does Congress at some point have to vote on this?</p><p/><p>I mean, talk us through how the process will work.</p><p/><p>JOHN HARWOOD, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Well, first of all, Susie, I think the thing to remember about this is this is mostly about the president trying to provide political cover for Democrats and for himself to buy time until the exchanges are going to work, the Web site will be fixed.</p><p/><p>He's not compelling any changes, and he's not giving a huge new grant of authority to states. What he's doing is saying that if state insurance commissioners and insurance companies want to extend policies further, they can, but the reality is that most of them don't want to because they want to move into the new world of insurance under the Affordable Care Act. So, it is not clear how much this will change.</p><p/><p>It may extend some policies and at the very latest unless there's an additional decision taken, some of those policies could go to the end of September 2015, but it is not likely so far as I can tell that this is going to make a whole sale change. What the president was trying to resist gutting of Obamacare and this is a minimum fix that he's trying to offer.</p><p/><p>GRIFFETH: Yes, as you mentioned, John, this is providing political cover for those Senate -- Democrats on the House who face reelection next year, but the fact the White House acknowledges that this fix could extend beyond 2014, beyond that election year, that sounds ominous at this point for trying to fix this whole thing.</p><p/><p>HARWOOD: It could, but I think that probably amounts to less than meets the eye, Bill, and the reason is that administration, they said that in their letter that was sent to state insurance commissioners earlier today. So, we've known that for most of the day, but what they are counting on is that the Web site will be working, people will see better options than the extension of these policies, and will be fine with moving over to the new system. That's why I said they are trying to buy time and get over this rough period that they are in right now.</p><p/><p>GRIFFETH: John Harwood in Washington. Thanks for the political angle of that.</p><p/><p>Let's talk about logistics, though. Many insurance companies said today they are worried about the president's fixes, saying that it could destabilize the insurance market and result in higher premiums for consumers.</p><p/><p>Let's turn to Bertha Coombs, who's been following this story all along.</p><p/><p>What do these fixes mean for the insurance industry?</p><p/><p>BERTHA COOMBS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Well, because it's voluntary, it's something that they need to now take a look at. And essentially, the insurers turned a page on these plans. So, they haven't priced what they would be for 2014. So, effectively, they now have a 30- day window that they would have to try to do this because people who want those plans that are expiring on December 31st, to be able to renew them for January 1st, they have to put their premiums in and pay them by the 15th of December.</p><p/><p>So, here are the things they would need to do in the next 30 days, they would need to figure out what the price is on those plans. Calculate all that for 2014. They would need to get approval from state insurance and the state insurance commissioners. Washington state weighing this afternoon saying they don't want to do this, and then they need to be able to get the plans out to their customers and collect their premiums, all in the next 30 days.</p><p/><p>GHARIB: So, it sounds like you're say thing is not feasible to do in 30 days. Will the insurance companies now fight back on this, or are they going to have to do what the White House wants them to do?</p><p/><p>COOMBS: Well, essentially, what's happened here is kind of like when you play your mom off your dad. Your dad kind of says, hey, it's not up to me, ask your mother, she'll make the decision. The president has now shifted the decision to the insurers and the state insurance commissioners.</p><p/><p>Aetna (NYSE:AET) essentially says we can try to do this but we would have to get expedited reviews from all of these state commissioners in order to do that and it is a logistical hurdle for them to do that over the next 30 days.</p><p/><p>Cigna says they are already working with a lot of their clients to try to figure out a way to extend these plans. So, they may be partly along the way. Some of these insurers have actually offered early renewals. One man who I talked whose plan was canceled, he had an early renewal that, in order to sort of skirt the ACA rules, went until December 1st, so that can probably be extended until the end of next year.</p><p/><p>GRIFFETH: There is a bit of a catch-22, though, because the president said he hoped that those who had policies canceled would find a better policy under ACA. But if the Web site is not working, it's tough to do that kind of comparison shopping.</p><p/><p>COOMBS: Well, and it's also tough for the insurers because these are people who already are good about paying their premiums. They already understand insurance and they're already committed to buying insurance. And if they're not buying on the exchange, that really throws into question the viability of that marketplace.</p><p/><p>GHARIB: Real quickly, in just a word or two, what does this mean for premiums if you have your old policy and you want to reinstall it, or new policies? Are they going up, prices?</p><p/><p>COOMBS: I would imagine. I mean, the insurers have to figure out what the price is. They've already seen some prices trends in terms of medical cost going up. So, they would need to raise the plan rates.</p><p/><p>GHARIB: OK. We'll get back to you on that.</p><p/><p>GRIFFETH: Thanks, Bertha.</p><p/><p>GHARIB: Thanks so much, Bertha.</p><p/><p>Well, despite all the changes to the new health law, health care stocks had a strong day, but the big talk on Wall Street was about Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) and Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT). Investors dumped Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) shares, reacting to that bad earnings report we told you about last night and that shaved 15 points off the Dow.</p><p/><p>And Wal-Mart's earnings did little to inspire investors and that Dow stock rose just a bit and we're going to have more analysis on both Wal- Mart (NYSE:WMT) and Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) in just a moment.</p><p/><p>Still, though, the disappointments did not stop the market rally, and new highs for the record books. The Dow added 54 points to a fresh record. The NASDAQ gained seven. And the S&amp;P up 8 1/2 points. It also moved to a new high.</p><p/><p>GRIFFETH: All right. Let's talk about shares of Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) Systems. They were the biggest drag for the Dow today, also for the S&amp;P and for the NASDAQ composite, with the stock tumbling 11 percent after forecasting the continued decline in sales for the rest of the year.</p><p/><p>Jon Fortt has more on what's driving Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) shares lower.</p><p/><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p/><p>JON FORTT, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): After Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) reported a bad quarter last night and a dismal outlook, the stock had its worst day in almost three years.</p><p/><p>(on camera): The culprit: emerging markets, countries like India, Brazil and Malaysia, that just a few months ago were bastions of growth are turning into a nightmare for big tech companies.</p><p/><p>JOHN CHAMBERS, CISCO SYSTEM CEO: It isn't just high tech. It's the consumer companies of our customers, the people who sell in Brazil or sell in India, or manufacture who sells in those areas, what you're seeing is the GDP slowed. And as they slowed, and you and others have talked about it for almost six months, then confidence began to drop. And if they're looking for the U.S. to lead them out of this scenario, clearly, the last month or two has not instilled a lot of confidence.</p><p/><p>FORTT (voice-over): At Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO), sales from the top five emerging market countries fell 21 percent, and that's on top of a rough sales environment in China that got worse because the NSA spying scandal has buyers favoring local Chinese suppliers.</p><p/><p>All of that led Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) to forecast sales this quarter will be far lower than a year ago. Analysts have been hoping they'd be up.</p><p/><p>And it's not just Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO). IBM cited major trouble in emerging markets during its quarterly report last month and Oracle (NASDAQ:ORCL) has struggled in Asia, too. A small networking player, fast- growing F5, says it's a regional issue.</p><p/><p>JOHN MCADAM, F5 NETWORKS CEO: Asia has been reasonably tough for us. South Asia, Vietnam, Australia, China was particularly tough last quarter and we told (ph) that in our conference call.</p><p/><p>FORTT: Things aren't likely to get better soon analysts fear. What Wall Street would like is a road map for how Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) will steer through this.</p><p/><p>MARK SUE, RBC CAPITAL MARKETS MANAGING DIRECTOR: We do think it's a several quarter issue. We think China I think could be longer than that.</p><p/><p>The next thing to look for is Cisco's analyst day, which comes up in three weeks, and they really have to have some crisp responses in what they're going to do.</p><p/><p>FORTT (on camera): One thing they're probably going to do is keep CEO John Chambers around a little bit longer than some expect it. Chambers tells that he plans to retire sometime in 2016. The board has asked him to stick around and guide the company through this very rough patch.</p><p/><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Jon Fortt.</p><p/><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p/><p>GHARIB: Well, it looks like Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) is also going through a rough patch. It posted quarterly earnings that were a penny better than estimates for the third quarter but revenues were lower, and its outlook for sales for the all-important holiday shopping period don't look to get much better.</p><p/><p>Courtney Reagan has the story.</p><p/><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p/><p>COURTNEY REAGAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The magic of Macy's appears to have been contained to just that retailer. The confident telling (ph) Macy's executive expressed going into the all- important holiday quarter was absent in Wal-Mart's executive commentary in its earnings report. The world's largest retailer did exceed expectations for earnings by one penny per share but sales fell short and the company's forecast isn't inspiring much confidence either.</p><p/><p>DANA TELSEY, TELSEY ADVISORY GROUP CEO: I think it's a very cautious tone. You go into a holiday season where six fewer days, the sense of urgency is greater and level of promotions feel like it's going to be higher than ever.</p><p/><p>REAGAN: Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) U.S. CEO Bill Simon says unemployment and job stability tops the list of consumer concerns and says that while gas prices have fallen, it's still a big piece of the budget for shoppers.</p><p/><p>(on camera): So, is Wal-Mart's sale's weakness due to poor execution by the company or results of the still pressured shopper? Likely, it's a combination of both.</p><p/><p>TELSEY: There is limited amount of dollars to go around. They now are competing as a consumables business in a bigger way, and that's definitely a more competitive space. So, it's the customer and the environment.</p><p/><p>REAGAN (voice-over): However, Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) says the company is encouraged by the momentum coming out of the third quarter, nothing same store sales and traffic improved throughout the quarter. The key now is making sure the trend continues.</p><p/><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Courtney Reagan.</p><p/><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p/><p>GRIFFETH: And there was more discouraging results at another big discounter, this time, it's Kohl's (NYSE:KSS). Their profits declined by 18 percent last quarter, with fewer customers shopping at their stores. Shares of Khol's dropped sharply today, down 8 percent with the chain cutting its full year earning's forecast as it predicts a pretty tough holiday shopping season.</p><p/><p>GHARIB: And still ahead on the program, Janet Yellen, widely expected to be confirmed as the next Fed chair, breezed through questions from senators on Capitol Hill today. Did her testimony send a message to the stock market and investors?</p><p/><p>(MUSIC)</p><p/><p>GRIFFETH: Janet Yellen did take the first step in the confirmation process to become the next chair of the Federal Reserve. Current vice chair of the central bank sounded positively dovish about the Fed's easy money stimulus plans. She said the U.S. economy still needs the Fed's help and that helped stocks today, but will it win over the support of lawmakers? That's the question.</p><p/><p>Hampton Pearson has more tonight.</p><p/><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p/><p>HAMPTON PEARSON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): At a Senate Banking Committee on her nomination to become the first woman Fed president --</p><p/><p>JANET YELLIN, FEDERAL RESERVE CHAIR NOMINEE. I do.</p><p/><p>PEARSON: -- Janet Yellen strongly defended the central bank's economic stimulus policy but gave no hint of when tapering might begin.</p><p/><p>YELLEN: While there is no set time, we will decide to reduce the pace of our purchases at each meeting, we are attempting to assess whether or not the outlook is meeting the criterion that we have set out to begin the pace of purchases.</p><p/><p>PEARSON: As Fed vice chairman, Yellen has been a key ally of Bernanke in holding key short term interest rates near zero since late 2008 and quadrupling the Fed's balance sheet to some $3.8 trillion done with massive monthly bond purchases.</p><p/><p>The housing recovery and strong auto sales she says are prime examples of how the stimulus benefitted both Main Street and Wall Street.</p><p/><p>YELLEN: We have seen interest rates fall very substantially. Lower interest rates, lower mortgage rates, particularly I think have been instrumental in -- it's not the only factor, but it has been the positive factor.</p><p/><p>PEARSON: When asked about Fed regulation in the future of banks judged too big to fail, Yellen said, as chairman, one of her highest priorities would be to reduce any advantages enjoyed by the nation's largest banks.</p><p/><p>YELLEN: We have made progress in promoting a strong and stable financial system but here, too, important work lies ahead. I'm committed to using the Fed's supervisory and regulatory role to reduce the threat of another financial crisis.</p><p/><p>PEARSON (on camera): A senior aid tells me, Yellen's strong performance today is paving the way for a full vote by the Senate Banking Committee early next week. The timetable for a full Senate confirmation is still up in the air.</p><p/><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Hampton Pearson on Capitol Hill.</p><p/><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p/><p>GHARIB: So, what did investors learn about what a Janet Yellen Fed could mean for the stock market?</p><p/><p>Joining us to talk about that, Jeff Kleintop, chief market strategist at LPL Financial.</p><p/><p>So, Jeff, what was the takeaway for investors here? It was very civilized hearing. There was no fireworks. She gave assurances that the Fed is going to keep on stimulating the economy.</p><p/><p>Is this a buy signal for the markets?</p><p/><p>JEFF KLEINTOP, LPL FINANCIAL CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST: Well, it's certainly good news in the sense that she communicated that the Fed is going to remain friendly to the markets, meaning continuing this insurance policy the Fed has put in place through the bond-buying program at the same time she acknowledged better growth in the private sector. She said the best of both worlds, the Fed remaining in the background is ensure against anything going wrong and continuing that stimulus, but at the same time better economic momentum. It sounds like a recipe for continued gains in the stock market.</p><p/><p>GRIFFETH: What about the bond market? Yields fell today. In fact, they fell last night when they first released her testimony to the Senate Banking Committee, and rates have been rising recently, expecting a tapering by the Fed sooner rather than later.</p><p/><p>Do you see yields going even further lower?</p><p/><p>KLEINTOP: You know, I think yields are in a range right now. I don't think anything Janet said today is going to break them out of that. Clearly, we were coming up on this December Fed meeting about a month from now, a little more than a month from now, where, you know, they will be deciding whether they're going to taper. I don't think they'll have enough information to do that.</p><p/><p>I think that's what we heard from Janet today, very much walking the same line Ben has said, which is stayed independent and we're not sure yet. The bond market interestingly has not really -- we haven't seen a dramatically steeper yield curve on the idea that Janet would be much easier in terms of monetary policy risking longer term inflation in the bond market. Instead, we see more continuation of Ben's policies.</p><p/><p>GHARIB: But, you know, Jeff, at some point, this reducing the stimulus is going to happen, whether it's in March or later than that, it's going to happen and a lot of experts have said it's going to be tricky. And today, Alan Greenspan was quoted as saying for Yellen, she faces very daunting problems.</p><p/><p>So, what could that mean for the markets? What could that mean for the economy in terms of something going wrong? It's going to be tough, right?</p><p/><p>KLEINTOP: Absolutely. Communication is going to key. And now that we know who the Fed chairman is going to be through the bulk of 2014, it lends more credibility to the Fed's message on what they're going to do on QE. And that should ease the transition.</p><p/><p>Listen, you're right, there is no surprise that this is coming -- a slowing down of these bond purchases and as long as it's accompanied by better growth, it should be good news for the stock market.</p><p/><p>But we only have to look back to the end of QE1 and QE2 to remember the knee-jerk reactions in the stock market, decline between 15 percent and 20 percent that accompanied those. Now, there were other background factors involved. But that's the knee-jerk reaction and we have to keep that in the back of our minds here, even though we're much more braced and in a better position economically for this transition.</p><p/><p>GRIFFETH: Very quickly --</p><p/><p>KLEINTOP: So, expect some volatility, but ultimately, some gains for the year.</p><p/><p>GRIFFETH: I'm going to try to pin you down a little more than that. I mean, we're sitting here at all time highs for the Dow and the S&amp;P. Do you see us continuing higher even as the Fed continues to talk about no tapering right now?</p><p/><p>KLEINTOP: Yes, I do. We believe here at LPL and the research department that we're going to see substantial gains, maybe double digit gains next year. But, Bill, it comes with a lot more volatility than we saw this year.</p><p/><p>Peak-to-trough decline this year, 5.7 percent, almost nothing. Expect double or triple that next year in terms of the peak-to-trough decline. Those are great opportunities for individual investors who have yet to invest the stock market.</p><p/><p>GHARIB: Well, that's a bullish forecast.</p><p/><p>Thanks a lot, Jeff, for coming on the program. Jeff Kleintop --</p><p/><p>KLEINTOP: My pleasure.</p><p/><p>GHARIB: -- chief market strategist at LPL Financial -- thanks again.</p><p/><p>GRIFFETH: Meantime, Nordstrom's profit slipped in the third quarter, and that's where we begin tonight's \"Market Focus\". The high end retailer's net income was down from last year because the company held its anniversary sale event earlier this year and overhead expenses increased. The chain still topped estimates.</p><p/><p>The stock initially fell on the results which came after the bell. Shares ended the day slightly higher at $63.43.</p><p/><p>Meantime, Viacom (NYSE:VIA) saw a fourth quarter profit jump by 24 percent, driven by strong growth in the advertising, and increased home entertainment revenue. They media giant beat on both the top and the bottom lines, but the company said it expects ad revenue to decelerate this quarter. The weak outlook worried investors, certainly, shares fell almost 3 percent, closed at $80.75.</p><p/><p>And the world's biggest burger chain is getting even better. McDonald's announced today that it plans to spend about $3 billion next year to open more than 1,500 new restaurants and remodeled 1,000 others. The plan is roughly in line with the company's spending forecast for the year. Micky D's finished a fraction lower, though, at $97.56.</p><p/><p>GHARIB: RE/MAX posted its first quarterly report since going public in October. And it wasn't the kind of report that investors expected -- a 38 percent drop in earnings. The real estate brokerage chain blamed higher interest expenses and IPO related costs for the profit missed. Shares tumbled almost 2 percent to $27.75.</p><p/><p>Under Armour (NYSE:UA) is entering the tech world with its first ever acquisition. The sports apparel maker will pay $150 million to buy Map My Fitness. This is a fitness application company. The purchase is an effort to get in on the wearable technology game. As for the shares, Under Armour (NYSE:UA) rose 1 percent to $83.53.</p><p/><p>And Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A) takes a big stake in ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM). According to a piling with regulators, Buffett bought more than 40 million shares of the world's largest publicly traded oil company. Investors brought up ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) shares on the news. Exxon finished the regular session up fractionally to $93.22.</p><p/><p>GRIFFETH: Certainly, Washington budget cuts are having an impact on at least one big defense contractor. That would be Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT). They announced plans to cut 4,000 jobs over the next two years, placing the blames squarely on a sharp drop in spending at the Pentagon. About half those losses will come from attrition, the other half by closing Lockheed facilities in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Texas, Arizona and in California.</p><p/><p>GHARIB: Still ahead on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT: as many families begin their year-end tax planning, there are some strategies that could help you lower your tax bill.</p><p/><p>(MUSIC)</p><p/><p>GRIFFETH: Maybe hard to believe, but there are only six weeks left until the end of the year. So this may be a good time to start preparing for your 2013 taxes, just remember who reminded you of this -- especially with new changes to the tax code that could mean you're going to be paying more to Uncle Sam this next year.</p><p/><p>So, what can you do now in the meantime?</p><p/><p>Sharon Epperson has some answers tonight.</p><p/><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p/><p>SHARON EPPERSON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Most people don't think about taxes in November, after all, tax returns aren't due until next April.</p><p/><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm not even there yet. I'm usually not a last minute person, so it might be mid-March, and then I start to get my stuff together.</p><p/><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I usually do my taxes in February. So we're -- I'm more into the holidays right now, if anything, you know, like Thanksgiving around the corner.</p><p/><p>EPPERSON: But if you've had big changes in work or at home in the past 12 months, some tax moves that's made before the end of the year could result in big tax savings.</p><p/><p>Real estate executive Linda Aronson meets regularly with her financial advisor to review tax-saving options, and make changes by December 31st that will allow her to make the most of her income.</p><p/><p>LINDA ARONSON, TAXPAYER: The biggest change that I made this year was making sure that I was taking full advantage of every pretax opportunity that my firm offered, and trying to lower my taxes in that way.</p><p/><p>EPPERSON: Financial advisor Rich Coppa suggests increasing pretax contributions to a 401(k) or another retire plan which lowers taxable income dollar for dollar.</p><p/><p>RICHARD COPPA, WEALTH HEALTH MANAGING DIRECTOR: If your company is offering it, absolutely try to maximize your 401(k). This is an opportunity for you to reduce your taxes and have money growing for you for your retirement.</p><p/><p>EPPERSON (on camera): It's important to get a handle on your tax situation now, because what you may owe or the refund you may get back from the IRS could be very different this year, particularly for high-income taxpayers.</p><p/><p>(voice-over): Individuals with incomes over $400,000 and couples over $450,000 have been moved up to a 39.6 percent federal income tax bracket, up from 35 percent last year. And they have to pay the maximum 20 percent tax rate on long-term capital gains and qualifying dividends, up from 15 percent in 2012.</p><p/><p>To cut down the tax bill, Coppa suggests deferring income and reviewing investments before the end of the year.</p><p/><p>COPPA: We always look at any tax loss harvesting, which means that you would sell a position that would reduce -- you know, fell in value, take that loss to offset capital gain.</p><p/><p>EPPERSON: With Coppa's guidance, Aronson says she's following some of these strategies --</p><p/><p>ARONSON: I do think that as I've been making these changes, I will see a lesser tax bill.</p><p/><p>EPPERSON: -- giving her some peace of mind.</p><p/><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Sharon Epperson.</p><p/><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p/><p>GHARIB: And finally tonight, the cost of Thanksgiving dinner will be a little lower this year. The American Farm Bureau Federation says a classic turkey dinner will average $49.04 to feed 10 people. That's down 44 cents from 2012 and still averages less than $5 a serving. The big driver for the decline: turkey prices.</p><p/><p>I love Thanksgiving.</p><p/><p>GRIFFETH: I do, too. And we don't like cranberry sauce in my household, so it's even cheaper --</p><p/><p>GHARIB: Lucky you, Bill.</p><p/><p>GRIFFETH: Yes.</p><p/><p>GHARIB: But keep the pumpkin pie.</p><p/><p>GRIFFETH: Absolutely.</p><p/><p>GHARIB: That's NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for tonight. I'm Susie Gharib. Thanks so much for watching.</p><p/><p>GRIFFETH: I'm Bill Griffeth. Have a great evening.

President Obama says Americans can keep their canceled insurance policies,  changing one of the key provisions in the new health law.  But is it easier  said than done?</p><p>  BILL GRIFFETH, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR:  Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO)  skid.  The stock tumbled, its worst dive in almost three years, after  warning a softening demand.  Does this tech bellwether help (ph) plan,  though, to turn things around? </p><p>  GHARIB:  And Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) woes.  The world's largest retailer  lowers its annual profit, offering a glimpse into how Americans feel about  their economic well-being. </p><p>  We have all that and more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for this  Thursday, November 14th. </p><p>  Good evening, everyone.  I'm Susie Gharib. </p><p>  GRIFFETH:  And I'm Bill Griffeth, in for Tyler tonight.</p><p>  President Obama again trying to fix the Affordable Care Act, bowing to  mounting political pressure.  The president said today he will now allow  insurers to extend their canceled health care policies for one year, maybe  even longer, even if the coverage falls short of the new federal minimum  standards.</p><p>  Now, speaking to reporters at the White House today, Mr. Obama  admitted his administration had botched the rollout of the new health care  law and he said he regretted that his assurances that Americans could keep  their health insurance plans if they liked it, that turned out to be wrong.</p><p>  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>  OBAMA:  I think it's legitimate for them to expect me to have to win  back some credibility on this health care law in particular and on a whole  range of these issues in general.  And, you know, that's on me.  I mean, we  fumbled the rollout on this health care law.</p><p>  (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>  GRIFFETH:  And House Speaker John Boehner did not mince words on his  prescription for the health care law.</p><p>  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>  REP. JOHN BOEHNER (R-OH), SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE:  Promise after promise  for this administration has turned out to be in the true.  So when it comes  to this health care law, the White House doesn't have much credibility.   And let's be clear: the only way to fully protect the American people is to  scrap this law once and for all. </p><p>  (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>  GHARIB:  John Harwood joins us now from Washington with more on this.</p><p>  You know, John, a lot of people wondering and questioning today, can  President Obama make these rule changes?  I mean, after all, the Affordable  Care Act is the law.  Does Congress at some point have to vote on this? </p><p>  I mean, talk us through how the process will work. </p><p>  JOHN HARWOOD, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Well, first of  all, Susie, I think the thing to remember about this is this is mostly  about the president trying to provide political cover for Democrats and for  himself to buy time until the exchanges are going to work, the Web site  will be fixed. </p><p>  He's not compelling any changes, and he's not giving a huge new grant  of authority to states.  What he's doing is saying that if state insurance  commissioners and insurance companies want to extend policies further, they  can, but the reality is that most of them don't want to because they want  to move into the new world of insurance under the Affordable Care Act.  So,  it is not clear how much this will change. </p><p>  It may extend some policies and at the very latest unless there's an  additional decision taken, some of those policies could go to the end of  September 2015, but it is not likely so far as I can tell that this is  going to make a whole sale change.  What the president was trying to resist  gutting of Obamacare and this is a minimum fix that he's trying to offer. </p><p>  GRIFFETH:  Yes, as you mentioned, John, this is providing political  cover for those Senate -- Democrats on the House who face reelection next  year, but the fact the White House acknowledges that this fix could extend  beyond 2014, beyond that election year, that sounds ominous at this point  for trying to fix this whole thing. </p><p>  HARWOOD:  It could, but I think that probably amounts to less than  meets the eye, Bill, and the reason is that administration, they said that  in their letter that was sent to state insurance commissioners earlier  today.  So, we've known that for most of the day, but what they are  counting on is that the Web site will be working, people will see better  options than the extension of these policies, and will be fine with moving  over to the new system.  That's why I said they are trying to buy time and  get over this rough period that they are in right now. </p><p>  GRIFFETH:  John Harwood in Washington.  Thanks for the political angle  of that. </p><p>  Let's talk about logistics, though.  Many insurance companies said  today they are worried about the president's fixes, saying that it could  destabilize the insurance market and result in higher premiums for  consumers. </p><p>  Let's turn to Bertha Coombs, who's been following this story all  along.</p><p>  What do these fixes mean for the insurance industry? </p><p>  BERTHA COOMBS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Well, because  it's voluntary, it's something that they need to now take a look at.  And  essentially, the insurers turned a page on these plans.  So, they haven't  priced what they would be for 2014.  So, effectively, they now have a 30- day window that they would have to try to do this because people who want  those plans that are expiring on December 31st, to be able to renew them  for January 1st, they have to put their premiums in and pay them by the  15th of December. </p><p>  So, here are the things they would need to do in the next 30 days,  they would need to figure out what the price is on those plans.  Calculate  all that for 2014.  They would need to get approval from state insurance  and the state insurance commissioners.  Washington state weighing this  afternoon saying they don't want to do this, and then they need to be able  to get the plans out to their customers and collect their premiums, all in  the next 30 days. </p><p>  GHARIB:  So, it sounds like you're say thing is not feasible to do in  30 days.  Will the insurance companies now fight back on this, or are they  going to have to do what the White House wants them to do?</p><p>  COOMBS:  Well, essentially, what's happened here is kind of like when  you play your mom off your dad.  Your dad kind of says, hey, it's not up to  me, ask your mother, she'll make the decision.  The president has now  shifted the decision to the insurers and the state insurance commissioners. </p><p>Aetna (NYSE:AET) essentially says we can try to do this but we would  have to get expedited reviews from all of these state commissioners in  order to do that and it is a logistical hurdle for them to do that over the  next 30 days.</p><p>  Cigna says they are already working with a lot of their clients to try  to figure out a way to extend these plans.  So, they may be partly along  the way.  Some of these insurers have actually offered early renewals.  One  man who I talked whose plan was canceled, he had an early renewal that, in  order to sort of skirt the ACA rules, went until December 1st, so that can  probably be extended until the end of next year. </p><p>  GRIFFETH:  There is a bit of a catch-22, though, because the president  said he hoped that those who had policies canceled would find a better  policy under ACA.  But if the Web site is not working, it's tough to do  that kind of comparison shopping. </p><p>  COOMBS:  Well, and it's also tough for the insurers because these are  people who already are good about paying their premiums.  They already  understand insurance and they're already committed to buying insurance.   And if they're not buying on the exchange, that really throws into question  the viability of that marketplace. </p><p>  GHARIB:  Real quickly, in just a word or two, what does this mean for  premiums if you have your old policy and you want to reinstall it, or new  policies?  Are they going up, prices? </p><p>  COOMBS:  I would imagine.  I mean, the insurers have to figure out  what the price is.  They've already seen some prices trends in terms of  medical cost going up.  So, they would need to raise the plan rates. </p><p>  GHARIB:  OK.  We'll get back to you on that. </p><p>  GRIFFETH:  Thanks, Bertha. </p><p>  GHARIB:  Thanks so much, Bertha.</p><p>  Well, despite all the changes to the new health law, health care  stocks had a strong day, but the big talk on Wall Street was about Cisco  (NASDAQ:CSCO) and Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT).  Investors dumped Cisco  (NASDAQ:CSCO) shares, reacting to that bad earnings report we told you  about last night and that shaved 15 points off the Dow.</p><p>  And Wal-Mart's earnings did little to inspire investors and that Dow  stock rose just a bit and we're going to have more analysis on both Wal- Mart (NYSE:WMT) and Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) in just a moment. </p><p>  Still, though, the disappointments did not stop the market rally, and  new highs for the record books.  The Dow added 54 points to a fresh record.   The NASDAQ gained seven.  And the S&amp;P up 8 1/2 points.  It also moved to a  new high.</p><p>  GRIFFETH:  All right.  Let's talk about shares of Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO)  Systems.  They were the biggest drag for the Dow today, also for the S&amp;P  and for the NASDAQ composite, with the stock tumbling 11 percent after  forecasting the continued decline in sales for the rest of the year. </p><p>  Jon Fortt has more on what's driving Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) shares lower. </p><p>  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>  JON FORTT, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  After  Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) reported a bad quarter last night and a dismal outlook,  the stock had its worst day in almost three years. </p><p>  (on camera):  The culprit: emerging markets, countries like India,  Brazil and Malaysia, that just a few months ago were bastions of growth are  turning into a nightmare for big tech companies.</p><p>  JOHN CHAMBERS, CISCO SYSTEM CEO:  It isn't just high tech.  It's the  consumer companies of our customers, the people who sell in Brazil or sell  in India, or manufacture who sells in those areas, what you're seeing is  the GDP slowed.  And as they slowed, and you and others have talked about  it for almost six months, then confidence began to drop.  And if they're  looking for the U.S. to lead them out of this scenario, clearly, the last  month or two has not instilled a lot of confidence. </p><p>  FORTT (voice-over):  At Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO), sales from the top five  emerging market countries fell 21 percent, and that's on top of a rough  sales environment in China that got worse because the NSA spying scandal  has buyers favoring local Chinese suppliers. </p><p>  All of that led Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) to forecast sales this quarter  will be far lower than a year ago.  Analysts have been hoping they'd be up.  </p><p>  And it's not just Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO).  IBM cited major trouble in  emerging markets during its quarterly report last month and Oracle  (NASDAQ:ORCL) has struggled in Asia, too.  A small networking player, fast- growing F5, says it's a regional issue. </p><p>  JOHN MCADAM, F5 NETWORKS CEO:  Asia has been reasonably tough for us.   South Asia, Vietnam, Australia, China was particularly tough last quarter  and we told (ph) that in our conference call.</p><p>  FORTT:  Things aren't likely to get better soon analysts fear.  What  Wall Street would like is a road map for how Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) will steer  through this.</p><p>  MARK SUE, RBC CAPITAL MARKETS MANAGING DIRECTOR:  We do think it's a  several quarter issue.  We think China I think could be longer than that. </p><p>  The next thing to look for is Cisco's analyst day, which comes up in  three weeks, and they really have to have some crisp responses in what  they're going to do. </p><p>  FORTT (on camera):  One thing they're probably going to do is keep CEO  John Chambers around a little bit longer than some expect it.  Chambers  tells that he plans to retire sometime in 2016.  The board has asked him to  stick around and guide the company through this very rough patch. </p><p>  For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Jon Fortt.</p><p>  (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>  GHARIB:  Well, it looks like Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) is also going through  a rough patch.  It posted quarterly earnings that were a penny better than  estimates for the third quarter but revenues were lower, and its outlook  for sales for the all-important holiday shopping period don't look to get  much better. </p><p>  Courtney Reagan has the story. </p><p>  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>  COURTNEY REAGAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):   The magic of Macy's appears to have been contained to just that retailer.   The confident telling (ph) Macy's executive expressed going into the all- important holiday quarter was absent in Wal-Mart's executive commentary in  its earnings report.  The world's largest retailer did exceed expectations  for earnings by one penny per share but sales fell short and the company's  forecast isn't inspiring much confidence either.</p><p>  DANA TELSEY, TELSEY ADVISORY GROUP CEO:  I think it's a very cautious  tone.  You go into a holiday season where six fewer days, the sense of  urgency is greater and level of promotions feel like it's going to be  higher than ever.  </p><p>  REAGAN:  Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) U.S. CEO Bill Simon says unemployment and  job stability tops the list of consumer concerns and says that while gas  prices have fallen, it's still a big piece of the budget for shoppers. </p><p>  (on camera):  So, is Wal-Mart's sale's weakness due to poor execution  by the company or results of the still pressured shopper?  Likely, it's a  combination of both. </p><p>TELSEY:  There is limited amount of dollars to go around.  They now  are competing as a consumables business in a bigger way, and that's  definitely a more competitive space.  So, it's the customer and the  environment. </p><p>  REAGAN (voice-over):   However, Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) says the company  is encouraged by the momentum coming out of the third quarter, nothing same  store sales and traffic improved throughout the quarter.  The key now is  making sure the trend continues. </p><p>  For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Courtney Reagan. </p><p>  (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>  GRIFFETH:  And there was more discouraging results at another big  discounter, this time, it's Kohl's (NYSE:KSS).  Their profits declined by  18 percent last quarter, with fewer customers shopping at their stores.   Shares of Khol's dropped sharply today, down 8 percent with the chain  cutting its full year earning's forecast as it predicts a pretty tough  holiday shopping season.</p><p>  GHARIB:  And still ahead on the program, Janet Yellen, widely expected  to be confirmed as the next Fed chair, breezed through questions from  senators on Capitol Hill today.  Did her testimony send a message to the  stock market and investors? </p><p>  (MUSIC)</p><p>  GRIFFETH:  Janet Yellen did take the first step in the confirmation  process to become the next chair of the Federal Reserve.  Current vice  chair of the central bank sounded positively dovish about the Fed's easy  money stimulus plans.  She said the U.S. economy still needs the Fed's help  and that helped stocks today, but will it win over the support of  lawmakers?  That's the question.</p><p>  Hampton Pearson has more tonight.</p><p>  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>  HAMPTON PEARSON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):   At a Senate Banking Committee on her nomination to become the first woman  Fed president --  </p><p>  JANET YELLIN, FEDERAL RESERVE CHAIR NOMINEE.  I do. </p><p>  PEARSON:  -- Janet Yellen strongly defended the central bank's  economic stimulus policy but gave no hint of when tapering might begin. </p><p>  YELLEN:  While there is no set time, we will decide to reduce the pace  of our purchases at each meeting, we are attempting to assess whether or  not the outlook is meeting the criterion that we have set out to begin the  pace of purchases. </p><p>  PEARSON:  As Fed vice chairman, Yellen has been a key ally of Bernanke  in holding key short term interest rates near zero since late 2008 and  quadrupling the Fed's balance sheet to some $3.8 trillion done with massive  monthly bond purchases. </p><p>  The housing recovery and strong auto sales she says are prime examples  of how the stimulus benefitted both Main Street and Wall Street. </p><p>  YELLEN:  We have seen interest rates fall very substantially.  Lower  interest rates, lower mortgage rates, particularly I think have been  instrumental in -- it's not the only factor, but it has been the positive  factor. </p><p>  PEARSON:  When asked about Fed regulation in the future of banks  judged too big to fail, Yellen said, as chairman, one of her highest  priorities would be to reduce any advantages enjoyed by the nation's  largest banks.</p><p>  YELLEN:  We have made progress in promoting a strong and stable  financial system but here, too, important work lies ahead.  I'm committed  to using the Fed's supervisory and regulatory role to reduce the threat of  another financial crisis. </p><p>  PEARSON (on camera):  A senior aid tells me, Yellen's strong  performance today is paving the way for a full vote by the Senate Banking  Committee early next week.  The timetable for a full Senate confirmation is  still up in the air.</p><p>  For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Hampton Pearson on Capitol Hill. </p><p>  (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>  GHARIB:  So, what did investors learn about what a Janet Yellen Fed  could mean for the stock market? </p><p>  Joining us to talk about that, Jeff Kleintop, chief market strategist  at LPL Financial. </p><p>  So, Jeff, what was the takeaway for investors here?  It was very  civilized hearing.  There was no fireworks.  She gave assurances that the  Fed is going to keep on stimulating the economy.</p><p>  Is this a buy signal for the markets? </p><p>  JEFF KLEINTOP, LPL FINANCIAL CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST:  Well, it's  certainly good news in the sense that she communicated that the Fed is  going to remain friendly to the markets, meaning continuing this insurance  policy the Fed has put in place through the bond-buying program at the same  time she acknowledged better growth in the private sector.  She said the  best of both worlds, the Fed remaining in the background is ensure against  anything going wrong and continuing that stimulus, but at the same time  better economic momentum.  It sounds like a recipe for continued gains in  the stock market. </p><p>  GRIFFETH:  What about the bond market?  Yields fell today.  In fact,  they fell last night when they first released her testimony to the Senate  Banking Committee, and rates have been rising recently, expecting a  tapering by the Fed sooner rather than later. </p><p>  Do you see yields going even further lower? </p><p>  KLEINTOP:  You know, I think yields are in a range right now.  I don't  think anything Janet said today is going to break them out of that.   Clearly, we were coming up on this December Fed meeting about a month from  now, a little more than a month from now, where, you know, they will be  deciding whether they're going to taper.  I don't think they'll have enough  information to do that. </p><p>  I think that's what we heard from Janet today, very much walking the  same line Ben has said, which is stayed independent and we're not sure yet.   The bond market interestingly has not really -- we haven't seen a  dramatically steeper yield curve on the idea that Janet would be much  easier in terms of monetary policy risking longer term inflation in the  bond market.  Instead, we see more continuation of Ben's policies. </p><p>  GHARIB:  But, you know, Jeff, at some point, this reducing the  stimulus is going to happen, whether it's in March or later than that, it's  going to happen and a lot of experts have said it's going to be tricky.   And today, Alan Greenspan was quoted as saying for Yellen, she faces very  daunting problems.</p><p>  So, what could that mean for the markets?  What could that mean for  the economy in terms of something going wrong?  It's going to be tough,  right? </p><p>  KLEINTOP:  Absolutely.  Communication is going to key.  And now that  we know who the Fed chairman is going to be through the bulk of 2014, it  lends more credibility to the Fed's message on what they're going to do on  QE.  And that should ease the transition.</p><p>  Listen, you're right, there is no surprise that this is coming -- a  slowing down of these bond purchases and as long as it's accompanied by  better growth, it should be good news for the stock market. </p><p>  But we only have to look back to the end of QE1 and QE2 to remember  the knee-jerk reactions in the stock market, decline between 15 percent and  20 percent that accompanied those.  Now, there were other background  factors involved.  But that's the knee-jerk reaction and we have to keep  that in the back of our minds here, even though we're much more braced and  in a better position economically for this transition. </p><p>  GRIFFETH:  Very quickly --  </p><p>  KLEINTOP:  So, expect some volatility, but ultimately, some gains for  the year.</p><p>  GRIFFETH:  I'm going to try to pin you down a little more than that.   I mean, we're sitting here at all time highs for the Dow and the S&amp;P.  Do  you see us continuing higher even as the Fed continues to talk about no  tapering right now?</p><p>  KLEINTOP:  Yes, I do.  We believe here at LPL and the research  department that we're going to see substantial gains, maybe double digit  gains next year.  But, Bill, it comes with a lot more volatility than we  saw this year.</p><p>  Peak-to-trough decline this year, 5.7 percent, almost nothing.  Expect  double or triple that next year in terms of the peak-to-trough decline.   Those are great opportunities for individual investors who have yet to  invest the stock market. </p><p>  GHARIB:  Well, that's a bullish forecast. </p><p>  Thanks a lot, Jeff, for coming on the program.  Jeff Kleintop --  </p><p>  KLEINTOP:  My pleasure.</p><p>  GHARIB:  -- chief market strategist at LPL Financial -- thanks again.</p><p>  GRIFFETH:  Meantime, Nordstrom's profit slipped in the third quarter,  and that's where we begin tonight's \"Market Focus\".  The high end  retailer's net income was down from last year because the company held its  anniversary sale event earlier this year and overhead expenses increased.   The chain still topped estimates. </p><p>  The stock initially fell on the results which came after the bell.   Shares ended the day slightly higher at $63.43. </p><p>  Meantime, Viacom (NYSE:VIA) saw a fourth quarter profit jump by 24  percent, driven by strong growth in the advertising, and increased home  entertainment revenue.  They media giant beat on both the top and the  bottom lines, but the company said it expects ad revenue to decelerate this  quarter.  The weak outlook worried investors, certainly, shares fell almost  3 percent, closed at $80.75.</p><p>  And the world's biggest burger chain is getting even better.   McDonald's announced today that it plans to spend about $3 billion next  year to open more than 1,500 new restaurants and remodeled 1,000 others.   The plan is roughly in line with the company's spending forecast for the  year.  Micky D's finished a fraction lower, though, at $97.56.</p><p>  GHARIB:  RE/MAX posted its first quarterly report since going public  in October.  And it wasn't the kind of report that investors expected -- a  38 percent drop in earnings.  The real estate brokerage chain blamed higher  interest expenses and IPO related costs for the profit missed.  Shares  tumbled almost 2 percent to $27.75.</p><p>  Under Armour (NYSE:UA) is entering the tech world with its first ever  acquisition.  The sports apparel maker will pay $150 million to buy Map My  Fitness.  This is a fitness application company.  The purchase is an effort  to get in on the wearable technology game.  As for the shares, Under Armour  (NYSE:UA) rose 1 percent to $83.53.</p><p>  And Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A) takes a big stake  in ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM).  According to a piling with regulators, Buffett  bought more than 40 million shares of the world's largest publicly traded  oil company.  Investors brought up ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) shares on the  news.  Exxon finished the regular session up fractionally to $93.22. </p><p>  GRIFFETH:  Certainly, Washington budget cuts are having an impact on  at least one big defense contractor.  That would be Lockheed Martin  (NYSE:LMT).  They announced plans to cut 4,000 jobs over the next two  years, placing the blames squarely on a sharp drop in spending at the  Pentagon.  About half those losses will come from attrition, the other half  by closing Lockheed facilities in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Texas, Arizona and in  California.</p><p>  GHARIB:  Still ahead on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT: as many families  begin their year-end tax planning, there are some strategies that could  help you lower your tax bill.</p><p>  (MUSIC)</p><p>  GRIFFETH:  Maybe hard to believe, but there are only six weeks left  until the end of the year.  So this may be a good time to start preparing  for your 2013 taxes, just remember who reminded you of this -- especially  with new changes to the tax code that could mean you're going to be paying  more to Uncle Sam this next year.</p><p>  So, what can you do now in the meantime? </p><p>  Sharon Epperson has some answers tonight.  </p><p>  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>  SHARON EPPERSON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):   Most people don't think about taxes in November, after all, tax returns  aren't due until next April. </p><p>  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I'm not even there yet.  I'm usually not a last  minute person, so it might be mid-March, and then I start to get my stuff  together.</p><p>  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I usually do my taxes in February.  So we're --  I'm more into the holidays right now, if anything, you know, like  Thanksgiving around the corner. </p><p>  EPPERSON:  But if you've had big changes in work or at home in the  past 12 months, some tax moves that's made before the end of the year could  result in big tax savings. </p><p>  Real estate executive Linda Aronson meets regularly with her financial  advisor to review tax-saving options, and make changes by December 31st  that will allow her to make the most of her income. </p><p>  LINDA ARONSON, TAXPAYER:  The biggest change that I made this year was  making sure that I was taking full advantage of every pretax opportunity  that my firm offered, and trying to lower my taxes in that way. </p><p>  EPPERSON:  Financial advisor Rich Coppa suggests increasing pretax  contributions to a 401(k) or another retire plan which lowers taxable  income dollar for dollar. </p><p>  RICHARD COPPA, WEALTH HEALTH MANAGING DIRECTOR:  If your company is  offering it, absolutely try to maximize your 401(k).  This is an  opportunity for you to reduce your taxes and have money growing for you for  your retirement. </p><p>  EPPERSON (on camera):  It's important to get a handle on your tax  situation now, because what you may owe or the refund you may get back from  the IRS could be very different this year, particularly for high-income  taxpayers. </p><p>  (voice-over):  Individuals with incomes over $400,000 and couples over  $450,000 have been moved up to a 39.6 percent federal income tax bracket,  up from 35 percent last year.  And they have to pay the maximum 20 percent  tax rate on long-term capital gains and qualifying dividends, up from 15  percent in 2012. </p><p>  To cut down the tax bill, Coppa suggests deferring income and  reviewing investments before the end of the year. </p><p>  COPPA:  We always look at any tax loss harvesting, which means that  you would sell a position that would reduce -- you know, fell in value,  take that loss to offset capital gain. </p><p>  EPPERSON:  With Coppa's guidance, Aronson says she's following some of  these strategies -- </p><p>  ARONSON:  I do think that as I've been making these changes, I will  see a lesser tax bill.</p><p>  EPPERSON:  -- giving her some peace of mind. </p><p>  For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Sharon Epperson. </p><p>  (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>  GHARIB:  And finally tonight, the cost of Thanksgiving dinner will be  a little lower this year.  The American Farm Bureau Federation says a  classic turkey dinner will average $49.04 to feed 10 people.  That's down  44 cents from 2012 and still averages less than $5 a serving.  The big  driver for the decline: turkey prices. </p><p>  I love Thanksgiving. </p><p>  GRIFFETH:  I do, too.  And we don't like cranberry sauce in my  household, so it's even cheaper --  </p><p>  GHARIB:  Lucky you, Bill.</p><p>  GRIFFETH:  Yes.</p><p>  GHARIB:  But keep the pumpkin pie. </p><p>  GRIFFETH:  Absolutely.</p><p>  GHARIB:  That's NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for tonight.  I'm Susie  Gharib.  Thanks so much for watching. </p><p>  GRIFFETH:  I'm Bill Griffeth.  Have a great evening.  We'll see you  tomorrow.</p><p> END</p><p> Nightly Business Report transcripts and video are available on-line post  broadcast at <url normalizedValue=\"http://nbr.com\">http://nbr.com</url>.

The president said today he will now allow insurers to extend their canceled health care policies for one year, maybe even longer, even if the coverage falls short of the new federal minimum standards.</p><p>Now, speaking to reporters at the White House today, Mr. Obama admitted his administration had botched the rollout of the new health care law and he said he regretted that his assurances that Americans could keep their health insurance plans if they liked it, that turned out to be wrong.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>OBAMA: I think it's legitimate for them to expect me to have to win back some credibility on this health care law in particular and on a whole range of these issues in general. And, you know, that's on me.

So when it comes to this health care law, the White House doesn't have much credibility. And let's be clear: the only way to fully protect the American people is to scrap this law once and for all.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GHARIB: John Harwood joins us now from Washington with more on this.</p><p>You know, John, a lot of people wondering and questioning today, can <person><nameText>President Obama </nameText></person>make these rule changes? I mean, after all, the Affordable Care Act is the law. Does Congress at some point have to vote on this?</p><p>I mean, talk us through how the process will work.</p><p>JOHN HARWOOD, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Well, first of all, Susie, I think the thing to remember about this is this is mostly about the president trying to provide political cover for Democrats and for himself to buy time until the exchanges are going to work, the Web site will be fixed.</p><p>He's not compelling any changes, and he's not giving a huge new grant of authority to states. What he's doing is saying that if state insurance commissioners and insurance companies want to extend policies further, they can, but the reality is that most of them don't want to because they want to move into the new world of insurance under the Affordable Care Act. So, it is not clear how much this will change.</p><p>It may extend some policies and at the very latest unless there's an additional decision taken, some of those policies could go to the end of September 2015, but it is not likely so far as I can tell that this is going to make a whole sale change. What the president was trying to resist gutting of Obamacare and this is a minimum fix that he's trying to offer.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Yes, as you mentioned, John, this is providing political cover for those Senate -- Democrats on the House who face reelection next year, but the fact the White House acknowledges that this fix could extend beyond 2014, beyond that election year, that sounds ominous at this point for trying to fix this whole thing.</p><p>HARWOOD: It could, but I think that probably amounts to less than meets the eye, Bill, and the reason is that administration, they said that in their letter that was sent to state insurance commissioners earlier today. So, we've known that for most of the day, but what they are counting on is that the Web site will be working, people will see better options than the extension of these policies, and will be fine with moving over to the new system. That's why I said they are trying to buy time and get over this rough period that they are in right now.</p><p>GRIFFETH: John Harwood in Washington. Thanks for the political angle of that.</p><p>Let's talk about logistics, though. Many insurance companies said today they are worried about the president's fixes, saying that it could destabilize the insurance market and result in higher premiums for consumers.</p><p>Let's turn to Bertha Coombs, who's been following this story all along.</p><p>What do these fixes mean for the insurance industry?</p><p>BERTHA COOMBS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Well, because it's voluntary, it's something that they need to now take a look at. And essentially, the insurers turned a page on these plans. So, they haven't priced what they would be for 2014. So, effectively, they now have a 30- day window that they would have to try to do this because people who want those plans that are expiring on December 31st, to be able to renew them for January 1st, they have to put their premiums in and pay them by the 15th of December.</p><p>So, here are the things they would need to do in the next 30 days, they would need to figure out what the price is on those plans. Calculate all that for 2014. They would need to get approval from state insurance and the state insurance commissioners. Washington state weighing this afternoon saying they don't want to do this, and then they need to be able to get the plans out to their customers and collect their premiums, all in the next 30 days.</p><p>GHARIB: So, it sounds like you're say thing is not feasible to do in 30 days. Will the insurance companies now fight back on this, or are they going to have to do what the White House wants them to do?</p><p>COOMBS: Well, essentially, what's happened here is kind of like when you play your mom off your dad. Your dad kind of says, hey, it's not up to me, ask your mother, she'll make the decision. The president has now shifted the decision to the insurers and the state insurance commissioners.</p><p>Aetna (NYSE:AET) essentially says we can try to do this but we would have to get expedited reviews from all of these state commissioners in order to do that and it is a logistical hurdle for them to do that over the next 30 days.</p><p>Cigna says they are already working with a lot of their clients to try to figure out a way to extend these plans. So, they may be partly along the way. Some of these insurers have actually offered early renewals. One man who I talked whose plan was canceled, he had an early renewal that, in order to sort of skirt the ACA rules, went until December 1st, so that can probably be extended until the end of next year.</p><p>GRIFFETH: There is a bit of a catch-22, though, because the president said he hoped that those who had policies canceled would find a better policy under ACA. But if the Web site is not working, it's tough to do that kind of comparison shopping.</p><p>COOMBS: Well, and it's also tough for the insurers because these are people who already are good about paying their premiums. They already understand insurance and they're already committed to buying insurance. And if they're not buying on the exchange, that really throws into question the viability of that marketplace.</p><p>GHARIB: Real quickly, in just a word or two, what does this mean for premiums if you have your old policy and you want to reinstall it, or new policies? Are they going up, prices?</p><p>COOMBS: I would imagine. I mean, the insurers have to figure out what the price is. They've already seen some prices trends in terms of medical cost going up. So, they would need to raise the plan rates.</p><p>GHARIB: OK. We'll get back to you on that.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Thanks, Bertha.</p><p>GHARIB: Thanks so much, Bertha.</p><p>Well, despite all the changes to the new health law, health care stocks had a strong day, but the big talk on Wall Street was about Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) and Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT). Investors dumped Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) shares, reacting to that bad earnings report we told you about last night and that shaved 15 points off the Dow.</p><p>And Wal-Mart's earnings did little to inspire investors and that Dow stock rose just a bit and we're going to have more analysis on both Wal- Mart (NYSE:WMT) and Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) in just a moment.</p><p>Still, though, the disappointments did not stop the market rally, and new highs for the record books. The Dow added 54 points to a fresh record. The NASDAQ gained seven. And the S&amp;P up 8 1/2 points. It also moved to a new high.</p><p>GRIFFETH: All right. Let's talk about shares of Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) Systems. They were the biggest drag for the Dow today, also for the S&amp;P and for the NASDAQ composite, with the stock tumbling 11 percent after forecasting the continued decline in sales for the rest of the year.</p><p>Jon Fortt has more on what's driving Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) shares lower.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JON FORTT, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): After Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) reported a bad quarter last night and a dismal outlook, the stock had its worst day in almost three years.</p><p>(on camera): The culprit: emerging markets, countries like India, Brazil and Malaysia, that just a few months ago were bastions of growth are turning into a nightmare for big tech companies.</p><p>JOHN CHAMBERS, CISCO SYSTEM CEO: It isn't just high tech. It's the consumer companies of our customers, the people who sell in Brazil or sell in India, or manufacture who sells in those areas, what you're seeing is the GDP slowed. And as they slowed, and you and others have talked about it for almost six months, then confidence began to drop. And if they're looking for the U.S. to lead them out of this scenario, clearly, the last month or two has not instilled a lot of confidence.</p><p>FORTT (voice-over): At Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO), sales from the top five emerging market countries fell 21 percent, and that's on top of a rough sales environment in China that got worse because the NSA spying scandal has buyers favoring local Chinese suppliers.</p><p>All of that led Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) to forecast sales this quarter will be far lower than a year ago. Analysts have been hoping they'd be up.</p><p>And it's not just Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO). IBM cited major trouble in emerging markets during its quarterly report last month and Oracle (NASDAQ:ORCL) has struggled in Asia, too. A small networking player, fast- growing F5, says it's a regional issue.</p><p>JOHN MCADAM, F5 NETWORKS CEO: Asia has been reasonably tough for us. South Asia, Vietnam, Australia, China was particularly tough last quarter and we told (ph) that in our conference call.</p><p>FORTT: Things aren't likely to get better soon analysts fear. What Wall Street would like is a road map for how Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) will steer through this.</p><p>MARK SUE, RBC CAPITAL MARKETS MANAGING DIRECTOR: We do think it's a several quarter issue. We think China I think could be longer than that.</p><p>The next thing to look for is Cisco's analyst day, which comes up in three weeks, and they really have to have some crisp responses in what they're going to do.</p><p>FORTT (on camera): One thing they're probably going to do is keep CEO John Chambers around a little bit longer than some expect it. Chambers tells that he plans to retire sometime in 2016. The board has asked him to stick around and guide the company through this very rough patch.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Jon Fortt.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GHARIB: Well, it looks like Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) is also going through a rough patch. It posted quarterly earnings that were a penny better than estimates for the third quarter but revenues were lower, and its outlook for sales for the all-important holiday shopping period don't look to get much better.</p><p>Courtney Reagan has the story.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>COURTNEY REAGAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The magic of Macy's appears to have been contained to just that retailer. The confident telling (ph) Macy's executive expressed going into the all- important holiday quarter was absent in Wal-Mart's executive commentary in its earnings report. The world's largest retailer did exceed expectations for earnings by one penny per share but sales fell short and the company's forecast isn't inspiring much confidence either.</p><p>DANA TELSEY, TELSEY ADVISORY GROUP CEO: I think it's a very cautious tone. You go into a holiday season where six fewer days, the sense of urgency is greater and level of promotions feel like it's going to be higher than ever.</p><p>REAGAN: Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) U.S. CEO Bill Simon says unemployment and job stability tops the list of consumer concerns and says that while gas prices have fallen, it's still a big piece of the budget for shoppers.</p><p>(on camera): So, is Wal-Mart's sale's weakness due to poor execution by the company or results of the still pressured shopper? Likely, it's a combination of both.</p><p>TELSEY: There is limited amount of dollars to go around. They now are competing as a consumables business in a bigger way, and that's definitely a more competitive space. So, it's the customer and the environment.</p><p>REAGAN (voice-over): However, Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) says the company is encouraged by the momentum coming out of the third quarter, nothing same store sales and traffic improved throughout the quarter. The key now is making sure the trend continues.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Courtney Reagan.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH: And there was more discouraging results at another big discounter, this time, it's Kohl's (NYSE:KSS). Their profits declined by 18 percent last quarter, with fewer customers shopping at their stores. Shares of Khol's dropped sharply today, down 8 percent with the chain cutting its full year earning's forecast as it predicts a pretty tough holiday shopping season.</p><p>GHARIB: And still ahead on the program, Janet Yellen, widely expected to be confirmed as the next Fed chair, breezed through questions from senators on Capitol Hill today. Did her testimony send a message to the stock market and investors?</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GRIFFETH: Janet Yellen did take the first step in the confirmation process to become the next chair of the Federal Reserve. Current vice chair of the central bank sounded positively dovish about the Fed's easy money stimulus plans. She said the U.S. economy still needs the Fed's help and that helped stocks today, but will it win over the support of lawmakers? That's the question.</p><p>Hampton Pearson has more tonight.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HAMPTON PEARSON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): At a Senate Banking Committee on her nomination to become the first woman Fed president --</p><p>JANET YELLIN, FEDERAL RESERVE CHAIR NOMINEE. I do.</p><p>PEARSON: -- Janet Yellen strongly defended the central bank's economic stimulus policy but gave no hint of when tapering might begin.</p><p>YELLEN: While there is no set time, we will decide to reduce the pace of our purchases at each meeting, we are attempting to assess whether or not the outlook is meeting the criterion that we have set out to begin the pace of purchases.</p><p>PEARSON: As Fed vice chairman, Yellen has been a key ally of Bernanke in holding key short term interest rates near zero since late 2008 and quadrupling the Fed's balance sheet to some $3.8 trillion done with massive monthly bond purchases.</p><p>The housing recovery and strong auto sales she says are prime examples of how the stimulus benefitted both Main Street and Wall Street.</p><p>YELLEN: We have seen interest rates fall very substantially. Lower interest rates, lower mortgage rates, particularly I think have been instrumental in -- it's not the only factor, but it has been the positive factor.</p><p>PEARSON: When asked about Fed regulation in the future of banks judged too big to fail, Yellen said, as chairman, one of her highest priorities would be to reduce any advantages enjoyed by the nation's largest banks.</p><p>YELLEN: We have made progress in promoting a strong and stable financial system but here, too, important work lies ahead. I'm committed to using the Fed's supervisory and regulatory role to reduce the threat of another financial crisis.</p><p>PEARSON (on camera): A senior aid tells me, Yellen's strong performance today is paving the way for a full vote by the Senate Banking Committee early next week. The timetable for a full Senate confirmation is still up in the air.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Hampton Pearson on Capitol Hill.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GHARIB: So, what did investors learn about what a Janet Yellen Fed could mean for the stock market?</p><p>Joining us to talk about that, Jeff Kleintop, chief market strategist at LPL Financial.</p><p>So, Jeff, what was the takeaway for investors here? It was very civilized hearing. There was no fireworks. She gave assurances that the Fed is going to keep on stimulating the economy.</p><p>Is this a buy signal for the markets?</p><p>JEFF KLEINTOP, LPL FINANCIAL CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST: Well, it's certainly good news in the sense that she communicated that the Fed is going to remain friendly to the markets, meaning continuing this insurance policy the Fed has put in place through the bond-buying program at the same time she acknowledged better growth in the private sector. She said the best of both worlds, the Fed remaining in the background is ensure against anything going wrong and continuing that stimulus, but at the same time better economic momentum. It sounds like a recipe for continued gains in the stock market.</p><p>GRIFFETH: What about the bond market? Yields fell today. In fact, they fell last night when they first released her testimony to the Senate Banking Committee, and rates have been rising recently, expecting a tapering by the Fed sooner rather than later.</p><p>Do you see yields going even further lower?</p><p>KLEINTOP: You know, I think yields are in a range right now. I don't think anything Janet said today is going to break them out of that. Clearly, we were coming up on this December Fed meeting about a month from now, a little more than a month from now, where, you know, they will be deciding whether they're going to taper. I don't think they'll have enough information to do that.</p><p>I think that's what we heard from Janet today, very much walking the same line Ben has said, which is stayed independent and we're not sure yet. The bond market interestingly has not really -- we haven't seen a dramatically steeper yield curve on the idea that Janet would be much easier in terms of monetary policy risking longer term inflation in the bond market. Instead, we see more continuation of Ben's policies.</p><p>GHARIB: But, you know, Jeff, at some point, this reducing the stimulus is going to happen, whether it's in March or later than that, it's going to happen and a lot of experts have said it's going to be tricky. And today, Alan Greenspan was quoted as saying for Yellen, she faces very daunting problems.</p><p>So, what could that mean for the markets? What could that mean for the economy in terms of something going wrong? It's going to be tough, right?</p><p>KLEINTOP: Absolutely. Communication is going to key. And now that we know who the Fed chairman is going to be through the bulk of 2014, it lends more credibility to the Fed's message on what they're going to do on QE. And that should ease the transition.</p><p>Listen, you're right, there is no surprise that this is coming -- a slowing down of these bond purchases and as long as it's accompanied by better growth, it should be good news for the stock market.</p><p>But we only have to look back to the end of QE1 and QE2 to remember the knee-jerk reactions in the stock market, decline between 15 percent and 20 percent that accompanied those. Now, there were other background factors involved. But that's the knee-jerk reaction and we have to keep that in the back of our minds here, even though we're much more braced and in a better position economically for this transition.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Very quickly --</p><p>KLEINTOP: So, expect some volatility, but ultimately, some gains for the year.</p><p>GRIFFETH: I'm going to try to pin you down a little more than that. I mean, we're sitting here at all time highs for the Dow and the S&amp;P. Do you see us continuing higher even as the Fed continues to talk about no tapering right now?</p><p>KLEINTOP: Yes, I do. We believe here at LPL and the research department that we're going to see substantial gains, maybe double digit gains next year. But, Bill, it comes with a lot more volatility than we saw this year.</p><p>Peak-to-trough decline this year, 5.7 percent, almost nothing. Expect double or triple that next year in terms of the peak-to-trough decline. Those are great opportunities for individual investors who have yet to invest the stock market.</p><p>GHARIB: Well, that's a bullish forecast.</p><p>Thanks a lot, Jeff, for coming on the program. Jeff Kleintop --</p><p>KLEINTOP: My pleasure.</p><p>GHARIB: -- chief market strategist at LPL Financial -- thanks again.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Meantime, Nordstrom's profit slipped in the third quarter, and that's where we begin tonight's \"Market Focus\". The high end retailer's net income was down from last year because the company held its anniversary sale event earlier this year and overhead expenses increased. The chain still topped estimates.</p><p>The stock initially fell on the results which came after the bell. Shares ended the day slightly higher at $63.43.</p><p>Meantime, Viacom (NYSE:VIA) saw a fourth quarter profit jump by 24 percent, driven by strong growth in the advertising, and increased home entertainment revenue. They media giant beat on both the top and the bottom lines, but the company said it expects ad revenue to decelerate this quarter. The weak outlook worried investors, certainly, shares fell almost 3 percent, closed at $80.75.</p><p>And the world's biggest burger chain is getting even better. McDonald's announced today that it plans to spend about $3 billion next year to open more than 1,500 new restaurants and remodeled 1,000 others. The plan is roughly in line with the company's spending forecast for the year. Micky D's finished a fraction lower, though, at $97.56.</p><p>GHARIB: RE/MAX posted its first quarterly report since going public in October. And it wasn't the kind of report that investors expected -- a 38 percent drop in earnings. The real estate brokerage chain blamed higher interest expenses and IPO related costs for the profit missed. Shares tumbled almost 2 percent to $27.75.</p><p>Under Armour (NYSE:UA) is entering the tech world with its first ever acquisition. The sports apparel maker will pay $150 million to buy Map My Fitness. This is a fitness application company. The purchase is an effort to get in on the wearable technology game. As for the shares, Under Armour (NYSE:UA) rose 1 percent to $83.53.</p><p>And Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A) takes a big stake in ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM). According to a piling with regulators, Buffett bought more than 40 million shares of the world's largest publicly traded oil company. Investors brought up ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) shares on the news. Exxon finished the regular session up fractionally to $93.22.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Certainly, Washington budget cuts are having an impact on at least one big defense contractor. That would be Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT). They announced plans to cut 4,000 jobs over the next two years, placing the blames squarely on a sharp drop in spending at the Pentagon. About half those losses will come from attrition, the other half by closing Lockheed facilities in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Texas, Arizona and in California.</p><p>GHARIB: Still ahead on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT: as many families begin their year-end tax planning, there are some strategies that could help you lower your tax bill.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GRIFFETH: Maybe hard to believe, but there are only six weeks left until the end of the year. So this may be a good time to start preparing for your 2013 taxes, just remember who reminded you of this -- especially with new changes to the tax code that could mean you're going to be paying more to Uncle Sam this next year.</p><p>So, what can you do now in the meantime?</p><p>Sharon Epperson has some answers tonight.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SHARON EPPERSON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Most people don't think about taxes in November, after all, tax returns aren't due until next April.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm not even there yet. I'm usually not a last minute person, so it might be mid-March, and then I start to get my stuff together.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I usually do my taxes in February. So we're -- I'm more into the holidays right now, if anything, you know, like Thanksgiving around the corner.</p><p>EPPERSON: But if you've had big changes in work or at home in the past 12 months, some tax moves that's made before the end of the year could result in big tax savings.</p><p>Real estate executive Linda Aronson meets regularly with her financial advisor to review tax-saving options, and make changes by December 31st that will allow her to make the most of her income.</p><p>LINDA ARONSON, TAXPAYER: The biggest change that I made this year was making sure that I was taking full advantage of every pretax opportunity that my firm offered, and trying to lower my taxes in that way.</p><p>EPPERSON: Financial advisor Rich Coppa suggests increasing pretax contributions to a 401(k) or another retire plan which lowers taxable income dollar for dollar.</p><p>RICHARD COPPA, WEALTH HEALTH MANAGING DIRECTOR: If your company is offering it, absolutely try to maximize your 401(k). This is an opportunity for you to reduce your taxes and have money growing for you for your retirement.</p><p>EPPERSON (on camera): It's important to get a handle on your tax situation now, because what you may owe or the refund you may get back from the IRS could be very different this year, particularly for high-income taxpayers.</p><p>(voice-over): Individuals with incomes over $400,000 and couples over $450,000 have been moved up to a 39.6 percent federal income tax bracket, up from 35 percent last year. And they have to pay the maximum 20 percent tax rate on long-term capital gains and qualifying dividends, up from 15 percent in 2012.</p><p>To cut down the tax bill, Coppa suggests deferring income and reviewing investments before the end of the year.</p><p>COPPA: We always look at any tax loss harvesting, which means that you would sell a position that would reduce -- you know, fell in value, take that loss to offset capital gain.</p><p>EPPERSON: With Coppa's guidance, Aronson says she's following some of these strategies --</p><p>ARONSON: I do think that as I've been making these changes, I will see a lesser tax bill.</p><p>EPPERSON: -- giving her some peace of mind.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Sharon Epperson.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GHARIB: And finally tonight, the cost of Thanksgiving dinner will be a little lower this year. The American Farm Bureau Federation says a classic turkey dinner will average $49.04 to feed 10 people. That's down 44 cents from 2012 and still averages less than $5 a serving. The big driver for the decline: turkey prices.</p><p>I love Thanksgiving.</p><p>GRIFFETH: I do, too. And we don't like cranberry sauce in my household, so it's even cheaper --</p><p>GHARIB: Lucky you, Bill.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Yes.</p><p>GHARIB: But keep the pumpkin pie.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Absolutely.</p><p>GHARIB: That's NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for tonight. I'm Susie Gharib. Thanks so much for watching.</p><p>GRIFFETH: I'm Bill Griffeth. Have a great evening. We'll see you tomorrow.</p><p>END</p><p>Nightly Business Report transcripts and video are available on-line post broadcast at <url normalizedValue=\"http://nbr.com\">http://nbr.com</url>.

The Dow sheds 1,300 points in two days. The trading was volatile. It was turbulent, and it was leaving a lot of investors with a lot of questions.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SUE HERERA, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR: Out of control. Why the president isn`t holding back in criticism of the Federal Reserve.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">GRIFFETH: Peak Permian? As interest rates rise, this is as good as it gets for the American shale boom perhaps. It`s centered around an industry loaded with debt.</p><p>Those stories and much more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for this Thursday, October the 11th.</p><p>HERERA: And good evening, everyone. And welcome.</p><p>There is only one way to describe today -- ugly. And there is only one way to describe the past two days -- really ugly. The selling was widespread. The volume heavy, the market has become gripped by fears of rapidly rising interest rates, a possible global economic slowdown and high tech valuations.</p><p>And according to one tally, this is now the worst start to a fourth quarter since 2008. The Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 545 points to 25,052. The Nasdaq fell 92 points, and the S&amp;P 500 dropped 57.</p><p>Bob Pisani at the New York Stock Exchange tells us what`s behind the selling and what`s getting hit.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BOB PISANI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Wall Street`s steep Wednesday selloff bled over today with the Dow tumbling almost 700 points at the lows before ending down about 500. Stocks were all over the map, moving between gains and losses in very choppy trading. But rates continue to be the main driver overall. The markets looked to the holding steady until 2:30 Eastern Time when there was a huge burst of selling around some ETFs in the equity space and treasury bond ETFs, in other words, a rotation out of stocks and into bonds.</p><p>What we`re seeing is a momentum driven flush-out of some of the big cap names and there also a couple of sector specific stories driving action today. So, for example, bank stocks have been weak early on because of a weaker read on consumer prices. They were driven even lower by strong demand for treasuries at today`s 30-year bond auction, all of which pushed bond yields down to session lows, generally negative for banks.</p><p>And energy lagged on the day, falling on a bigger build up than expected in crude oil inventories. And that was an issue for all the energy stocks. Tomorrow will be a key day to watch with bank earnings kicking off, starting with J.P. Morgan and another big read on consumer sentiment.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Bob Pisani at the New York Stock Exchange.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH: Now with all of the selling, we asked Mike Santoli to look for any clues about when the downward pressure might ease up. Here is what he found.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MIKE SANTOLI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: After a sharp and jarring market drop, investors quickly move to asses the damage and search for signs of stability. And this process is now underway following the biggest two-day tumble since February.</p><p>The damage has been swift and pervasive across the market, and the downside momentum has not yet let up. Traders are noting that the market has quickly become oversold, which means the indexes are stretched far below their recent trend.</p><p>Along with the fact that the vast majority of stocks are down more than 10 percent from the high in a short time, this can ultimately set the stage for a bounce simply as a technical matter. But selloffs can feed on themselves as traders seek shelter from a more treacherous market action.</p><p>One indicator getting a lot of attention is known as the volatility index, a measure of how urgently traders are buying protective options. This index has surged from 15 to the high 20s this week and elevated level, but while the low extremes reached in February that marked the correction low. Veteran traders like to see this volatility gauge retreat dramatically from a peak over the course of a trading session, often a sign the market is calming itself.</p><p>Investor sentiment has been turned cautious as well. Typically a nasty decline spreads worry which also can set the scene for an eventual recovery. One clue to end this market might find its footing is to whether the majority of stocks participate in any relief rallies that pop up. While the skid in the market got rolling with a move to new multiyear highs in bond yields, it continued after yield stock going up on Thursday, suggesting it had became a violent rotation out of some of the best performing tech, industrial and consumer stocks as fears of rising rates, a possible profit slowdown and unsettled global markets flared up.</p><p>There is no reliable way to call an end to these ugly market episodes. But one consolation might be that the action is not clearly based on evidence of a weakening economy. This is mostly a stock market event tied to valuations and investor risk appetites for now, which means the market itself will have to tell us when these painful adjustments might be nearing an end.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Mike Santoli.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: And now to the Fed, which is at the center of the concern over interest rates. Today, the president of the Kansas City Fed said the central bank will likely continue to raise interest rates. Esther George says a tightening labor market could lead inflation to accelerate over the next few years, though she had the pace remains a matter of discussion.</p><p>Separately, a new report showed slowing inflation last month. The consumer price index rose just 0.1 percent, which was less than expected.</p><p>GRIFFETH: And the president as we have been reporting has been a vocal critic of the Fed`s monetary policy. He recently called the Fed`s recent stance on interest rates too aggressive. But is it?</p><p>Steve Liesman reports.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>STEVE LIESMAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: The president of the United States not holding back in his criticism of the Federal Reserve`s interest rate hiking policies, blaming the recent stock market selloff directly on the central bank.</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I think the Fed is out of control. I think what they`re do something wrong. I think the Fed is far too stringent and making a mistake. And it`s not right.</p><p>And it`s -- despite that we are doing very well. But it`s not necessary in my opinion. And I think I know about it better than they do, believe me.</p><p>LIESMAN: So, is the Fed crazy? Before answering, it`s worth pointing out three of the four members of the board of governors chair and two vice chairs were all appointed by President Trump.</p><p>Beyond that, it`s worth looking at how the Fed changed interest rate policy in the past year, largely in response to the president`s own policies. Last year, the Fed forecast 2 percent inflation for 2018, 2 percent growth and 4.1 percent unemployment rate. The median forecast as a result looked for the Fed to raise rates by about three quarters of a point to 2 percent.</p><p>So, what happened? Inflation came in right on target, but growth surge and unemployment came in well below the forecast. That is, the economy did better than the Fed expected.</p><p>So, the Fed changed its outlook. It now forecasts a full percentage point rate rise this year compared to 3/4 of a point or just 25 basis points in the prior forecasts.</p><p>Is that crazy? After a huge tax cut, a surge in the deficit and series of price-raising tariffs, most economists say the Fed is responding appropriately to the change in the economy.</p><p>JOHN RYDING, RDQ ECONOMICS: There`s a rate hike in does in its forecast. It has three rate hikes next year. My guess is actually the inflation numbers will push the Fed to four. But none of that is a disaster as long as companies generate profits.</p><p>LIESMAN: The danger is if the economy doesn`t keep up its momentum. In that case, the Fed`s forecast could be too aggressive. But it can always dial back its plan to raise rates if the economy weakens. That`s not crazy. That`s monetary policy.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Steve Liesman.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH: Joining us now to help put all of this into perspective. Joining us tonight is Andres Garcia. He`s founder and CEO of Zoe Financial.</p><p>Andres, always good to see you. Thanks for joining us tonight.</p><p>ANDRES GARCIA, ZOE FINANCIAL FOUNDER &amp; CEO: Thanks for having me.</p><p>GRIFFETH: So, the selloff this week essentially wiped out gains we`ve seen over the last three months in the stock market here in the U.S. So, now what? What -- put this in perspective for us.</p><p>GARCIA: OK. So, the first thing that I would mention is we`re still what 5 percent from all all-time highs, right? So, let`s take a deep breath.</p><p>Another thing that`s important to keep in mind is we have had 23 corrections that are 5 percent or more since March of 2009. So, this is not -- this is not -- is not an everyday event but is not totally abnormal.</p><p>I`ll give you one more stat. If you go back 39 years, on average, if you look at the worst intra year drop, it`s 13 percent. So, even if we see this, you know, 5, 6 percent correction turn to the 10 percent correction, that is still considered normal when we look at the last four decades, right? That`s important to keep in mind.</p><p>GRIFFETH: OK.</p><p>GARCIA: I don`t know what`s happening next. And I think that`s important to keep in mind as well. Nobody does. So, if it`s s out of your control, try to basically not to focus too much on the headlines and stay focus on the long-term.</p><p>HERERA: All right. So, what is the best advise then for our viewers who are watching tonight? Because, I mean, interest rates have been edging up gradually, but all of a sudden, it seems to be what the market is focused on.</p><p>So, if you have a long-term horizon what is the best strategy to keep all this volatility in perspective.</p><p>GARCIA: Yes, I think that`s the key.</p><p>And I`ll say one more thing about the interest rates as well. Let`s not forget that interest rates, long-term interest rates and short-term interest rates have been rising a while. In fact, long-term interest rates have been rising since last summer. And last time I checked, the S&amp;P 500 has been up since then.</p><p>The other kind of headline that I see is that trade wars are creating this. Last time I check, trade wars have been ongoing this year, and the market is still up 5 percent and it was up 10 percent when this trade war situation was pretty rough.</p><p>But going back to your question, what is under people`s control is how much they save, do they invest, and do they have a plan for the long-term? That`s under their control.</p><p>And then the last thing under their control is how they react to short-term volatility. If you keep control of those things in the long-term, you`ll be okay.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Very quickly, technology stocks have been the darling of this market. The FANG stocks have been getting a lot of the attention in the last couple of years. And they`re leading this market lower.</p><p>What do you do with those guys?</p><p>GARCIA: I`m not going to comment on short-term volatility, on tech stocks. What I would say is that their volatility in general tends to be much higher than the overall market. So, people forget that they were up 50, 60 percent. They feel it more when they`re down 15 or 20, right?</p><p>GRIFFETH: Right.</p><p>GARCIA: So, higher risk, higher return, and that`s the essence what you`re getting when you`re investing in those types of stocks.</p><p>GRIFFETH: One of the sacrosanct laws of Wall Street, the higher the risk, the higher gains.</p><p>Andres Garcia with Zoe Financial -- always good to see you. Thanks for joining us tonight.</p><p>GARCIA: Thanks for having me.</p><p>HERERA: It is time to take a look at some of today`s upgrades and downgrades.</p><p>Lear (NYSE:LEA) was upgraded to buy from neutral at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS). The analyst cites solid free cash flow and the potential to gain market share. The price target is $195. Shares of Lear (NYSE:LEA) rose nearly 2 percent to $137.54.</p><p>The price target for shares of \"The New York Times (NYSE:NYT)\" was increased to $32 at J.P. Morgan. The analyst there expects the upcoming elections to help drive its paper`s digital subscriptions. The firm maintains the overweight rating. \"The New York Times (NYSE:NYT)\" shares rose a fraction to $24.84.</p><p>And J.P. Morgan cut the target on Abercrombie &amp; Fitch (NYSE:ANF) to $16. The analyst cites potential margin pressure as a result of tariffs and higher wages. The rating remains underweight. The shares finished down more than 5 percent to $17.99.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Still ahead, tipping point? Money had been flowing into passive investments like ETFs and mutual funds. But is that starting to shift?</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>HERERA: A group of senators are not pleased with Google (NASDAQ:GOOG). Today, they sent a letter to the company criticizing it for failing to disclose the data vulnerability that affected hundreds of thousands of Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) Plus users. Senator Thune said he was disappointed that Google`s chief privacy officer testified before the Commerce Committee a few weeks ago and failed to provide information on that breach. Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) disclosed the breach after it was reported by the \"Wall Street Journal.\"</p><p>GRIFFETH: And as we have been reporting, of course, the Nasdaq selloff has been sharp. The index is off more than 9 percent from its most recent highs into August. And, of course, it is loaded with some very popular technology stocks, which begs the question, will this group that led the market higher now lead it lower?</p><p>Josh Lipton looks at what may be next.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JOSH LIPTON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: High-fliers have been losing altitude. That`s the story of big tech`s recent performance in the stock market that has seen names like Alphabet, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) fall sharply from their recent highs.</p><p>Many on Wall Street say the reason for the decline is simple. When there is a broad, sharp selloff investors tend to sell what has been performing the best. And that`s especially true when the winners are some of the biggest, most liquid names in the market. But a major concern is whether there is a broader rotation happening from sectors with significant growth potential to those that appear cheaper and more defensive. If that`s the case, it would be bad news for tech in the quarters ahead.</p><p>TIMOTHY LESKO, GRANITE INVESTMENT ADVISORS: Right now, you have a lot of other crosswinds that are scaring investors. So, this may last a little while longer as people get comfortable with what goes on in tariffs, inflation and rates.</p><p>LIPTON: Still there are tech bulls on Wall Street. For example, the team at CFRA Research remains bullish on the tech sector. Next year, they estimate earnings growth of 11 percent and revenue growth of 9 percent, both better than the broader market.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Josh Lipton, San Francisco.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: So, with all of that selling on Wall Street and money flowing out of passive investments like ETFs and mutual funds, is this setting the stage for the comeback of active investing?</p><p>Amanda Agati is the co-chief investment strategist at PNC Financial and she is here to share her thoughts with us.</p><p>Good to see you, Amanda. Welcome.</p><p>AMANDA AGATI, PNC FINANCIAL CO-CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST: Thank you for having me.</p><p>HERERA: You make the points in the notes that I`m reading here that you are starting to see that, and it`s been going on for a little bit now.</p><p>AGATI: Well, yes, absolutely. We believe very strongly that a comeback or a resurgence in active management is already occurring. It`s not just precipitated by the last couple of days of spike in volatility in the markets.</p><p>And actually, the backdrop for active management has been evolving and improving basically over the course of 2018. So, yes, we think it`s already underway and likely to pick up steam.</p><p>GRIFFETH: But you know why people were rushing to the passive investments, the exchange traded funds, the index funds, they`re cheaper. The fees are much cheaper. It`s more expensive to invest with an actively managed fund.</p><p>So, what`s the argument to go back for the actively managed funds?</p><p>AGATI: Well, I think really we believe strongly that the mix of active and passive that we employ in portfolios should evolve as the cycle involves. And so, the rush towards passive investing has really been borne out of the cycle that we have been in, really since the financial crisis, where it`s been very long, slow, sluggish growth. And with this as a back drop, we have seen high correlations among stock. So, large swaths of the market moving together.</p><p>Volatility near record lows if not at record lows over extended periods of time. And then with the, you know, highly accommodative monetary policy stance out of the Fed, it`s really made for a back drop of easy access to cheap capital for companies. So, it really hasn`t created a back drop to easily distinguish between winners and losers from a stock picking perspective.</p><p>So, we think all of the trends are reversing course now.</p><p>HERERA: So, are you telling your clients to have a mix of both active and passive?</p><p>AGATI: Yes, absolutely. So we believe strongly that depending on the cycle and also depending on the asset class mix, the mix of active and passive can be different in every client`s portfolio. So, we`re not fully recommending 100 percent passive in portfolios, just as we wouldn`t recommend 100 percent active exposure as well. There really is very much a mix.</p><p>HERERA: All right. On that note, Amanda Agati, thank you. Amanda is with PNC Financials.</p><p>AGATI: Thank you.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Soaring demand helps Delta`s profits fly high, and that`s where we begin tonight`s \"Market Focus\".</p><p>The airline said today that the higher ticket prices and stronger sales for its premium seats nearly offset the rise in its jet fuel costs. Delta also managed to keep a tight lid on other costs as well, leading to an overall earnings beat. And when it comes to rising rates, Delta thinks it stands to benefit as well.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ED BASTIAN, DELTA CEO: The demand we are looking at in 8 percent growth in Q4 in terms of top line growth. So, demand is continuing strong. At Delta, we paid down the vast majority of our debt. We got the investment grade rating back. Our debt level is arguably lowest in our history.</p><p>We also have, still have the pension liability and as interest rates climb, it actually causes the pension liability to come down. So, we`ll probably be a net beneficiary on the balance sheet from a rise in rates.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GRIFFETH: Delta shares took off, up more than 3 percent today to $51.48.</p><p>In the meantime, Lockheed Martin`s F-35 fighter jets have been temporarily grounded. The Pentagon says that fuel tubes are being examined after the Joint Strike Fighter jets crashed last month in South Carolina. The F-35 is the most expensive weapon system in the U.S. military. The inspection of the 320 jets currently in operation is expected to be completed in two days. Lockheed shares were down 3 percent to $326.26.</p><p>HERERA: PayPal is teaming up with Walmart to provide financial services and products to their shared customers. The program will mark the first time PayPal`s mobile app users will be able to take cash out of their PayPal account in a brick and mortar environment. PayPal shares rose a fraction to $75.90. Meanwhile, shares of Walmart were down nearly 2 percent to $93.92.</p><p>RH, the retailer formerly known as Restoration Hardware, plans to buy back up $700 million worth of shares. In a statement, the CEO of the home furnishings company says he believes the stock is undervalued and the repurchase reflects confidence in the business. Shares of RH climbed 10 percent to $118.62.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Walgreens Boots Alliance today became the first Dow component to report its earnings for this season. And while the company is not facing direct headwinds from China or rising interest rates, it is trying to overcome challenges of its own.</p><p>Bertha Coombs takes a look at Walgreen`s mixed quarter.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BERTHA COOMBS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Walgreens earnings results topped analyst expectations despite disappointing revenues, driven in part by strong prescription volume growth. The company says its share of the U.S. prescription market is now about 22 percent, thanks in part to the closing of its deal to buy more than 1,900 Rite Aid (NYSE:RAD) stores earlier this year.</p><p>But the firm`s key chief financial officer admitted the profit margins on specialty drugs were down year over year due to lower reimbursement. Pharmacy benefit managers and insurers have been driving harder bargains on brand name drug prices. The drugstore`s overall retail sales were down from a year ago in part because they purposely deemphasized cigarette sales as they shift their focus.</p><p>Quote: We think we`ve done a good job in terms of shifting the emphasis to become more of a health, beauty, wellness expert, co-COO Alex Gourlay told analysts, adding that there`s a lot more to go.</p><p>To that end, Walgreens is expanding its relationship with Lab Corp. They`re going to be bringing more blood testing to 600 of their stores. It`s a strategic partnership. So, a likely CVS (NYSE:CVS) Aetna (NYSE:AET) merger poised to ramp up competition in drugstore clinics with more integrated offering.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Bertha Coombs, New York.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: Coming up, is there trouble in the Permian?</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRIAN SULLIVAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: I`m Brian Sullivan in the capital of the shale oil boom, Midland, Texas, where the combination of low interest rates and higher oil prices had been great for the industry. But coming up on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, why many are concerned if rates keep rising, all the debt that this industry is based on will come back to haunt it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GRIFFETH: We note it`s your favorite segment. Here`s what to watch for tomorrow.</p><p>Earnings from J.P. Morgan, Citigroup (NYSE:C) and Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) are due. Attention will be paid to loan growth and interest margins. And with the central bank rates and inflation in focus, investors will listen to what a number of Fed officials have to say about the economy tomorrow as well. And we`ll get a fresh read on consumer sentiment which has been a driving force behind spending.</p><p>And that`s what we`re watching for on Friday.</p><p>HERERA: The Postal Service is proposing the biggest stamp price hike in its history, to help shore up its finances. Under the proposal, the cost of a Forever Stamp would rise from 50 cents to 55 cents. The request from the USPS board of governors must be proved by the postal regulatory commission.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Well, starting in January, Social Security recipients will see their biggest pay raise in seven years. Beneficiaries will receive a cost of living adjustment of 2.8 percent for 2019. For the average Social Security recipient, that works out to an increase of $39 a month.</p><p>The annual adjustment is based on changes in the so-called consumer price index. It affects roughly one in five Americans, including disabled veterans and federal retirees.</p><p>HERERA: Oil prices slumped to more than two-week lows as global stock markets fell and the government reported a bigger than expected build in crude inventories. The price of domestic crude settled just above $70 a barrel. That drop in oil prices coupled with rising rates is putting pressure on the country`s shale producers, many of them located in the Permian Basin in Texas.</p><p>And that is where we find Brian Sullivan tonight.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SULLIVAN: Here in West Texas, long timers in the oil and gas business will tell you the industry has really built on three things, rock, people, and money.</p><p>The Permian basin of Texas, the richest oil area in America, has plenty of the first, but always needs more of the other two. And that`s why some people are beginning to question if the great American shale oil boom has reached a peak, so-called good rock is plentiful here. It`s estimated there are tens of billions of barrels of oil just waiting to be sucked out of the ground.</p><p>But to do that you need the oil and gas workers to do the job, something that is increasingly hard to come by in a city 500 miles west of Houston with one of the hottest real estate markets in the country.</p><p>RON GUSEK, LIBERTY OILFIELD SERVICES: Getting people to move here is a difficult challenge. Obviously, real estate, particularly troublesome in that housing is very, very expensive, more expensive here than Houston or Dallas or someplace like that. And so, for younger families trying to come here and start up, that`s a lot to ask.</p><p>SULLIVAN: Locals have told us, some houses will sell in less than 24 hours. Some workers live in hotels where rates can be eye-popping. A hotel like this can run nearly $400 per night.</p><p>But the biggest concern about the shale boom on Wall Street is not people, it is debt. Moody`s estimates that some $200 billion of oil and gas company debt will mature in the next five years, with nearly $100 billion of that alone coming from the exploration and production companies. We asked the head of research at Simmons Piper Jaffray about the impact rising rates could have on the industry.</p><p>BILL HERBERT, SIMMONS PIPER JAFFRAY: Of course they matter. Actually, the collective balance sheet of the upstream sector with regard to EMP and oil services are in much better shape than it`s been in a long time. Companies are living with a much closer I guess proximity of cash flow. And there`s been true capital allocation reform.</p><p>So, effectively, I think that was a germane argument two or three years ago when the companies were living well outside of cash flow. But today, coupled with pretty responsible balance sheets and living within closer proximity of cash flow, I don`t think it`s nearly as alarming as it could have been.</p><p>SULLIVAN: A few years ago, many oil and gas companies had almost no free cash flow. Now, they`ve gotten smarter and they`ve cleaned up their balance sheets. Low interest rates and higher oil prices have been a great combination for the industry. But if rates keep moving higher and oil prices fall due to slowing economy, the booming shale oil industry and the boom town of Midland, Texas, could find itself between a good rock and a hard place.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Brian Sullivan, Midland, Texas.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH: And before we go, another look at the day on Wall Street. Another selloff. The Dow down 545 points. The Nasdaq was down 92. The S&amp;P was down 57.</p><p>And don`t forget, we`ve got those bank earnings starting tomorrow.</p><p>HERERA: Exactly.</p><p>GRIFFETH: It should be very interesting day again.</p><p>HERERA: We will see what Friday holds. We hope you`ll join us for that tomorrow night. In the meantime, that does it for us tonight. I`m Sue Herera. Thanks for joining us.</p><p>GRIFFETH: I`m Bill Griffeth. Have a great evening.

The  Dow sheds 1,300 points in two days.  The trading was volatile.  It was  turbulent, and it was leaving a lot of investors with a lot of questions.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SUE HERERA, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR:  Out of control.  Why the  president isn't holding back in criticism of the Federal Reserve.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">GRIFFETH:  Peak Permian?  As interest rates rise, this is as good as it  gets for the American shale boom perhaps.  It's centered around an industry  loaded with debt.  </p><p>Those stories and much more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for this  Thursday, October the 11th.  </p><p>HERERA:  And good evening, everyone.  And welcome.  </p><p>There is only one way to describe today -- ugly.  And there is only one way  to describe the past two days -- really ugly.  The selling was widespread.   The volume heavy, the market has become gripped by fears of rapidly rising  interest rates, a possible global economic slowdown and high tech  valuations.  </p><p>And according to one tally, this is now the worst start to a fourth quarter  since 2008.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 545 points to 25,052.   The Nasdaq fell 92 points, and the S&amp;P 500 dropped 57.  </p><p>Bob Pisani at the New York Stock Exchange tells us what's behind the  selling and what's getting hit.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BOB PISANI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Wall Street's steep  Wednesday selloff bled over today with the Dow tumbling almost 700 points  at the lows before ending down about 500.  Stocks were all over the map,  moving between gains and losses in very choppy trading.  But rates continue  to be the main driver overall.  The markets looked to the holding steady  until 2:30 Eastern Time when there was a huge burst of selling around some  ETFs in the equity space and treasury bond ETFs, in other words, a rotation  out of stocks and into bonds.  </p><p>What we're seeing is a momentum driven flush-out of some of the big cap  names and there also a couple of sector specific stories driving action  today.  So, for example, bank stocks have been weak early on because of a  weaker read on consumer prices.  They were driven even lower by strong  demand for treasuries at today's 30-year bond auction, all of which pushed  bond yields down to session lows, generally negative for banks.  </p><p>And energy lagged on the day, falling on a bigger build up than expected in  crude oil inventories.  And that was an issue for all the energy stocks.   Tomorrow will be a key day to watch with bank earnings kicking off,  starting with J.P. Morgan and another big read on consumer sentiment.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Bob Pisani at the New York Stock Exchange.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Now with all of the selling, we asked Mike Santoli to look for  any clues about when the downward pressure might ease up.  Here is what he  found.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MIKE SANTOLI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  After a sharp and  jarring market drop, investors quickly move to asses the damage and search  for signs of stability.  And this process is now underway following the  biggest two-day tumble since February.  </p><p>The damage has been swift and pervasive across the market, and the downside  momentum has not yet let up.  Traders are noting that the market has  quickly become oversold, which means the indexes are stretched far below  their recent trend.  </p><p>Along with the fact that the vast majority of stocks are down more than 10  percent from the high in a short time, this can ultimately set the stage  for a bounce simply as a technical matter.  But selloffs can feed on  themselves as traders seek shelter from a more treacherous market action.  </p><p>One indicator getting a lot of attention is known as the volatility index,  a measure of how urgently traders are buying protective options.  This  index has surged from 15 to the high 20s this week and elevated level, but  while the low extremes reached in February that marked the correction low.   Veteran traders like to see this volatility gauge retreat dramatically from  a peak over the course of a trading session, often a sign the market is  calming itself.  </p><p>Investor sentiment has been turned cautious as well.  Typically a nasty  decline spreads worry which also can set the scene for an eventual  recovery.  One clue to end this market might find its footing is to whether  the majority of stocks participate in any relief rallies that pop up.   While the skid in the market got rolling with a move to new multiyear highs  in bond yields, it continued after yield stock going up on Thursday,  suggesting it had became a violent rotation out of some of the best  performing tech, industrial and consumer stocks as fears of rising rates, a  possible profit slowdown and unsettled global markets flared up.  </p><p>There is no reliable way to call an end to these ugly market episodes.  But  one consolation might be that the action is not clearly based on evidence  of a weakening economy.  This is mostly a stock market event tied to  valuations and investor risk appetites for now, which means the market  itself will have to tell us when these painful adjustments might be nearing  an end.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Mike Santoli.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  And now to the Fed, which is at the center of the concern over  interest rates.  Today, the president of the Kansas City Fed said the  central bank will likely continue to raise interest rates.  Esther George  says a tightening labor market could lead inflation to accelerate over the  next few years, though she had the pace remains a matter of discussion.  </p><p>Separately, a new report showed slowing inflation last month.  The consumer  price index rose just 0.1 percent, which was less than expected.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  And the president as we have been reporting has been a vocal  critic of the Fed's monetary policy.  He recently called the Fed's recent  stance on interest rates too aggressive.  But is it?  </p><p>Steve Liesman reports.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>STEVE LIESMAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  The president of the  United States not holding back in his criticism of the Federal Reserve's  interest rate hiking policies, blaming the recent stock market selloff  directly on the central bank.  </p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I think the Fed is out of  control.  I think what they're do something wrong.  I think the Fed is far  too stringent and making a mistake.  And it's not right.  </p><p>And it's -- despite that we are doing very well.  But it's not necessary in  my opinion.  And I think I know about it better than they do, believe me.  </p><p>LIESMAN:  So, is the Fed crazy?  Before answering, it's worth pointing out  three of the four members of the board of governors chair and two vice  chairs were all appointed by President Trump.  </p><p>Beyond that, it's worth looking at how the Fed changed interest rate policy  in the past year, largely in response to the president's own policies.   Last year, the Fed forecast 2 percent inflation for 2018, 2 percent growth  and 4.1 percent unemployment rate.  The median forecast as a result looked  for the Fed to raise rates by about three quarters of a point to 2 percent.  </p><p>So, what happened?  Inflation came in right on target, but growth surge and  unemployment came in well below the forecast.  That is, the economy did  better than the Fed expected.  </p><p>So, the Fed changed its outlook.  It now forecasts a full percentage point  rate rise this year compared to 3/4 of a point or just 25 basis points in  the prior forecasts.  </p><p>Is that crazy?  After a huge tax cut, a surge in the deficit and series of  price-raising tariffs, most economists say the Fed is responding  appropriately to the change in the economy.  </p><p>JOHN RYDING, RDQ ECONOMICS:  There's a rate hike in does in its forecast.   It has three rate hikes next year.  My guess is actually the inflation  numbers will push the Fed to four.  But none of that is a disaster as long  as companies generate profits.  </p><p>LIESMAN:  The danger is if the economy doesn't keep up its momentum.  In  that case, the Fed's forecast could be too aggressive.  But it can always  dial back its plan to raise rates if the economy weakens.  That's not  crazy.  That's monetary policy.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Steve Liesman.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Joining us now to help put all of this into perspective.   Joining us tonight is Andres Garcia.  He's founder and CEO of Zoe  Financial.</p><p>Andres, always good to see you.  Thanks for joining us tonight.  </p><p>ANDRES GARCIA, ZOE FINANCIAL FOUNDER &amp; CEO:  Thanks for having me.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  So, the selloff this week essentially wiped out gains we've seen  over the last three months in the stock market here in the U.S.  So, now  what?  What -- put this in perspective for us.  </p><p>GARCIA:  OK.  So, the first thing that I would mention is we're still what  5 percent from all all-time highs, right?  So, let's take a deep breath.  </p><p>Another thing that's important to keep in mind is we have had 23  corrections that are 5 percent or more since March of 2009.  So, this is  not -- this is not -- is not an everyday event but is not totally abnormal.  </p><p>I'll give you one more stat.  If you go back 39 years, on average, if you  look at the worst intra year drop, it's 13 percent.  So, even if we see  this, you know, 5, 6 percent correction turn to the 10 percent correction,  that is still considered normal when we look at the last four decades,  right?  That's important to keep in mind.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  OK.</p><p>GARCIA:  I don't know what's happening next.  And I think that's important  to keep in mind as well.  Nobody does.  So, if it's s out of your control,  try to basically not to focus too much on the headlines and stay focus on  the long-term.  </p><p>HERERA:  All right.  So, what is the best advise then for our viewers who  are watching tonight?  Because, I mean, interest rates have been edging up  gradually, but all of a sudden, it seems to be what the market is focused  on.  </p><p>So, if you have a long-term horizon what is the best strategy to keep all  this volatility in perspective.  </p><p>GARCIA:  Yes, I think that's the key.  </p><p>And I'll say one more thing about the interest rates as well.  Let's not  forget that interest rates, long-term interest rates and short-term  interest rates have been rising a while.  In fact, long-term interest rates  have been rising since last summer.  And last time I checked, the S&amp;P 500  has been up since then.  </p><p>The other kind of headline that I see is that trade wars are creating this.   Last time I check, trade wars have been ongoing this year, and the market  is still up 5 percent and it was up 10 percent when this trade war  situation was pretty rough.  </p><p>But going back to your question, what is under people's control is how much  they save, do they invest, and do they have a plan for the long-term?   That's under their control.  </p><p>And then the last thing under their control is how they react to short-term  volatility.  If you keep control of those things in the long-term, you'll  be okay.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  Very quickly, technology stocks have been the darling of this  market.  The FANG stocks have been getting a lot of the attention in the  last couple of years.  And they're leading this market lower.  </p><p>What do you do with those guys?  </p><p>GARCIA:  I'm not going to comment on short-term volatility, on tech stocks.   What I would say is that their volatility in general tends to be much  higher than the overall market.  So, people forget that they were up 50, 60  percent.  They feel it more when they're down 15 or 20, right? </p><p>GRIFFETH:  Right.</p><p>GARCIA:  So, higher risk, higher return, and that's the essence what you're  getting when you're investing in those types of stocks.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  One of the sacrosanct laws of Wall Street, the higher the risk,  the higher gains.</p><p>Andres Garcia with Zoe Financial -- always good to see you.  Thanks for  joining us tonight.  </p><p>GARCIA:  Thanks for having me.</p><p>HERERA:  It is time to take a look at some of today's upgrades and  downgrades.  </p><p>Lear (NYSE:LEA) was upgraded to buy from neutral at Goldman Sachs  (NYSE:GS).  The analyst cites solid free cash flow and the potential to  gain market share.  The price target is $195.  Shares of Lear (NYSE:LEA)  rose nearly 2 percent to $137.54.  </p><p>The price target for shares of \"The New York Times (NYSE:NYT)\" was  increased to $32 at J.P. Morgan.  The analyst there expects the upcoming  elections to help drive its paper's digital subscriptions.  The firm  maintains the overweight rating.  \"The New York Times (NYSE:NYT)\" shares  rose a fraction to $24.84.  </p><p>And J.P. Morgan cut the target on Abercrombie &amp; Fitch (NYSE:ANF) to $16.   The analyst cites potential margin pressure as a result of tariffs and  higher wages.  The rating remains underweight.  The shares finished down  more than 5 percent to $17.99.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  Still ahead, tipping point?  Money had been flowing into passive  investments like ETFs and mutual funds.  But is that starting to shift?  </p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>HERERA:  A group of senators are not pleased with Google (NASDAQ:GOOG).   Today, they sent a letter to the company criticizing it for failing to  disclose the data vulnerability that affected hundreds of thousands of  Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) Plus users.  Senator Thune said he was disappointed  that Google's chief privacy officer testified before the Commerce Committee  a few weeks ago and failed to provide information on that breach.  Google  (NASDAQ:GOOG) disclosed the breach after it was reported by the \"Wall  Street Journal.\" </p><p>GRIFFETH:  And as we have been reporting, of course, the Nasdaq selloff has  been sharp.  The index is off more than 9 percent from its most recent  highs into August.  And, of course, it is loaded with some very popular  technology stocks, which begs the question, will this group that led the  market higher now lead it lower?  </p><p>Josh Lipton looks at what may be next.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JOSH LIPTON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  High-fliers have been  losing altitude.  That's the story of big tech's recent performance in the  stock market that has seen names like Alphabet, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and  Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) fall sharply from their recent highs.  </p><p>Many on Wall Street say the reason for the decline is simple.  When there  is a broad, sharp selloff investors tend to sell what has been performing  the best.  And that's especially true when the winners are some of the  biggest, most liquid names in the market.  But a major concern is whether  there is a broader rotation happening from sectors with significant growth  potential to those that appear cheaper and more defensive.  If that's the  case, it would be bad news for tech in the quarters ahead.  </p><p>TIMOTHY LESKO, GRANITE INVESTMENT ADVISORS:  Right now, you have a lot of  other crosswinds that are scaring investors.  So, this may last a little  while longer as people get comfortable with what goes on in tariffs,  inflation and rates.  </p><p>LIPTON:  Still there are tech bulls on Wall Street.  For example, the team  at CFRA Research remains bullish on the tech sector.  Next year, they  estimate earnings growth of 11 percent and revenue growth of 9 percent,  both better than the broader market.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Josh Lipton, San Francisco.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  So, with all of that selling on Wall Street and money flowing out  of passive investments like ETFs and mutual funds, is this setting the  stage for the comeback of active investing?  </p><p>Amanda Agati is the co-chief investment strategist at PNC Financial and she  is here to share her thoughts with us.  </p><p>Good to see you, Amanda.  Welcome.</p><p>AMANDA AGATI, PNC FINANCIAL CO-CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST:  Thank you for  having me.  </p><p>HERERA:  You make the points in the  notes that I'm reading here that you  are starting to see that, and it's been going on for a little bit now.  </p><p>AGATI:  Well, yes, absolutely.  We believe very strongly that a comeback or  a resurgence in active management is already occurring.  It's not just  precipitated by the last couple of days of spike in volatility in the  markets.  </p><p>And actually, the backdrop for active management has been evolving and  improving basically over the course of 2018.  So, yes, we think it's  already underway and likely to pick up steam.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  But you know why people were rushing to the passive investments,  the exchange traded funds, the index funds, they're cheaper.  The fees are  much cheaper.  It's more expensive to invest with an actively managed fund.  </p><p>So, what's the argument to go back for the actively managed funds?  </p><p>AGATI:  Well, I think really we believe strongly that the mix of active and  passive that we employ in portfolios should evolve as the cycle involves.   And so, the rush towards passive investing has really been borne out of the  cycle that we have been in, really since the financial crisis, where it's  been very long, slow, sluggish growth.  And with this as a back drop, we  have seen high correlations among stock.  So, large swaths of the market  moving together.  </p><p>Volatility near record lows if not at record lows over extended periods of  time.  And then with the, you know, highly accommodative monetary policy  stance out of the Fed, it's really made for a back drop of easy access to  cheap capital for companies.  So, it really hasn't created a back drop to  easily distinguish between winners and losers from a stock picking  perspective.  </p><p>So, we think all of the trends are reversing course now.  </p><p>HERERA:  So, are you telling your clients to have a mix of both active and  passive?  </p><p>AGATI:  Yes, absolutely.  So we believe strongly that depending on the  cycle and also depending on the asset class mix, the mix of active and  passive can be different in every client's portfolio.  So, we're not fully  recommending 100 percent passive in portfolios, just as we wouldn't  recommend 100 percent active exposure as well.  There really is very much a  mix.  </p><p>HERERA:  All right.  On that note, Amanda Agati, thank you.  Amanda is with  PNC Financials.  </p><p>AGATI:  Thank you.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  Soaring demand helps Delta's profits fly high, and that's where  we begin tonight's \"Market Focus\".  </p><p>The airline said today that the higher ticket prices and stronger sales for  its premium seats nearly offset the rise in its jet fuel costs.  Delta also  managed to keep a tight lid on other costs as well, leading to an overall  earnings beat.  And when it comes to rising rates, Delta thinks it stands  to benefit as well.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ED BASTIAN, DELTA CEO:  The demand we are looking at in 8 percent growth in  Q4 in terms of top line growth.  So, demand is continuing strong.  At  Delta, we paid down the vast majority of our debt.  We got the investment  grade rating back.  Our debt level is arguably lowest in our history.  </p><p>We also have, still have the pension liability and as interest rates climb,  it actually causes the pension liability to come down.  So, we'll probably  be a net beneficiary on the balance sheet from a rise in rates.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Delta shares took off, up more than 3 percent today to $51.48.  </p><p>In the meantime, Lockheed Martin's F-35 fighter jets have been temporarily  grounded.  The Pentagon says that fuel tubes are being examined after the  Joint Strike Fighter jets crashed last month in South Carolina.  The F-35  is the most expensive weapon system in the U.S. military.  The inspection  of the 320 jets currently in operation is expected to be completed in two  days.  Lockheed shares were down 3 percent to $326.26.  </p><p>HERERA:  PayPal is teaming up with Walmart to provide financial services  and products to their shared customers.  The program will mark the first  time PayPal's mobile app users will be able to take cash out of their  PayPal account in a brick and mortar environment.  PayPal shares rose a  fraction to $75.90.  Meanwhile, shares of Walmart were down nearly 2  percent to $93.92.</p><p>RH, the retailer formerly known as Restoration Hardware, plans to buy back  up $700 million worth of shares.  In a statement, the CEO of the home  furnishings company says he believes the stock is undervalued and the  repurchase reflects confidence in the business.  Shares of RH climbed 10  percent to $118.62.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  Walgreens Boots Alliance today became the first Dow component to  report its earnings for this season.  And while the company is not facing  direct headwinds from China or rising interest rates, it is trying to  overcome challenges of its own.  </p><p>Bertha Coombs takes a look at Walgreen's mixed quarter.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BERTHA COOMBS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Walgreens earnings  results topped analyst expectations despite disappointing revenues, driven  in part by strong prescription volume growth.  The company says its share  of the U.S. prescription market is now about 22 percent, thanks in part to  the closing of its deal to buy more than 1,900 Rite Aid (NYSE:RAD) stores  earlier this year.  </p><p>But the firm's key chief financial officer admitted the profit margins on  specialty drugs were down year over year due to lower reimbursement.   Pharmacy benefit managers and insurers have been driving harder bargains on  brand name drug prices.  The drugstore's overall retail sales were down  from a year ago in part because they purposely deemphasized cigarette sales  as they shift their focus.  </p><p>Quote: We think we've done a good job in terms of shifting the emphasis to  become more of a health, beauty, wellness expert, co-COO Alex Gourlay told  analysts, adding that there's a lot more to go.  </p><p>To that end, Walgreens is expanding its relationship with Lab Corp.   They're going to be bringing more blood testing to 600 of their stores.   It's a strategic partnership.  So, a likely CVS (NYSE:CVS) Aetna (NYSE:AET)  merger poised to ramp up competition in drugstore clinics with more  integrated offering.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Bertha Coombs, New York.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  Coming up, is there trouble in the Permian?  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRIAN SULLIVAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  I'm Brian Sullivan  in the capital of the shale oil boom, Midland, Texas, where the combination  of low interest rates and higher oil prices had been great for the  industry.  But coming up on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, why many are concerned  if rates keep rising, all the debt that this industry is based on will come  back to haunt it.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  We note it's your favorite segment.  Here's what to watch for  tomorrow.  </p><p>Earnings from J.P. Morgan, Citigroup (NYSE:C) and Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC)  are due.  Attention will be paid to loan growth and interest margins.  And  with the central bank rates and inflation in focus, investors will listen  to what a number of Fed officials have to say about the economy tomorrow as  well.  And we'll get a fresh read on consumer sentiment which has been a  driving force behind spending.  </p><p>And that's what we're watching for on Friday.  </p><p>HERERA:  The Postal Service is proposing the biggest stamp price hike in  its history, to help shore up its finances.  Under the proposal, the cost  of a Forever Stamp would rise from 50 cents to 55 cents.  The request from  the USPS board of governors must be proved by the postal regulatory  commission.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  Well, starting in January, Social Security recipients will see  their biggest pay raise in seven years.  Beneficiaries will receive a cost  of living adjustment of 2.8 percent for 2019.  For the average Social  Security recipient, that works out to an increase of $39 a month.  </p><p>The annual adjustment is based on changes in the so-called consumer price  index.  It affects roughly one in five Americans, including disabled  veterans and federal retirees.  </p><p>HERERA:  Oil prices slumped to more than two-week lows as global stock  markets fell and the government reported a bigger than expected build in  crude inventories.  The price of domestic crude settled just above $70 a  barrel.  That drop in oil prices coupled with rising rates is putting  pressure on the country's shale producers, many of them located in the  Permian Basin in Texas.  </p><p>And that is where we find Brian Sullivan tonight.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SULLIVAN:  Here in West Texas, long timers in the oil and gas business will  tell you the industry has really built on three things, rock, people, and  money.  </p><p>The Permian basin of Texas, the richest oil area in America, has plenty of  the first, but always needs more of the other two.  And that's why some  people are beginning to question if the great American shale oil boom has  reached a peak, so-called good rock is plentiful here.  It's estimated  there are tens of billions of barrels of oil just waiting to be sucked out  of the ground.  </p><p>But to do that you need the oil and gas workers to do the job, something  that is increasingly hard to come by in a city 500 miles west of Houston  with one of the hottest real estate markets in the country.  </p><p>RON GUSEK, LIBERTY OILFIELD SERVICES:  Getting people to move here is a  difficult challenge.  Obviously, real estate, particularly troublesome in  that housing is very, very expensive, more expensive here than Houston or  Dallas or someplace like that.  And so, for younger families trying to come  here and start up, that's a lot to ask.  </p><p>SULLIVAN:  Locals have told us, some houses will sell in less than 24  hours.  Some workers live in hotels where rates can be eye-popping.  A  hotel like this can run nearly $400 per night.</p><p>But the biggest concern about the shale boom on Wall Street is not people,  it is debt.  Moody's estimates that some  $200 billion of oil and gas  company debt will mature in the next five years, with nearly $100 billion  of that alone coming from the exploration and production companies.  We  asked the head of research at Simmons Piper Jaffray about the impact rising  rates could have on the industry.  </p><p>BILL HERBERT, SIMMONS PIPER JAFFRAY:  Of course they matter.  Actually, the  collective balance sheet of the upstream sector with regard to EMP and oil  services are in much better shape than it's been in a long time.  Companies  are living with a much closer I guess proximity of cash flow.  And there's  been true capital allocation reform.  </p><p>So, effectively, I think that was a germane argument two or three years ago  when the companies were living well outside of cash flow.  But today,  coupled with pretty responsible balance sheets and living within closer  proximity of cash flow, I don't think it's nearly as alarming as it could  have been.  </p><p>SULLIVAN:  A few years ago, many oil and gas companies had almost no free  cash flow.  Now, they've gotten smarter and they've cleaned up their  balance sheets.  Low interest rates and higher oil prices have been a great  combination for the industry.  But if rates keep moving higher and oil  prices fall due to slowing economy, the booming shale oil industry and the  boom town of Midland, Texas, could find itself between a good rock and a  hard place.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Brian Sullivan, Midland, Texas.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  And before we go, another look at the day on Wall Street.   Another selloff.  The Dow down 545 points.  The Nasdaq was down 92.  The  S&amp;P was down 57.  </p><p>And don't forget, we've got those bank earnings starting tomorrow.  </p><p>HERERA:  Exactly.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  It should be very interesting day again.  </p><p>HERERA:  We will see what Friday holds.  We hope you'll join us for that  tomorrow night.  In the meantime, that does it for us tonight.  I'm Sue  Herera.  Thanks for joining us.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  I'm Bill Griffeth.  Have a great evening.

The  Dow sheds 1,300 points in two days.  The trading was volatile.  It was  turbulent, and it was leaving a lot of investors with a lot of questions.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SUE HERERA, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR:  Out of control.  Why the  president isn't holding back in criticism of the Federal Reserve.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">GRIFFETH:  Peak Permian?  As interest rates rise, this is as good as it  gets for the American shale boom perhaps.  It's centered around an industry  loaded with debt.  </p><p>Those stories and much more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for this  Thursday, October the 11th.  </p><p>HERERA:  And good evening, everyone.  And welcome.  </p><p>There is only one way to describe today -- ugly.  And there is only one way  to describe the past two days -- really ugly.  The selling was widespread.   The volume heavy, the market has become gripped by fears of rapidly rising  interest rates, a possible global economic slowdown and high tech  valuations.  </p><p>And according to one tally, this is now the worst start to a fourth quarter  since 2008.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 545 points to 25,052.   The Nasdaq fell 92 points, and the S&amp;P 500 dropped 57.  </p><p>Bob Pisani at the New York Stock Exchange tells us what's behind the  selling and what's getting hit.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BOB PISANI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Wall Street's steep  Wednesday selloff bled over today with the Dow tumbling almost 700 points  at the lows before ending down about 500.  Stocks were all over the map,  moving between gains and losses in very choppy trading.  But rates continue  to be the main driver overall.  The markets looked to the holding steady  until 2:30 Eastern Time when there was a huge burst of selling around some  ETFs in the equity space and treasury bond ETFs, in other words, a rotation  out of stocks and into bonds.  </p><p>What we're seeing is a momentum driven flush-out of some of the big cap  names and there also a couple of sector specific stories driving action  today.  So, for example, bank stocks have been weak early on because of a  weaker read on consumer prices.  They were driven even lower by strong  demand for treasuries at today's 30-year bond auction, all of which pushed  bond yields down to session lows, generally negative for banks.  </p><p>And energy lagged on the day, falling on a bigger build up than expected in  crude oil inventories.  And that was an issue for all the energy stocks.   Tomorrow will be a key day to watch with bank earnings kicking off,  starting with J.P. Morgan and another big read on consumer sentiment.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Bob Pisani at the New York Stock Exchange.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Now with all of the selling, we asked Mike Santoli to look for  any clues about when the downward pressure might ease up.  Here is what he  found.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MIKE SANTOLI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  After a sharp and  jarring market drop, investors quickly move to asses the damage and search  for signs of stability.  And this process is now underway following the  biggest two-day tumble since February.  </p><p>The damage has been swift and pervasive across the market, and the downside  momentum has not yet let up.  Traders are noting that the market has  quickly become oversold, which means the indexes are stretched far below  their recent trend.  </p><p>Along with the fact that the vast majority of stocks are down more than 10  percent from the high in a short time, this can ultimately set the stage  for a bounce simply as a technical matter.  But selloffs can feed on  themselves as traders seek shelter from a more treacherous market action.  </p><p>One indicator getting a lot of attention is known as the volatility index,  a measure of how urgently traders are buying protective options.  This  index has surged from 15 to the high 20s this week and elevated level, but  while the low extremes reached in February that marked the correction low.   Veteran traders like to see this volatility gauge retreat dramatically from  a peak over the course of a trading session, often a sign the market is  calming itself.  </p><p>Investor sentiment has been turned cautious as well.  Typically a nasty  decline spreads worry which also can set the scene for an eventual  recovery.  One clue to end this market might find its footing is to whether  the majority of stocks participate in any relief rallies that pop up.   While the skid in the market got rolling with a move to new multiyear highs  in bond yields, it continued after yield stock going up on Thursday,  suggesting it had became a violent rotation out of some of the best  performing tech, industrial and consumer stocks as fears of rising rates, a  possible profit slowdown and unsettled global markets flared up.  </p><p>There is no reliable way to call an end to these ugly market episodes.  But  one consolation might be that the action is not clearly based on evidence  of a weakening economy.  This is mostly a stock market event tied to  valuations and investor risk appetites for now, which means the market  itself will have to tell us when these painful adjustments might be nearing  an end.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Mike Santoli.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  And now to the Fed, which is at the center of the concern over  interest rates.  Today, the president of the Kansas City Fed said the  central bank will likely continue to raise interest rates.  Esther George  says a tightening labor market could lead inflation to accelerate over the  next few years, though she had the pace remains a matter of discussion.  </p><p>Separately, a new report showed slowing inflation last month.  The consumer  price index rose just 0.1 percent, which was less than expected.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  And the president as we have been reporting has been a vocal  critic of the Fed's monetary policy.  He recently called the Fed's recent  stance on interest rates too aggressive.  But is it?  </p><p>Steve Liesman reports.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>STEVE LIESMAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  The president of the  United States not holding back in his criticism of the Federal Reserve's  interest rate hiking policies, blaming the recent stock market selloff  directly on the central bank.  </p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I think the Fed is out of  control.  I think what they're do something wrong.  I think the Fed is far  too stringent and making a mistake.  And it's not right.  </p><p>And it's -- despite that we are doing very well.  But it's not necessary in  my opinion.  And I think I know about it better than they do, believe me.  </p><p>LIESMAN:  So, is the Fed crazy?  Before answering, it's worth pointing out  three of the four members of the board of governors chair and two vice  chairs were all appointed by President Trump.  </p><p>Beyond that, it's worth looking at how the Fed changed interest rate policy  in the past year, largely in response to the president's own policies.   Last year, the Fed forecast 2 percent inflation for 2018, 2 percent growth  and 4.1 percent unemployment rate.  The median forecast as a result looked  for the Fed to raise rates by about three quarters of a point to 2 percent.  </p><p>So, what happened?  Inflation came in right on target, but growth surge and  unemployment came in well below the forecast.  That is, the economy did  better than the Fed expected.  </p><p>So, the Fed changed its outlook.  It now forecasts a full percentage point  rate rise this year compared to 3/4 of a point or just 25 basis points in  the prior forecasts.  </p><p>Is that crazy?  After a huge tax cut, a surge in the deficit and series of  price-raising tariffs, most economists say the Fed is responding  appropriately to the change in the economy.  </p><p>JOHN RYDING, RDQ ECONOMICS:  There's a rate hike in does in its forecast.   It has three rate hikes next year.  My guess is actually the inflation  numbers will push the Fed to four.  But none of that is a disaster as long  as companies generate profits.  </p><p>LIESMAN:  The danger is if the economy doesn't keep up its momentum.  In  that case, the Fed's forecast could be too aggressive.  But it can always  dial back its plan to raise rates if the economy weakens.  That's not  crazy.  That's monetary policy.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Steve Liesman.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Joining us now to help put all of this into perspective.   Joining us tonight is Andres Garcia.  He's founder and CEO of Zoe  Financial.</p><p>Andres, always good to see you.  Thanks for joining us tonight.  </p><p>ANDRES GARCIA, ZOE FINANCIAL FOUNDER &amp; CEO:  Thanks for having me.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  So, the selloff this week essentially wiped out gains we've seen  over the last three months in the stock market here in the U.S.  So, now  what?  What -- put this in perspective for us.  </p><p>GARCIA:  OK.  So, the first thing that I would mention is we're still what  5 percent from all all-time highs, right?  So, let's take a deep breath.  </p><p>Another thing that's important to keep in mind is we have had 23  corrections that are 5 percent or more since March of 2009.  So, this is  not -- this is not -- is not an everyday event but is not totally abnormal.  </p><p>I'll give you one more stat.  If you go back 39 years, on average, if you  look at the worst intra year drop, it's 13 percent.  So, even if we see  this, you know, 5, 6 percent correction turn to the 10 percent correction,  that is still considered normal when we look at the last four decades,  right?  That's important to keep in mind.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  OK.</p><p>GARCIA:  I don't know what's happening next.  And I think that's important  to keep in mind as well.  Nobody does.  So, if it's s out of your control,  try to basically not to focus too much on the headlines and stay focus on  the long-term.  </p><p>HERERA:  All right.  So, what is the best advise then for our viewers who  are watching tonight?  Because, I mean, interest rates have been edging up  gradually, but all of a sudden, it seems to be what the market is focused  on.  </p><p>So, if you have a long-term horizon what is the best strategy to keep all  this volatility in perspective.  </p><p>GARCIA:  Yes, I think that's the key.  </p><p>And I'll say one more thing about the interest rates as well.  Let's not  forget that interest rates, long-term interest rates and short-term  interest rates have been rising a while.  In fact, long-term interest rates  have been rising since last summer.  And last time I checked, the S&amp;P 500  has been up since then.  </p><p>The other kind of headline that I see is that trade wars are creating this.   Last time I check, trade wars have been ongoing this year, and the market  is still up 5 percent and it was up 10 percent when this trade war  situation was pretty rough.  </p><p>But going back to your question, what is under people's control is how much  they save, do they invest, and do they have a plan for the long-term?   That's under their control.  </p><p>And then the last thing under their control is how they react to short-term  volatility.  If you keep control of those things in the long-term, you'll  be okay.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  Very quickly, technology stocks have been the darling of this  market.  The FANG stocks have been getting a lot of the attention in the  last couple of years.  And they're leading this market lower.  </p><p>What do you do with those guys?  </p><p>GARCIA:  I'm not going to comment on short-term volatility, on tech stocks.   What I would say is that their volatility in general tends to be much  higher than the overall market.  So, people forget that they were up 50, 60  percent.  They feel it more when they're down 15 or 20, right? </p><p>GRIFFETH:  Right.</p><p>GARCIA:  So, higher risk, higher return, and that's the essence what you're  getting when you're investing in those types of stocks.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  One of the sacrosanct laws of Wall Street, the higher the risk,  the higher gains.</p><p>Andres Garcia with Zoe Financial -- always good to see you.  Thanks for  joining us tonight.  </p><p>GARCIA:  Thanks for having me.</p><p>HERERA:  It is time to take a look at some of today's upgrades and  downgrades.  </p><p>Lear (NYSE:LEA) was upgraded to buy from neutral at Goldman Sachs  (NYSE:GS).  The analyst cites solid free cash flow and the potential to  gain market share.  The price target is $195.  Shares of Lear (NYSE:LEA)  rose nearly 2 percent to $137.54.  </p><p>The price target for shares of \"The New York Times (NYSE:NYT)\" was  increased to $32 at J.P. Morgan.  The analyst there expects the upcoming  elections to help drive its paper's digital subscriptions.  The firm  maintains the overweight rating.  \"The New York Times (NYSE:NYT)\" shares  rose a fraction to $24.84.  </p><p>And J.P. Morgan cut the target on Abercrombie &amp; Fitch (NYSE:ANF) to $16.   The analyst cites potential margin pressure as a result of tariffs and  higher wages.  The rating remains underweight.  The shares finished down  more than 5 percent to $17.99.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  Still ahead, tipping point?  Money had been flowing into passive  investments like ETFs and mutual funds.  But is that starting to shift?  </p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>HERERA:  A group of senators are not pleased with Google (NASDAQ:GOOG).   Today, they sent a letter to the company criticizing it for failing to  disclose the data vulnerability that affected hundreds of thousands of  Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) Plus users.  Senator Thune said he was disappointed  that Google's chief privacy officer testified before the Commerce Committee  a few weeks ago and failed to provide information on that breach.  Google  (NASDAQ:GOOG) disclosed the breach after it was reported by the \"Wall  Street Journal.\" </p><p>GRIFFETH:  And as we have been reporting, of course, the Nasdaq selloff has  been sharp.  The index is off more than 9 percent from its most recent  highs into August.  And, of course, it is loaded with some very popular  technology stocks, which begs the question, will this group that led the  market higher now lead it lower?  </p><p>Josh Lipton looks at what may be next.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JOSH LIPTON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  High-fliers have been  losing altitude.  That's the story of big tech's recent performance in the  stock market that has seen names like Alphabet, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and  Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) fall sharply from their recent highs.  </p><p>Many on Wall Street say the reason for the decline is simple.  When there  is a broad, sharp selloff investors tend to sell what has been performing  the best.  And that's especially true when the winners are some of the  biggest, most liquid names in the market.  But a major concern is whether  there is a broader rotation happening from sectors with significant growth  potential to those that appear cheaper and more defensive.  If that's the  case, it would be bad news for tech in the quarters ahead.  </p><p>TIMOTHY LESKO, GRANITE INVESTMENT ADVISORS:  Right now, you have a lot of  other crosswinds that are scaring investors.  So, this may last a little  while longer as people get comfortable with what goes on in tariffs,  inflation and rates.  </p><p>LIPTON:  Still there are tech bulls on Wall Street.  For example, the team  at CFRA Research remains bullish on the tech sector.  Next year, they  estimate earnings growth of 11 percent and revenue growth of 9 percent,  both better than the broader market.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Josh Lipton, San Francisco.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  So, with all of that selling on Wall Street and money flowing out  of passive investments like ETFs and mutual funds, is this setting the  stage for the comeback of active investing?  </p><p>Amanda Agati is the co-chief investment strategist at PNC Financial and she  is here to share her thoughts with us.  </p><p>Good to see you, Amanda.  Welcome.</p><p>AMANDA AGATI, PNC FINANCIAL CO-CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST:  Thank you for  having me.  </p><p>HERERA:  You make the points in the  notes that I'm reading here that you  are starting to see that, and it's been going on for a little bit now.  </p><p>AGATI:  Well, yes, absolutely.  We believe very strongly that a comeback or  a resurgence in active management is already occurring.  It's not just  precipitated by the last couple of days of spike in volatility in the  markets.  </p><p>And actually, the backdrop for active management has been evolving and  improving basically over the course of 2018.  So, yes, we think it's  already underway and likely to pick up steam.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  But you know why people were rushing to the passive investments,  the exchange traded funds, the index funds, they're cheaper.  The fees are  much cheaper.  It's more expensive to invest with an actively managed fund.  </p><p>So, what's the argument to go back for the actively managed funds?  </p><p>AGATI:  Well, I think really we believe strongly that the mix of active and  passive that we employ in portfolios should evolve as the cycle involves.   And so, the rush towards passive investing has really been borne out of the  cycle that we have been in, really since the financial crisis, where it's  been very long, slow, sluggish growth.  And with this as a back drop, we  have seen high correlations among stock.  So, large swaths of the market  moving together.  </p><p>Volatility near record lows if not at record lows over extended periods of  time.  And then with the, you know, highly accommodative monetary policy  stance out of the Fed, it's really made for a back drop of easy access to  cheap capital for companies.  So, it really hasn't created a back drop to  easily distinguish between winners and losers from a stock picking  perspective.  </p><p>So, we think all of the trends are reversing course now.  </p><p>HERERA:  So, are you telling your clients to have a mix of both active and  passive?  </p><p>AGATI:  Yes, absolutely.  So we believe strongly that depending on the  cycle and also depending on the asset class mix, the mix of active and  passive can be different in every client's portfolio.  So, we're not fully  recommending 100 percent passive in portfolios, just as we wouldn't  recommend 100 percent active exposure as well.  There really is very much a  mix.  </p><p>HERERA:  All right.  On that note, Amanda Agati, thank you.  Amanda is with  PNC Financials.  </p><p>AGATI:  Thank you.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  Soaring demand helps Delta's profits fly high, and that's where  we begin tonight's \"Market Focus\".  </p><p>The airline said today that the higher ticket prices and stronger sales for  its premium seats nearly offset the rise in its jet fuel costs.  Delta also  managed to keep a tight lid on other costs as well, leading to an overall  earnings beat.  And when it comes to rising rates, Delta thinks it stands  to benefit as well.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ED BASTIAN, DELTA CEO:  The demand we are looking at in 8 percent growth in  Q4 in terms of top line growth.  So, demand is continuing strong.  At  Delta, we paid down the vast majority of our debt.  We got the investment  grade rating back.  Our debt level is arguably lowest in our history.  </p><p>We also have, still have the pension liability and as interest rates climb,  it actually causes the pension liability to come down.  So, we'll probably  be a net beneficiary on the balance sheet from a rise in rates.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Delta shares took off, up more than 3 percent today to $51.48.  </p><p>In the meantime, Lockheed Martin's F-35 fighter jets have been temporarily  grounded.  The Pentagon says that fuel tubes are being examined after the  Joint Strike Fighter jets crashed last month in South Carolina.  The F-35  is the most expensive weapon system in the U.S. military.  The inspection  of the 320 jets currently in operation is expected to be completed in two  days.  Lockheed shares were down 3 percent to $326.26.  </p><p>HERERA:  PayPal is teaming up with Walmart to provide financial services  and products to their shared customers.  The program will mark the first  time PayPal's mobile app users will be able to take cash out of their  PayPal account in a brick and mortar environment.  PayPal shares rose a  fraction to $75.90.  Meanwhile, shares of Walmart were down nearly 2  percent to $93.92.</p><p>RH, the retailer formerly known as Restoration Hardware, plans to buy back  up $700 million worth of shares.  In a statement, the CEO of the home  furnishings company says he believes the stock is undervalued and the  repurchase reflects confidence in the business.  Shares of RH climbed 10  percent to $118.62.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  Walgreens Boots Alliance today became the first Dow component to  report its earnings for this season.  And while the company is not facing  direct headwinds from China or rising interest rates, it is trying to  overcome challenges of its own.  </p><p>Bertha Coombs takes a look at Walgreen's mixed quarter.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BERTHA COOMBS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Walgreens earnings  results topped analyst expectations despite disappointing revenues, driven  in part by strong prescription volume growth.  The company says its share  of the U.S. prescription market is now about 22 percent, thanks in part to  the closing of its deal to buy more than 1,900 Rite Aid (NYSE:RAD) stores  earlier this year.  </p><p>But the firm's key chief financial officer admitted the profit margins on  specialty drugs were down year over year due to lower reimbursement.   Pharmacy benefit managers and insurers have been driving harder bargains on  brand name drug prices.  The drugstore's overall retail sales were down  from a year ago in part because they purposely deemphasized cigarette sales  as they shift their focus.  </p><p>Quote: We think we've done a good job in terms of shifting the emphasis to  become more of a health, beauty, wellness expert, co-COO Alex Gourlay told  analysts, adding that there's a lot more to go.  </p><p>To that end, Walgreens is expanding its relationship with Lab Corp.   They're going to be bringing more blood testing to 600 of their stores.   It's a strategic partnership.  So, a likely CVS (NYSE:CVS) Aetna (NYSE:AET)  merger poised to ramp up competition in drugstore clinics with more  integrated offering.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Bertha Coombs, New York.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  Coming up, is there trouble in the Permian?  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRIAN SULLIVAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  I'm Brian Sullivan  in the capital of the shale oil boom, Midland, Texas, where the combination  of low interest rates and higher oil prices had been great for the  industry.  But coming up on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, why many are concerned  if rates keep rising, all the debt that this industry is based on will come  back to haunt it.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  We note it's your favorite segment.  Here's what to watch for  tomorrow.  </p><p>Earnings from J.P. Morgan, Citigroup (NYSE:C) and Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC)  are due.  Attention will be paid to loan growth and interest margins.  And  with the central bank rates and inflation in focus, investors will listen  to what a number of Fed officials have to say about the economy tomorrow as  well.  And we'll get a fresh read on consumer sentiment which has been a  driving force behind spending.  </p><p>And that's what we're watching for on Friday.  </p><p>HERERA:  The Postal Service is proposing the biggest stamp price hike in  its history, to help shore up its finances.  Under the proposal, the cost  of a Forever Stamp would rise from 50 cents to 55 cents.  The request from  the USPS board of governors must be proved by the postal regulatory  commission.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  Well, starting in January, Social Security recipients will see  their biggest pay raise in seven years.  Beneficiaries will receive a cost  of living adjustment of 2.8 percent for 2019.  For the average Social  Security recipient, that works out to an increase of $39 a month.  </p><p>The annual adjustment is based on changes in the so-called consumer price  index.  It affects roughly one in five Americans, including disabled  veterans and federal retirees.  </p><p>HERERA:  Oil prices slumped to more than two-week lows as global stock  markets fell and the government reported a bigger than expected build in  crude inventories.  The price of domestic crude settled just above $70 a  barrel.  That drop in oil prices coupled with rising rates is putting  pressure on the country's shale producers, many of them located in the  Permian Basin in Texas.  </p><p>And that is where we find Brian Sullivan tonight.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SULLIVAN:  Here in West Texas, long timers in the oil and gas business will  tell you the industry has really built on three things, rock, people, and  money.  </p><p>The Permian basin of Texas, the richest oil area in America, has plenty of  the first, but always needs more of the other two.  And that's why some  people are beginning to question if the great American shale oil boom has  reached a peak, so-called good rock is plentiful here.  It's estimated  there are tens of billions of barrels of oil just waiting to be sucked out  of the ground.  </p><p>But to do that you need the oil and gas workers to do the job, something  that is increasingly hard to come by in a city 500 miles west of Houston  with one of the hottest real estate markets in the country.  </p><p>RON GUSEK, LIBERTY OILFIELD SERVICES:  Getting people to move here is a  difficult challenge.  Obviously, real estate, particularly troublesome in  that housing is very, very expensive, more expensive here than Houston or  Dallas or someplace like that.  And so, for younger families trying to come  here and start up, that's a lot to ask.  </p><p>SULLIVAN:  Locals have told us, some houses will sell in less than 24  hours.  Some workers live in hotels where rates can be eye-popping.  A  hotel like this can run nearly $400 per night.</p><p>But the biggest concern about the shale boom on Wall Street is not people,  it is debt.  Moody's estimates that some  $200 billion of oil and gas  company debt will mature in the next five years, with nearly $100 billion  of that alone coming from the exploration and production companies.  We  asked the head of research at Simmons Piper Jaffray about the impact rising  rates could have on the industry.  </p><p>BILL HERBERT, SIMMONS PIPER JAFFRAY:  Of course they matter.  Actually, the  collective balance sheet of the upstream sector with regard to EMP and oil  services are in much better shape than it's been in a long time.  Companies  are living with a much closer I guess proximity of cash flow.  And there's  been true capital allocation reform.  </p><p>So, effectively, I think that was a germane argument two or three years ago  when the companies were living well outside of cash flow.  But today,  coupled with pretty responsible balance sheets and living within closer  proximity of cash flow, I don't think it's nearly as alarming as it could  have been.  </p><p>SULLIVAN:  A few years ago, many oil and gas companies had almost no free  cash flow.  Now, they've gotten smarter and they've cleaned up their  balance sheets.  Low interest rates and higher oil prices have been a great  combination for the industry.  But if rates keep moving higher and oil  prices fall due to slowing economy, the booming shale oil industry and the  boom town of Midland, Texas, could find itself between a good rock and a  hard place.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Brian Sullivan, Midland, Texas.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  And before we go, another look at the day on Wall Street.   Another selloff.  The Dow down 545 points.  The Nasdaq was down 92.  The  S&amp;P was down 57.  </p><p>And don't forget, we've got those bank earnings starting tomorrow.  </p><p>HERERA:  Exactly.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  It should be very interesting day again.  </p><p>HERERA:  We will see what Friday holds.

The  Dow sheds 1,300 points in two days.  The trading was volatile.  It was  turbulent, and it was leaving a lot of investors with a lot of questions.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> SUE HERERA, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR:  Out of control.  Why the  president isn't holding back in criticism of the Federal Reserve.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> GRIFFETH:  Peak Permian?  As interest rates rise, this is as good as it  gets for the American shale boom perhaps.  It's centered around an industry  loaded with debt.  </p><p> Those stories and much more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for this  Thursday, October the 11th.  </p><p> HERERA:  And good evening, everyone.  And welcome.  </p><p> There is only one way to describe today -- ugly.  And there is only one way  to describe the past two days -- really ugly.  The selling was widespread.   The volume heavy, the market has become gripped by fears of rapidly rising  interest rates, a possible global economic slowdown and high tech  valuations.  </p><p> And according to one tally, this is now the worst start to a fourth quarter  since 2008.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 545 points to 25,052.   The Nasdaq fell 92 points, and the S&amp;P 500 dropped 57.  </p><p> Bob Pisani at the New York Stock Exchange tells us what's behind the  selling and what's getting hit.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> BOB PISANI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Wall Street's steep  Wednesday selloff bled over today with the Dow tumbling almost 700 points  at the lows before ending down about 500.  Stocks were all over the map,  moving between gains and losses in very choppy trading.  But rates continue  to be the main driver overall.  The markets looked to the holding steady  until 2:30 Eastern Time when there was a huge burst of selling around some  ETFs in the equity space and treasury bond ETFs, in other words, a rotation  out of stocks and into bonds.  </p><p> What we're seeing is a momentum driven flush-out of some of the big cap  names and there also a couple of sector specific stories driving action  today.  So, for example, bank stocks have been weak early on because of a  weaker read on consumer prices.  They were driven even lower by strong  demand for treasuries at today's 30-year bond auction, all of which pushed  bond yields down to session lows, generally negative for banks.  </p><p> And energy lagged on the day, falling on a bigger build up than expected in  crude oil inventories.  And that was an issue for all the energy stocks.   Tomorrow will be a key day to watch with bank earnings kicking off,  starting with J.P. Morgan and another big read on consumer sentiment.  </p><p> For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Bob Pisani at the New York Stock Exchange.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> GRIFFETH:  Now with all of the selling, we asked Mike Santoli to look for  any clues about when the downward pressure might ease up.  Here is what he  found.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> MIKE SANTOLI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  After a sharp and  jarring market drop, investors quickly move to asses the damage and search  for signs of stability.  And this process is now underway following the  biggest two-day tumble since February.  </p><p> The damage has been swift and pervasive across the market, and the downside  momentum has not yet let up.  Traders are noting that the market has  quickly become oversold, which means the indexes are stretched far below  their recent trend.  </p><p> Along with the fact that the vast majority of stocks are down more than 10  percent from the high in a short time, this can ultimately set the stage  for a bounce simply as a technical matter.  But selloffs can feed on  themselves as traders seek shelter from a more treacherous market action.  </p><p> One indicator getting a lot of attention is known as the volatility index,  a measure of how urgently traders are buying protective options.  This  index has surged from 15 to the high 20s this week and elevated level, but  while the low extremes reached in February that marked the correction low.   Veteran traders like to see this volatility gauge retreat dramatically from  a peak over the course of a trading session, often a sign the market is  calming itself.  </p><p> Investor sentiment has been turned cautious as well.  Typically a nasty  decline spreads worry which also can set the scene for an eventual  recovery.  One clue to end this market might find its footing is to whether  the majority of stocks participate in any relief rallies that pop up.   While the skid in the market got rolling with a move to new multiyear highs  in bond yields, it continued after yield stock going up on Thursday,  suggesting it had became a violent rotation out of some of the best  performing tech, industrial and consumer stocks as fears of rising rates, a  possible profit slowdown and unsettled global markets flared up.  </p><p> There is no reliable way to call an end to these ugly market episodes.  But  one consolation might be that the action is not clearly based on evidence  of a weakening economy.  This is mostly a stock market event tied to  valuations and investor risk appetites for now, which means the market  itself will have to tell us when these painful adjustments might be nearing  an end.  </p><p> For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Mike Santoli.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> HERERA:  And now to the Fed, which is at the center of the concern over  interest rates.  Today, the president of the Kansas City Fed said the  central bank will likely continue to raise interest rates.  Esther George  says a tightening labor market could lead inflation to accelerate over the  next few years, though she had the pace remains a matter of discussion.  </p><p> Separately, a new report showed slowing inflation last month.  The consumer  price index rose just 0.1 percent, which was less than expected.  </p><p> GRIFFETH:  And the president as we have been reporting has been a vocal  critic of the Fed's monetary policy.  He recently called the Fed's recent  stance on interest rates too aggressive.  But is it?  </p><p> Steve Liesman reports.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> STEVE LIESMAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  The president of the  United States not holding back in his criticism of the Federal Reserve's  interest rate hiking policies, blaming the recent stock market selloff  directly on the central bank.  </p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I think the Fed is out of  control.  I think what they're do something wrong.  I think the Fed is far  too stringent and making a mistake.  And it's not right.  </p><p> And it's -- despite that we are doing very well.  But it's not necessary in  my opinion.  And I think I know about it better than they do, believe me.  </p><p> LIESMAN:  So, is the Fed crazy?  Before answering, it's worth pointing out  three of the four members of the board of governors chair and two vice  chairs were all appointed by President Trump.  </p><p> Beyond that, it's worth looking at how the Fed changed interest rate policy  in the past year, largely in response to the president's own policies.   Last year, the Fed forecast 2 percent inflation for 2018, 2 percent growth  and 4.1 percent unemployment rate.  The median forecast as a result looked  for the Fed to raise rates by about three quarters of a point to 2 percent.  </p><p> So, what happened?  Inflation came in right on target, but growth surge and  unemployment came in well below the forecast.  That is, the economy did  better than the Fed expected.  </p><p> So, the Fed changed its outlook.  It now forecasts a full percentage point  rate rise this year compared to 3/4 of a point or just 25 basis points in  the prior forecasts.  </p><p> Is that crazy?  After a huge tax cut, a surge in the deficit and series of  price-raising tariffs, most economists say the Fed is responding  appropriately to the change in the economy.  </p><p> JOHN RYDING, RDQ ECONOMICS:  There's a rate hike in does in its forecast.   It has three rate hikes next year.  My guess is actually the inflation  numbers will push the Fed to four.  But none of that is a disaster as long  as companies generate profits.  </p><p> LIESMAN:  The danger is if the economy doesn't keep up its momentum.  In  that case, the Fed's forecast could be too aggressive.  But it can always  dial back its plan to raise rates if the economy weakens.  That's not  crazy.  That's monetary policy.  </p><p> For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Steve Liesman.</p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> GRIFFETH:  Joining us now to help put all of this into perspective.   Joining us tonight is Andres Garcia.  He's founder and CEO of Zoe  Financial.</p><p> Andres, always good to see you.  Thanks for joining us tonight.  </p><p> ANDRES GARCIA, ZOE FINANCIAL FOUNDER &amp; CEO:  Thanks for having me.</p><p> GRIFFETH:  So, the selloff this week essentially wiped out gains we've seen  over the last three months in the stock market here in the U.S.  So, now  what?  What -- put this in perspective for us.  </p><p> GARCIA:  OK.  So, the first thing that I would mention is we're still what  5 percent from all all-time highs, right?  So, let's take a deep breath.  </p><p> Another thing that's important to keep in mind is we have had 23  corrections that are 5 percent or more since March of 2009.  So, this is  not -- this is not -- is not an everyday event but is not totally abnormal.  </p><p> I'll give you one more stat.  If you go back 39 years, on average, if you  look at the worst intra year drop, it's 13 percent.  So, even if we see  this, you know, 5, 6 percent correction turn to the 10 percent correction,  that is still considered normal when we look at the last four decades,  right?  That's important to keep in mind.  </p><p> GRIFFETH:  OK.</p><p> GARCIA:  I don't know what's happening next.  And I think that's important  to keep in mind as well.  Nobody does.  So, if it's s out of your control,  try to basically not to focus too much on the headlines and stay focus on  the long-term.  </p><p> HERERA:  All right.  So, what is the best advise then for our viewers who  are watching tonight?  Because, I mean, interest rates have been edging up  gradually, but all of a sudden, it seems to be what the market is focused  on.  </p><p> So, if you have a long-term horizon what is the best strategy to keep all  this volatility in perspective.  </p><p> GARCIA:  Yes, I think that's the key.  </p><p> And I'll say one more thing about the interest rates as well.  Let's not  forget that interest rates, long-term interest rates and short-term  interest rates have been rising a while.  In fact, long-term interest rates  have been rising since last summer.  And last time I checked, the S&amp;P 500  has been up since then.  </p><p> The other kind of headline that I see is that trade wars are creating this.   Last time I check, trade wars have been ongoing this year, and the market  is still up 5 percent and it was up 10 percent when this trade war  situation was pretty rough.  </p><p> But going back to your question, what is under people's control is how much  they save, do they invest, and do they have a plan for the long-term?   That's under their control.  </p><p> And then the last thing under their control is how they react to short-term  volatility.  If you keep control of those things in the long-term, you'll  be okay.  </p><p> GRIFFETH:  Very quickly, technology stocks have been the darling of this  market.  The FANG stocks have been getting a lot of the attention in the  last couple of years.  And they're leading this market lower.  </p><p> What do you do with those guys?  </p><p> GARCIA:  I'm not going to comment on short-term volatility, on tech stocks.   What I would say is that their volatility in general tends to be much  higher than the overall market.  So, people forget that they were up 50, 60  percent.  They feel it more when they're down 15 or 20, right? </p><p> GRIFFETH:  Right.</p><p> GARCIA:  So, higher risk, higher return, and that's the essence what you're  getting when you're investing in those types of stocks.  </p><p> GRIFFETH:  One of the sacrosanct laws of Wall Street, the higher the risk,  the higher gains.</p><p> Andres Garcia with Zoe Financial -- always good to see you.  Thanks for  joining us tonight.  </p><p> GARCIA:  Thanks for having me.</p><p> HERERA:  It is time to take a look at some of today's upgrades and  downgrades.  </p><p>Lear (NYSE:LEA) was upgraded to buy from neutral at Goldman Sachs  (NYSE:GS).  The analyst cites solid free cash flow and the potential to  gain market share.  The price target is $195.  Shares of Lear (NYSE:LEA)  rose nearly 2 percent to $137.54.  </p><p> The price target for shares of \"The New York Times (NYSE:NYT)\" was  increased to $32 at J.P. Morgan.  The analyst there expects the upcoming  elections to help drive its paper's digital subscriptions.  The firm  maintains the overweight rating.  \"The New York Times (NYSE:NYT)\" shares  rose a fraction to $24.84.  </p><p> And J.P. Morgan cut the target on Abercrombie &amp; Fitch (NYSE:ANF) to $16.   The analyst cites potential margin pressure as a result of tariffs and  higher wages.  The rating remains underweight.  The shares finished down  more than 5 percent to $17.99.  </p><p> GRIFFETH:  Still ahead, tipping point?  Money had been flowing into passive  investments like ETFs and mutual funds.  But is that starting to shift?  </p><p> (MUSIC)</p><p> HERERA:  A group of senators are not pleased with Google (NASDAQ:GOOG).   Today, they sent a letter to the company criticizing it for failing to  disclose the data vulnerability that affected hundreds of thousands of  Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) Plus users.  Senator Thune said he was disappointed  that Google's chief privacy officer testified before the Commerce Committee  a few weeks ago and failed to provide information on that breach.  Google  (NASDAQ:GOOG) disclosed the breach after it was reported by the \"Wall  Street Journal.\" </p><p> GRIFFETH:  And as we have been reporting, of course, the Nasdaq selloff has  been sharp.  The index is off more than 9 percent from its most recent  highs into August.  And, of course, it is loaded with some very popular  technology stocks, which begs the question, will this group that led the  market higher now lead it lower?  </p><p> Josh Lipton looks at what may be next.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> JOSH LIPTON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  High-fliers have been  losing altitude.  That's the story of big tech's recent performance in the  stock market that has seen names like Alphabet, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and  Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) fall sharply from their recent highs.  </p><p> Many on Wall Street say the reason for the decline is simple.  When there  is a broad, sharp selloff investors tend to sell what has been performing  the best.  And that's especially true when the winners are some of the  biggest, most liquid names in the market.  But a major concern is whether  there is a broader rotation happening from sectors with significant growth  potential to those that appear cheaper and more defensive.  If that's the  case, it would be bad news for tech in the quarters ahead.  </p><p> TIMOTHY LESKO, GRANITE INVESTMENT ADVISORS:  Right now, you have a lot of  other crosswinds that are scaring investors.  So, this may last a little  while longer as people get comfortable with what goes on in tariffs,  inflation and rates.  </p><p> LIPTON:  Still there are tech bulls on Wall Street.  For example, the team  at CFRA Research remains bullish on the tech sector.  Next year, they  estimate earnings growth of 11 percent and revenue growth of 9 percent,  both better than the broader market.  </p><p> For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Josh Lipton, San Francisco.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> HERERA:  So, with all of that selling on Wall Street and money flowing out  of passive investments like ETFs and mutual funds, is this setting the  stage for the comeback of active investing?  </p><p> Amanda Agati is the co-chief investment strategist at PNC Financial and she  is here to share her thoughts with us.  </p><p> Good to see you, Amanda.  Welcome.</p><p> AMANDA AGATI, PNC FINANCIAL CO-CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST:  Thank you for  having me.  </p><p> HERERA:  You make the points in the  notes that I'm reading here that you  are starting to see that, and it's been going on for a little bit now.  </p><p> AGATI:  Well, yes, absolutely.  We believe very strongly that a comeback or  a resurgence in active management is already occurring.  It's not just  precipitated by the last couple of days of spike in volatility in the  markets.  </p><p> And actually, the backdrop for active management has been evolving and  improving basically over the course of 2018.  So, yes, we think it's  already underway and likely to pick up steam.  </p><p> GRIFFETH:  But you know why people were rushing to the passive investments,  the exchange traded funds, the index funds, they're cheaper.  The fees are  much cheaper.  It's more expensive to invest with an actively managed fund.  </p><p> So, what's the argument to go back for the actively managed funds?  </p><p> AGATI:  Well, I think really we believe strongly that the mix of active and  passive that we employ in portfolios should evolve as the cycle involves.   And so, the rush towards passive investing has really been borne out of the  cycle that we have been in, really since the financial crisis, where it's  been very long, slow, sluggish growth.  And with this as a back drop, we  have seen high correlations among stock.  So, large swaths of the market  moving together.  </p><p> Volatility near record lows if not at record lows over extended periods of  time.  And then with the, you know, highly accommodative monetary policy  stance out of the Fed, it's really made for a back drop of easy access to  cheap capital for companies.  So, it really hasn't created a back drop to  easily distinguish between winners and losers from a stock picking  perspective.  </p><p> So, we think all of the trends are reversing course now.  </p><p> HERERA:  So, are you telling your clients to have a mix of both active and  passive?  </p><p> AGATI:  Yes, absolutely.  So we believe strongly that depending on the  cycle and also depending on the asset class mix, the mix of active and  passive can be different in every client's portfolio.  So, we're not fully  recommending 100 percent passive in portfolios, just as we wouldn't  recommend 100 percent active exposure as well.  There really is very much a  mix.  </p><p> HERERA:  All right.  On that note, Amanda Agati, thank you.  Amanda is with  PNC Financials.  </p><p> AGATI:  Thank you.  </p><p> GRIFFETH:  Soaring demand helps Delta's profits fly high, and that's where  we begin tonight's \"Market Focus\".  </p><p> The airline said today that the higher ticket prices and stronger sales for  its premium seats nearly offset the rise in its jet fuel costs.  Delta also  managed to keep a tight lid on other costs as well, leading to an overall  earnings beat.  And when it comes to rising rates, Delta thinks it stands  to benefit as well.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> ED BASTIAN, DELTA CEO:  The demand we are looking at in 8 percent growth in  Q4 in terms of top line growth.  So, demand is continuing strong.  At  Delta, we paid down the vast majority of our debt.  We got the investment  grade rating back.  Our debt level is arguably lowest in our history.  </p><p> We also have, still have the pension liability and as interest rates climb,  it actually causes the pension liability to come down.  So, we'll probably  be a net beneficiary on the balance sheet from a rise in rates.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> GRIFFETH:  Delta shares took off, up more than 3 percent today to $51.48.  </p><p> In the meantime, Lockheed Martin's F-35 fighter jets have been temporarily  grounded.  The Pentagon says that fuel tubes are being examined after the  Joint Strike Fighter jets crashed last month in South Carolina.  The F-35  is the most expensive weapon system in the U.S. military.  The inspection  of the 320 jets currently in operation is expected to be completed in two  days.  Lockheed shares were down 3 percent to $326.26.  </p><p> HERERA:  PayPal is teaming up with Walmart to provide financial services  and products to their shared customers.  The program will mark the first  time PayPal's mobile app users will be able to take cash out of their  PayPal account in a brick and mortar environment.  PayPal shares rose a  fraction to $75.90.  Meanwhile, shares of Walmart were down nearly 2  percent to $93.92.</p><p>RH, the retailer formerly known as Restoration Hardware, plans to buy back  up $700 million worth of shares.  In a statement, the CEO of the home  furnishings company says he believes the stock is undervalued and the  repurchase reflects confidence in the business.  Shares of RH climbed 10  percent to $118.62.  </p><p> GRIFFETH:  Walgreens Boots Alliance today became the first Dow component to  report its earnings for this season.  And while the company is not facing  direct headwinds from China or rising interest rates, it is trying to  overcome challenges of its own.  </p><p> Bertha Coombs takes a look at Walgreen's mixed quarter.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> BERTHA COOMBS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Walgreens earnings  results topped analyst expectations despite disappointing revenues, driven  in part by strong prescription volume growth.  The company says its share  of the U.S. prescription market is now about 22 percent, thanks in part to  the closing of its deal to buy more than 1,900 Rite Aid (NYSE:RAD) stores  earlier this year.  </p><p> But the firm's key chief financial officer admitted the profit margins on  specialty drugs were down year over year due to lower reimbursement.   Pharmacy benefit managers and insurers have been driving harder bargains on  brand name drug prices.  The drugstore's overall retail sales were down  from a year ago in part because they purposely deemphasized cigarette sales  as they shift their focus.  </p><p> Quote: We think we've done a good job in terms of shifting the emphasis to  become more of a health, beauty, wellness expert, co-COO Alex Gourlay told  analysts, adding that there's a lot more to go.  </p><p> To that end, Walgreens is expanding its relationship with Lab Corp.   They're going to be bringing more blood testing to 600 of their stores.   It's a strategic partnership.  So, a likely CVS (NYSE:CVS) Aetna (NYSE:AET)  merger poised to ramp up competition in drugstore clinics with more  integrated offering.  </p><p> For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Bertha Coombs, New York.</p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> HERERA:  Coming up, is there trouble in the Permian?  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BRIAN SULLIVAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  I'm Brian Sullivan  in the capital of the shale oil boom, Midland, Texas, where the combination  of low interest rates and higher oil prices had been great for the  industry.  But coming up on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, why many are concerned  if rates keep rising, all the debt that this industry is based on will come  back to haunt it.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> (MUSIC)</p><p> GRIFFETH:  We note it's your favorite segment.  Here's what to watch for  tomorrow.  </p><p> Earnings from J.P. Morgan, Citigroup (NYSE:C) and Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC)  are due.  Attention will be paid to loan growth and interest margins.  And  with the central bank rates and inflation in focus, investors will listen  to what a number of Fed officials have to say about the economy tomorrow as  well.  And we'll get a fresh read on consumer sentiment which has been a  driving force behind spending.  </p><p> And that's what we're watching for on Friday.  </p><p> HERERA:  The Postal Service is proposing the biggest stamp price hike in  its history, to help shore up its finances.  Under the proposal, the cost  of a Forever Stamp would rise from 50 cents to 55 cents.  The request from  the USPS board of governors must be proved by the postal regulatory  commission.  </p><p> GRIFFETH:  Well, starting in January, Social Security recipients will see  their biggest pay raise in seven years.  Beneficiaries will receive a cost  of living adjustment of 2.8 percent for 2019.  For the average Social  Security recipient, that works out to an increase of $39 a month.  </p><p> The annual adjustment is based on changes in the so-called consumer price  index.  It affects roughly one in five Americans, including disabled  veterans and federal retirees.  </p><p> HERERA:  Oil prices slumped to more than two-week lows as global stock  markets fell and the government reported a bigger than expected build in  crude inventories.  The price of domestic crude settled just above $70 a  barrel.  That drop in oil prices coupled with rising rates is putting  pressure on the country's shale producers, many of them located in the  Permian Basin in Texas.  </p><p> And that is where we find Brian Sullivan tonight.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> SULLIVAN:  Here in West Texas, long timers in the oil and gas business will  tell you the industry has really built on three things, rock, people, and  money.  </p><p> The Permian basin of Texas, the richest oil area in America, has plenty of  the first, but always needs more of the other two.  And that's why some  people are beginning to question if the great American shale oil boom has  reached a peak, so-called good rock is plentiful here.  It's estimated  there are tens of billions of barrels of oil just waiting to be sucked out  of the ground.  </p><p> But to do that you need the oil and gas workers to do the job, something  that is increasingly hard to come by in a city 500 miles west of Houston  with one of the hottest real estate markets in the country.  </p><p> RON GUSEK, LIBERTY OILFIELD SERVICES:  Getting people to move here is a  difficult challenge.  Obviously, real estate, particularly troublesome in  that housing is very, very expensive, more expensive here than Houston or  Dallas or someplace like that.  And so, for younger families trying to come  here and start up, that's a lot to ask.  </p><p> SULLIVAN:  Locals have told us, some houses will sell in less than 24  hours.  Some workers live in hotels where rates can be eye-popping.  A  hotel like this can run nearly $400 per night.</p><p> But the biggest concern about the shale boom on Wall Street is not people,  it is debt.  Moody's estimates that some  $200 billion of oil and gas  company debt will mature in the next five years, with nearly $100 billion  of that alone coming from the exploration and production companies.  We  asked the head of research at Simmons Piper Jaffray about the impact rising  rates could have on the industry.  </p><p> BILL HERBERT, SIMMONS PIPER JAFFRAY:  Of course they matter.  Actually, the  collective balance sheet of the upstream sector with regard to EMP and oil  services are in much better shape than it's been in a long time.  Companies  are living with a much closer I guess proximity of cash flow.  And there's  been true capital allocation reform.  </p><p> So, effectively, I think that was a germane argument two or three years ago  when the companies were living well outside of cash flow.  But today,  coupled with pretty responsible balance sheets and living within closer  proximity of cash flow, I don't think it's nearly as alarming as it could  have been.  </p><p> SULLIVAN:  A few years ago, many oil and gas companies had almost no free  cash flow.  Now, they've gotten smarter and they've cleaned up their  balance sheets.  Low interest rates and higher oil prices have been a great  combination for the industry.  But if rates keep moving higher and oil  prices fall due to slowing economy, the booming shale oil industry and the  boom town of Midland, Texas, could find itself between a good rock and a  hard place.  </p><p> For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Brian Sullivan, Midland, Texas.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> GRIFFETH:  And before we go, another look at the day on Wall Street.   Another selloff.  The Dow down 545 points.  The Nasdaq was down 92.  The  S&amp;P was down 57.  </p><p> And don't forget, we've got those bank earnings starting tomorrow.  </p><p> HERERA:  Exactly.  </p><p> GRIFFETH:  It should be very interesting day again.  </p><p> HERERA:  We will see what Friday holds.  We hope you'll join us for that  tomorrow night.  In the meantime, that does it for us tonight.  I'm Sue  Herera.  Thanks for joining us.  </p><p> GRIFFETH:  I'm Bill Griffeth.  Have a great evening.  We'll see you  tomorrow.</p><p> END</p><p> Nightly Business Report transcripts and video are available on-line post  broadcast at <url normalizedValue=\"http://nbr.com\">http://nbr.com</url>.

The  Dow sheds 1,300 points in two days.  The trading was volatile.  It was  turbulent, and it was leaving a lot of investors with a lot of questions.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> SUE HERERA, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR:  Out of control.  Why the  president isn't holding back in criticism of the Federal Reserve.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> GRIFFETH:  Peak Permian?  As interest rates rise, this is as good as it  gets for the American shale boom perhaps.  It's centered around an industry  loaded with debt.  </p><p> Those stories and much more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for this  Thursday, October the 11th.  </p><p> HERERA:  And good evening, everyone.  And welcome.  </p><p> There is only one way to describe today -- ugly.  And there is only one way  to describe the past two days -- really ugly.  The selling was widespread.   The volume heavy, the market has become gripped by fears of rapidly rising  interest rates, a possible global economic slowdown and high tech  valuations.  </p><p> And according to one tally, this is now the worst start to a fourth quarter  since 2008.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 545 points to 25,052.   The Nasdaq fell 92 points, and the S&amp;P 500 dropped 57.  </p><p> Bob Pisani at the New York Stock Exchange tells us what's behind the  selling and what's getting hit.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> BOB PISANI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Wall Street's steep  Wednesday selloff bled over today with the Dow tumbling almost 700 points  at the lows before ending down about 500.  Stocks were all over the map,  moving between gains and losses in very choppy trading.  But rates continue  to be the main driver overall.  The markets looked to the holding steady  until 2:30 Eastern Time when there was a huge burst of selling around some  ETFs in the equity space and treasury bond ETFs, in other words, a rotation  out of stocks and into bonds.  </p><p> What we're seeing is a momentum driven flush-out of some of the big cap  names and there also a couple of sector specific stories driving action  today.  So, for example, bank stocks have been weak early on because of a  weaker read on consumer prices.  They were driven even lower by strong  demand for treasuries at today's 30-year bond auction, all of which pushed  bond yields down to session lows, generally negative for banks.  </p><p> And energy lagged on the day, falling on a bigger build up than expected in  crude oil inventories.  And that was an issue for all the energy stocks.   Tomorrow will be a key day to watch with bank earnings kicking off,  starting with J.P. Morgan and another big read on consumer sentiment.  </p><p> For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Bob Pisani at the New York Stock Exchange.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> GRIFFETH:  Now with all of the selling, we asked Mike Santoli to look for  any clues about when the downward pressure might ease up.  Here is what he  found.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> MIKE SANTOLI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  After a sharp and  jarring market drop, investors quickly move to asses the damage and search  for signs of stability.  And this process is now underway following the  biggest two-day tumble since February.  </p><p> The damage has been swift and pervasive across the market, and the downside  momentum has not yet let up.  Traders are noting that the market has  quickly become oversold, which means the indexes are stretched far below  their recent trend.  </p><p> Along with the fact that the vast majority of stocks are down more than 10  percent from the high in a short time, this can ultimately set the stage  for a bounce simply as a technical matter.  But selloffs can feed on  themselves as traders seek shelter from a more treacherous market action.  </p><p> One indicator getting a lot of attention is known as the volatility index,  a measure of how urgently traders are buying protective options.  This  index has surged from 15 to the high 20s this week and elevated level, but  while the low extremes reached in February that marked the correction low.   Veteran traders like to see this volatility gauge retreat dramatically from  a peak over the course of a trading session, often a sign the market is  calming itself.  </p><p> Investor sentiment has been turned cautious as well.  Typically a nasty  decline spreads worry which also can set the scene for an eventual  recovery.  One clue to end this market might find its footing is to whether  the majority of stocks participate in any relief rallies that pop up.   While the skid in the market got rolling with a move to new multiyear highs  in bond yields, it continued after yield stock going up on Thursday,  suggesting it had became a violent rotation out of some of the best  performing tech, industrial and consumer stocks as fears of rising rates, a  possible profit slowdown and unsettled global markets flared up.  </p><p> There is no reliable way to call an end to these ugly market episodes.  But  one consolation might be that the action is not clearly based on evidence  of a weakening economy.  This is mostly a stock market event tied to  valuations and investor risk appetites for now, which means the market  itself will have to tell us when these painful adjustments might be nearing  an end.  </p><p> For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Mike Santoli.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> HERERA:  And now to the Fed, which is at the center of the concern over  interest rates.  Today, the president of the Kansas City Fed said the  central bank will likely continue to raise interest rates.  Esther George  says a tightening labor market could lead inflation to accelerate over the  next few years, though she had the pace remains a matter of discussion.  </p><p> Separately, a new report showed slowing inflation last month.  The consumer  price index rose just 0.1 percent, which was less than expected.  </p><p> GRIFFETH:  And the president as we have been reporting has been a vocal  critic of the Fed's monetary policy.  He recently called the Fed's recent  stance on interest rates too aggressive.  But is it?  </p><p> Steve Liesman reports.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> STEVE LIESMAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  The president of the  United States not holding back in his criticism of the Federal Reserve's  interest rate hiking policies, blaming the recent stock market selloff  directly on the central bank.  </p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I think the Fed is out of  control.  I think what they're do something wrong.  I think the Fed is far  too stringent and making a mistake.  And it's not right.  </p><p> And it's -- despite that we are doing very well.  But it's not necessary in  my opinion.  And I think I know about it better than they do, believe me.  </p><p> LIESMAN:  So, is the Fed crazy?  Before answering, it's worth pointing out  three of the four members of the board of governors chair and two vice  chairs were all appointed by President Trump.  </p><p> Beyond that, it's worth looking at how the Fed changed interest rate policy  in the past year, largely in response to the president's own policies.   Last year, the Fed forecast 2 percent inflation for 2018, 2 percent growth  and 4.1 percent unemployment rate.  The median forecast as a result looked  for the Fed to raise rates by about three quarters of a point to 2 percent.  </p><p> So, what happened?  Inflation came in right on target, but growth surge and  unemployment came in well below the forecast.  That is, the economy did  better than the Fed expected.  </p><p> So, the Fed changed its outlook.  It now forecasts a full percentage point  rate rise this year compared to 3/4 of a point or just 25 basis points in  the prior forecasts.  </p><p> Is that crazy?  After a huge tax cut, a surge in the deficit and series of  price-raising tariffs, most economists say the Fed is responding  appropriately to the change in the economy.  </p><p> JOHN RYDING, RDQ ECONOMICS:  There's a rate hike in does in its forecast.   It has three rate hikes next year.  My guess is actually the inflation  numbers will push the Fed to four.  But none of that is a disaster as long  as companies generate profits.  </p><p> LIESMAN:  The danger is if the economy doesn't keep up its momentum.  In  that case, the Fed's forecast could be too aggressive.  But it can always  dial back its plan to raise rates if the economy weakens.  That's not  crazy.  That's monetary policy.  </p><p> For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Steve Liesman.</p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> GRIFFETH:  Joining us now to help put all of this into perspective.   Joining us tonight is Andres Garcia.  He's founder and CEO of Zoe  Financial.</p><p> Andres, always good to see you.  Thanks for joining us tonight.  </p><p> ANDRES GARCIA, ZOE FINANCIAL FOUNDER &amp; CEO:  Thanks for having me.</p><p> GRIFFETH:  So, the selloff this week essentially wiped out gains we've seen  over the last three months in the stock market here in the U.S.  So, now  what?  What -- put this in perspective for us.  </p><p> GARCIA:  OK.  So, the first thing that I would mention is we're still what  5 percent from all all-time highs, right?  So, let's take a deep breath.  </p><p> Another thing that's important to keep in mind is we have had 23  corrections that are 5 percent or more since March of 2009.  So, this is  not -- this is not -- is not an everyday event but is not totally abnormal.  </p><p> I'll give you one more stat.  If you go back 39 years, on average, if you  look at the worst intra year drop, it's 13 percent.  So, even if we see  this, you know, 5, 6 percent correction turn to the 10 percent correction,  that is still considered normal when we look at the last four decades,  right?  That's important to keep in mind.  </p><p> GRIFFETH:  OK.</p><p> GARCIA:  I don't know what's happening next.  And I think that's important  to keep in mind as well.  Nobody does.  So, if it's s out of your control,  try to basically not to focus too much on the headlines and stay focus on  the long-term.  </p><p> HERERA:  All right.  So, what is the best advise then for our viewers who  are watching tonight?  Because, I mean, interest rates have been edging up  gradually, but all of a sudden, it seems to be what the market is focused  on.  </p><p> So, if you have a long-term horizon what is the best strategy to keep all  this volatility in perspective.  </p><p> GARCIA:  Yes, I think that's the key.  </p><p> And I'll say one more thing about the interest rates as well.  Let's not  forget that interest rates, long-term interest rates and short-term  interest rates have been rising a while.  In fact, long-term interest rates  have been rising since last summer.  And last time I checked, the S&amp;P 500  has been up since then.  </p><p> The other kind of headline that I see is that trade wars are creating this.   Last time I check, trade wars have been ongoing this year, and the market  is still up 5 percent and it was up 10 percent when this trade war  situation was pretty rough.  </p><p> But going back to your question, what is under people's control is how much  they save, do they invest, and do they have a plan for the long-term?   That's under their control.  </p><p> And then the last thing under their control is how they react to short-term  volatility.  If you keep control of those things in the long-term, you'll  be okay.  </p><p> GRIFFETH:  Very quickly, technology stocks have been the darling of this  market.  The FANG stocks have been getting a lot of the attention in the  last couple of years.  And they're leading this market lower.  </p><p> What do you do with those guys?  </p><p> GARCIA:  I'm not going to comment on short-term volatility, on tech stocks.   What I would say is that their volatility in general tends to be much  higher than the overall market.  So, people forget that they were up 50, 60  percent.  They feel it more when they're down 15 or 20, right? </p><p> GRIFFETH:  Right.</p><p> GARCIA:  So, higher risk, higher return, and that's the essence what you're  getting when you're investing in those types of stocks.  </p><p> GRIFFETH:  One of the sacrosanct laws of Wall Street, the higher the risk,  the higher gains.</p><p> Andres Garcia with Zoe Financial -- always good to see you.  Thanks for  joining us tonight.  </p><p> GARCIA:  Thanks for having me.</p><p> HERERA:  It is time to take a look at some of today's upgrades and  downgrades.  </p><p>Lear (NYSE:LEA) was upgraded to buy from neutral at Goldman Sachs  (NYSE:GS).  The analyst cites solid free cash flow and the potential to  gain market share.  The price target is $195.  Shares of Lear (NYSE:LEA)  rose nearly 2 percent to $137.54.  </p><p> The price target for shares of \"The New York Times (NYSE:NYT)\" was  increased to $32 at J.P. Morgan.  The analyst there expects the upcoming  elections to help drive its paper's digital subscriptions.  The firm  maintains the overweight rating.  \"The New York Times (NYSE:NYT)\" shares  rose a fraction to $24.84.  </p><p> And J.P. Morgan cut the target on Abercrombie &amp; Fitch (NYSE:ANF) to $16.   The analyst cites potential margin pressure as a result of tariffs and  higher wages.  The rating remains underweight.  The shares finished down  more than 5 percent to $17.99.  </p><p> GRIFFETH:  Still ahead, tipping point?  Money had been flowing into passive  investments like ETFs and mutual funds.  But is that starting to shift?  </p><p> (MUSIC)</p><p> HERERA:  A group of senators are not pleased with Google (NASDAQ:GOOG).   Today, they sent a letter to the company criticizing it for failing to  disclose the data vulnerability that affected hundreds of thousands of  Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) Plus users.  Senator Thune said he was disappointed  that Google's chief privacy officer testified before the Commerce Committee  a few weeks ago and failed to provide information on that breach.  Google  (NASDAQ:GOOG) disclosed the breach after it was reported by the \"Wall  Street Journal.\" </p><p> GRIFFETH:  And as we have been reporting, of course, the Nasdaq selloff has  been sharp.  The index is off more than 9 percent from its most recent  highs into August.  And, of course, it is loaded with some very popular  technology stocks, which begs the question, will this group that led the  market higher now lead it lower?  </p><p> Josh Lipton looks at what may be next.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> JOSH LIPTON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  High-fliers have been  losing altitude.  That's the story of big tech's recent performance in the  stock market that has seen names like Alphabet, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and  Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) fall sharply from their recent highs.  </p><p> Many on Wall Street say the reason for the decline is simple.  When there  is a broad, sharp selloff investors tend to sell what has been performing  the best.  And that's especially true when the winners are some of the  biggest, most liquid names in the market.  But a major concern is whether  there is a broader rotation happening from sectors with significant growth  potential to those that appear cheaper and more defensive.  If that's the  case, it would be bad news for tech in the quarters ahead.  </p><p> TIMOTHY LESKO, GRANITE INVESTMENT ADVISORS:  Right now, you have a lot of  other crosswinds that are scaring investors.  So, this may last a little  while longer as people get comfortable with what goes on in tariffs,  inflation and rates.  </p><p> LIPTON:  Still there are tech bulls on Wall Street.  For example, the team  at CFRA Research remains bullish on the tech sector.  Next year, they  estimate earnings growth of 11 percent and revenue growth of 9 percent,  both better than the broader market.  </p><p> For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Josh Lipton, San Francisco.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> HERERA:  So, with all of that selling on Wall Street and money flowing out  of passive investments like ETFs and mutual funds, is this setting the  stage for the comeback of active investing?  </p><p> Amanda Agati is the co-chief investment strategist at PNC Financial and she  is here to share her thoughts with us.  </p><p> Good to see you, Amanda.  Welcome.</p><p> AMANDA AGATI, PNC FINANCIAL CO-CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST:  Thank you for  having me.  </p><p> HERERA:  You make the points in the  notes that I'm reading here that you  are starting to see that, and it's been going on for a little bit now.  </p><p> AGATI:  Well, yes, absolutely.  We believe very strongly that a comeback or  a resurgence in active management is already occurring.  It's not just  precipitated by the last couple of days of spike in volatility in the  markets.  </p><p> And actually, the backdrop for active management has been evolving and  improving basically over the course of 2018.  So, yes, we think it's  already underway and likely to pick up steam.  </p><p> GRIFFETH:  But you know why people were rushing to the passive investments,  the exchange traded funds, the index funds, they're cheaper.  The fees are  much cheaper.  It's more expensive to invest with an actively managed fund.  </p><p> So, what's the argument to go back for the actively managed funds?  </p><p> AGATI:  Well, I think really we believe strongly that the mix of active and  passive that we employ in portfolios should evolve as the cycle involves.   And so, the rush towards passive investing has really been borne out of the  cycle that we have been in, really since the financial crisis, where it's  been very long, slow, sluggish growth.  And with this as a back drop, we  have seen high correlations among stock.  So, large swaths of the market  moving together.  </p><p> Volatility near record lows if not at record lows over extended periods of  time.  And then with the, you know, highly accommodative monetary policy  stance out of the Fed, it's really made for a back drop of easy access to  cheap capital for companies.  So, it really hasn't created a back drop to  easily distinguish between winners and losers from a stock picking  perspective.  </p><p> So, we think all of the trends are reversing course now.  </p><p> HERERA:  So, are you telling your clients to have a mix of both active and  passive?  </p><p> AGATI:  Yes, absolutely.  So we believe strongly that depending on the  cycle and also depending on the asset class mix, the mix of active and  passive can be different in every client's portfolio.  So, we're not fully  recommending 100 percent passive in portfolios, just as we wouldn't  recommend 100 percent active exposure as well.  There really is very much a  mix.  </p><p> HERERA:  All right.  On that note, Amanda Agati, thank you.  Amanda is with  PNC Financials.  </p><p> AGATI:  Thank you.  </p><p> GRIFFETH:  Soaring demand helps Delta's profits fly high, and that's where  we begin tonight's \"Market Focus\".  </p><p> The airline said today that the higher ticket prices and stronger sales for  its premium seats nearly offset the rise in its jet fuel costs.  Delta also  managed to keep a tight lid on other costs as well, leading to an overall  earnings beat.  And when it comes to rising rates, Delta thinks it stands  to benefit as well.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> ED BASTIAN, DELTA CEO:  The demand we are looking at in 8 percent growth in  Q4 in terms of top line growth.  So, demand is continuing strong.  At  Delta, we paid down the vast majority of our debt.  We got the investment  grade rating back.  Our debt level is arguably lowest in our history.  </p><p> We also have, still have the pension liability and as interest rates climb,  it actually causes the pension liability to come down.  So, we'll probably  be a net beneficiary on the balance sheet from a rise in rates.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> GRIFFETH:  Delta shares took off, up more than 3 percent today to $51.48.  </p><p> In the meantime, Lockheed Martin's F-35 fighter jets have been temporarily  grounded.  The Pentagon says that fuel tubes are being examined after the  Joint Strike Fighter jets crashed last month in South Carolina.  The F-35  is the most expensive weapon system in the U.S. military.  The inspection  of the 320 jets currently in operation is expected to be completed in two  days.  Lockheed shares were down 3 percent to $326.26.  </p><p> HERERA:  PayPal is teaming up with Walmart to provide financial services  and products to their shared customers.  The program will mark the first  time PayPal's mobile app users will be able to take cash out of their  PayPal account in a brick and mortar environment.  PayPal shares rose a  fraction to $75.90.  Meanwhile, shares of Walmart were down nearly 2  percent to $93.92.</p><p>RH, the retailer formerly known as Restoration Hardware, plans to buy back  up $700 million worth of shares.  In a statement, the CEO of the home  furnishings company says he believes the stock is undervalued and the  repurchase reflects confidence in the business.  Shares of RH climbed 10  percent to $118.62.  </p><p> GRIFFETH:  Walgreens Boots Alliance today became the first Dow component to  report its earnings for this season.  And while the company is not facing  direct headwinds from China or rising interest rates, it is trying to  overcome challenges of its own.  </p><p> Bertha Coombs takes a look at Walgreen's mixed quarter.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> BERTHA COOMBS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Walgreens earnings  results topped analyst expectations despite disappointing revenues, driven  in part by strong prescription volume growth.  The company says its share  of the U.S. prescription market is now about 22 percent, thanks in part to  the closing of its deal to buy more than 1,900 Rite Aid (NYSE:RAD) stores  earlier this year.  </p><p> But the firm's key chief financial officer admitted the profit margins on  specialty drugs were down year over year due to lower reimbursement.   Pharmacy benefit managers and insurers have been driving harder bargains on  brand name drug prices.  The drugstore's overall retail sales were down  from a year ago in part because they purposely deemphasized cigarette sales  as they shift their focus.  </p><p> Quote: We think we've done a good job in terms of shifting the emphasis to  become more of a health, beauty, wellness expert, co-COO Alex Gourlay told  analysts, adding that there's a lot more to go.  </p><p> To that end, Walgreens is expanding its relationship with Lab Corp.   They're going to be bringing more blood testing to 600 of their stores.   It's a strategic partnership.  So, a likely CVS (NYSE:CVS) Aetna (NYSE:AET)  merger poised to ramp up competition in drugstore clinics with more  integrated offering.  </p><p> For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Bertha Coombs, New York.</p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> HERERA:  Coming up, is there trouble in the Permian?  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BRIAN SULLIVAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  I'm Brian Sullivan  in the capital of the shale oil boom, Midland, Texas, where the combination  of low interest rates and higher oil prices had been great for the  industry.  But coming up on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, why many are concerned  if rates keep rising, all the debt that this industry is based on will come  back to haunt it.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> (MUSIC)</p><p> GRIFFETH:  We note it's your favorite segment.  Here's what to watch for  tomorrow.  </p><p> Earnings from J.P. Morgan, Citigroup (NYSE:C) and Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC)  are due.  Attention will be paid to loan growth and interest margins.  And  with the central bank rates and inflation in focus, investors will listen  to what a number of Fed officials have to say about the economy tomorrow as  well.  And we'll get a fresh read on consumer sentiment which has been a  driving force behind spending.  </p><p> And that's what we're watching for on Friday.  </p><p> HERERA:  The Postal Service is proposing the biggest stamp price hike in  its history, to help shore up its finances.  Under the proposal, the cost  of a Forever Stamp would rise from 50 cents to 55 cents.  The request from  the USPS board of governors must be proved by the postal regulatory  commission.  </p><p> GRIFFETH:  Well, starting in January, Social Security recipients will see  their biggest pay raise in seven years.  Beneficiaries will receive a cost  of living adjustment of 2.8 percent for 2019.  For the average Social  Security recipient, that works out to an increase of $39 a month.  </p><p> The annual adjustment is based on changes in the so-called consumer price  index.  It affects roughly one in five Americans, including disabled  veterans and federal retirees.  </p><p> HERERA:  Oil prices slumped to more than two-week lows as global stock  markets fell and the government reported a bigger than expected build in  crude inventories.  The price of domestic crude settled just above $70 a  barrel.  That drop in oil prices coupled with rising rates is putting  pressure on the country's shale producers, many of them located in the  Permian Basin in Texas.  </p><p> And that is where we find Brian Sullivan tonight.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> SULLIVAN:  Here in West Texas, long timers in the oil and gas business will  tell you the industry has really built on three things, rock, people, and  money.  </p><p> The Permian basin of Texas, the richest oil area in America, has plenty of  the first, but always needs more of the other two.  And that's why some  people are beginning to question if the great American shale oil boom has  reached a peak, so-called good rock is plentiful here.  It's estimated  there are tens of billions of barrels of oil just waiting to be sucked out  of the ground.  </p><p> But to do that you need the oil and gas workers to do the job, something  that is increasingly hard to come by in a city 500 miles west of Houston  with one of the hottest real estate markets in the country.  </p><p> RON GUSEK, LIBERTY OILFIELD SERVICES:  Getting people to move here is a  difficult challenge.  Obviously, real estate, particularly troublesome in  that housing is very, very expensive, more expensive here than Houston or  Dallas or someplace like that.  And so, for younger families trying to come  here and start up, that's a lot to ask.  </p><p> SULLIVAN:  Locals have told us, some houses will sell in less than 24  hours.  Some workers live in hotels where rates can be eye-popping.  A  hotel like this can run nearly $400 per night.</p><p> But the biggest concern about the shale boom on Wall Street is not people,  it is debt.  Moody's estimates that some  $200 billion of oil and gas  company debt will mature in the next five years, with nearly $100 billion  of that alone coming from the exploration and production companies.  We  asked the head of research at Simmons Piper Jaffray about the impact rising  rates could have on the industry.  </p><p> BILL HERBERT, SIMMONS PIPER JAFFRAY:  Of course they matter.  Actually, the  collective balance sheet of the upstream sector with regard to EMP and oil  services are in much better shape than it's been in a long time.  Companies  are living with a much closer I guess proximity of cash flow.  And there's  been true capital allocation reform.  </p><p> So, effectively, I think that was a germane argument two or three years ago  when the companies were living well outside of cash flow.  But today,  coupled with pretty responsible balance sheets and living within closer  proximity of cash flow, I don't think it's nearly as alarming as it could  have been.  </p><p> SULLIVAN:  A few years ago, many oil and gas companies had almost no free  cash flow.  Now, they've gotten smarter and they've cleaned up their  balance sheets.  Low interest rates and higher oil prices have been a great  combination for the industry.  But if rates keep moving higher and oil  prices fall due to slowing economy, the booming shale oil industry and the  boom town of Midland, Texas, could find itself between a good rock and a  hard place.  </p><p> For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Brian Sullivan, Midland, Texas.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> GRIFFETH:  And before we go, another look at the day on Wall Street.   Another selloff.  The Dow down 545 points.  The Nasdaq was down 92.  The  S&amp;P was down 57.  </p><p> And don't forget, we've got those bank earnings starting tomorrow.  </p><p> HERERA:  Exactly.  </p><p> GRIFFETH:  It should be very interesting day again.  </p><p> HERERA:  We will see what Friday holds.  We hope you'll join us for that  tomorrow night.  In the meantime, that does it for us tonight.  I'm Sue  Herera.  Thanks for joining us.  </p><p> GRIFFETH:  I'm Bill Griffeth.  Have a great evening.  We'll see you  tomorrow.</p><p> END</p><p> Nightly Business Report transcripts and video are available on-line post  broadcast at <url normalizedValue=\"http://nbr.com\">http://nbr.com</url>.

Dell (NASDAQ:DELL) buys EMC (NYSE:EMC) in the biggest tech deal of all time, and Anheuser-Busch makes another bid -- or is that a Bud? -- for SABMiller in what would be one of the biggest takeovers ever.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SUE HERERA, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR: Blockbuster bust. Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) shares tank after it scrapped an experimental cholesterol drug that was once thought to have big potential.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">MATHISEN: And $7 trillion target. Why big investors are going after a sector that`s been slow to innovate -- the senior care market.</p><p>All that and more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Monday, October 12th.</p><p>HERERA: Good evening, everyone, and welcome.</p><p>We begin with two mega deals -- one that`s done; another that`s still developing.</p><p>Dell (NASDAQ:DELL) is buying EMC (NYSE:EMC) for $67 billion, making it the largest technology deal ever. The other deal isn`t done quite yet. But Anheuser-Busch InBev just sweetened its offer for SABMiller, hoping the higher price can seal the deal, and if it does, it would be one of the largest takeovers of all time.</p><p>So, let`s start with the tech tie-up, which we told you about last week when with was in the works. It sent shares of EMC (NYSE:EMC) higher today. Dell (NASDAQ:DELL) is privately held.</p><p>But is there a big risk to doing a big deal like this one, and which companies might be next?</p><p>Josh Lipton has our report tonight.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JOSH LIPTON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Dell (NASDAQ:DELL) founder and chief executive Michael Dell (NASDAQ:DELL) will lead the combined company as chairman and chief executive. He says this deal creates an enterprise powerhouse.</p><p>MICHAEL DELL, DELL CHAIRMAN AND CEO: We started back in about 2002, and for about a decade worked together. At one point, the relationship was about a $2 billion annual run rate. And, you know, this is really all about bringing together complementary technologies and helping our customers address challenges and opportunities that this digital future is creating.</p><p>LIPTON: Analysts say the IT hardware market which includes companies selling storage and servers still generates a lot of cash but the stock prices have come under pressure because of the threat from newer technologies like cloud computing. And that means this is a market ripe for consolidation.</p><p>BRENT BRACELIN, PACIFIC CREST SECURITIES: Being bigger, being able to protect cash flows, reinvest some of the cash flows, I think makes a tremendous amount of strategic sense given the stage we`re at and frankly given the tipping point we see where some of the disruptions from cloud could start to accelerate now.</p><p>LIPTON: Bracelin highlights one name to watch, NetApp (NASDAQ:NTAP). The data storage company he says is worth north of $35 per share in a consolidation scenario. NetApp (NASDAQ:NTAP) in a statement to CNBC said that the Dell (NASDAQ:DELL)-EMC (NYSE:EMC) deal does not fundamentally change the competitive landscape and in fact could provide the company with a chance to take market share.</p><p>Of course, big tech deals pose real risk. For instance, HP bought Compaq in 2001 for $25 billion, in a move meant to create a tech giant that could take on IBM. Critics charge that the acquisition was ultimately a dud leading to a plunging stock price and thousands of layoffs.</p><p>On the other hand, analysts are fans of Facebook`s decision to buy WhatsApp for $19 billion. They see the messaging service potentially disrupting the telecom industry.</p><p>Despite the risk, there is the expectation of more mergers in the IT hardware space. Consolidation could make real sense for companies lacking growth but boasting plenty of cash and cheap valuations.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Josh Lipton in San Francisco.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN: And now to the potential deal that could create a beer behemoth, controlling nearly a third of the world`s beer market. Shares of Anheuser-Busch InBev did fall slightly today after it increased its offer for SABMiller, which trades over in London.</p><p>But big hurdles still remain before an agreement could be hammered out and as Morgan Brennan explained, under British law, the clock is ticking.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MORGAN BRENNAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Call it round 4. Today, AB InBev upping its price for SABMiller as clock ticks down to a Wednesday deadline.</p><p>The world`s biggest brewer raising its offer for its top rival to 43 1/2 pounds per share in cash, plus shares in stock as an alternative for the largest stakeholders. That works out to an estimate $103 billion, in what would be one of the largest takeovers in history. AB InBev noting the improved proposal hinges on both Altria Group (NYSE:MO), SABMiller`s top shareholder, and Bevco, the number two shareholder controlled by the Colombia`s Santo Domingo family, opting for the partial share alternative, which would include a combo of cash and stock.</p><p>No word yet from SABMiller, which owns Peroni and Miller Lite on this latest offer. But analysts say the key will be BevCo agreeing to the new price.</p><p>CAROLINE LEVY, CLSA: I think what the new bid does is keep the door open for negotiations because at this point, up until this point, SAB really hasn`t let AB In to discuss anything. They`re making -- they`re proposing an offer. They haven`t made a formal offer, and unless they get some level of detail and communication from SAB, they`re really not going to be able to do that.</p><p>BRENNAN: The higher offer comes after three previously rejected ones. At just 42 pounds per share last week and 40 pounds and 38 pounds prior to that.</p><p>This past Friday, after the last refusal, SAB raise its cost savings target to more than a billion dollars by 2020, a move meant to highlight its strength as a stand-alone company.</p><p>Now, negotiations are getting down to the wire. According to U.K. takeover rules, AB InBev, which owns Budweiser and Stella Artois, has until noon eastern on Wednesday to submit a final bid or walk away for at least six months, unless SABMiller asks for an extension to continue negotiating.</p><p>If a deal does emerge this week, the proposed powerhouse would claim nearly a third of the global beer market with total annual sales estimated at upwards of $70 billion. The proposed transaction would then be likely to face intense regulatory scrutiny that could result in the divestiture of certain brands and certain markets including the Miller Coors business at SABMiller owns in a joint venture with Molson Coors.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Morgan Brennan.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN: So thirsty.</p><p>And late today, \"Reuters\" reports that the Department of Justice is separately looking into allegation that`s Anheuser Busch InBev tried to curb competition from craft brewers by buying up distributors.</p><p>HERERA: It`s been a buoyant year so far for M&amp;A deals, but as we approach the end of the year, will we see deal making pick up steam?</p><p>Jeff Bistrong is managing director at Harris (NYSE:HRS) Williams, which specialize in M&amp;A, and he joins us now.</p><p>Jeff, welcome. Nice to have you here.</p><p>JEFF BISTRONG, HARRIS WILLLIAMS MANAGING DIRECTOR: Thank you very much.</p><p>HERERA: I guess one of the big questions is, one, what`s fueling this M&amp;A and does the end of the year necessarily represent kind of a deadline for some of these companies to do deals or could we see this trend continue into the new year?</p><p>BISTRONG: I`ll start with the first point. In fueling the tremendous activity in M&amp;A is really the availability of capital across many different sources, both for corporate and financial investors. That remains strong, and we expect it to continue to remain strong through the end of the year. Certainly, we expect deal flow to remain healthy in the fourth quarter but then continue into 2016.</p><p>MATHISEN: You know, I can see the reason for the EMC (NYSE:EMC)-Dell (NASDAQ:DELL) deal. It seems like a classic sort of strategic partnership here. I can see the reasons for the SAB-InBev possible deal.</p><p>But are these being driven by the desire to go out and buy or acquire growth or a desire to increase profitability by cutting expenses? Or both?</p><p>BISTRONG: It`s certainly all of the above. It is attractive to acquire revenue because their currency for acquisition, whether it`s stock or cash or debt is very reasonably priced in the market today. So it`s easy to make acquisitions. And also there`s tremendous opportunity across industries to rationalize businesses, drive technology through them, and improve profitability.</p><p>HERERA: But, Jeff, you know, a lot of people are pointing to this EMC (NYSE:EMC) deal and also the beer deal as one of them would be the biggest takeover practically in history and the other is the biggest technology takeover deal and the world \"bubble\" comes to mind.</p><p>Do you see in any sign of frothiness in the market with deals of this size coming to market as quickly as they have been?</p><p>BISTRONG: I think it would be right to say we`re at peak or near peak levels in M&amp;A. But what we have been at some time. Instead of a bubble, we`d call it a plateau. We`ve been at elevated M&amp;A levels both in terms of volume and valuation on deals for some time.</p><p>What you`re seeing is these larger transformational acquisitions. And we believe that this sustained period of strong M&amp;A opportunity is reflecting out in bigger deals. If anything, these large deals reflect a buyer`s belief that the broader economy will remain strong and they`ll be able to make good on these acquisitions. Therefore, we believe it`s going to be a sustainable market.</p><p>HERERA: Very interesting.</p><p>Jeff, thank you so much. Jeff Bistrong with Harris (NYSE:HRS) Williams.</p><p>BISTRONG: Thanks.</p><p>MATHISEN: And on Wall Street today, stocks began the week with gains as investors prepared for earnings reports from some of the world`s biggest companies later this week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rising now seven straight sessions, up 47 points today to 17,131. NASDAQ gained eight. And the S&amp;P 500 added a whopping 2.</p><p>But the gains were capped as a drop in oil prices weighed on energy shares.</p><p>HERERA: And one reason for that decline in oil was a report from OPEC that showed a rise in output last month to a little bit more than a three-year high. The oil cartel also said it expects U.S. production to fall next year for the first time in eight years.</p><p>By the settlement, domestic crude was down 5 percent to $47.10.</p><p>MATHISEN: And despite the decline in oil prices today, they have been rising steadily over the past month. But the energy markets are waiting for some key reports out of China this week. For clues on future demand from the world`s top energy consumer.</p><p>Seema Mody now with why this week is an important one for investors across the globe.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SEEMA MODY, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Strong start to the month for emerging markets but crucial data out of China this week could change the emerging markets story, starting with trade data tomorrow. A look at China`s import-export picture will provide evidence on just how much economic activity is slowing. Inflation on Wednesday will tell us whether China is in fact dealing with a deflation problem and bank lending, a good indicator of how healthy the consumer is and whether they are taking out loans will come out by Thursday.</p><p>Disappointing data could prompt the Chinese Central Bank to introduce new stimulus measures, but the bigger concern is whether China will devalue its currency again to boost trade, a move that would reignite the global currency war fears. Something Washington is keeping a close eye on.</p><p>But some investors say the China fears are overblown and are recommending clients to look not only at China but Indonesia and India for opportunities.</p><p>DAVID HERRO, HARRIS ASSOCIATES: Looking at places like Indonesia, India, and perhaps even China, there are some better macro stories, especially in India and Indonesia. And again, these are big places. India`s over a billion people. Indonesia, you know, has hundreds of millions of people. They`re growing at 4 percent, 5 percent, 6 percent a year. Even China, perhaps even China has bottomed.</p><p>MODY: And we`ll learn more about China`s overall economic growth when it releases GDP numbers one week from today. In the meantime, the Chinese stock market, the Shanghai Composite, is trading at a seven-week high after a senior central banker from China said the stock market correction is, quote, \"almost over.\"</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Seema Mody.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: As we mentioned, the focus this week will also be on earnings. Big financial firms are set to report and investors will be paying attention since that sector has the second biggest weighting in the S&amp;P 500. Tomorrow, we hear from JP Morgan. Wednesday, Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) and Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC). Thursday, Citigroup (NYSE:C) and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) release their results.</p><p>According to Thomson Reuters (NYSE:TRI), financial companies are expected to show earnings growth of more than 8 percent versus a decline overall for the S&amp;P 500.</p><p>MATHISEN: And still ahead, as Americans age, investors see big opportunity to the tune of a $7 trillion market and growing.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>HERERA: Shares of Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) had their worst day since 2008. The drug company is halting the development of an experimental cholesterol drug. The stock sank 7 percent after it was determined that the drug wasn`t effective in a clinical trial.</p><p>Meg Tirrell has more now on this cholesterol drug setback.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MEG TIRRELL, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Tough day for Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY). The company stopping development of a big cholesterol drug that was in the last stages of clinical studies because an outside advisory board said it looked like the drug wasn`t going to work.</p><p>Analysts had really focused on this as one of the most important pipeline products for Lilly, saying it could be a potentially $5 billion product if it was successful. Now, this class of cholesterol drugs was thought to be important because you can take them by pill. As opposed to the big class that just got approved from Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN) and Regeneron Sanofi which are injectable drugs. There is another drug in this class known as CEPT inhibitors being developed by Merck (NYSE:MRK).</p><p>So, in addition to Lilly`s stock getting hit today, you did see a little bit of a read-through into Merck (NYSE:MRK) being weighed on as well, as folks wondered if we`d see a similar negative outcome for that drug.</p><p>Now, some positive read-through to those drugs from Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN) and Regeneron Sanofi as analysts said this removes a potential competitor to those. So, you did see the stocks of those companies going up.</p><p>Now, there`s another company we should mention, Asperion. It`s a smaller drug maker working on yet on another kind of cholesterol drug aiming to lower bad cholesterol.</p><p>Now, originally, that stock rose as well as the others from Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN) and Regeneron Sanofi because folks thought it would lessen the competitive landscape. But as the day went on, that stock fell as folks started to worry that company would need to do what are more known as outcome studies, before getting approval of this drug.</p><p>So, because this market is so big, millions of patients in the United States, billions of dollars potentially at stake, a lot of stocks moving on this big negative surprise from Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY).</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Meg Tirrell.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN: Ferrari is getting ready to offer shares to the public. Today, Fiat Chrysler announced the launch of its Ferrari spinoff and that it plans to sell a nearly 9 percent stake in the automaker in its initial public offering. The shares will price between $48 and $52. And will raise about a billion from investors. Shares will trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the very apt ticker symbol RACE.</p><p>HERERA: Meantime, Standard &amp; Poor`s downgrading Volkswagen`s credit rating, citing the emissions scandal. The automaker`s short-term corporate credit rating was cut to A-minus from A. The ratings agency will keep Volkswagen on credit watch negative and could lower its rating even further.</p><p>Now, separately, the Volkswagen emissions scandal has also damaged Germany`s brand. According to a report by Brand Finance, Germany has lost its position as the most powerful national brand with its value tumbling more than $190 billion.</p><p>MATHISEN: Ford announcing a major invest in China, and that is where we begin tonight`s \"Market Focus\".</p><p>The automaker intends to invest nearly 2 billion over the next five years into smart cars in China, an area where it has seen sales decline. Ford hopes that new features such as smartphone connectivity and control will help it better compete against growing competition. Shares of Ford off earlier in the day, but they ended a penny higher at $14.98.</p><p>Norwegian cruise lines also planning to invest in its Chinese business. The company is developing a ship that will cater especially to Chinese customers. The 4,200-passenger ship should set sail in mid-2017. And shares of Norwegian were up more than 3 percent today to $59.79.</p><p>The oil refiner Phillips 66 unveiled its 2016 capital budget today, and it plans to spend a billion less than this year. The company also intends to boost its buyback program by $2 billion. Shares of Phillips higher today by a little bit at $83.87.</p><p>HERERA: General Electric (NYSE:GE) is in talks with Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) to have that bank purchase more than $30 billion in loans, and that`s according to a Reuters report. In April, the company announced it was looking into selling 200 billion in assets as it looked to focus more on its core manufacturing businesses. Shares of both companies were flat today. GE closing at $28.09. Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) at $52.18.</p><p>Twitter is reportedly set to announce a cost-cutting plan that includes some layoffs. This news comes days after Jack Dorsey was named permanent CEO of the company, which has seen its shares fall sharply over the past year. On the news, shares were off almost 7 percent to $28.74.</p><p>And Ryder Systems cutting both its third quarter and full-year earnings forecast, sending shares of the truck rental company down sharply after the bell. The company said earnings were hit partially by an unexpected number of out of service vehicles in that quarter. Shares initially fell 6 percent on the news, but then closed the regular session down just a fraction to $75.65.</p><p>MATHISEN: Well, Sue, gas prices didn`t move much over the past two weeks. According to the Lundberg Survey, the average price of a gallon of regular gas dropped a half a cent to $2.34. The slowing decline is attributed to the rise in oil prices in recent weeks, but prices are still down, that is, on gasoline more than 90 cents a gallon from a year ago.</p><p>HERERA: And it`s partially because of those low gas prices that Social Security recipients will not get an increase in benefits next year. The annual cost of living adjustment is based on a government measure of inflation, which is down because of the drop in gas prices. This is just the third time in 40 years that there will be no rise in benefits. The official announcement will be made later this week.</p><p>MATHISEN: Senior care in the U.S., not surprisingly, a booming $7 trillion market, but it has been slow to change. Investors, however, are betting big now and are looking at ways to innovate and invest in this growing niche market.</p><p>Katy Fike is a partner at Generator Ventures, and co-founder of Aging 2.0. She`s one of those investors and joins us now.</p><p>Katy, welcome. Good to have you with us.</p><p>Aging 2.0 is called an accelerator. Tell me -- tell me what an accelerator does and in what sectors of this sort of aging market you`re finding the greatest values.</p><p>KATY FIKE, AGING 2.0 CO-FOUNDER: Sure. Yes, there`s accelerators in other industries and we really were the first to set up one in ageing and senior care. And we really work with them closely to help them understand the insights they need to address this market, as well as how to refine their product and think about messaging, think about usability and design. Then we help them with distribution and partnerships to help them get to scale, and we also help them with funding.</p><p>So, it`s really about finding these entrepreneurs who are working on these really important areas and helping them get to market faster. They`re working on a broad range of things from cognitive impairment to falls to medication management to help them stay independent.</p><p>HERERA: Exactly, because it`s complicated, isn`t it? A lot of those who are aging don`t want to or can`t afford to go into assisted living facilities. They`d rather stay in their homes. Then you have the wearable niche. You know, it`s a very complicated and multilayered area you`re invested in.</p><p>FIKE: It really is. That intersection of ageing and technology is very nuance. And you have to be very careful about how you do it. Senior care has traditionally been very high touch and low tech. And introduce technology, we have to be very thoughtful about how we can create high-tech but also high touch solutions.</p><p>And usability and design are really critical. And just getting the entrepreneurs closer to who they`re designing for, most of the entrepreneurs are in their 20s, 30s, and 40s, designing for problems they`re not experiencing. And so, we have to bridge that gap.</p><p>MATHISEN: What are you seeing -- this is obviously a finance and business show. What are you seeing that is in the pipeline or out there already that could help the aging population manage their money? Because it`s very complicated stuff, and sometimes that`s an area where control issues come into play, with children and so forth. What are you seeing there?</p><p>FIKE: I think one of the companies that actually was in our first accelerator program called True Link Financial. They developed a debit card to help protect against financial elder abuse, which is obviously a huge problem for this population, especially if cognitive impairment starts to come into play. And so, it gives more transparency to the family around spending, around being able to set limits, perhaps about donations or how much someone could spend with certain types of vendors.</p><p>So I think transparency and letting family, even if they`re spread out, have more insight into what`s being spent where. And that could be either with direct solutions like True Link or other more broad solutions like online banking or mint.com that help you all get a view into where the money is coming and going.</p><p>MATHISEN: Fascinating in a growing market.</p><p>Katy Fike, thank you very much, with Generator Ventures and Aging 2.0.</p><p>HERERA: And coming up, why some Americans don`t feel as optimistic about the economy as they once did.</p><p>But, first, how commodities and currencies fared today. The bond market was closed for the Columbus Day holiday.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>HERERA: Two Federal Reserve policy makers today suggested that a December rate hike is possible as long as the data doesn`t disappoint. Atlanta Fed President Dennis Lockhart said that he expects the central bank to raise interest rates this year. Separately, Chicago Fed President Charles Evans said as long as the increases are gradual, he could be persuaded to support a rate hike this year. Evans previously said he would prefer to wait until next year.</p><p>Both Evans and Lockhart are voting members of the central bank.</p><p>MATHISEN: But how do average Americans opposed to Fed presidents feel about the economy and the stock market, if they feel good, they tend to spend more. If they don`t, they may put off purchases.</p><p>Steve Liesman asked that question to people across the country in his quarterly all America economic survey.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>STEVE LIESMAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: The plunge in the stock market and weaker growth in the U.S. and abroad look to have taken a toll on optimism in America according to the latest CNBC/All America Economic survey.</p><p>The poll of 800 Americans found views on the current state of the economy about stable. But 32 percent of Americans now say the economy will get worse, up six points from the last survey. And the highest levels since the government shutdown in 2013. A fifth think the economy will get better, that`s the lowest level since 2008.</p><p>JAY CAMPBELL, HART RESEARCH ASSOCIATES SENIOR VP: We`ve been on the upswing for the past few quarters and we`re now on a very clear downswing with a pretty significant net negative set of feelings among the public right now.</p><p>The significant drop-off in optimism for the future is surprising given the ongoing sort of slow incremental increases in improvements in the economy. But people are clearly not feeling it entirely yet.</p><p>LIESMAN: Lackluster growth and the recent stock market dive look to be weighing on sentiment. Forty-six percent of the public say this is a bad time to invest in stocks. A 12-point gain from the June survey. Attitudes eroded among the wealthy and those with considerable sums in the stock market.</p><p>JOE LAVORGNA, DEUTSCHE BANK CHIEF U.S. ECONOMIST: The very rapid decline in stocks certainly is going to shaky think people`s decision to buy big ticket items. It certainly impacted the Fed`s decision not to raise rates.</p><p>LIESMAN: The danger is that these negative sentiments continue into the critical Christmas selling season. The optimistic view, lower gas prices combined with a turnaround in stocks and jobs to settle things down before consumers go shopping in earnest.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Steve Liesman.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: So, we wanted to know how you feel about the economy and your own prospects. So, we took our cameras outside to find out.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I just don`t know if the jobs that are being created are what people want.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I think it`s stabilizing right now. I`m working as a recruiter, and it seems like there are more jobs available. For a while, there were fewer jobs in general and people were really struggling, but I think things are moving up at least in my sector.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: In the `90s compared to today, my salary has dropped as far as working.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MATHISEN: And finally tonight, the Nobel Prize in Economics was awarded to a Princeton university professor. Angus Deaton is one of the leading experts on poverty and has done research in India, South Africa, and other parts of the developing world. After being honored, Deaton said he foresees a decline in poverty but is concerned about upward trends in inequality.</p><p>Back to the preceding story there, I think the political uncertainty going into the election year also causes people to feel less confident economically.</p><p>HERERA: Absolutely. They want to know who`s going to be running the country. Congress isn`t getting a lot -- there`s a lot of turmoil.</p><p>MATHISEN: A lot of turmoil on the horizon.</p><p>HERERA: I agree.</p><p>That does it for NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for tonight. I`m Sue Herera. Thanks for watching.</p><p>MATHISEN: And I`m Tyler Mathisen. Thanks from me as well. Have a great evening, everybody. And we will see you right back here tomorrow night.</p><p>Nightly Business Report transcripts and video are available on-line post broadcast at <url normalizedValue=\"http://nbr.com\">http://nbr.com</url>.

The other deal isn't done quite yet. But Anheuser-Busch InBev just sweetened its offer for SABMiller, hoping the higher price can seal the deal, and if it does, it would be one of the largest takeovers of all time.</p><p>So, let's start with the tech tie-up, which we told you about last week when with was in the works. It sent shares of EMC (NYSE:EMC) higher today. Dell (NASDAQ:DELL) is privately held.</p><p>But is there a big risk to doing a big deal like this one, and which companies might be next?</p><p>Josh Lipton has our report tonight.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JOSH LIPTON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Dell (NASDAQ:DELL) founder and chief executive Michael Dell (NASDAQ:DELL) will lead the combined company as chairman and chief executive. He says this deal creates an enterprise powerhouse.</p><p>MICHAEL DELL, DELL CHAIRMAN AND CEO: We started back in about 2002, and for about a decade worked together. At one point, the relationship was about a $2 billion annual run rate. And, you know, this is really all about bringing together complementary technologies and helping our customers address challenges and opportunities that this digital future is creating.</p><p>LIPTON: Analysts say the IT hardware market which includes companies selling storage and servers still generates a lot of cash but the stock prices have come under pressure because of the threat from newer technologies like cloud computing. And that means this is a market ripe for consolidation.</p><p>BRENT BRACELIN, PACIFIC CREST SECURITIES: Being bigger, being able to protect cash flows, reinvest some of the cash flows, I think makes a tremendous amount of strategic sense given the stage we're at and frankly given the tipping point we see where some of the disruptions from cloud could start to accelerate now.</p><p>LIPTON: Bracelin highlights one name to watch, NetApp (NASDAQ:NTAP). The data storage company he says is worth north of $35 per share in a consolidation scenario. NetApp (NASDAQ:NTAP) in a statement to CNBC said that the Dell (NASDAQ:DELL)-EMC (NYSE:EMC) deal does not fundamentally change the competitive landscape and in fact could provide the company with a chance to take market share.</p><p>Of course, big tech deals pose real risk. For instance, HP bought Compaq in 2001 for $25 billion, in a move meant to create a tech giant that could take on IBM. Critics charge that the acquisition was ultimately a dud leading to a plunging stock price and thousands of layoffs.</p><p>On the other hand, analysts are fans of Facebook's decision to buy WhatsApp for $19 billion. They see the messaging service potentially disrupting the telecom industry.</p><p>Despite the risk, there is the expectation of more mergers in the IT hardware space. Consolidation could make real sense for companies lacking growth but boasting plenty of cash and cheap valuations.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Josh Lipton in San Francisco.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN: And now to the potential deal that could create a beer behemoth, controlling nearly a third of the world's beer market. Shares of Anheuser-Busch InBev did fall slightly today after it increased its offer for SABMiller, which trades over in London.</p><p>But big hurdles still remain before an agreement could be hammered out and as Morgan Brennan explained, under British law, the clock is ticking.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MORGAN BRENNAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Call it round 4. Today, AB InBev upping its price for SABMiller as clock ticks down to a Wednesday deadline.</p><p>The world's biggest brewer raising its offer for its top rival to 43 1/2 pounds per share in cash, plus shares in stock as an alternative for the largest stakeholders. That works out to an estimate $103 billion, in what would be one of the largest takeovers in history. AB InBev noting the improved proposal hinges on both Altria Group (NYSE:MO), SABMiller's top shareholder, and Bevco, the number two shareholder controlled by the Colombia's Santo Domingo family, opting for the partial share alternative, which would include a combo of cash and stock.</p><p>No word yet from SABMiller, which owns Peroni and Miller Lite on this latest offer. But analysts say the key will be BevCo agreeing to the new price.</p><p>CAROLINE LEVY, CLSA: I think what the new bid does is keep the door open for negotiations because at this point, up until this point, SAB really hasn't let AB In to discuss anything. They're making -- they're proposing an offer. They haven't made a formal offer, and unless they get some level of detail and communication from SAB, they're really not going to be able to do that.</p><p>BRENNAN: The higher offer comes after three previously rejected ones. At just 42 pounds per share last week and 40 pounds and 38 pounds prior to that.</p><p>This past Friday, after the last refusal, SAB raise its cost savings target to more than a billion dollars by 2020, a move meant to highlight its strength as a stand-alone company.</p><p>Now, negotiations are getting down to the wire. According to U.K. takeover rules, AB InBev, which owns Budweiser and Stella Artois, has until noon eastern on Wednesday to submit a final bid or walk away for at least six months, unless SABMiller asks for an extension to continue negotiating.</p><p>If a deal does emerge this week, the proposed powerhouse would claim nearly a third of the global beer market with total annual sales estimated at upwards of $70 billion. The proposed transaction would then be likely to face intense regulatory scrutiny that could result in the divestiture of certain brands and certain markets including the Miller Coors business at SABMiller owns in a joint venture with Molson Coors.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Morgan Brennan.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN: So thirsty.</p><p>And late today, \"Reuters\" reports that the Department of Justice is separately looking into allegation that's Anheuser Busch InBev tried to curb competition from craft brewers by buying up distributors.</p><p>HERERA: It's been a buoyant year so far for M&amp;A deals, but as we approach the end of the year, will we see deal making pick up steam?</p><p>Jeff Bistrong is managing director at Harris (NYSE:HRS) Williams, which specialize in M&amp;A, and he joins us now.</p><p>Jeff, welcome. Nice to have you here.</p><p>JEFF BISTRONG, HARRIS WILLLIAMS MANAGING DIRECTOR: Thank you very much.</p><p>HERERA: I guess one of the big questions is, one, what's fueling this M&amp;A and does the end of the year necessarily represent kind of a deadline for some of these companies to do deals or could we see this trend continue into the new year?</p><p>BISTRONG: I'll start with the first point. In fueling the tremendous activity in M&amp;A is really the availability of capital across many different sources, both for corporate and financial investors. That remains strong, and we expect it to continue to remain strong through the end of the year. Certainly, we expect deal flow to remain healthy in the fourth quarter but then continue into 2016.</p><p>MATHISEN: You know, I can see the reason for the EMC (NYSE:EMC)-Dell (NASDAQ:DELL) deal. It seems like a classic sort of strategic partnership here. I can see the reasons for the SAB-InBev possible deal.</p><p>But are these being driven by the desire to go out and buy or acquire growth or a desire to increase profitability by cutting expenses? Or both?</p><p>BISTRONG: It's certainly all of the above. It is attractive to acquire revenue because their currency for acquisition, whether it's stock or cash or debt is very reasonably priced in the market today. So it's easy to make acquisitions. And also there's tremendous opportunity across industries to rationalize businesses, drive technology through them, and improve profitability.</p><p>HERERA: But, Jeff, you know, a lot of people are pointing to this EMC (NYSE:EMC) deal and also the beer deal as one of them would be the biggest takeover practically in history and the other is the biggest technology takeover deal and the world \"bubble\" comes to mind.</p><p>Do you see in any sign of frothiness in the market with deals of this size coming to market as quickly as they have been?</p><p>BISTRONG: I think it would be right to say we're at peak or near peak levels in M&amp;A. But what we have been at some time. Instead of a bubble, we'd call it a plateau. We've been at elevated M&amp;A levels both in terms of volume and valuation on deals for some time.</p><p>What you're seeing is these larger transformational acquisitions. And we believe that this sustained period of strong M&amp;A opportunity is reflecting out in bigger deals. If anything, these large deals reflect a buyer's belief that the broader economy will remain strong and they'll be able to make good on these acquisitions. Therefore, we believe it's going to be a sustainable market.</p><p>HERERA: Very interesting.</p><p>Jeff, thank you so much. Jeff Bistrong with Harris (NYSE:HRS) Williams.</p><p>BISTRONG: Thanks.</p><p>MATHISEN: And on Wall Street today, stocks began the week with gains as investors prepared for earnings reports from some of the world's biggest companies later this week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rising now seven straight sessions, up 47 points today to 17,131. NASDAQ gained eight. And the S&amp;P 500 added a whopping 2.</p><p>But the gains were capped as a drop in oil prices weighed on energy shares.</p><p>HERERA: And one reason for that decline in oil was a report from OPEC that showed a rise in output last month to a little bit more than a three-year high. The oil cartel also said it expects U.S. production to fall next year for the first time in eight years.</p><p>By the settlement, domestic crude was down 5 percent to $47.10.</p><p>MATHISEN: And despite the decline in oil prices today, they have been rising steadily over the past month. But the energy markets are waiting for some key reports out of China this week. For clues on future demand from the world's top energy consumer.</p><p>Seema Mody now with why this week is an important one for investors across the globe.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SEEMA MODY, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Strong start to the month for emerging markets but crucial data out of China this week could change the emerging markets story, starting with trade data tomorrow. A look at China's import-export picture will provide evidence on just how much economic activity is slowing. Inflation on Wednesday will tell us whether China is in fact dealing with a deflation problem and bank lending, a good indicator of how healthy the consumer is and whether they are taking out loans will come out by Thursday.</p><p>Disappointing data could prompt the Chinese Central Bank to introduce new stimulus measures, but the bigger concern is whether China will devalue its currency again to boost trade, a move that would reignite the global currency war fears. Something Washington is keeping a close eye on.</p><p>But some investors say the China fears are overblown and are recommending clients to look not only at China but Indonesia and India for opportunities.</p><p>DAVID HERRO, HARRIS ASSOCIATES: Looking at places like Indonesia, India, and perhaps even China, there are some better macro stories, especially in India and Indonesia. And again, these are big places. India's over a billion people. Indonesia, you know, has hundreds of millions of people. They're growing at 4 percent, 5 percent, 6 percent a year. Even China, perhaps even China has bottomed.</p><p>MODY: And we'll learn more about China's overall economic growth when it releases GDP numbers one week from today. In the meantime, the Chinese stock market, the Shanghai Composite, is trading at a seven-week high after a senior central banker from China said the stock market correction is, quote, \"almost over.\"</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Seema Mody.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: As we mentioned, the focus this week will also be on earnings. Big financial firms are set to report and investors will be paying attention since that sector has the second biggest weighting in the S&amp;P 500. Tomorrow, we hear from JP Morgan. Wednesday, Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) and Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC). Thursday, Citigroup (NYSE:C) and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) release their results.</p><p>According to Thomson Reuters (NYSE:TRI), financial companies are expected to show earnings growth of more than 8 percent versus a decline overall for the S&amp;P 500.</p><p>MATHISEN: And still ahead, as Americans age, investors see big opportunity to the tune of a $7 trillion market and growing.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>HERERA: Shares of Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) had their worst day since 2008. The drug company is halting the development of an experimental cholesterol drug. The stock sank 7 percent after it was determined that the drug wasn't effective in a clinical trial.</p><p>Meg Tirrell has more now on this cholesterol drug setback.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MEG TIRRELL, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Tough day for Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY). The company stopping development of a big cholesterol drug that was in the last stages of clinical studies because an outside advisory board said it looked like the drug wasn't going to work.</p><p>Analysts had really focused on this as one of the most important pipeline products for Lilly, saying it could be a potentially $5 billion product if it was successful. Now, this class of cholesterol drugs was thought to be important because you can take them by pill. As opposed to the big class that just got approved from Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN) and Regeneron Sanofi which are injectable drugs. There is another drug in this class known as CEPT inhibitors being developed by Merck (NYSE:MRK).</p><p>So, in addition to Lilly's stock getting hit today, you did see a little bit of a read-through into Merck (NYSE:MRK) being weighed on as well, as folks wondered if we'd see a similar negative outcome for that drug.</p><p>Now, some positive read-through to those drugs from Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN) and Regeneron Sanofi as analysts said this removes a potential competitor to those. So, you did see the stocks of those companies going up.</p><p>Now, there's another company we should mention, Asperion. It's a smaller drug maker working on yet on another kind of cholesterol drug aiming to lower bad cholesterol.</p><p>Now, originally, that stock rose as well as the others from Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN) and Regeneron Sanofi because folks thought it would lessen the competitive landscape. But as the day went on, that stock fell as folks started to worry that company would need to do what are more known as outcome studies, before getting approval of this drug.</p><p>So, because this market is so big, millions of patients in the United States, billions of dollars potentially at stake, a lot of stocks moving on this big negative surprise from Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY).</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Meg Tirrell.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN: Ferrari is getting ready to offer shares to the public. Today, Fiat Chrysler announced the launch of its Ferrari spinoff and that it plans to sell a nearly 9 percent stake in the automaker in its initial public offering. The shares will price between $48 and $52. And will raise about a billion from investors. Shares will trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the very apt ticker symbol RACE.</p><p>HERERA: Meantime, Standard &amp; Poor's downgrading Volkswagen's credit rating, citing the emissions scandal. The automaker's short-term corporate credit rating was cut to A-minus from A. The ratings agency will keep Volkswagen on credit watch negative and could lower its rating even further.</p><p>Now, separately, the Volkswagen emissions scandal has also damaged Germany's brand. According to a report by Brand Finance, Germany has lost its position as the most powerful national brand with its value tumbling more than $190 billion.</p><p>MATHISEN: Ford announcing a major invest in China, and that is where we begin tonight's \"Market Focus\".</p><p>The automaker intends to invest nearly 2 billion over the next five years into smart cars in China, an area where it has seen sales decline. Ford hopes that new features such as smartphone connectivity and control will help it better compete against growing competition. Shares of Ford off earlier in the day, but they ended a penny higher at $14.98.</p><p>Norwegian cruise lines also planning to invest in its Chinese business. The company is developing a ship that will cater especially to Chinese customers. The 4,200-passenger ship should set sail in mid-2017. And shares of Norwegian were up more than 3 percent today to $59.79.</p><p>The oil refiner Phillips 66 unveiled its 2016 capital budget today, and it plans to spend a billion less than this year. The company also intends to boost its buyback program by $2 billion. Shares of Phillips higher today by a little bit at $83.87.</p><p>HERERA: General Electric (NYSE:GE) is in talks with Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) to have that bank purchase more than $30 billion in loans, and that's according to a Reuters report. In April, the company announced it was looking into selling 200 billion in assets as it looked to focus more on its core manufacturing businesses. Shares of both companies were flat today. GE closing at $28.09. Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) at $52.18.</p><p>Twitter is reportedly set to announce a cost-cutting plan that includes some layoffs. This news comes days after Jack Dorsey was named permanent CEO of the company, which has seen its shares fall sharply over the past year. On the news, shares were off almost 7 percent to $28.74.</p><p>And Ryder Systems cutting both its third quarter and full-year earnings forecast, sending shares of the truck rental company down sharply after the bell. The company said earnings were hit partially by an unexpected number of out of service vehicles in that quarter. Shares initially fell 6 percent on the news, but then closed the regular session down just a fraction to $75.65.</p><p>MATHISEN: Well, Sue, gas prices didn't move much over the past two weeks. According to the Lundberg Survey, the average price of a gallon of regular gas dropped a half a cent to $2.34. The slowing decline is attributed to the rise in oil prices in recent weeks, but prices are still down, that is, on gasoline more than 90 cents a gallon from a year ago.</p><p>HERERA: And it's partially because of those low gas prices that Social Security recipients will not get an increase in benefits next year. The annual cost of living adjustment is based on a government measure of inflation, which is down because of the drop in gas prices. This is just the third time in 40 years that there will be no rise in benefits. The official announcement will be made later this week.</p><p>MATHISEN: Senior care in the U.S., not surprisingly, a booming $7 trillion market, but it has been slow to change. Investors, however, are betting big now and are looking at ways to innovate and invest in this growing niche market.</p><p>Katy Fike is a partner at Generator Ventures, and co-founder of Aging 2.0. She's one of those investors and joins us now.</p><p>Katy, welcome. Good to have you with us.</p><p>Aging 2.0 is called an accelerator. Tell me -- tell me what an accelerator does and in what sectors of this sort of aging market you're finding the greatest values.</p><p>KATY FIKE, AGING 2.0 CO-FOUNDER: Sure. Yes, there's accelerators in other industries and we really were the first to set up one in ageing and senior care. And we really work with them closely to help them understand the insights they need to address this market, as well as how to refine their product and think about messaging, think about usability and design. Then we help them with distribution and partnerships to help them get to scale, and we also help them with funding.</p><p>So, it's really about finding these entrepreneurs who are working on these really important areas and helping them get to market faster. They're working on a broad range of things from cognitive impairment to falls to medication management to help them stay independent.</p><p>HERERA: Exactly, because it's complicated, isn't it? A lot of those who are aging don't want to or can't afford to go into assisted living facilities. They'd rather stay in their homes. Then you have the wearable niche. You know, it's a very complicated and multilayered area you're invested in.</p><p>FIKE: It really is. That intersection of ageing and technology is very nuance. And you have to be very careful about how you do it. Senior care has traditionally been very high touch and low tech. And introduce technology, we have to be very thoughtful about how we can create high-tech but also high touch solutions.</p><p>And usability and design are really critical. And just getting the entrepreneurs closer to who they're designing for, most of the entrepreneurs are in their 20s, 30s, and 40s, designing for problems they're not experiencing. And so, we have to bridge that gap.</p><p>MATHISEN: What are you seeing -- this is obviously a finance and business show. What are you seeing that is in the pipeline or out there already that could help the aging population manage their money? Because it's very complicated stuff, and sometimes that's an area where control issues come into play, with children and so forth. What are you seeing there?</p><p>FIKE: I think one of the companies that actually was in our first accelerator program called True Link Financial. They developed a debit card to help protect against financial elder abuse, which is obviously a huge problem for this population, especially if cognitive impairment starts to come into play. And so, it gives more transparency to the family around spending, around being able to set limits, perhaps about donations or how much someone could spend with certain types of vendors.</p><p>So I think transparency and letting family, even if they're spread out, have more insight into what's being spent where. And that could be either with direct solutions like True Link or other more broad solutions like online banking or mint.com that help you all get a view into where the money is coming and going.</p><p>MATHISEN: Fascinating in a growing market.</p><p>Katy Fike, thank you very much, with Generator Ventures and Aging 2.0.</p><p>HERERA: And coming up, why some Americans don't feel as optimistic about the economy as they once did.</p><p>But, first, how commodities and currencies fared today. The bond market was closed for the Columbus Day holiday.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>HERERA: Two Federal Reserve policy makers today suggested that a December rate hike is possible as long as the data doesn't disappoint. Atlanta Fed President Dennis Lockhart said that he expects the central bank to raise interest rates this year. Separately, Chicago Fed President Charles Evans said as long as the increases are gradual, he could be persuaded to support a rate hike this year. Evans previously said he would prefer to wait until next year.</p><p>Both Evans and Lockhart are voting members of the central bank.</p><p>MATHISEN: But how do average Americans opposed to Fed presidents feel about the economy and the stock market, if they feel good, they tend to spend more. If they don't, they may put off purchases.</p><p>Steve Liesman asked that question to people across the country in his quarterly all America economic survey.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>STEVE LIESMAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: The plunge in the stock market and weaker growth in the U.S. and abroad look to have taken a toll on optimism in America according to the latest CNBC/All America Economic survey.</p><p>The poll of 800 Americans found views on the current state of the economy about stable. But 32 percent of Americans now say the economy will get worse, up six points from the last survey. And the highest levels since the government shutdown in 2013. A fifth think the economy will get better, that's the lowest level since 2008.</p><p>JAY CAMPBELL, HART RESEARCH ASSOCIATES SENIOR VP: We've been on the upswing for the past few quarters and we're now on a very clear downswing with a pretty significant net negative set of feelings among the public right now.</p><p>The significant drop-off in optimism for the future is surprising given the ongoing sort of slow incremental increases in improvements in the economy. But people are clearly not feeling it entirely yet.</p><p>LIESMAN: Lackluster growth and the recent stock market dive look to be weighing on sentiment. Forty-six percent of the public say this is a bad time to invest in stocks. A 12-point gain from the June survey. Attitudes eroded among the wealthy and those with considerable sums in the stock market.</p><p>JOE LAVORGNA, DEUTSCHE BANK CHIEF U.S. ECONOMIST: The very rapid decline in stocks certainly is going to shaky think people's decision to buy big ticket items. It certainly impacted the Fed's decision not to raise rates.</p><p>LIESMAN: The danger is that these negative sentiments continue into the critical Christmas selling season. The optimistic view, lower gas prices combined with a turnaround in stocks and jobs to settle things down before consumers go shopping in earnest.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Steve Liesman.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: So, we wanted to know how you feel about the economy and your own prospects. So, we took our cameras outside to find out.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I just don't know if the jobs that are being created are what people want.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I think it's stabilizing right now. I'm working as a recruiter, and it seems like there are more jobs available. For a while, there were fewer jobs in general and people were really struggling, but I think things are moving up at least in my sector.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: In the '90s compared to today, my salary has dropped as far as working.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MATHISEN: And finally tonight, the Nobel Prize in Economics was awarded to a Princeton university professor. Angus Deaton is one of the leading experts on poverty and has done research in India, South Africa, and other parts of the developing world. After being honored, Deaton said he foresees a decline in poverty but is concerned about upward trends in inequality.</p><p>Back to the preceding story there, I think the political uncertainty going into the election year also causes people to feel less confident economically.</p><p>HERERA: Absolutely. They want to know who's going to be running the country. Congress isn't getting a lot -- there's a lot of turmoil.</p><p>MATHISEN: A lot of turmoil on the horizon.</p><p>HERERA: I agree.</p><p>That does it for NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for tonight. I'm Sue Herera. Thanks for watching.</p><p>MATHISEN: And I'm Tyler Mathisen. Thanks from me as well. Have a great evening, everybody. And we will see you right back here tomorrow night.</p><p>END</p><p>Nightly Business Report transcripts and video are available on-line post broadcast at <url normalizedValue=\"http://nbr.com\">http://nbr.com</url>.

Dell  (NASDAQ:DELL) buys EMC (NYSE:EMC) in the biggest tech deal of all time, and  Anheuser-Busch makes another bid -- or is that a Bud? -- for SABMiller in  what would be one of the biggest takeovers ever.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SUE HERERA, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR:  Blockbuster bust.  Eli  Lilly (NYSE:LLY) shares tank after it scrapped an experimental cholesterol  drug that was once thought to have big potential.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">MATHISEN:  And $7 trillion target.  Why big investors are going after  a sector that's been slow to innovate -- the senior care market.  </p><p>All that and more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Monday,  October 12th. </p><p>HERERA:  Good evening, everyone, and welcome. </p><p>We begin with two mega deals -- one that's done; another that's still  developing.  </p><p>Dell (NASDAQ:DELL) is buying EMC (NYSE:EMC) for $67 billion, making  it the largest technology deal ever.  The other deal isn't done quite yet.   But Anheuser-Busch InBev just sweetened its offer for SABMiller, hoping the  higher price can seal the deal, and if it does, it would be one of the  largest takeovers of all time.  </p><p>So, let's start with the tech tie-up, which we told you about last  week when with was in the works.  It sent shares of EMC (NYSE:EMC) higher  today.  Dell (NASDAQ:DELL) is privately held.  </p><p>But is there a big risk to doing a big deal like this one, and which  companies might be next?</p><p>Josh Lipton has our report tonight.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JOSH LIPTON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Dell  (NASDAQ:DELL) founder and chief executive Michael Dell (NASDAQ:DELL) will  lead the combined company as chairman and chief executive.  He says this  deal creates an enterprise powerhouse.  </p><p>MICHAEL DELL, DELL CHAIRMAN AND CEO:  We started back in about 2002,  and for about a decade worked together.  At one point, the relationship was  about a $2 billion annual run rate.  And, you know, this is really all  about bringing together complementary technologies and helping our  customers address challenges and opportunities that this digital future is  creating.  </p><p>LIPTON:  Analysts say the IT hardware market which includes companies  selling storage and servers still generates a lot of cash but the stock  prices have come under pressure because of the threat from newer  technologies like cloud computing.  And that means this is a market ripe  for consolidation.  </p><p>BRENT BRACELIN, PACIFIC CREST SECURITIES:  Being bigger, being able  to protect cash flows, reinvest some of the cash flows, I think makes a  tremendous amount of strategic sense given the stage we're at and frankly  given the tipping point we see where some of the disruptions from cloud  could start to accelerate now.  </p><p>LIPTON:  Bracelin highlights one name to watch, NetApp (NASDAQ:NTAP).   The data storage company he says is worth north of $35 per share in a  consolidation scenario.  NetApp (NASDAQ:NTAP) in a statement to CNBC said  that the Dell (NASDAQ:DELL)-EMC (NYSE:EMC) deal does not fundamentally  change the competitive landscape and in fact could provide the company with  a chance to take market share.  </p><p>Of course, big tech deals pose real risk.  For instance, HP bought  Compaq in 2001 for $25 billion, in a move meant to create a tech giant that  could take on IBM.  Critics charge that the acquisition was ultimately a  dud leading to a plunging stock price and thousands of layoffs.  </p><p>On the other hand, analysts are fans of Facebook's decision to buy  WhatsApp for $19 billion.  They see the messaging service potentially  disrupting the telecom industry.  </p><p>Despite the risk, there is the expectation of more mergers in the IT  hardware space.  Consolidation could make real sense for companies lacking  growth but boasting plenty of cash and cheap valuations.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Josh Lipton in San Francisco. </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN:  And now to the potential deal that could create a beer  behemoth, controlling nearly a third of the world's beer market.  Shares of  Anheuser-Busch InBev did fall slightly today after it increased its offer  for SABMiller, which trades over in London.  </p><p>But big hurdles still remain before an agreement could be hammered  out and as Morgan Brennan explained, under British law, the clock is  ticking.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MORGAN BRENNAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Call it round  4.  Today, AB InBev upping its price for SABMiller as clock ticks down to a  Wednesday deadline.  </p><p>The world's biggest brewer raising its offer for its top rival to 43  1/2 pounds per share in cash, plus shares in stock as an alternative for  the largest stakeholders.  That works out to an estimate $103 billion, in  what would be one of the largest takeovers in history.  AB InBev noting the  improved proposal hinges on both Altria Group (NYSE:MO), SABMiller's top  shareholder, and Bevco, the number two shareholder controlled by the  Colombia's Santo Domingo family, opting for the partial share alternative,  which would include a combo of cash and stock.  </p><p>No word yet from SABMiller, which owns Peroni and Miller Lite on this  latest offer.  But analysts say the key will be BevCo agreeing to the new  price.  </p><p>CAROLINE LEVY, CLSA:  I think what the new bid does is keep the door  open for negotiations because at this point, up until this point, SAB  really hasn't let AB In to discuss anything.  They're making -- they're  proposing an offer.  They haven't made a formal offer, and unless they get  some level of detail and communication from SAB, they're really not going  to be able to do that.  </p><p>BRENNAN:  The higher offer comes after three previously rejected  ones.  At just 42 pounds per share last week and 40 pounds and 38 pounds  prior to that.  </p><p>This past Friday, after the last refusal, SAB raise its cost savings  target to more than a billion dollars by 2020, a move meant to highlight  its strength as a stand-alone company.  </p><p>Now, negotiations are getting down to the wire.  According to U.K.  takeover rules, AB InBev, which owns Budweiser and Stella Artois, has until  noon eastern on Wednesday to submit a final bid or walk away for at least  six months, unless SABMiller asks for an extension to continue negotiating.  </p><p>If a deal does emerge this week, the proposed powerhouse would claim  nearly a third of the global beer market with total annual sales estimated  at upwards of $70 billion.  The proposed transaction would then be likely  to face intense regulatory scrutiny that could result in the divestiture of  certain brands and certain markets including the Miller Coors business at  SABMiller owns in a joint venture with Molson Coors.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Morgan Brennan.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN:  So thirsty.  </p><p>And late today, \"Reuters\" reports that the Department of Justice is  separately looking into allegation that's Anheuser Busch InBev tried to  curb competition from craft brewers by buying up distributors.  </p><p>HERERA:  It's been a buoyant year so far for M&amp;A deals, but as we  approach the end of the year, will we see deal making pick up steam?  </p><p>Jeff Bistrong is managing director at Harris (NYSE:HRS) Williams,  which specialize in M&amp;A, and he joins us now.  </p><p>Jeff, welcome.  Nice to have you here.  </p><p>JEFF BISTRONG, HARRIS WILLLIAMS MANAGING DIRECTOR:  Thank you very  much.  </p><p>HERERA:  I guess one of the big questions is, one, what's fueling  this M&amp;A and does the end of the year necessarily represent kind of a  deadline for some of these companies to do deals or could we see this trend  continue into the new year?  </p><p>BISTRONG:  I'll start with the first point.  In fueling the  tremendous activity in M&amp;A is really the availability of capital across  many different sources, both for corporate and financial investors.  That  remains strong, and we expect it to continue to remain strong through the  end of the year.  Certainly, we expect deal flow to remain healthy in the  fourth quarter but then continue into 2016.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  You know, I can see the reason for the EMC (NYSE:EMC)-Dell  (NASDAQ:DELL) deal.  It seems like a classic sort of strategic partnership  here.  I can see the reasons for the SAB-InBev possible deal.</p><p>But are these being driven by the desire to go out and buy or acquire  growth or a desire to increase profitability by cutting expenses?  Or both?  </p><p>BISTRONG:  It's certainly all of the above.  It is attractive to  acquire revenue because their currency for acquisition, whether it's stock  or cash or debt is very reasonably priced in the market today.  So it's  easy to make acquisitions.  And also there's tremendous opportunity across  industries to rationalize businesses, drive technology through them, and  improve profitability.  </p><p>HERERA:  But, Jeff, you know, a lot of people are pointing to this  EMC (NYSE:EMC) deal and also the beer deal as one of them would be the  biggest takeover practically in history and the other is the biggest  technology takeover deal and the world \"bubble\" comes to mind.  </p><p>Do you see in any sign of frothiness in the market with deals of this  size coming to market as quickly as they have been?  </p><p>BISTRONG:  I think it would be right to say we're at peak or near  peak levels in M&amp;A.  But what we have been at some time.  Instead of a  bubble, we'd call it a plateau.  We've been at elevated M&amp;A levels both in  terms of volume and valuation on deals for some time.  </p><p>What you're seeing is these larger transformational acquisitions.   And we believe that this sustained period of strong M&amp;A opportunity is  reflecting out in bigger deals.  If anything, these large deals reflect a  buyer's belief that the broader economy will remain strong and they'll be  able to make good on these acquisitions.  Therefore, we believe it's going  to be a sustainable market.  </p><p>HERERA:  Very interesting.  </p><p>Jeff, thank you so much.  Jeff Bistrong with Harris (NYSE:HRS)  Williams.</p><p>BISTRONG:  Thanks.</p><p>MATHISEN:  And on Wall Street today, stocks began the week with gains  as investors prepared for earnings reports from some of the world's biggest  companies later this week.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average rising now  seven straight sessions, up 47 points today to 17,131.  NASDAQ gained  eight.  And the S&amp;P 500 added a whopping 2.  </p><p>But the gains were capped as a drop in oil prices weighed on energy  shares.  </p><p>HERERA:  And one reason for that decline in oil was a report from  OPEC that showed a rise in output last month to a little bit more than a  three-year high.  The oil cartel also said it expects U.S. production to  fall next year for the first time in eight years.  </p><p>By the settlement, domestic crude was down 5 percent to $47.10.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  And despite the decline in oil prices today, they have  been rising steadily over the past month.  But the energy markets are  waiting for some key reports out of China this week.  For clues on future  demand from the world's top energy consumer.  </p><p>Seema Mody now with why this week is an important one for investors  across the globe.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SEEMA MODY, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Strong start to  the month for emerging markets but crucial data out of China this week  could change the emerging markets story, starting with trade data tomorrow.   A look at China's import-export picture will provide evidence on just how  much economic activity is slowing.  Inflation on Wednesday will tell us  whether China is in fact dealing with a deflation problem and bank lending,  a good indicator of how healthy the consumer is and whether they are taking  out loans will come out by Thursday.</p><p>Disappointing data could prompt the Chinese Central Bank to introduce  new stimulus measures, but the bigger concern is whether China will devalue  its currency again to boost trade, a move that would reignite the global  currency war fears.  Something Washington is keeping a close eye on.  </p><p>But some investors say the China fears are overblown and are  recommending clients to look not only at China but Indonesia and India for  opportunities.  </p><p>DAVID HERRO, HARRIS ASSOCIATES:  Looking at places like Indonesia,  India, and perhaps even China, there are some better macro stories,  especially in India and Indonesia.  And again, these are big places.   India's over a billion people.  Indonesia, you know, has hundreds of  millions of people.  They're growing at 4 percent, 5 percent, 6 percent a  year.  Even China, perhaps even China has bottomed.  </p><p>MODY:  And we'll learn more about China's overall economic growth  when it releases GDP numbers one week from today.  In the meantime, the  Chinese stock market, the Shanghai Composite, is trading at a seven-week  high after a senior central banker from China said the stock market  correction is, quote, \"almost over.\" </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Seema Mody.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  As we mentioned, the focus this week will also be on  earnings.  Big financial firms are set to report and investors will be  paying attention since that sector has the second biggest weighting in the  S&amp;P 500.  Tomorrow, we hear from JP Morgan.  Wednesday, Bank of America  (NYSE:BAC) and Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC).  Thursday, Citigroup (NYSE:C) and  Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) release their results.  </p><p>According to Thomson Reuters (NYSE:TRI), financial companies are  expected to show earnings growth of more than 8 percent versus a decline  overall for the S&amp;P 500. </p><p>MATHISEN:  And still ahead, as Americans age, investors see big  opportunity to the tune of a $7 trillion market and growing.  </p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>HERERA:  Shares of Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) had their worst day since  2008.  The drug company is halting the development of an experimental  cholesterol drug.  The stock sank 7 percent after it was determined that  the drug wasn't effective in a clinical trial.  </p><p>Meg Tirrell has more now on this cholesterol drug setback.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MEG TIRRELL, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Tough day for  Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY).  The company stopping development of a big  cholesterol drug that was in the last stages of clinical studies because an  outside advisory board said it looked like the drug wasn't going to work.  </p><p>Analysts had really focused on this as one of the most important  pipeline products for Lilly, saying it could be a potentially $5 billion  product if it was successful.  Now, this class of cholesterol drugs was  thought to be important because you can take them by pill.  As opposed to  the big class that just got approved from Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN) and Regeneron  Sanofi which are injectable drugs.  There is another drug in this class  known as CEPT inhibitors being developed by Merck (NYSE:MRK).  </p><p>So, in addition to Lilly's stock getting hit today, you did see a  little bit of a read-through into Merck (NYSE:MRK) being weighed on as  well, as folks wondered if we'd see a similar negative outcome for that  drug.  </p><p>Now, some positive read-through to those drugs from Amgen  (NASDAQ:AMGN) and Regeneron Sanofi as analysts said this removes a  potential competitor to those.  So, you did see the stocks of those  companies going up.  </p><p>Now, there's another company we should mention, Asperion.  It's a  smaller drug maker working on yet on another kind of cholesterol drug  aiming to lower bad cholesterol.  </p><p>Now, originally, that stock rose as well as the others from Amgen  (NASDAQ:AMGN) and Regeneron Sanofi because folks thought it would lessen  the competitive landscape.  But as the day went on, that stock fell as  folks started to worry that company would need to do what are more known as  outcome studies, before getting approval of this drug.  </p><p>So, because this market is so big, millions of patients in the United  States, billions of dollars potentially at stake, a lot of stocks moving on  this big negative surprise from Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY).  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Meg Tirrell.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN:  Ferrari is getting ready to offer shares to the public.   Today, Fiat Chrysler announced the launch of its Ferrari spinoff and that  it plans to sell a nearly 9 percent stake in the automaker in its initial  public offering.  The shares will price between $48 and $52.  And will  raise about a billion from investors.  Shares will trade on the New York  Stock Exchange under the very apt ticker symbol RACE.  </p><p>HERERA:  Meantime, Standard &amp; Poor's downgrading Volkswagen's credit  rating, citing the emissions scandal.  The automaker's short-term corporate  credit rating was cut to A-minus from A.  The ratings agency will keep  Volkswagen on credit watch negative and could lower its rating even  further.  </p><p>Now, separately, the Volkswagen emissions scandal has also damaged  Germany's brand.  According to a report by Brand Finance, Germany has lost  its position as the most powerful national brand with its value tumbling  more than $190 billion.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  Ford announcing a major invest in China, and that is where  we begin tonight's \"Market Focus\".</p><p>The automaker intends to invest nearly 2 billion over the next five  years into smart cars in China, an area where it has seen sales decline.   Ford hopes that new features such as smartphone connectivity and control  will help it better compete against growing competition.  Shares of Ford  off earlier in the day, but they ended a penny higher at $14.98.  </p><p>Norwegian cruise lines also planning to invest in its Chinese  business.  The company is developing a ship that will cater especially to  Chinese customers.  The 4,200-passenger ship should set sail in mid-2017.   And shares of Norwegian were up more than 3 percent today to $59.79.  </p><p>The oil refiner Phillips 66 unveiled its 2016 capital budget today,  and it plans to spend a billion less than this year.  The company also  intends to boost its buyback program by $2 billion.  Shares of Phillips  higher today by a little bit at $83.87.  </p><p>HERERA:  General Electric (NYSE:GE) is in talks with Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) to have that bank purchase more than $30 billion in loans, and  that's according to a Reuters report.  In April, the company announced it  was looking into selling 200 billion in assets as it looked to focus more  on its core manufacturing businesses.  Shares of both companies were flat  today.  GE closing at $28.09.  Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) at $52.18.  </p><p>Twitter is reportedly set to announce a cost-cutting plan that  includes some layoffs.  This news comes days after Jack Dorsey was named  permanent CEO of the company, which has seen its shares fall sharply over  the past year.  On the news, shares were off almost 7 percent to $28.74.  </p><p>And Ryder Systems cutting both its third quarter and full-year  earnings forecast, sending shares of the truck rental company down sharply  after the bell.  The company said earnings were hit partially by an  unexpected number of out of service vehicles in that quarter.  Shares  initially fell 6 percent on the news, but then closed the regular session  down just a fraction to $75.65.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  Well, Sue, gas prices didn't move much over the past two  weeks.  According to the Lundberg Survey, the average price of a gallon of  regular gas dropped a half a cent to $2.34.  The slowing decline is  attributed to the rise in oil prices in recent weeks, but prices are still  down, that is, on gasoline more than 90 cents a gallon from a year ago.  </p><p>HERERA:  And it's partially because of those low gas prices that  Social Security recipients will not get an increase in benefits next year.   The annual cost of living adjustment is based on a government measure of  inflation, which is down because of the drop in gas prices.  This is just  the third time in 40 years that there will be no rise in benefits.  The  official announcement will be made later this week.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  Senior care in the U.S., not surprisingly, a booming $7  trillion market, but it has been slow to change.  Investors, however, are  betting big now and are looking at ways to innovate and invest in this  growing niche market.  </p><p>Katy Fike is a partner at Generator Ventures, and co-founder of Aging  2.0.  She's one of those investors and joins us now.  </p><p>Katy, welcome.  Good to have you with us.</p><p>Aging 2.0 is called an accelerator.  Tell me -- tell me what an  accelerator does and in what sectors of this sort of aging market you're  finding the greatest values.  </p><p>KATY FIKE, AGING 2.0 CO-FOUNDER:  Sure.  Yes, there's accelerators in  other industries and we really were the first to set up one in ageing and  senior care.  And we really work with them closely to help them understand  the insights they need to address this market, as well as how to refine  their product and think about messaging, think about usability and design.   Then we help them with distribution and partnerships to help them get to  scale, and we also help them with funding.  </p><p>So, it's really about finding these entrepreneurs who are working on  these really important areas and helping them get to market faster.   They're working on a broad range of things from cognitive impairment to  falls to medication management to help them stay independent.  </p><p>HERERA:  Exactly, because it's complicated, isn't it?  A lot of those  who are aging don't want to or can't afford to go into assisted living  facilities.  They'd rather stay in their homes.  Then you have the wearable  niche.  You know, it's a very complicated and multilayered area you're  invested in.  </p><p>FIKE:  It really is.  That intersection of ageing and technology is  very nuance.  And you have to be very careful about how you do it.  Senior  care has traditionally been very high touch and low tech.  And introduce  technology, we have to be very thoughtful about how we can create high-tech  but also high touch solutions.  </p><p>And usability and design are really critical.  And just getting the  entrepreneurs closer to who they're designing for, most of the  entrepreneurs are in their 20s, 30s, and 40s, designing for problems  they're not experiencing.  And so, we have to bridge that gap.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  What are you seeing -- this is obviously a finance and  business show.  What are you seeing that is in the pipeline or out there  already that could help the aging population manage their money?  Because  it's very complicated stuff, and sometimes that's an area where control  issues come into play, with children and so forth.  What are you seeing  there?  </p><p>FIKE:  I think one of the companies that actually was in our first  accelerator program called True Link Financial.  They developed a debit  card to help protect against financial elder abuse, which is obviously a  huge problem for this population, especially if cognitive impairment starts  to come into play.  And so, it gives more transparency to the family around  spending, around being able to set limits, perhaps about donations or how  much someone could spend with certain types of vendors.  </p><p>So I think transparency and letting family, even if they're spread  out, have more insight into what's being spent where.  And that could be  either with direct solutions like True Link or other more broad solutions  like online banking or mint.com that help you all get a view into where the  money is coming and going.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  Fascinating in a growing market.  </p><p>Katy Fike, thank you very much, with Generator Ventures and Aging  2.0.  </p><p>HERERA:  And coming up, why some Americans don't feel as optimistic  about the economy as they once did.  </p><p>But, first, how commodities and currencies fared today.  The bond  market was closed for the Columbus Day holiday.  </p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>HERERA:  Two Federal Reserve policy makers today suggested that a  December rate hike is possible as long as the data doesn't disappoint.   Atlanta Fed President Dennis Lockhart said that he expects the central bank  to raise interest rates this year.  Separately, Chicago Fed President  Charles Evans said as long as the increases are gradual, he could be  persuaded to support a rate hike this year.  Evans previously said he would  prefer to wait until next year.  </p><p>Both Evans and Lockhart are voting members of the central bank.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  But how do average Americans opposed to Fed presidents  feel about the economy and the stock market, if they feel good, they tend  to spend more.  If they don't, they may put off purchases.  </p><p>Steve Liesman asked that question to people across the country in his  quarterly all America economic survey.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>STEVE LIESMAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  The plunge in  the stock market and weaker growth in the U.S. and abroad look to have  taken a toll on optimism in America according to the latest CNBC/All  America Economic survey.  </p><p>The poll of 800 Americans found views on the current state of the  economy about stable.  But 32 percent of Americans now say the economy will  get worse, up six points from the last survey.  And the highest levels  since the government shutdown in 2013.  A fifth think the economy will get  better, that's the lowest level since 2008.  </p><p>JAY CAMPBELL, HART RESEARCH ASSOCIATES SENIOR VP:  We've been on the  upswing for the past few quarters and we're now on a very clear downswing  with a pretty significant net negative set of feelings among the public  right now.  </p><p>The significant drop-off in optimism for the future is surprising  given the ongoing sort of slow incremental increases in improvements in the  economy.  But people are clearly not feeling it entirely yet.  </p><p>LIESMAN:  Lackluster growth and the recent stock market dive look to  be weighing on sentiment.  Forty-six percent of the public say this is a  bad time to invest in stocks.  A 12-point gain from the June survey.   Attitudes eroded among the wealthy and those with considerable sums in the  stock market.  </p><p>JOE LAVORGNA, DEUTSCHE BANK CHIEF U.S. ECONOMIST:  The very rapid  decline in stocks certainly is going to shaky think people's decision to  buy big ticket items.  It certainly impacted the Fed's decision not to  raise rates.  </p><p>LIESMAN:  The danger is that these negative sentiments continue into  the critical Christmas selling season.  The optimistic view, lower gas  prices combined with a turnaround in stocks and jobs to settle things down  before consumers go shopping in earnest.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Steve Liesman.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  So, we wanted to know how you feel about the economy and  your own prospects.  So, we took our cameras outside to find out.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I just don't know if the jobs that are being  created are what people want.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I think it's stabilizing right now.  I'm working  as a recruiter, and it seems like there are more jobs available.  For a  while, there were fewer jobs in general and people were really struggling,  but I think things are moving up at least in my sector.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  In the '90s compared to today, my salary has  dropped as far as working.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MATHISEN:  And finally tonight, the Nobel Prize in Economics was  awarded to a Princeton university professor.  Angus Deaton is one of the  leading experts on poverty and has done research in India, South Africa,  and other parts of the developing world.  After being honored, Deaton said  he foresees a decline in poverty but is concerned about upward trends in  inequality.</p><p>Back to the preceding story there, I think the political uncertainty  going into the election year also causes people to feel less confident  economically.  </p><p>HERERA:  Absolutely.  They want to know who's going to be running the  country.  Congress isn't getting a lot -- there's a lot of turmoil.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  A lot of turmoil on the horizon.  </p><p>HERERA:  I agree.  </p><p>That does it for NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for tonight.  I'm Sue  Herera.  Thanks for watching.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  And I'm Tyler Mathisen.  Thanks from me as well.  Have a  great evening, everybody.  And we will see you right back here tomorrow  night.  </p><p>END</p><p>Nightly Business Report transcripts and video are available on-line post  broadcast at <url normalizedValue=\"http://nbr.com\">http://nbr.com</url>.

Stocks  take a breather from their record run as investors gear up for a very busy  earnings week.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Retirement crisis: 401(k) plans may be safe for now, but that does not  change the fact that many Americans have little save for their later years.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> New bellwethers.  You know, GE used to be one, but there may be other  companies that better reflect current economic trends.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Those stories and more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for this Monday,  October the 23rd.</p><p> Good evening, everybody.  I'm Bill Griffeth, coming to you tonight from the  New York Stock Exchange.  Both Tyler Mathisen and Sue Herera are off  tonight.  So, it's just you and me.  Let's do this, shall we?</p><p> Here on Wall Street, stocks pulled back from record levels to start this  week.  The Dow snapped its six-day win streak as shares of General Electric  (NYSE:GE) weighed on investor sentiment and saw their biggest decline in  six years.  We'll have more on that story in a moment.</p><p> But, first, the closing numbers.  The Dow did hit an intraday high today in  record territory, but finally fell 54 points at the close to 23,273.  The  Nasdaq was down by 42 points, the S&amp;P fell by 10.  </p><p> The prospects of tax reform has long been a big driver for this stock  market, but one tax proposal that got a lot of a buzz over the weekend was  changing popular 401(k) retirement plans.  That's likely not going to  happen.</p><p> But the president this morning tweeted: There will be no change to your  401(k).  This has always been a great and popular middle-class tax break  that works and it stays.  </p><p> There had been reports that Republicans in Congress were weighing a  proposal that would significantly reduce the income that workers could save  in these accounts as a way to offset lost revenue with tax reform.  </p><p> And all that talk about retirement just highlighted one major problem right  now: most Americans don't have enough save for their later years.</p><p> Bob Pisani has the grim details for us tonight.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> BOB PISANI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  The dust-up over 401(k)  is a good opportunity to remind everyone how bad the state of the average  person's retirement plan isn't cutting 401(k)s.  That only make it worse.  </p><p> The good news the total value of investment in 401(k)s and other defined  contribution plans are at a new high, thanks to the stock market rally.   The bad news is the numbers are still terrible.  Americans don't save  enough for their retirement with or without 401(k)s.  </p><p> According to Vanguard, 94 million Americans are covered by defined  contribution accounts like 401(k)s.  Assets are in excess to $7 trillion.   Oh, sounds like a lot of money.  Well, it is.  </p><p> But when you really drill down, there's not a lot in the accounts.  The  median account for 35 to 40-year-olds has only $23,000 and 65 and over,  only have $60,000.  </p><p> Let's assume at 65, you're going to live another 20 years, $60,000 isn't  much to live on spread out over 20 years.  We need personal savings because  the contributions from Social Security and pensions are modest.  It's about  $13,000 a year for Social Security right now, a little more than $10,000  per year from private pensions, but only a third of Americans collect  pensions, so private savings are critical for helping people through  retirement. </p><p> But most people don't even contribute the maximum out to their 401(k)s  likely because they either can't afford to or they'd rather spend the  money.  There's been other proposals floated to help investors save money.  </p><p> A universal savings account where investors contribute after-tax money, but  the gain on the accounts are tax-free, has been successfully implemented in  Canada and the U.K.  Investors could take out money at any time without  paying taxes or penalties.</p><p> One thing's for sure, if we don't find some way to get people to save more,  a lot of people are going to work into their 80s or they're going to  outlive their money.</p><p> For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Bob Pisani at the New York Stock Exchange.</p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> GRIFFETH:  All right.  Here to talk more about this retirement crisis and  what you can do maybe to maximize your savings, joining us tonight, Diane  Oakley is executive director at the National Institute on Retirement  Security.  Eric Aanes is president of Titus Wealth Management.</p><p> Folks, thank you both for joining us tonight.</p><p> Diane, I well remember when defined contribution plans were introduced back  in the 1980s, with IRAs and 401(k)s.  Here we are at 30 years later, and we  see here that the median amount saved by a 65-year-old today is only  $60,000.</p><p> What happened?</p><p> DIANE OAKLEY, DIRECTOR, NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON RETIREMENT SECURITY:  You  know, I think what happened is a lot of Americans just couldn't afford to  say if we hear from people saying that with their salaries being somewhat  constrained and not growing that much, they just can't save enough.</p><p> GRIFFETH:  Eric, what do you think?  I mean, people are told, save a  certain amount, and then let the money grow.  But was that a flawed message  to Americans?</p><p> ERIC AANES, PRESIDENT, TITUS WEALTH MANAGEMENT:  Well, people need to start  earlier and save longer that's really the message.  In the old school of  defined benefit plans where company took care of you, they're just no  longer exist and I think it's all about education and making sure that  really people understand what -- as Albert Einstein call it the eighth  wonder of the world, compound interest -- understand what you'd have today  and what you could end up in the future if you're diligent with your plan.</p><p> GRIFFETH:  But what about Diane's point that people just can't afford to  save as much as they should right now?</p><p> AANES:  Well, that's a -- that's a whole another animal.  The end result is  you're going to have to do better budgeting.  You're going to have to  figure out where you can make some modifications to your budget and make  hard decisions if you do indeed want to reach your retirement goals.</p><p> GRIFFETH:  Dianne, the current camp now for a 401(k) to be -- for you to  save is, what, $18,000 year?  Is that what it is now?</p><p> OAKLEY:  Yes, it is.  </p><p> GRIFFETH:  And they're talking -- they were talking, I don't know, they  still haven't taken this back yet that may be reducing that sharply to  $2,400.  What would that do to the average person saving for retirement  right now?</p><p> OAKLEY:  You know, the average person just doesn't have that much to save  as it is, and if you cut that back so much when they get towards their  later years where maybe the kids have gotten through college and they've  got an ability to save, and they could finally max out, if they're going to  max out and the new max is $2,400 where it used to be $18,000, and it's  hard to catch up for what they lost over those years. </p><p> You know, people today tell you, you got to start in your 20s saving  fifteen percent of your pay.  If you don't do that until you're 35 or 40,  you've almost got to do 30 percent of your pay.  </p><p> And most people --  </p><p> GRIFFETH:  Right.</p><p> OAKLEY:  -- can't afford their bills today and do that kind of saving for  retirement.</p><p> GRIFFETH:  And, Eric, it's been a sort of a double whammy because we can't  be saved by the bond market, the fixed income market, because interest  rates have been so low for the last decade and there's no sign they're  going to rise that appreciably in the near future, right?</p><p> AANES:  That's true and that's why you really want to reverse-engineer your  plan and that that comes back to the fact of if I'm 25 or 30 today, and I'm  going to retire and I'm 65, well, how much do I need to save and what kind  of rate do I need to earn and really taking a look at your time horizon to  make sure that you can -- you can maybe be a little more aggressive as you  said, you know, fixed income if rates do rise.  It doesn't -- doesn't sound  like a wonderful time for bonds.  So, folks may have to get a little more  aggressive.</p><p> GRIFFETH:  I suspect we're preaching to the choir with our audience here on  the NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT they're very savvy investors to begin with.  </p><p> But, Eric, let's assume we've got a 65-year-old out there who has saved the  median of $60,000.  What do they do now?</p><p> AANES:  Well, that's a great question, Bill, because the safe and secure  method of investing just doesn't exist anymore.  You can't get anything at  the bank, and if you put it in bonds, the yields are pretty low.  So, they  do have to kind of venture into, you know, a bull market that maybe kind of  in the third or fourth quarter here.  So, that makes the decisions even a  little bit harder, but if your time horizon is long enough having a  diversified plan can still make some sense for you.  </p><p> GRIFFETH:  Diane, there are many types of plans these days, you know, with  the Roth IRAs that are out there, in addition to the traditional IRAs, the  catch-up IRAs.  I mean, is it too complicated for the average person who  just doesn't pay that much attention to investments these days?</p><p> OAKLEY:  You know, it is complicated.  It used to be simple when grandpa  had a pension plan, and it actually worked pretty well for grandpa.  The  real question is, as you're looking at retiring and you've got different  products to save, if you don't have it through your employer, it makes it  that much harder because you don't have the convenience of having money  come right out of your paycheck and go right into your retirement account.  </p><p> And so, that's a key and an important thing to make sure that people have  the access through an employer, and I think if you go to a low cap, you'd  end up taking away the incentive for employers to offer plans.  </p><p> And quickly before we go, I know some states for small business owners that  can't afford to offer a plan of some kind Oregon, for example, now has  these retirement plans much like a college savings plan.  Is that a good  idea to get into if you can?</p><p> OAKLEY:  It is actually a good -- I think a lot of these states are  starting to look at the fact of how many people have nothing saved.  If you  look at the group of people aged 64 to 55, those individuals, you've got  about 60 percent of them who have less than one times their salary saved.   So, how do we get people to nudge into retirement savings by having it be  automatic like the plan is in Oregon.  And it is in about six other states  that are looking to bring these plans on board.</p><p> GRIFFETH:  Folks, thank you.  Diane Oakley with the National Institute on  Retirement Security and Eric Aanes with Titus Wealth Management, thanks for  joining us tonight.</p><p> AANES:  Thanks, Bill.</p><p> OAKLEY:  Thank you, Bill.</p><p> GRIFFETH:  As we mentioned, one stock weighing on the market today was  General Electric (NYSE:GE).  Shares of GE saw their biggest decline in six  years today, a number of brokerages cut their price targets on the stock,  citing higher chances of a dividend cut following that disappointing  earnings report last Friday.  The stock was off more than 6 percent on  heavy volume.  </p><p> GE was once considered a bellwether for the economy and whether it still is  or not is up for debate right now.  But today, some are looking to a new  batch of companies that they say are more reflective of the changing times.  </p><p> Dominic Chu has our story tonight.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> DOMINIC CHU, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  According to the  Merriam-Webster Dictionary, bellwether is defined as one that takes the  lead or initiative, also an indicator of trends.  Now trends in the stock  market change over time and so do the bellwethers of the market.  In  today's environment, it's easy to see Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) as a market  bellwether.  That's what Jones Trading chief market strategist Michael  O'Rourke says.  Not only is it the biggest company out there, it's also a  blend of technology and retail, which means it could be viewed as an  indicator of the consumer.</p><p> It's why Northern Trust (NASDAQ:NTRS) chief investment strategist Jim  McDonald says he picked Walmart.  He says the U.S. is a consumer-led  economy and Walmart is a good measure of consumer spending.  Some  estimates, of course, have over two-thirds of our economy driven by  consumer spending.  </p><p> Speaking of economic activity, Wunderlich Securities chief market  strategist Art Hogan says today's bellwether is FedEx (NYSE:FDX).  Simply  put, he feels like it's impossible to hide economic activity from  transportation companies like FedEx (NYSE:FDX), so it acts as a good  indicator. </p><p> And when it comes to a conglomerate, look no further than Berkshire  Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A).  Huntington Private Bank chief investment officer  John Augustine thinks Warren Buffett's company has a set of businesses that  are basically a smaller sample of the American economy, with everything  from insurance to retail to railroads to energy, et cetera.  </p><p> Now, everyone has a different view on what companies are the best  indicators of the market or economy right now, but one thing is for  certain, America and its top companies will always have to evolve with the  times.</p><p> For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Dominic Chu.</p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> GRIFFETH:  This is the busiest week for earnings, with more than 170  members of the S&amp;P 500 reporting results this week, twelve Dow components  among them.  And that includes McDonald's (NYSE:MCD), which has seen its  stock rise about percent just this year, and now, investors want to know if  there's a golden opportunity that could send that the shares even higher.</p><p> Kate Rogers (NYSE:ROG) tells us what to look for when McDonald's (NYSE:MCD)  reports first thing tomorrow morning.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> KATE ROGERS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Hurricanes Harvey and  Irma could have an impact on McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) results when the fast- food giant reports earnings.  The fast food chain has a large presence in  both Florida and Texas, but many say that impact could be temporary and are  focusing instead on delivery driving sales growth.  McDonald's (NYSE:MCD)  has been testing delivery in the U.S. via its McDelivery partnership with  UberEATS, which is now in countries and locations and could positively  impact same-store sales growth.  </p><p> R.J. HOTTOVY, MORNINGSTAR:  It has potential to add maybe a point, maybe  two points of same store sales growth in this quarter particularly with the  average transaction size being larger than in-store transactions.  That'll  be the big number I think a lot of people be looking for is, you know, what  kind of contribution this quarter and more importantly what can we expect  going forward.</p><p> ROGERS:  Another thing to keep an eye on our sales performance of newer  menu items, including buttermilk chicken tenders and the company's  continued push into fresh beef in 2018.  Last quarter the company offered  in earnings beat, thanks in part to discounts on McCafe beverages and  sodas, that national value promotion again will be in focus for tomorrow's  report. </p><p> HOTTOVY:  Delivery, the experience of the future kiosk ordering and mobile  order and pay, we need to see validation that this is on track and can be a  major contributor in the future.  Last couple quarters, we've seen benefits  from these programs internationally, and now start -- and now it's time for  those to start materializing in the U.S.</p><p> ROGERS:  Also look out for any mention of the experience of the future he  asks should be in 2,500 locations by the end of the year and mobile  ordering should be nationwide.</p><p> For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Kate Rogers (NYSE:ROG).</p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> GRIFFETH:  And still ahead, is big tech moving in on the turf of big banks?</p><p> (MUSIC)</p><p> GRIFFETH:  It turns out that Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) has received -- get this  -- more than 230 proposals from cities and regions around the country,  hoping to be the home of the company's second headquarters.  Proposals were  due last week.  Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) says that tax breaks and grants would  be a big deciding factor and that it promises to bring 50,000 new jobs and  to spend more than $5 billion on new construction.  The proposals came from  states as well as Washington, D.C. and Puerto Rico, three Mexican states  and six Canadian provinces.</p><p> So, how often do you use cash these days?  Probably a lot less than you  used to, and that's because more payments are going digital.  But it's not  necessarily the banks that are leading the way, but instead big technology  firms.</p><p> Deirdre Bosa reports from the Money 2020 Conference in Las Vegas.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> DEIRDRE BOSA, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  The future of money  big banks aren't leading the way technology companies are.  That's why some  of the biggest speakers that this year's Money Conference are from Apple  (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).  </p><p> Apple's vision of the future includes buying and selling things through the  iPhone and sending money through iMessage.</p><p> Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) sees you ordering from restaurants using its app and  paying with the information already stored in your account this was all  once the turf of traditional banks but if technology companies have their  way, that won't be the case for very long.  Tech giants are increasingly  moving further into payments, especially as banks lag behind in the  development of technologies like cloud computing, artificial intelligence  and big data analytics.  </p><p> It's still early days for tech giants and financial services, but they're  growing fast and a big question: would they want to actually become banks  and face the same regulations the banking industry does?</p><p> MAX LEVCHIN, AFFIRM FOUNDER AND CEO:  As any one of these companies decides  to get into anything from banking to a simpler universe of lending or  payments, they have to prepare for the entirety of the business to be  impacted by the regulatory oversight.  I think that that's a very complex  choice.</p><p> BOSA:  An Accenture study found that one out of three consumers globally  would consider using Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) or Facebook  (NASDAQ:FB) for banking services.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I think big tech represents an opportunity for the  banking industry to partner and capitalize on a lot of the innovation  that's available in the market, that the banks may not have the ability to  innovate around themselves. </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Yes, they will offer some banking services, but they  don't have to be a bank to do that because you have regulations and, you  know, the regulatory authorities and if the regulations are so strict, it's  hard to be a bank.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  If you can become a trusted -- it's around trust,  right?  If you can establish the trust with a consumer, and I think both of  those have the brands and the depths and the history to actually -- to  actually establish that trust with consumers, and they don't compromise  that trust, then absolutely, they could become banks, because banks are all  built on trust. </p><p> BOSA:  Even as companies like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN)  push further into financial services, banks are relying on them more  heavily for their expertise, and it could prove difficult for them to catch  up with those capabilities if the competition heats up.</p><p> For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Deirdre Bosa, Las Vegas.</p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> GRIFFETH:  Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) strikes a deal with BroadSoft (NASDAQ:BSFT)  and that's where we begin tonight's \"Market Focus\".</p><p> The networking technology company is paying nearly $2 billion to acquire  BroadSoft (NASDAQ:BSFT), which makes cloud-based communication software.   The deal is aimed at growing Cisco's subscription-based revenue and  expanding the company's services.  Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) shares closed  fractionally higher today to $34.35, shares of BroadSoft (NASDAQ:BSFT) rose  more than one-and-a-half percent to $54.80.</p><p> Meanwhile, toy maker Hasbro (NYSE:HAS) reported stronger than expected  earnings despite saying the results were hurt by the bankruptcy of its  biggest customer.  That would be Toys \"R\" Us.  But the maker of Monopoly,  which sold nearly 10 percent of its inventory through Toys \"R\" Us in the  quarter warned that sales in the future would be pressured during the  holiday shopping season because of that Toys \"R\" Us bankruptcy, and as a  result, Hasbro (NYSE:HAS) shares felt more than percent today to close at  $89.75.</p><p> Under Armour (NYSE:UA) is reportedly considering exiting some of its  smaller categories.  \"The Wall Street Journal\" says that the athletic  apparel maker is exploring getting out of the tennis outdoor gear and  fishing, in an effort to combat falling sales.  Under Armour (NYSE:UA) also  said that its co-founder Kip Fulks will take a sabbatical from the company.   Shares were up more than 3 percent today to close at $16.85.</p><p> Restructuring charges cause profits to miss the mark at specialty metals  maker Arconic.  The company topped analyst revenue expectations, also  lifted its guidance for the full year.  In addition, Arconic named former  GE executive Charles Blankenship as its new CEO.  But Arconic shares fell  by 10 percent, finished the day at $24.35.</p><p> And during a wide-ranging interview earlier today, Saudi billionaire  investor Prince Alwaleed bin Talal said the shares of Citigroup (NYSE:C)  could go above $100 and the Tesla's valuation is as he put it too  exuberant.  Mr. Alwaleed runs Kingdom Holdings, a massive conglomerate  based in Riyadh.  He also floated the idea that Saudi Arabia could list  more than 5 percent of the state oil giant Saudi Aramco in the coming  years.  </p><p> But the comments getting the most attention had to do with bitcoin.  He  says the cryptocurrency we told you about recently, he told Andrew Ross  Sorkin, he's not a fan.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> PRINCE ALWALEED BIN TALAL, KINGDOM HOLDING COMPANY:  I just don't believe  this bitcoin thing.  I think it's just going to implode one day.  I think  this is Enron in the making.  </p><p> ANDREW ROSS SORKIN, CNBC:  Really?  Enron in the making.</p><p> BIN TALAL:  I just don't believe in bitcoin it completely.</p><p> SORKIN:  Because?</p><p> BIN TALAL:  It just doesn't make sense.  You know, this thing is not  regulated.  It's not under control.  It's not under the supervision of any  federal -- any, you know, United States Federal Reserve or any other  central banks.  So, I just -- I don't believe this whole thing at all.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> GRIFFETH:  Enron -- of course, the prince was referring to the massive  accounting fraud that took Enron, the energy trading company, into  bankruptcy in 2001.</p><p> And while the Saudi prince and others are skeptical of bitcoin, it is  getting a lot of buzz lately due in part to its recent surge in value.  But  it's been slow to take hold as a way to actually buy things.  But that may  be about to change as a couple of bitcoin investors use their gains to  purchase expensive real estate.</p><p> Diana Olick has that story for us tonight.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> DIANA OLICK, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  You see  it in some restaurants and in some retail.  Now, bitcoin is buying into  real estate.  Over the summer, a Sotheby's agency in Austin was behind the  first single-family home sale in Texas involving a cryptocurrency.  </p><p> J. KUPER, KUPER SOTHEBY'S INTERNATIONAL REALTY OWNER:  So, we knew that,  you know, bitcoin is cryptocurrency.  It's like any other currency.  It has  an exchange rate.  It can be exchanged for U.S. dollars.  So, the challenge  which actually wasn't all that challenging was to figure out who would do  an exchange that large.</p><p> OLICK:  They turned to bitpay, which did the exchange because the seller, a  custom homebuilder, didn't want bitcoin.  He wanted dollars.</p><p> KUPER:  We had a brief amount of conversation about that, but bitcoin on  some level is new to most consumers.  So, accepting bitcoin was just not  something that they wanted to do.</p><p> OLICK:  That will not be the case in Lower Manhattan where one developer is  converting this old rental building into new condos.  He had several  potential buyers who want to pay in bitcoin and he wants to keep the  currency think.</p><p> BENJAMIN SHAOUL, MAGNUM REAL ESTATE GROUP PRESIDENT:  I'll be able to use  it both personally and as a developer, but I think it'll become a long-term  means to make payment.  I've been buying some artwork a recent, and  personally for me, I've had a bunch of sellers of artwork asked me to pay  them in bitcoin.</p><p> OLICK:  Shaoul says that in a hot market like Manhattan, accepting bitcoin  gives him a competitive edge over other sellers. </p><p> SHAOUL:  It's a price point building in the $700,000 to $1.5 million range.   There is not a lot of that inventory in the marketplace and, you know, you  try to always work and get one extra edge over someone else, and we think  the cryptocurrency in offering that to our buyers is certainly an edge.</p><p> OLICK (on camera):  It sounds pretty simple now, but the deals so far have  been all bitcoin sales, no mortgage.  Bringing bitcoin to your average  neighborhood where most buyers need a home loan will be a much bigger deal,  with far-reaching implications not just for real estate but for banking and  borrowing.</p><p> For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Diana Olick in Washington.</p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> GRIFFETH:  Coming up, why this watch is considered the Holy Grail of  timepieces.</p><p> (MUSIC)</p><p> GRIFFETH:  Welcome back.  </p><p> This watch certainly does more than tell time, it has a history -- a  history that belongs to the late actor Paul Newman, and the mystery  surrounding it could help it become one of the most expensive watches ever  sold.  </p><p> Robert Frank has the fascinating story.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> ROBERT FRANK, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Paul Newman was  always in a race against time, as an actor, as a race car driver and as a  philanthropist.  And now, his wristwatch which some considered to be the  holy grail of sports watches is coming up for sale, and it could become one  of the most expensive watches ever sold.  </p><p> Newman's Rolex Cosmograph Daytona will be auctioned off by Phillips on  Thursday in New York.  Watch collectors say it could fetch between $5  million and $10 million, possibly challenging the current highest price for  a wristwatch of $11 million.  </p><p> Newman wore the watch every day of his life between 1969 and 1984, and used  it to time his car races.  It is inscribed on the back with a message from  his wife Joanne Woodward with the words \"Drive Carefully, Me\".  </p><p> Now, in 1984, Newman gave the watch to James Cox who at the time was dating  Newman's daughter Nell.  Cox kept the watch and is now selling it with some  of the proceeds going to Nell's charity.  Newman made the Rolex Daytona one  of the most sought-after watches in the world.  Vintage Daytona's like his  have sold for millions at auction.  </p><p> Now, watch hunters have searched for Newman's Daytona for decades, creating  a source of mystery and legend in the watch world.  Now, the watch worn by  Cool Hand Luke is coming on to the auction block, proving once again that  Paul Newman is one of Hollywood's truly timeless.</p><p> For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Robert Frank.</p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> GRIFFETH:  And that is NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for tonight.
