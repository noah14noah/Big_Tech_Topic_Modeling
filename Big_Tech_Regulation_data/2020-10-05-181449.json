Additional suspensions will hinder the revamping of mining within the Tonkolili district. Reduced steel demand and persisting resource nationalistic attitudes will continue to challenge new iron ore investment in Sierra Leone.</p><p>We forecast iron ore production to contract 25.0% y-o-y in Sierra Leone in 2020, amid suspended output at the Marampa mine. SL Mining, a subsidiary of Gerald Group, halted mining operations in September 2019 following a legal dispute with the government of Sierra Leone over a mineral export ban imposed on Marampa's output in July 2019. Marampa had almost exclusively accounted for Sierra Leone's iron ore production in 2019, due to the suspension of mining activities at the Tonkolili mine in late 2017. An arbitration tribunal of the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) ordered the government of Sierra Leone to reinstate SL Mining's license and lift the lingering export shipping ban in February 2020, however the government has since failed to comply. Furthermore, in May 2020, local police arrested five of SL Mining's expatriate staff members on suspicion of inciting a riot near the Marampa mine.</p><p>SECTION 5 BUSINESS MONITOR INTERNATIONAL INC.

Additional suspensions will hinder the revamping of mining within the Tonkolili district. Reduced steel demand and persisting resource nationalistic attitudes will continue to challenge new iron ore investment in Sierra Leone.</p><p>We forecast iron ore production to contract 25.0% y-o-y in Sierra Leone in 2020, amid suspended output at the Marampa mine. SL Mining, a subsidiary of Gerald Group, halted mining operations in September 2019 following a legal dispute with the government of Sierra Leone over a mineral export ban imposed on Marampa's output in July 2019. Marampa had almost exclusively accounted for Sierra Leone's iron ore production in 2019, due to the suspension of mining activities at the Tonkolili mine in late 2017. An arbitration tribunal of the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) ordered the government of Sierra Leone to reinstate SL Mining's license and lift the lingering export shipping ban in February 2020, however the government has since failed to comply. Furthermore, in May 2020, local police arrested five of SL Mining's expatriate staff members on suspicion of inciting a riot near the Marampa mine.</p><p>SECTION 5 BUSINESS MONITOR INTERNATIONAL INC.

Additional suspensions will hinder the revamping of mining within the Tonkolili district. Reduced steel demand and persisting resource nationalistic attitudes will continue to challenge new iron ore investment in Sierra Leone.</p><p>We forecast iron ore production to contract 25.0% y-o-y in Sierra Leone in 2020, amid suspended output at the Marampa mine. SL Mining, a subsidiary of Gerald Group, halted mining operations in September 2019 following a legal dispute with the government of Sierra Leone over a mineral export ban imposed on Marampa's output in July 2019. Marampa had almost exclusively accounted for Sierra Leone's iron ore production in 2019, due to the suspension of mining activities at the Tonkolili mine in late 2017. An arbitration tribunal of the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) ordered the government of Sierra Leone to reinstate SL Mining's license and lift the lingering export shipping ban in February 2020, however the government has since failed to comply. Furthermore, in May 2020, local police arrested five of SL Mining's expatriate staff members on suspicion of inciting a riot near the Marampa mine.</p><p>SECTION 5 BUSINESS MONITOR INTERNATIONAL INC.

The study, \"California Consumer Privacy Act: Are Consumers' Digital Rights Protected? \" found:</p><p>Consumers struggled to locate the required links to opt out of the sale of their information. For 42.5% of sites tested, at least one of three testers was unable to find a DNS link. All three volunteers failed to find a \"Do Not Sell\" link on 12.6% of sites, and in several other cases one or two of three testers were unable to locate a link. At least 14% of the time, burdensome or broken DNS processes prevented consumers from exercising their rights under the CCPA. At least one data broker used information provided for a DNS request to add the user to a marketing list, in violation of the CCPA. At least one data broker required the user to set up an account to opt out, in violation of the CCPA. Consumers often didn't know if their opt-out request was successful. Neither the CCPA nor the CCPA rules require companies to notify consumers when their request has been honored. As a result, about 46% of the time, consumers were left waiting or unsure about the status of their request. About 52% of the time, the tester was \"somewhat dissatisfied\" or \"very dissatisfied\" with opt-out processes. California Proposition 24, the ballot initiative to reform the CCPA that will be voted on by Californians on November 3, would address some, but not all of these problems with the CCPA. While the measure would strengthen enforcement and eliminate some loopholes in the CCPA that companies have exploited, it would introduce new loopholes as well.</p><p>\"Despite the CCPA being signed into law, this study shows that the digital rights of Californians are still not fully protected,\" said Justin Brookman, director of consumer privacy and technology at Consumer Reports. \"Policymakers in California need to adopt crucial reforms to the CCPA in order to ensure that consumers can enjoy their right to privacy under the California Constitution.\"</p><p>Maureen Mahoney, policy analyst at Consumer Reports, added, \"Attorney General Xavier Becerra must strengthen enforcement of the CCPA to address non-compliance. While the CCPA is an important first step, the results of the study shows that the law needs to be enforced more aggressively and enhanced so that consumers can more easily exercise their privacy rights. \" </p><p>INDEX</p><p>SECTION 1 CONSUMERS UNION PROFILE</p><p>SECTION 2 PRESS RELEASES: 2020</p><p>SECTION 3 OTHER NEWS: 2020</p><p>SECTION 4 CONSUMERS UNION TOP MANAGEMENT</p><p>SECTION 1 CONSUMERS UNION PROFILE</p><p>1.1 ACTIVITIES</p><p>Consumers Union publishes magazines and newsletters.

The bill (AB 1864) signed by Newsom will transform California's existing financial regulator into a more robust watchdog with broader authority and more resources to protect consumers.</p><p>California is strengthening state oversight at a time when the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) has scaled back its enforcement efforts at the federal level and reduced penalties on firms caught taking advantage of consumers. CR and a coalition of consumer and small business groups rallied behind the proposal given weak federal oversight and the heightened risk of financial exploitation that many Californians are facing during the current economic crisis.</p><p>\"Families hit hard by the collapse of the economy are prime targets for shady lenders and other unscrupulous financial firms,\" said Suzanne Martindale, senior policy counsel and western states legislative manager for Consumer Reports. \"California's financial watchdog will be equipped with the tools and resources it needs to protect communities from predatory financial practices and should serve as a model for other states.\"</p><p>Martindale continued, \"It's encouraging that California is strengthening its ability to stop financial fraud and abuse at a time when the CFPB is missing in action. No other state has empowered its financial regulator with such comprehensive authority and resources to protect consumers.\"</p><p>Under AB 1864, the Department of Business Oversight will be augmented and renamed the Department of Financial Protection and Innovation (DFPI). The new watchdog is modeled after the CFPB and is being funded using the Department of Business Oversight's existing reserve fund from past enforcement actions rather than money from the state's general fund.</p><p>The DFPI will have broad subject-matter jurisdiction over the financial services industry, including expanded authority to oversee important sectors that aren't currently subject to their supervision, such as debt collectors, credit reporting agencies and so-called \"fintech\" companies.</p><p>September 25: Consumers Union: California Governor Newsom signs student borrower protections into law</p><p>Californians with education debt will soon enjoy the strongest consumer protections in the nation now that Governor Gavin Newsom has signed into law the Student Borrower Bill of Rights. The new law goes into effect on January 1 and aims to protect borrowers from loan servicing abuses that can make debts grow more costly and trigger defaults.</p><p>Consumer Reports co-sponsored the legislation with the California Federation of Teachers, NextGen California, Student Borrower Protection Center, Student Debt Crisis, and Young Invincibles. California's landmark new law was supported by a broad coalition of civil rights, higher education, and consumer advocacy organizations.</p><p>\"For most Californians, paying for college means going into debt that can haunt them for years before it is finally paid off,\" said Suzanne Martindale, senior policy counsel and western states legislative manager. \"Borrowers face a complex and confusing loan repayment system plagued by a lack of consumer protections and shoddy treatment that can add time and money to their loans.</p><p>Martindale continued, \"The Student Borrower Bill of Rights establishes the strongest standards in the nation to ensure student loan companies treat Californians fairly by acting in borrowers' best interests. California's comprehensive student borrower protections are a model for other states for holding loan servicers accountable when they mismanage accounts or engage in predatory practices.\"</p><p>Student loan servicers are the main point of contact for borrowers - taking payments, keeping account records and handling requests. In recent years, these companies have been the target state and federal investigations for abusive practices and mismanagement that have frustrated borrowers' ability to manage their loans, access legal rights to flexible repayment options, and stay out of default.</p><p>California's Student Borrower Bill of Rights (AB 376), introduced by Assemblymember Mark Stone, creates standards that require loan servicers to apply payments in a way that minimizes extra fees or charges, improve record-keeping, and train staff to provide borrowers with accurate information about their repayment options.</p><p>September 24: Consumer Reports survey finds that most Americans support government regulation of online platforms</p><p>Washington, DC - American consumers across the political spectrum are concerned about the increasing power and lack of accountability of online platforms such as Google, Apple, Facebook, and Amazon, and a clear majority support some form of government regulation of the companies.</p><p>Consumer Reports conducted the nationally representative online survey of 3,219 adult U.S residents this summer to assess their experiences and opinions about online platforms. The report, \"Platform Perceptions: Consumer Attitudes on Competition and Fairness in Online Platforms,\" was issued by the Digital Lab at Consumer Reports. Here's a look at the findings:</p><p>A majority of consumers-about 6 out of 10-support more government regulation of platforms (60%) and mandating interoperability features (61%) to deal with the growing power of large online platforms that may be hurting competition and consumers.</p><p>79% of Americans say Big Tech mergers and acquisitions unfairly undermine competition and consumer choice.</p><p>65% say platforms should be held accountable for the products and services sold on their platforms.</p><p>74% believe companies should be required to take more responsibility for evaluating information before it's shared on their platforms.</p><p>46% have difficulty distinguishing between what is a paid ad and objective search result, and 58% are not confident that they are getting objective and unbiased search results when using an online platform to shop or search for information;</p><p>85% of Americans are either very concerned or somewhat concerned about the amount of data online platforms store about them.</p><p>81% of Americans are either very concerned or somewhat concerned that platforms are collecting and holding this data about consumers in order to build out more comprehensive consumer profiles.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>September 23: Consumers Union: CR Delivers 62,000 Petition Signatures To DOT Demanding Airline Safety Standards To Protect Passengers During COVID Crisis</p><p>WASHINGTON, D.C. - Consumer Reports delivered over 62,000 petition signatures to Department of Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao today calling on her to establish mandatory health and safety standards for airlines and airports to help prevent the spread of the coronavirus. While the DOT issued COVID-19 health and safety recommendations in July, airlines and airports are not required to follow them and practices can vary widely across the industry.</p><p>\"Americans are already wary about traveling during a global pandemic and deserve to know that strict COVID-19 safety precautions will be followed if they choose to fly,\" said William J. McGee, Aviation Adviser for Consumer Reports. \"We need mandatory, enforceable health and safety rules so that every airline, airport and passenger can be held accountable to help stop the spread of this potentially deadly virus. Mandatory standards will ultimately help the airlines recover from the current crisis by giving Americans more confidence that they will be safe when flying.\"</p><p>In a letter accompanying the petition signatures, Consumer Reports noted that Americans encounter a confusing patchwork of conflicting health and safety policies at hundreds of U.S. airports and every airline. Travelers cannot be sure, when they make a reservation, what the airline's policies on healthy travel will be on the date when their flight takes off.</p><p>While some airlines are currently leaving middle seats open on flights, other carriers are booking passengers on every seat on their planes. CR has heard from travelers concerned about overcrowded flights and that mask requirements are not being enforced consistently.</p><p>CR urged Secretary Chao to work with other key administration officials to establish requirements for airlines, airports, and travelers to protect against the transmission of COVID-19 during air travel.</p><p>July 30: Consumers Reports investigation finds that the College Board is sharing students personal information with tech companies</p><p>Consumer Reports released findings from an investigation into the privacy practices of the College Board and found that the organization appears to be in violation of its own policies.</p><p>Researchers at CR's Digital Lab found that the College Board is sending personally identifiable student information to major technology companies and ad platforms including Adobe, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Snapchat, and Yahoo.</p><p>\"College-bound students don't have any choice but to transact with the College Board-which is what makes these findings so concerning,\" said Ben Moskowitz, Director of the Digital Lab at Consumer Reports. \"Because of its mission and its importance in the college admissions process, it is critical that the organization meet a high privacy standard, communicate clearly with its users, and limit the user data it shares with third parties for advertising purposes.\"</p><p>The College Board is a non-profit company that owns and operates the SAT test. The organization also administers the Advanced Placement exam, which high school students can take to earn college credit and strengthen applications. In some states, the SAT is even required for high school graduation. For millions of students, the College Board is an unavoidable gatekeeper on the path to higher education.</p><p>After contacting the College Board with our findings, the organization made some updates to its site, but the underlying problem as found in the investigation remains.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>July 13: Consumer Reports launches petition calling for mandatory COVID-19 health and safety standards for airlines and airports</p><p>Consumer Reports is calling on Department of Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao to issue mandatory, enforceable health and safety standards for airlines and airports to help stop the spread of the coronavirus. CR launched a petition urging Secretary Chao to take more aggressive action to protect passengers one week after the DOT issued COVID-19 health and safety recommendations without requiring airlines and airports to comply with them.</p><p>\"Americans shouldn't have to figure out on their own whether it's safe to fly during a global pandemic,\" said William J. McGee, Aviation Adviser for Consumer Reports. \"Secretary Chao is essentially making passengers gamble with their health by failing to require airlines and airports to abide by mandatory safety protocols. We need enforceable rules to protect travelers, especially now that some airlines are ignoring social distancing recommendations and packing flights with passengers.\"</p><p>While some airlines are currently leaving middle seats open on flights, American, Spirit, and United airlines say they will book passengers on every seat on their planes. Some airlines and airports are enforcing mask requirements, while others are not. And some airports are doing health screenings without any clear rule on how that information will be acted on, raising both medical and privacy concerns.</p><p>In June, Consumer Reports urged Secretary Chao to work with other key administration officials and take an active role in establishing requirements for airlines, airports, and travelers to protect against the transmission of COVID-19 during air travel. Secretary Chao has the authority to make COVID-19 safety protocols mandatory using the same authority used by the DOT in the past to require airlines to adopt stronger security measures following the September 11th terrorist attacks.</p><p>May 13: CR, U.S. PIRG and activist deliver nearly 250,000 petition signatures to airlines calling for full refunds for canceled flights</p><p>WASHINGTON, D.C. - Consumer Reports, U.S. PIRG and a consumer-turned-activist delivered nearly 250,000 petition signatures today to the airlines calling on them to provide full refunds when passengers cancel their flights because of concerns about the coronavirus. The petition delivery came on the same day that Senator Edward Markey (MA) introduced legislation in Congress endorsed by the groups that would make refunds mandatory in such cases.</p><p>Despite receiving a $50 billion taxpayer-funded bailout as part of the CARES Act, the majority of airlines are only offering vouchers instead of refunds to passengers who canceled their flights because of concerns about the coronavirus pandemic. Additionally, even though passengers are legally entitled to a full refund if the airline cancels their flight, some carriers are offering vouchers as the default option. This forces passengers to take extra steps to get the cash refund they deserve.</p><p>\"It's simply unfair to deny refunds to customers who cannot travel safely or to those who are facing financial hardship and need the cash,\" said Anna Laitin, director of financial policy for Consumer Reports. \"The airlines are, in effect, forcing millions of Americans to provide an interest-free loan after these companies have already received billions of dollars in taxpayer-funded relief.\"</p><p>In a letter accompanying the petition signatures, the groups noted that they have heard from thousands of people from all over the country who are frustrated that they can't get a refund for their canceled flight. These stories include customers who canceled flights because of stay-at-home orders, senior citizens and other at-risk customers worried about their safety, and the newly unemployed who need the money to pay their bills. Others have expressed concerns that the vouchers will expire before it is safe to travel again.</p><p>\"The airlines just received a multi-billion dollar taxpayer bailout and want to continue holding onto passengers' ticket dollars as well.</p><p>May 01: Consumer Reports Applauds ICANN's Decision to Reject.ORG Sale to Private Equity Firm</p><p>ICANN announced last night that it would reject a plan to sell the.ORG domain registry. The sale would have transferred control of the Public Interest Registry from the Internet Society to Ethos Capital, a private equity firm. This is a major victory for the nonprofit community and the public interest.</p><p>\"ICANN's rejection of the sale of.ORG to Ethos Capital is a win for nonprofits around the world. The sale would have resulted in one company deciding who gets the domain and how much they would have to pay for it. We applaud ICANN, and we thank California Attorney General Xavier Becerra and all of the organizations that came together to push back against this sale. Although the process for securing a steward for the.org domain is not yet over, we hope that the search is transparent, competitive, and in the interest of the public. This news is especially welcome at a time when nonprofits are focused on meeting their communities' needs during the coronavirus pandemic.\" Katie McInnis, Policy Counsel for Consumer Reports.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>March 31: Zoom Makes Improvements to Privacy Policy after Consumer Reports Investigation</p><p>Yonkers, NY -Consumer Reports recently uncovered a range of privacy concerns with Zoom, a videoconferencing service that has gained in popularity as consumers, businesses, and schools have come to rely on the platform during the coronavirus pandemic.</p><p>Researchers at CR's Digital Lab found that Zoom, like many digital platforms, outlines in its privacy policy that it collects personal information about its users, but failed to disclose details about how that information is used for advertising, marketing, or other business purposes. Such information, known as \"Customer Content\" could include cloud video recordings and information that was shared during the recordings such as instant messages, files, and whiteboards.</p><p>After these findings by CR, Zoom made significant changes to its privacy policies, which was announced in a blog post and detailed in a new CR article. The updated policy now states that so-called \"Customer Content\" is not allowed for advertising purposes, that video is only retained at the user's request, and that it's not accessed by Zoom. The new policy also provides more insight into the type of consumer data Zoom collects, such as phone numbers and user names.</p><p>While CR is pleased to see the quick response by Zoom, there is still work to be done. For example, Zoom should make a clear differentiation between hosts and participants, and require participants to click on a consent button before a recording can begin.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>March 02: Consumer Reports: Consumer Reports responds to EPA Science Advisory Board final report about fuel economy rollback plan</p><p>The science advisory board of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) recently released a final report about the proposed EPA &amp; DOT plan to rollback vehicle fuel economy and emissions standards, known as the 'SAFE' Rule.</p><p>In response to the report, David Friedman, Vice President of Advocacy at Consumer Reports, provides the following statement:</p><p>\"The EPA's own scientific advisors confirm many of CR's criticisms of the proposed rule. They even acknowledge that the original, \"2012 rule might provide a better outcome for society than the proposed revision.\" Our analysis shows that it is more than a possibility. Strong fuel economy standards save consumers money, and reduce harmful greenhouse gas emissions. So, whether it is a full or partial rollback, the administration should ditch its current plans so consumers won't be stuck spending billions more than they should just to go about their daily lives.\"</p><p>You can learn more about how costly the proposed rollback would be for consumers at CR.org/unsaferule.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>February 28: Consumer Reports: DOJ/FTC proposed update to Vertical Merger Guidelines needs more work, more relevance to today's marketplace</p><p>WASHINGTON, D.C. - Consumer Reports has filed comments with the Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission in response to a proposal to update their Enforcement Guidelines for assessing vertical mergers under the antitrust laws. These are mergers that combine two companies that operate at different levels in a supply and marketing chain, and therefore do, or could, do business with each other. The updated Vertical Merger Guidelines would replace guidelines published in 1984, before the arrival of the internet and its dramatic transformation of the marketplace. The 1984 guidelines are largely ignored in actual enforcement decision making, but they remain on the books.</p><p>CR welcomes the plan to update the guidelines as long overdue, but says the current draft needs more work.</p><p>\"To be useful, updated guidelines need to be relevant, and they need to be clear,\" says George Slover, senior policy counsel at Consumer Reports. \"They need to speak to the challenges to competition we are facing in today's online marketplace, and they need to be understandable to the wider public, not just antitrust economists and lawyers. Curiously, the descriptive examples used in the current draft could have been written for the marketplace as it existed decades ago, or even for the marketplace Adam Smith wrote about 250 years ago. There is not a single reference to today's online marketplace, where a handful of giant platforms are increasingly able to control the choices that can reach consumers.</p><p>\"Age-old competition concerns are being magnified and transformed by an entirely new dimension of high-tech market power, fueled by massive troves of data and awesome technological capabilities to gather, sort, and manipulate it, reaching into all corners of our commercial and personal interactions and preferences.</p><p>February 25: Consumer Reports calls for major safety improvements across the industry after NTSB makes new findings in Tesla investigation</p><p>WASHINGTON, D.C. - In light of new findings by the National Transportation Safety Board related to Tesla Autopilot, Consumer Reports today called for manufacturers to include key safety features in any vehicle that has an active driving assistance system - a type of emerging technology that helps human drivers accelerate, brake, and steer but also requires them to be responsible for the driving at any moment - and for the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to ensure that is the case.</p><p>Ethan Douglas, senior policy analyst for cars and product safety at Consumer Reports, said, \"This shouldn't be considered optional. Manufacturers and NHTSA must make sure that these driver-assist systems come with critical safety features that actually verify drivers are monitoring the road and ready to take action at all times. Otherwise, the safety risks of these systems could end up outweighing their benefits.</p><p>\"The evidence is clear, and continuing to pile up, that if a car makes it easier for people to take their attention off the road, they're going to do so-with potentially deadly consequences. So far, federal safety regulators have done little to reduce these risks, and the NTSB makes clear that NHTSA's hands-off approach is far too weak. It's time for NHTSA to go beyond mere words and take some real, forceful action to keep people safe.\"</p><p>CR's call comes as the NTSB today released a preliminary report on the fatal March 2018 crash of a Tesla vehicle with Autopilot engaged. The NTSB attributed the crash to several factors, including Autopilot's limitations and \"cell phone distraction.\" The investigative board also reiterated that regulators and manufacturers alike have ignored the NTSB's previous recommendations for system safeguards, and called for an overhaul of how manufacturers design their active driving assistance systems to ensure a human driver stays engaged and ready to take action.</p><p>February 25: Consumers Union: Investigation finds Allstate's secret algorithm resulted in \"suckers list\" of drivers deemed unlikely to shop for better deals</p><p>A joint investigation by Consumer Reports and The Markup sheds light on how a controversial plan pushed by Allstate in Maryland could be functioning in other states that have allowed the company's customer \"retention model.\" The groups found that Allstate would have saddled Maryland customers paying the most expensive premiums with big increases that it wasn't willing to pass on to thriftier customers with similar risk profiles.</p><p>Maryland and a few other states have rejected these efforts, but ten other states have allowed Allstate to use a customer retention model. The groups based their joint investigation on a statistical analysis of the documents Allstate submitted on its plan in Maryland. It offers a rare public window revealing details of Allstate's pricing plan that have otherwise been kept secret.</p><p>\"Despite the purported complexity of Allstate's price adjustment algorithm, it was actually simple: It resulted in a suckers list of Maryland customers who were big spenders and would squeeze more money out of them than others,\" according to the report by Maddy Varner and Aaron Sankin of The Markup, the data-driven journalism organization launching today focused on the impact of technology on society.</p><p>\"These revelations are concerning enough on their own, but they're also an unmistakable harbinger of the new age of consumer threats we're racing headlong into,\" said Marta L. Tellado, President &amp; CEO of Consumer Reports. \"Like security flaws in our gadgets and invisible toxins in our food, hidden biases in the algorithms that set more and more of the prices we pay pose an insidious threat.\"</p><p>Seven years ago, when Allstate filed this plan with Maryland, the company said that its new risk analysis showed that it was charging nearly all of its customers outdated premiums. Rather than apply the new rates all at once, Allstate asked the Maryland Insurance Administration for permission to run each policy through an advanced algorithm containing dozens of variables that would adjust it in the general direction of the new customer \"retention\" model.</p><p>But The Markup and Consumer Reports found that customers who were due a big rate hike may or may not get it based on whether Allstate thought they were likely to shop around:</p><p>It appears that Allstate assumed drivers with a cheap policy would shop around for a better deal, while those with an expensive policy would not.</p><p>February 11: Consumers Union: Court Rules Against State Antitrust Challenge to T-MobileSprint Merger</p><p>A federal district court ruled today against the antitrust action by 13 states and the District of Columbia to stop the merger of T-Mobile and Sprint.</p><p>Consumer Reports said the merger will combine two giant nationwide wireless phone service carriers into one, leaving consumers with only three giant carriers to choose from and reducing the incentives of the three remaining carriers to compete by offering more affordable, higher quality, and more innovative service.</p><p>Consumer Reports has been raising strong concerns that the merger would harm competition, and harm consumers and others in the wireless marketplace who depend on that competition</p><p>\"We commend the states for their perseverance and determination in challenging this anti-consumer combination,\" said George Slover, senior policy counsel at Consumer Reports. \"From the moment this merger was announced, it was clear that it went against what is needed to give consumers the benefits of competition. This merger should never have made it out of the corporate boardroom. Unfortunately, despite all the states' efforts, and the strong case they presented, the court could not be convinced.\"</p><p>The U.S. Department of Justice had opposed a similar merger in the past, when AT&amp;T sought to merge with T-Mobile in 2011. However, DOJ gave T-Mobile and Sprint a green light, based on a side deal it helped engineer to set up satellite TV company DISH to become a new fourth nationwide mobile phone carrier to replace the loss of Sprint.</p><p>Slover said DISH is an unproven newcomer, with no mobile phone network, and no experience providing mobile phone service. It will have to build both essentially from scratch, he said.</p><p>\"Sprint is an established carrier, with a track record of determination and success in spurring competition that benefits consumers,\" said Slover.</p><p>SECTION 3 OTHER NEWS: 2020</p><p>September 25: Consumers Union: California Gov. Rejects Bill that Protects Privacy of Californians' Genetic Data</p><p>California Governor Newsom today vetoed a bill (SB 980) that would have established strong privacy protections for genetic data collected by direct-to-consumer (DTC) genetic testing companies like 23andMe. Consumer Reports supported and provided input on the measure, which gained support from both consumer advocates and industry, and from California state legislators on both sides of the aisle.</p><p>The measure would have required DTC genetic testing companies to obtain consumers' consent before collecting, using, or disclosing their genetic data, and to adopt security procedures to protect it from unauthorized access.</p><p>\"We're disappointed that Governor Newsom rejected this common-sense legislation. Privacy and security protections over this extremely sensitive data are sorely needed, especially in light of data breaches at several direct-to-consumer genetic testing companies in recent years,\" said Maureen Mahoney, policy analyst at Consumer Reports. \"Without these protections, by default, California consumers' most personal information can be bought and sold to third parties without their knowledge. We urge California legislators to take up this measure again in the next session, and for lawmakers in other states to pursue similar protections.\" Source: Company Website</p><p>September 24: Consumers Union: Electric vehicle owners spending half as much on maintenance compared to gas-powered vehicle owners, finds new CR analysis</p><p>A new analysis by Consumer Reports finds that owners of plug-in electric vehicles are spending half as much on maintenance and repair as the owners of similar gas-powered vehicles.</p><p>Consumer Reports analyzed its 2019 and 2020 reliability survey data for thousands of electric and gas-powered vehicles, and found that drivers of electric vehicles are saving an average of 50% on maintenance and repair over the life of a vehicle compared to owners of gas-powered vehicles.</p><p>\"Electric vehicle owners don't need a coupon to get half-off typical maintenance and repair costs from their dealer, it comes standard!\" says senior transportation policy analyst Chris Harto, who authored the analysis based on CR's real-world data. \"These savings are going a long way to offset the upfront costs for consumers.\"</p><p>Average maintenance/repair costs over vehicle lifetime:</p><p>BEV (Battery-Electric Vehicle): $0.03/mile PHEV (Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle): $0.03/mile ICE (Internal Combustion Engine): $0.06/mile According to CR's experts, simpler powertrains in EVs and no need for oil changes are likely reasons for the lower costs.</p><p>\"Electrics just don't need as much maintenance as gas-powered cars, and even though repairs won't necessarily be less expensive, they are less frequently needed,\" explains Gabe Shenhar, associate director of CR's Auto Test Center, specializing in electric vehicle testing.</p><p>September 24: Consumers Union: Electric vehicle owners spending half as much on maintenance compared to gas-powered vehicle owners, finds new CR analysis</p><p>A new analysis by Consumer Reports finds that owners of plug-in electric vehicles are spending half as much on maintenance and repair as the owners of similar gas-powered vehicles.</p><p>Consumer Reports analyzed its 2019 and 2020 reliability survey data for thousands of electric and gas-powered vehicles, and found that drivers of electric vehicles are saving an average of 50% on maintenance and repair over the life of a vehicle compared to owners of gas-powered vehicles.</p><p>\"Electric vehicle owners don't need a coupon to get half-off typical maintenance and repair costs from their dealer, it comes standard!\" says senior transportation policy analyst Chris Harto, who authored the analysis based on CR's real-world data. \"These savings are going a long way to offset the upfront costs for consumers.\"</p><p>Average maintenance/repair costs over vehicle lifetime:</p><p>BEV (Battery-Electric Vehicle): $0.03/mile PHEV (Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle): $0.03/mile ICE (Internal Combustion Engine): $0.06/mile According to CR's experts, simpler powertrains in EVs and no need for oil changes are likely reasons for the lower costs.</p><p>\"Electrics just don't need as much maintenance as gas-powered cars, and even though repairs won't necessarily be less expensive, they are less frequently needed,\" explains Gabe Shenhar, associate director of CR's Auto Test Center, specializing in electric vehicle testing.</p><p>September 23: Lack of key considerations in FDA food chemical safety process leaves consumers at risk of chronic diseases</p><p>(Washington, D.C. - September 23, 2020) Today, a group of health, environmental, and consumer organizations challenged the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) practice of not accounting for the cumulative health effect of chemicals in the diet when allowing new chemicals in food. Over 60 years ago, Congress passed a law requiring that FDA and industry do just that. Unfortunately, an Environmental Defense Fund investigation of nearly 900 safety determinations found that only one considered the requirement in a meaningful way.</p><p>In reviewing the correspondence between FDA and manufacturers, EDF found no evidence the agency raises concerns with this major shortcoming. The analysis also demonstrates that, when evaluating the safety of new additives, FDA and food manufacturers all too often consider one chemical at a time rather than as a class of related substances.</p><p>\"The collective failure by FDA and the food industry to follow the law may well have contributed to the dramatic increases we have seen in chronic diseases, including obesity, diabetes, and kidney disease in the US in recent decades,\" said Tom Neltner, Chemicals Policy Director for Environmental Defense Fund. \"Every time we eat highly processed food, we are exposed to chemical additives, and - for the chemicals that cause similar toxic effects - that combined exposure can increase the harm to our health.</p><p>September 17: Consumers Union: Consumer Reports applauds California's settlement against Glow for privacy violations that risked exposing women's sensitive health data</p><p>Consumer Reports today praised the state of California following the announcement of a settlement with Glow, a technology company that operates a mobile fertility application.</p><p>In 2016 Consumer Reports found that the Glow app exposed women to privacy threats.

Especially with California's new privacy law in effect, the Attorney General's office is at the front line of protecting our privacy and security.

And father of 30 asking taxpayers to bail him out. Hello, everybody, I'm Gerri Willis.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">You know, I've gotten a lot of flak over the years for warning small investors of the perils of putting their hard-earned money into red-hot initial public offerings.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I warned here Friday about Facebook and it has become a prime example of what I'm talking about. My savvy viewers already know that Wall Street bait and switch.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We're now learning while banks were selling Facebook stock to the public, they were quietly cutting their own outlook for the company. Can you believe that?</p><p>It's the same thing happened during the housing bust. Bankers were selling mortgages to investors, mortgages they knew were worthless.</p><p>Today, NASDAQ and brokerages pointing fingers at each other over the whole Facebook flop. Regulators say that small investors should have confidence in the market.</p><p>You've got to be kidding. Those same regulators started investigations into what went wrong with the most hyped IPO in history.</p><p>This is exactly the reason that many feel there is an uneven playing field when it comes to investing. Stock message boards were lit up with Facebook comments today. \"Biggest IPO fraud ever,\" said one. The biggest sting of all time.</p><p>One person saying simply, \"The worst investment decision I have ever made.\" Unfortunately, that is the story for some small investors. They learn the hard way, and it shouldn't be that way. That's my two cents and this is THE WILLIS REPORT.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>The market still not liking Facebook, shares dropping eight percent today. And reportedly, one investor is suing NASDAQ over its handling of the debut and seeking class-action status.</p><p>So should investors feel zuckered - or maybe \"suckered\" is the better word - over the Facebook hype?</p><p>To Gary Kaltbaum, president of Kaltbaum management. Gary, let's start with this lawsuit. Not a big surprise? I've been expecting it. You probably have been, too. Can they be successful?</p><p>GARY KALTBAUM, PRESIDENT, KALTBAUM MANAGEMENT: Let's just say there's going to be a lot more of these lawsuits to come, and they're going to go after everybody.</p><p>Whenever you see a company blow up on earnings, the lawyers who like these class actions are looking into the market and finding these things. So you're going to see it. It's going to go after the underwriters.</p><p>It's probably going to be Facebook also. It's already on the NASDAQ and the free-for-all starts.</p><p>WILLIS: Well, the free-for-all starts. But look, individual investors feel like the biggest losers here.</p><p>KALTBAUM: Yes.</p><p>WILLIS: Let's just be honest. And frankly, they were, because the investors, the original investors and the founders - they're the ones who made out.</p><p>You know, individual investors aren't doing well here. This stock is trading lower than its offer price.</p><p>KALTBAUM: A lot lower. And some people actually paid higher than the offering price. Look, the bottom line here is, the bankers overreached, overhyped.</p><p>The price was an absolute joke. I've been yelling and screaming about this price, $100 billion market cap with less than $4 billion in revenues.</p><p>And by the way, their earnings have been decelerating over the last three quarters. Now, I didn't know where the stock would open. When I saw it open in the 40s, I knew something was up. And you see what is happening here.</p><p>And frankly, I think at even these levels that it is too expensive. And I think there will be more pain to come especially since there is so much negativity on the deal at this point.</p><p>WILLIS: So the valuation, at the time it went public, four times Google's valuation based on earnings. Now, today, this was supposed to be the biggest tech IPO of all time. Its market cap now, $84.84 billion, down from $104 billion.</p><p>What is going on here? And you know, what we had heard is that the major underwriters of this stock, their analysts had come out while they were doing the road show saying, look, this - you know, reduce your expectations particularly for revenue here. What do you make of that?</p><p>KALTBAUM: I think the bankers were simply greedy. That is what this came out to. The more fees - they get more fees because of higher price and more shares and they didn't listen to sound advice.</p><p>They put their own wallets first, the investors second. And guess what happens now? All those fees are going to be bye-bye. The credibility is shot, and they're going to lose a lot of money just defending the lawsuits going forward.</p><p>So it is a lose-lose for these guys. And you would think they would learn a lesson. I still remember back in '99. They did the same thing, but it was actually worse back then.</p><p>They brought companies public in the Internet space that had no revenues and brought them out with billion-dollar market caps. But then, investors would bid them up to $2 billion and $3 billion.</p><p>WILLIS: Not anymore.</p><p>KALTBAUM: And I think they were trying to get the same - yes, exactly. I think they were trying to get the same thing done here and it bit back on them.</p><p>WILLIS: Bit back on them. But you know, look, we're sort of in a delicate time here for individual investors.</p><p>KALTBAUM: Yes.</p><p>WILLIS: You know, we had our hopes dashed for many years on returns in the stock market broadly. And just seeing this through the hype around this IPO for Facebook reminded people of the big tech boom, the big tech bubble.</p><p>What do you think individual investors, what is the lesson they're going to take away from this?</p><p>KALTBAUM: Well, they'd better take the lesson of the more noise, the more you better investigate. When Wall Street is very noisy on something, you've got to look at fine print and you've got to look at numbers.</p><p>And this one was easy. You can look at amazon, which has 13 times the sales of this company and less the valuation, yet they don't care. They still bring it out at this price.</p><p>If the individual investor did a little bit of work here, they would have looked at number and said, \"No way, I'm going to take a pass regardless what happens.\"</p><p>But what happened was everybody thought this thing was going to open, $60, $70. I heard some people talking $80 and $90, and everybody figured OK.</p><p>And of course, the big letdown came when it opened in the s$40. And now, we're seeing it at $31 and probably lower prices to come.</p><p>WILLIS: All right. Hey, Gary -</p><p>KALTBAUM: Yes.</p><p>WILLIS: We've got some breaking news here that I want you to respond to on Facebook. The State of Massachusetts is investigating Morgan Stanley over its handling of Facebook and specifically the thing I mentioned earlier, this issuance of analyst guidance on the stock itself.</p><p>There are subpoenas apparently is what I'm hearing. Details are just beginning to emerge just this moment. What do you make of that? It seems like a pile on to me, buddy.</p><p>KALTBAUM: Well, you're going to see individual investors go to the state security's regulators. And states are going to go after them and investigate.</p><p>I don't know the exact timing of the Morgan Stanley analyst, and I know exactly what he did. They talked about the mobile apps, that more people are on mobile than on the regular computers and that is going to hurt them, and also as far as numbers being a little bit on the soft side.</p><p>So if the timing was bad, Morgan Stanley and especially the analysts, the way they did it, could be in some trouble. I'm not so sure of that.</p><p>But you can expect everybody to get involved. This was a big deal. It was all over the news. It was all over the place. And just remember, there are 900 million people on Facebook.</p><p>And when you are front and center, I can promise you the regulators want to make sure they cover their side of it. And that's where you're going to see a lot of this going on in the weeks to come, especially if the stock keeps getting hit.</p><p>WILLIS: All right. Gary, we'll come back when they do. We want to talk to you some more. Thanks for being with us today. Really appreciate it.</p><p>KALTBAUM: Thanks for having me.</p><p>WILLIS: All right. Just to repeat here because this is just coming out moments ago, the State of Massachusetts investigating Morgan Stanley over Facebook and specifically some of the analyst guidance they had out about that stock.</p><p>Apparently, subpoenas have been issued. We'll be following that. If we get more details in the hour, we'll let you know.</p><p>In the meantime, coming up, why a small business tax credit is going virtually unused.</p><p>And next, as Facebook stock continues its downward spiral, what should small investor be doing? I will break it down, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>WILLIS: The nation's lead securities regulator, Mary Schapiro, had a message for small investors stung by the Facebook IPO.</p><p>In spite of the problems with the social network's public stock launch, you should be confident in the markets. But it is too late. They've already lost confidence.</p><p>The IPO that was supposed to take the market by storm and reignite small investor interest in stocks - well, it did just the opposite.</p><p>Small investors are complaining. They were prevented from confirming trades or trade cancellations. Orders to buy and sell that normally take two seconds took two hours and even longer.</p><p>People who bought are angry. Those who didn't are shrugging their soldiers and saying, \"I told you so.\" One investor commented to the \"Wall Street Journal,\" \"I was stuck for six hours trying to confirm whether I owned this dog or not.\"</p><p>What is going on behind the scenes according to reports that NASDAQ system took an extra two milliseconds to calculate Facebook shares' opening price. In the meantime, the system was trying to process orders.</p><p>And that resulted in NASDAQ having to manually override the system, an override which took 20 minutes. One simple glitch in the middle of a massive public stock offering gets magnified.</p><p>There is no room for error. Now, that is the official explanation. But we talked to those in the marketplace. And what is going on is a lot of finger-pointing.</p><p>NASDAQ says they fixed the problem that caused the delay and that it won't happen again. As for the order confirmations that are still pending, all NASDAQ will say is that after clearing up the unintended consequences of their pricing system, they cleared their backlog of outstanding orders and cancellations at 1:50 p.m. Friday afternoon.</p><p>Now, the implication - look, any delays people have had since then must be at the broker-dealer end. Online brokers though, for their part, say the fault was with NASDAQ and market makers.</p><p>Scottrade, for example, says NASDAQ issues caused their customer orders to be delayed, which in turn caused some of those investors to try to change or modify their order.</p><p>And that put in place a cascade of errors. Scottrade told THE WILLIS REPORT that the company had staffed up to deal with questions even before problems arose across its 505 branch offices, its national service center and even on Facebook and Twitter.</p><p>When it was clear big problems had occurred, the company kept its trading services team working throughout the weekend to manually process several thousand transactions.</p><p>Can you imagine? Now, some of these brokerages managed to turn the trouble to their advantage. Scottrade opened 431 percent more new accounts Friday than a typical day, and today's trading volumes were up 70 percent versus monthly average.</p><p>Fidelity spoke to us as well saying, quote, \"Fidelity continues to deal with the aftermath of Friday's market issues and delayed processing of orders for Facebook.\"</p><p>\"As they did Friday and yesterday, Fidelity systems continued to operate normally. Unfortunately, our clients continue to feel the effects of these issues in some cases, and we're working aggressive to address them.\"</p><p>E-trade declined to comment to us. So far, at least one investor has already filed a lawsuit against NASDAQ alleging negligence.</p><p>If you've been impacted, the right thing to do is contact your broker pronto, even an online broker. Register what they call a dispute.</p><p>You don't even need to have details of your trade on hand because the brokerage will have it in their computer system. Any reimbursement will come from the brokerage. But ultimately, NASDAQ will be on the hook.</p><p>Frankly, I hate to see this kind of trouble for small investors. We need a system in place that treats everybody fairly, not just the deep pocketed investors looking to cash out of their investments.</p><p>The market needs small investors and small investors need an even playing field in the stock market in order to fulfill their own financial goals, fix the problem, do it fast.</p><p>Look, ultimately, it is in everybody's interest for the markets to work efficiently, openly and fairly.</p><p>Coming up, it's a story you have to hear to believe - a father of 30 asking the government to pay his bills.</p><p>And next, more evidence as if we needed it, on how Obamacare is crushing small business and how it's only going to get worse. Former CBO director Doug Holtz-Eakin gives us his take, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>WILLIS: Many Catholic organizations not waiting for the Supreme Court to decide the fate of Obamacare. They're suing now. Douglas Holtz-Eakin gives us his take in 60 seconds.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>WILLIS: A new report out this afternoon showing the country will go over a fiscal cliff if Congress doesn't act.</p><p>Joining me now, Douglas Holtz-Eakin, former director of the CBO, now the president of the American Action Forum. Doug, welcome to the show again.</p><p>DOUGLAS HOLTZ-EAKIN, PRESIDENT, AMERICAN ACTION FORUM: Thanks, Gerri.</p><p>WILLIS: And your old organization, the CBO, out with a study - I've got to get you to comment on this - just this afternoon saying that allowing the Bush-era tax cuts to expire and a scheduled round of automatic spending cuts will send this economy spiraling into a recession. Do you agree and how big is the threat to the economy?</p><p>EAKIN: Well, I think this is a very real threat, Gerri. Imagine investors who have a dividend tax rate 15 percent now, facing potential dividend tax rate of 44 percent come January 1st.</p><p>It's not going to take until January for the implications to start showing up. Investors are going to start getting nervous this fall.</p><p>I think markets are going to react. We're going to see some severe economic impact. So it is time to address the real problems that face the United States, the overspending, the uncertainty about the tax code.</p><p>Put in place something investors can count on. And it is a reminder our problems are not because we have debt limits and things like that. The problems are, we have problems.</p><p>WILLIS: we have problems and our main problem is spending too much money and money we don't have.</p><p>EAKIN: Absolutely. Absolutely.</p><p>WILLIS: You know, I want to talk to you about John Boehner because the Speaker of the House has been out talking about, how, OK, OK, we'll come to agreement on lifting the debt ceiling.</p><p>But if you do that, let's have commensurate cuts. And he has taken hell for that. I mean the Democrats are all over him. You can't initiate in this country, it seems to me, a meaningful conversation about cutting spending because the left just won't allow it.</p><p>EAKIN: Well, I mean, no one wants to default on the debt, but also no one wants to have a downgrade. And remember, Japan doesn't have a debt limit. Japan just got downgraded. Why? They have too much debt.</p><p>The fundamental problem is the debt. Speaker Boehner is talking about an approach to addressing the real problem which is spending that causes debt. And we have to deal with that, not just the symptom.</p><p>The notion we have clean debt, limit increase and everything is going to be fine is really badly mistaken.</p><p>WILLIS: Well, you know, the president, just this weekend, meeting with world leaders, he said essentially this idea that we need to spend more is fundamentally right, to pull Europe out of recession and of course the threat that the U.S. would go into recession too.</p><p>That seems to be diametrically opposed to what you just said.</p><p>EAKIN: There is this great fear of austerity in the United States. But no one is talking about austerity. We're talking about sensible reforms to the big spending programs that are driving the debt.</p><p>Take social security as an example. If we were to reform social security, all that would happen is that anyone working now would know what the deal was in retirement.</p><p>International investors would know that we could deal with traditional third rail of politics. There would be no cut in immediate spending. There would be no impact on the recovery.</p><p>So fear of austerity is just an excuse to not make reforms we need and which our citizens really deserve.</p><p>WILLIS: You know, big headlines around Catholic institutions now suing the Federal Government over Obamacare and these requirements really that these institutions fund birth control, fund things that they're just fundamentally opposed to.</p><p>I want you to respond to comments from Cardinal Timothy Dolan from right here in New York City. Here is what he had to say.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TIMOTHY CARDINAL DOLAN, ARCHBISHOP OF NEW YORK: What the federal government did, unfortunately, and which got our Irish up is when they said, \"Oh, by the way, we'll define what a church is.\"</p><p>\"We'll tell you what you can and can't do. We'll set the parameters as to how you can minister, to whom you may minister and the motives that should direct your ministry.\"</p><p>That is the character, that is the tone of these straitjacketing exemptions.</p><p>WILLIS: Your response?</p><p>EAKIN: Well, I mean what you're hearing is the cardinal saying Obamacare tramples on religious freedoms that are at the core of what America is built on. It also tramples on economic freedoms, the individual mandate.</p><p>And as you know it tramples on small businesses. This is a reform that really did not serve its intended goal of cutting costs. Costs are going up, not down, and in the process, has trampled all over things which we count on in America.</p><p>WILLIS: Well, you know, it is interesting you bring up small business, because there was just a story today about how small businesses are not signing up for this tax credit.</p><p>They have expected four million small businesses to get the free money. I mean, we're talking about free money here. But in fact, about 170,000 did it. Does that surprise you?</p><p>EAKIN: There's a lot of research that says this credit is not particularly valuable because it penalizes you if you hire more. It penalizes if you pay better.</p><p>It is incredibly complicated and hard to figure out and it is temporary, whereas the burdens that Obamacare imposes are permanent. So the research said, this isn't so good.</p><p>We're now seeing evidence that is exactly right. It is not going to work.</p><p>WILLIS: Well, you know, in just a few short weeks we're going to get answer from the Supreme Court on what they think about the individual mandate and Obamacare, generally.</p><p>There's a lot of talk about what is going to happen, Doug. And I know you spent a lot of time thinking about that. Do you have any fresh insights into what the Supreme Court might do?</p><p>EAKIN: I haven't had a vision of what the vote is. But certainly, I think the likely scenarios are ones in which if there is something overturned, it's just the individual mandate.</p><p>And Supreme Court says, \"Out of abundance of caution, we'll do no more. You Congress, go fix this.\" Or since there is nowhere to stop between that and everything, they overturn everything.</p><p>So there are only three things I'm looking for. If it upholds the law, we go from there, get rid of the individual mandate or throw out the entire law. Most of the other outcomes I don't think are very likely.</p><p>WILLIS: All right. Well, Doug, thanks for coming on tonight. We appreciate your time.</p><p>EAKIN: Thank you.</p><p>WILLIS: Come back soon. All right. If you're fired up about this or any of the issues on the program, drop me an E-mail, <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:gerri@foxbusiness.com\">gerri@foxbusiness.com</email></p><p>ANNOUNCER: Coming up on THE WILLIS REPORT, some people wait until they're financially stable to have kids, but not this Tennessee man who is calling on taxpayers to help them support his 30 children. Can he do this? Gerri gets to the bottom of this outrage.</p><p>And lawmakers are calling to break up big banks in the wake of the J.P. Morgan multibillion-dollar trading fiasco, but is there another solution to this? We'll ask our expert. We're on the case, next on THE WILLIS REPORT.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>WILLIS: Fresh details in the MF Global debacle. In the year leading up to the company's collapse, CEO Jon Corzine raked in the $8 million in compensation.</p><p>Keep in mind we've got some $1.6 billion still missing. Now, granted $5 million of his compensation came in the form of stock options, which are now worthless, but $3 million came in straight up cash.</p><p>While $1.6 billion, as I said, in customer money is still gone with the wind.</p><p>Time to bring out our panel. Katie Pavlich is the news editor for TownHall.com in D.C. Marjorie Clifton is founder of SpikeTheWatercooler.com, also in D.C. And Al Lewis, columnist for \"Dow Jones Newswires\" in Denver. Katie, start with you.</p><p>KATIE PAVLICH, NEWS EDITOR, TOWNHALL.COM: Look, when is President Obama and Vice President Joe Biden going to come out and denounce Jon Corzine?</p><p>I mean, he did help craft the failed stimulus package after all. And I think they should reassure us that they're not going to go and get advice from people like Jon Corzine who are willing to cut and run and then cost their investors millions of dollars, billions of dollars, and then cost the taxpayers at least $1 trillion in addition, too.</p><p>WILLIS: Crazy. Al, do you agree?</p><p>AL LEWIS, COLUMNIST, \"DOW JONES NEWS WIRES\": I second what she said. And you know what? I want to add that every time one of these big banks blow up, what we do is we look back and we see how much the CEO got paid and it's a lot.</p><p>And shat this shows is that CEO's get paid to take enormous risks with other people's money. And if it doesn't work out, oh, well.</p><p>WILLIS: Oh, well. Yes, definitely, sometimes there is a disconnect between performance and pay. Marjorie, what do you say?</p><p>MARJORIE CLIFTON, FOUNDER, SPIKETHEWATERCOOLER.COM: Well, it is part of the Wall Street culture. And right now, unfortunately, there is no retribution for anyone who unwisely spends investors' money.</p><p>So unless there is an overall change in Wall Street and how we - and obviously, we don't regulate Wall Street - it's going to continue to happen.</p><p>WILLIS: All right. Here's one of my favorite stories tonight. Former presidential candidate, Newt Gingrich, is having cash problems. Gingrich dropped out of the race nearly five million in debt and his own business is now going bankrupt. And yet, on the campaign trail, Gingrich said he knew exactly how to manage money.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NEWT GINGRICH, (R) FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I am for capitalism. I am for honest entrepreneurs investing. I'm for people creating businesses. Callista and I have created four small businesses in the last decade. I get it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILLIS: Marjorie, does Gingrich really get it when it comes to money?</p><p>CLIFTON: Well, Gingrich doesn't get it when it comes to campaigns, because most politicians who don't end up cutting it are able to actually profit and make money when they come out of the election season. But what was unique about Gingrich is that he really was ego driven.</p><p>I mean, you saw with Santorum, he stood for ideals. Gingrich stood for ego. And people saw right through it. So, I think he needs to take a lesson from Sarah Palin on how to capitalize on your image and rebrand himself.</p><p>WILLIS: I think he needs more than capitalizing in his image. Katie, what do you say?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>KATIE PAVLICH, TOWNHALL.COM NEWS EDITOR: I say (ph) that truth is looks like he is in a lot of trouble here. And I think he's probably bouncing off of what Marjorie just said. He's probably reassessing why he stayed in the GOP primary race so long and whether he should have run for president, in the first place.</p><p>WILLIS: You're probably right. Al, what do you say?</p><p>AL LEWIS, \"DOW JONES NEWSWIRES\" COLUMNIST: Oh, I just love the words bankrupt fiscal conservative in the same headline. You know, I think the Republicans made the right choice. The question is, what took them so long? I mean, this is a guy who says he doesn't like Fannie and Freddie and he takes money from Fannie and Freddie.</p><p>WILLIS: Yes.</p><p>LEWIS: He complains about adultery. Why he commits adultery? Now, we see all his money problems while he is trying to straighten out the money problems of America. How does this guy have any credibility left? Why are we even talking about him?</p><p>WILLIS: And send your e-mails to AlLewis.com.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>WILLIS: All right. Here's a man bite dog, bites man, bites newspaper story. There's a new reason to be aware of dog bites. Guess what? They're driving up insurance rates. In fact, dog bites account for more than a third of homeowners insurance liability claims in 2011, costing hundreds of millions of dollars. Al, I would never have guessed this.</p><p>LEWIS: Well, first I want to say that e-mail is <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:Al.Lewis@DowJones.com\">Al.Lewis@DowJones.com</email></p><p>WILLIS: Oh, you're going to --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WILLIS: Oh, my goodness. I wish I was saving you.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>LEWIS: And the second thing is buy a cat, OK? Get a cat.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>LEWIS: That's basically all I got to say about this story.</p><p>WILLIS: Marjorie.</p><p>CLIFTON: Well, it was actually $479 million went out last year which is just a shocking number. And I do agree. Either, I would go with the cat, a gerbil, a poodle, maybe one of those small little dogs. But yes, in general, this does not farewell for dog owners.</p><p>WILLIS: Katie, how about nice dogs, nice dogs?</p><p>PAVLICH: Yes, you know, some of the most vicious dogs I've ever met are the little ones. I don't say a get a little dog. I'd say --</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CLIFTON: Little dog syndrome.</p><p>PAVLICH: Get a breed that is nice. And hello, homeowners, keep your dog away from your visitors. Keep them on a leash. Keep them away from kids and people visiting and people on the street. Keep your kids away from front yards and dogs that you're not familiar with. It's basic common sense.</p><p>WILLIS: My favorite pick is the lab. I want a lab.</p><p>PAVLICH: Yes, exactly.</p><p>WILLIS: The private space industry taking off for the first time in history. SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket, doesn't that sound cool? It took flight this morning delivering 1,000 pounds of cargo to the International Space Station. Al, what do you say?</p><p>LEWIS: Well, we're a far cry away from private space. This is highly subsidized by NASA, but it's good to see. This is a small step for mankind, I think, but nonetheless, a good one.</p><p>WILLIS: Marjorie, I want us to have NASA. I want the country to be involved in this. This whole idea that we just leave it to entrepreneurs, not very satisfying for me. What do you say?</p><p>CLIFTON: Well, NASA was excited because it actually privatizing space is a more lucrative prospect given our government spending right now. We don't have the funds for it. I want to know if office space is cheaper on the moon because gas prices are pretty high, and I'm wondering, how can we figure this out, because something is not working with the economy here in the United States.</p><p>WILLIS: Katie, can we not afford it? Is that the reason we're not doing it?</p><p>PAVLICH: Well, unfortunately, because the government has spent out of control, we can't afford it. And I am with you. I think that space exploration is actually crucial to our national and international security.</p><p>But on the brighter note, I like idea that the founder of this company that sent this private jet into space invested millions of his own dollars into this project which just proves that the top one percent are doing amazing things for the country.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>WILLIS: Yes. It's not all taking your money. All right. Katie, Marjorie, and Al, thanks for coming on tonight. You guys were great as always.</p><p>LEWIS: Thank you.</p><p>WILLIS: Excellent job. Appreciate your time. Thank you.</p><p>PAVLICH: Thanks.</p><p>CLIFTON: Thank you.</p><p>WILLIS: And we'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>WILLIS: The media is dubbing him, \"Octodad.\" Desmond Hatchet is a 33-year-old Knoxville, Tennessee resident. He's the father of not eight, though, not 12, but 30 kids, with 11 different mothers. Only making minimum wage, he's struggling to keep up with child support payments and is asking taxpayers to lend him a hand.</p><p>Here to weigh in, Kelly Saindon, a family law attorney. Kelly, I can't get over this story. What do you make of this?</p><p>KELLY SAINDON, FAMILY LAW ATTORNEY: It's outrageous. I mean, it's very socially irresponsible. It's terrible for the children. Taxpayers are very upset. And what is wrong with these women that the second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eight, ninth, 10th, 11th, didn't say no?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>WILLIS: Well, -- I mean, I just can't get my mind wrapped around this. OK. So, the dad here, Desmond Hatchet, has a minimum wage job which means that some of the moms are getting as little as $1.49 a month. So, ultimately, the state would not be on the hook for a lot of dough, but should the state pay? Should government pay for this?</p><p>SAINDON: Well, let's back up really quickly, and I'm sorry to sort of derail that a little bit, but the government is on the hook, because you have to assume that if dad can only pay 1.49, then there's likely welfare involved.</p><p>WILLIS: True.</p><p>SAINDON: There's medical insurance involved. There's doctors that's involved. There's free lunches involved. And so, the $1.49 a month for some of these women is laughable. And so, in tells of him asking for help, he's saying hey, give me a break, I make 7.25 an hour, and 50 percent of his gross income goes to child support based on the laws there.</p><p>That's the maximum allowed. But the reality is this is a burden, and lots of people in Tennessee are outraged by this.</p><p>WILLIS: And, isn't the solution simple here? Stop having children.</p><p>SAINDON: Well, you would think so, and this guy was in some interviews in 2009, and at that point in time, he had 21 children. And they said, are you going to keep having kids? He said, no, I'm done. Three-years later, nine children later.</p><p>WILLIS: Wow.</p><p>SAINDON: What scares me is he's only 33. I mean, he could arguably procreate for another 40 years.</p><p>WILLIS: Yes. When I heard he was 33, that's what really turned me around on this. OK. Everybody is listening to the story, talking to the story. It's gone viral. Do you think people feel like you do? I mean, that it's an outrage, and that we should definitely not be subsidizing this kind of behavior?</p><p>SAINDON: You know, I posted it on Twitter and Facebook and everyone said, this guy is crazy. The women are crazy. What is he thinking with? Force him to get another job. They're saying, suggesting should castration become legal. Can we punish him for having more children? The answer is no. It's not legal, and you can't force him to stop having babies.</p><p>But lots of people are angry saying, why are my tax dollars subsidizing his irresponsible lifestyle?</p><p>WILLIS: Well, Kelly, what do you do about this? I mean, as a practical matter, what can the state do? Because if there's one Desmond, there's probably 20 Desmonds, there's 50 Desmonds, maybe different scales, fewer kids, more kids, who knows. But what can the state of Tennessee really do here?</p><p>SAINDON: You know, I arguably come to education. And, while some people may disagree with this, accessible birth control, because some guy making $7 an hour who's now giving $3.50 of that to his multiple children isn't going to spend his money on appropriate safe sex. So, that's a possible solution.</p><p>The reality of the situation is, I don't think there's an answer, unless, a judge forces him to get another job to support his children, because if that possibility, maybe he won't have as much free time to procreate.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>WILLIS: Well, I got to tell you, I think birth control is everywhere and easy to get. I doubt it's about the money. Kelly, thanks for coming on today. Really appreciate your time. Interesting conversation, thanks.</p><p>SAINDON: Thanks for having me.</p><p>WILLIS: Great. All right.</p><p>Well, now, we want to know what you think about this story. Should the Tennessee father of 30, 30 kids, get government help paying for child support? We took to the streets of New York asking people from all over the country what they thought. Here's what they said.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He has that many kids? He should pay for all those kids. Shouldn't be the -- shouldn't be the government. Shouldn't be us.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I think that's pretty sad commentary, 33 children and --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Thirty children, 33 years old.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Thirty-three years old. Where's the accountability? You know? That's really irresponsibile.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Promiscuous enough to do that with that many chicks, --</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's his mistake, and they're alive. So, you got to like be a man. Take your responsibility and live with that.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We deal in California with octomom. So, it's not OK. It's not OK. we worked hard all our life, you know, to have what we have, and when we have to pay extra, when we see this kind of stuff going on, it's just not OK.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He enjoyed making them so he should pay for them. You know? It's quite obvious that he enjoyed it, right?</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>WILLIS: I love that. It's not OK. We worked hard all our lives. Don't want to pay for this. Agree with you.</p><p>Here's what some of you are saying on my Facebook page. David writes this, \"No. There are too many people that do just that now, have kids just for the government support.\"</p><p>And Beverly agrees. She says, \"Talk about wanting a free ride? I feel sorry for the kids.\"</p><p>Laura says, \"Give him a government job, make him earn the money, then garnish his wages to pay the child support. Otherwise, the taxpayers foot the entire bill.\"</p><p>And finally, Gary says this, \"The only government help he should get is a free vasectomy.\"</p><p>Here's your chance to weigh in on our question tonight, log on to GerriWillis.com, vote on the right-hand side of the screen. I'll share the results at the end of tonight's show. And, in addition to liking me on Facebook, don't forget to follow me on Twitter. We love to hear what you have to say.</p><p>All right. Is breaking up the banks the only way to prevent another JPMorgan mess? Details after the break.</p><p>And coming up in just a few minutes, Neil Cavuto will be joined by former Minnesota governor, Tim Pawlenty. Don't go away.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>WILLIS: Federal regulators aren't giving up insisting more must be done in the wake of the huge trading loss at JPMorgan, but there may be a better option. Find out next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>WILLIS: In focus tonight, JPMorgan's multibillion-dollar trading loss. New reports claiming those losses may have exceeded $7 billion. That's much higher than previous estimates of more than 2 billion. So, is more regulation the answer? James Grant is publisher for Grant's Interest Rate Observer. Jim, welcome to the show.</p><p>JAMES GRANT, GRANT'S INTEREST RATE OBSERVER PUBLISHER: No, it's not.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>WILLIS: I'm sorry?</p><p>GRANT: It's not the answer.</p><p>WILLIS: It's not the answer.</p><p>GRANT: No.</p><p>WILLIS: Why not? I mean, look at this. This is a lot of money. It brings back all the memories of what happened in 2007 and 2008.</p><p>GRANT: It does.</p><p>WILLIS: Doesn't this make you worry that we could be in for another round of banks blowing up?</p><p>GRANT: One memory it brings back is the utter inability of the regulators in 2006 and 2007 to spot the most obvious and crying shame of an excuse for bank underwriting in modern American financial history. They saw nothing. And we are now to believe that the answer to the difficulties --</p><p>WILLIS: They had more of that.</p><p>GRANT: Right. So, you know, banking is hard-line of work. They start with a relatively small equity capital. They pile assets and liabilities. And, it takes a lot of judgment and it takes a certain -- a great amount of skill. And, it's not clear that the government has that skill. Bankers may not be very good at it, but the government is not --</p><p>WILLIS: Even worse, because they sure didn't see the last blowup coming. Gary Gensler, who runs the CFTC, big regulator, Commodities Future Trading Commission, had this to say about how he found out about what was going on at JPMorgan.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GARY GENSLER, CFTC CHAIRMAN: I would say that the trades that came to, I think, many of our attention personal attention with press reports.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Press reports?</p><p>GENSLER: But our staff was aware of trades that are in the clearinghouses, because they monitor the clearinghouses daily.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILLIS: It goes right to your point that these regulators don't know what's going on.</p><p>GRANT: The regulators are all -- over this bank -- they're quartered in the banks. Bank of any size has a permanent staff of regulators on the premises like the marine detachments at American embassies. The federal government is present constantly.</p><p>What the regulators had to know because it was in JPMorgan's own SEC filing was that there was no claim by the bank that these transactions were hedged transactions. You have to do -- in order to have a hedged transaction, you have to file extensive documents and you have to show that the transaction in which you were meant to hedge a position could hedge it.</p><p>And it wasn't merely a bet (ph). None of that took place in Morgan. So, the regulators had to know what was going on knowing they did nothing. And now, we are meant to believe that the answer is still more regulation. The answer is the personal accountability of the bankers in question. The answer is --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WILLIS: Jim, Jim, how do you make that happen? Because at the end of the day, these guys do not have a fall from grace. They just go to another bank. They don't even typically have to earn less.</p><p>GRANT: I'm going to tell you a story about capitalism. Way back when up until 1935 from the dawn of American modern banking system until 1935, if a bank got into trouble, it became impaired with respect to capital or became insolvent. The stockholders of that bank got a capital call. The taxpayers did not get a capital call, because --</p><p>WILLIS: That was the right way to do it.</p><p>GRANT: It was the stockholders bank and not the taxpayers. It would be easy today to institute a first approximation of this very healthy regime. One could, for example, claw back the income of any of our big- earring bankers above a certain decent minimum if the bank in which they have been working and have not been performing well gets into trouble.</p><p>There are all sorts of possibilities for reinstituting personal accountability in banking without subjecting it to the --</p><p>WILLIS: Wow! I can not -- I can't imagine how that would go over.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WILLIS: -- you're going to claw back -- I mean, just interesting. As a practical matter, do you think that could ever become a reality?</p><p>GRANT: Doesn't it sound good, though? I mean, it sounds that has a nice bipartisan appeal. Anyone who makes, for example, more than 10 times the manufacturing wage would be susceptible to claw back for seven years after he or she departs his or her --</p><p>WILLIS: Would anybody go to work in a bank if you did that?</p><p>GRANT: Sure, because people going to work into banks don't believe that they're going to run into trouble. And furthermore, susceptible to that kind of penalty, they would, perhaps, bear down a little bit harder with regard to risk management. It seems to me that the way forward is not with more government. The way forward is with more capitalism.</p><p>WILLIS: There's even been talk of Glass-Steagall, bringing Glass- Steagall back. And I'm not even sure that would have an impact on what happened here with JPMorgan, would it?</p><p>GRANT: I don't think so.</p><p>WILLIS: Yes.</p><p>GRANT: I think what is wanted again is the accountability of people who make decisions. What is not wanted is still more asphyxiating regulation as it is now. If you are a bank examiner, you have to worry about the following things. You have to worry about the card act. You have to worry about regulation E, the community reinvestment act. You have to worry about U.S. patriot act.</p><p>There are half a dozen or more major preoccupations of these regulators without any attention paid to the quality of the assets of the institutions they are regulating. And the answer supposedly to difficulties at JPMorgan and others is to give them still more to do, more regulations, more recondite rules that we will draft later, right?</p><p>WILLIS: All right. Fascinating. Fascinating stuff. Interesting. We'll have to put your idea to a few people and see how they react to it.</p><p>GRANT: Well, good.</p><p>WILLIS: Jim Grant, Grant's Interest Rate Observer, thanks for coming on tonight. We appreciate it.</p><p>All right. We'll be right back with my \"Two Cents More\" and the answer to our question of the day, should a Tennessee father of 30 get government help paying his child support? Coming up next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>WILLIS: A Tennessee man says he has problems paying child support. Why? Because he says he makes minimum wage and has 30 children. Now, Desmond Hatchett is pleading with the state to help him pay. So, we asked on GerriWillis.com, should the Tennessee father of 30 get government help to pay his child support.</p><p>No big surprise here. Ninety-seven percent of you say no way. Log on to GerriWillis.com for our online question every weekday.</p><p>All right. It may not feel like it for a lot of drivers out there, but traffic congestion dropped 30 percent last year across the country. Now, all that's good news. The bad news is the drop is because of higher gas prices and unemployment.</p><p>And tonight's top five, the city is seeing the biggest decreases in gridlock. Number five, Provo, Utah, number four, Sacramento -- Sacramento, that is, California. That's one positive for the Golden State. Number three, Honolulu, Hawaii. Number two, Akron, Ohio.</p><p>And the number one city where traffic congestion has decreased, Minneapolis, Minnesota, with stimulus funds drying road construction plummeted in 2011 making traffic less of an issue. Tampa, Jacksonville, Florida have the biggest increases in traffic from 2010 to 2011. You probably already know that if you're living it.</p><p>All right. Here are some of your e-mails. Cathy writes this, \"The next time VP Biden or anybody else talks about the mess inherited by Obama, he or they should be reminded that in the last two years of the Bush administration, both Houses of Congress were controlled by Democrats.\"</p><p>And finally, here's Lynn from Texas, \"Gerri, you were spot on with my opinions. Why don't you run for president? Oh, I forget. You're too sensible.\" Lynn, thank you for that.</p><p>Appreciate your comment. We love to hear from you and send me an e- mail to <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:Gerri@FoxBusiness.com\">Gerri@FoxBusiness.com</email></p><p>And finally, tonight, listen, airlines are officially out of control. Fees for bags, fees for boarding, fees to change tickets, and even fees if you want to schlep your own stuff. This summer, they're going to force all of us to cough up another fee. It's going to cost extra for friends and family to sit together.</p><p>So, if you're flying in the coming months, get ready to pay more for buying the seat next to you. In they're never ending quest to squeeze every possibly penny out of the American public airlines are now charging extra seats for windows and aisle seats. About 50 bucks each per trip. Now, the airlines (INAUDIBLE) to constantly trying to improve customer service.</p><p>Well, I've got a special announcement for them, forcing folks to fly solo on family vacations, it's not the way to do it. My advice to them, be honest enough about (ph) your pricing. As Americans, we love to fly. We don't like being taken for a ride. That is my \"Two Cents more.\"</p><p>That's it for tonight's WILLIS REPORT. Thanks for joining us. Don't forget to DVR the show if you can't catch us live. Have a great night.

And father of 30 asking taxpayers to bail him out. Hello, everybody, I'm Gerri Willis.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"/><p nitf:lede=\"true\">You know, I've gotten a lot of flak over the years for warning small investors of the perils of putting their hard-earned money into red-hot initial public offerings.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"/><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I warned here Friday about Facebook and it has become a prime example of what I'm talking about. My savvy viewers already know that Wall Street bait and switch.</p><p/><p>We're now learning while banks were selling Facebook stock to the public, they were quietly cutting their own outlook for the company. Can you believe that?</p><p/><p>It's the same thing happened during the housing bust. Bankers were selling mortgages to investors, mortgages they knew were worthless.</p><p/><p>Today, NASDAQ and brokerages pointing fingers at each other over the whole Facebook flop. Regulators say that small investors should have confidence in the market.</p><p/><p>You've got to be kidding. Those same regulators started investigations into what went wrong with the most hyped IPO in history.</p><p/><p>This is exactly the reason that many feel there is an uneven playing field when it comes to investing. Stock message boards were lit up with Facebook comments today. \"Biggest IPO fraud ever,\" said one. The biggest sting of all time.</p><p/><p>One person saying simply, \"The worst investment decision I have ever made.\" Unfortunately, that is the story for some small investors. They learn the hard way, and it shouldn't be that way. That's my two cents and this is THE WILLIS REPORT.</p><p/><p>(MUSIC)</p><p/><p>The market still not liking Facebook, shares dropping eight percent today. And reportedly, one investor is suing NASDAQ over its handling of the debut and seeking class-action status.</p><p/><p>So should investors feel zuckered - or maybe \"suckered\" is the better word - over the Facebook hype?</p><p/><p>To Gary Kaltbaum, president of Kaltbaum management. Gary, let's start with this lawsuit. Not a big surprise? I've been expecting it. You probably have been, too. Can they be successful?</p><p/><p>GARY KALTBAUM, PRESIDENT, KALTBAUM MANAGEMENT: Let's just say there's going to be a lot more of these lawsuits to come, and they're going to go after everybody.</p><p/><p>Whenever you see a company blow up on earnings, the lawyers who like these class actions are looking into the market and finding these things. So you're going to see it. It's going to go after the underwriters.</p><p/><p>It's probably going to be Facebook also. It's already on the NASDAQ and the free-for-all starts.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: Well, the free-for-all starts. But look, individual investors feel like the biggest losers here.</p><p/><p>KALTBAUM: Yes.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: Let's just be honest. And frankly, they were, because the investors, the original investors and the founders - they're the ones who made out.</p><p/><p>You know, individual investors aren't doing well here. This stock is trading lower than its offer price.</p><p/><p>KALTBAUM: A lot lower. And some people actually paid higher than the offering price. Look, the bottom line here is, the bankers overreached, overhyped.</p><p/><p>The price was an absolute joke. I've been yelling and screaming about this price, $100 billion market cap with less than $4 billion in revenues.</p><p/><p>And by the way, their earnings have been decelerating over the last three quarters. Now, I didn't know where the stock would open. When I saw it open in the 40s, I knew something was up. And you see what is happening here.</p><p/><p>And frankly, I think at even these levels that it is too expensive. And I think there will be more pain to come especially since there is so much negativity on the deal at this point.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: So the valuation, at the time it went public, four times Google's valuation based on earnings. Now, today, this was supposed to be the biggest tech IPO of all time. Its market cap now, $84.84 billion, down from $104 billion.</p><p/><p>What is going on here? And you know, what we had heard is that the major underwriters of this stock, their analysts had come out while they were doing the road show saying, look, this - you know, reduce your expectations particularly for revenue here. What do you make of that?</p><p/><p>KALTBAUM: I think the bankers were simply greedy. That is what this came out to. The more fees - they get more fees because of higher price and more shares and they didn't listen to sound advice.</p><p/><p>They put their own wallets first, the investors second. And guess what happens now? All those fees are going to be bye-bye. The credibility is shot, and they're going to lose a lot of money just defending the lawsuits going forward.</p><p/><p>So it is a lose-lose for these guys. And you would think they would learn a lesson. I still remember back in '99. They did the same thing, but it was actually worse back then.</p><p/><p>They brought companies public in the Internet space that had no revenues and brought them out with billion-dollar market caps. But then, investors would bid them up to $2 billion and $3 billion.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: Not anymore.</p><p/><p>KALTBAUM: And I think they were trying to get the same - yes, exactly. I think they were trying to get the same thing done here and it bit back on them.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: Bit back on them. But you know, look, we're sort of in a delicate time here for individual investors.</p><p/><p>KALTBAUM: Yes.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: You know, we had our hopes dashed for many years on returns in the stock market broadly. And just seeing this through the hype around this IPO for Facebook reminded people of the big tech boom, the big tech bubble.</p><p/><p>What do you think individual investors, what is the lesson they're going to take away from this?</p><p/><p>KALTBAUM: Well, they'd better take the lesson of the more noise, the more you better investigate. When Wall Street is very noisy on something, you've got to look at fine print and you've got to look at numbers.</p><p/><p>And this one was easy. You can look at amazon, which has 13 times the sales of this company and less the valuation, yet they don't care. They still bring it out at this price.</p><p/><p>If the individual investor did a little bit of work here, they would have looked at number and said, \"No way, I'm going to take a pass regardless what happens.\"</p><p/><p>But what happened was everybody thought this thing was going to open, $60, $70. I heard some people talking $80 and $90, and everybody figured OK.</p><p/><p>And of course, the big letdown came when it opened in the s$40. And now, we're seeing it at $31 and probably lower prices to come.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: All right. Hey, Gary -</p><p/><p>KALTBAUM: Yes.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: We've got some breaking news here that I want you to respond to on Facebook. The State of Massachusetts is investigating Morgan Stanley over its handling of Facebook and specifically the thing I mentioned earlier, this issuance of analyst guidance on the stock itself.</p><p/><p>There are subpoenas apparently is what I'm hearing. Details are just beginning to emerge just this moment. What do you make of that? It seems like a pile on to me, buddy.</p><p/><p>KALTBAUM: Well, you're going to see individual investors go to the state security's regulators. And states are going to go after them and investigate.</p><p/><p>I don't know the exact timing of the Morgan Stanley analyst, and I know exactly what he did. They talked about the mobile apps, that more people are on mobile than on the regular computers and that is going to hurt them, and also as far as numbers being a little bit on the soft side.</p><p/><p>So if the timing was bad, Morgan Stanley and especially the analysts, the way they did it, could be in some trouble. I'm not so sure of that.</p><p/><p>But you can expect everybody to get involved. This was a big deal. It was all over the news. It was all over the place. And just remember, there are 900 million people on Facebook.</p><p/><p>And when you are front and center, I can promise you the regulators want to make sure they cover their side of it. And that's where you're going to see a lot of this going on in the weeks to come, especially if the stock keeps getting hit.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: All right. Gary, we'll come back when they do. We want to talk to you some more. Thanks for being with us today. Really appreciate it.</p><p/><p>KALTBAUM: Thanks for having me.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: All right. Just to repeat here because this is just coming out moments ago, the State of Massachusetts investigating Morgan Stanley over Facebook and specifically some of the analyst guidance they had out about that stock.</p><p/><p>Apparently, subpoenas have been issued. We'll be following that. If we get more details in the hour, we'll let you know.</p><p/><p>In the meantime, coming up, why a small business tax credit is going virtually unused.</p><p/><p>And next, as Facebook stock continues its downward spiral, what should small investor be doing? I will break it down, next.</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>WILLIS: The nation's lead securities regulator, Mary Schapiro, had a message for small investors stung by the Facebook IPO.</p><p/><p>In spite of the problems with the social network's public stock launch, you should be confident in the markets. But it is too late. They've already lost confidence.</p><p/><p>The IPO that was supposed to take the market by storm and reignite small investor interest in stocks - well, it did just the opposite.</p><p/><p>Small investors are complaining. They were prevented from confirming trades or trade cancellations. Orders to buy and sell that normally take two seconds took two hours and even longer.</p><p/><p>People who bought are angry. Those who didn't are shrugging their soldiers and saying, \"I told you so.\" One investor commented to the \"Wall Street Journal,\" \"I was stuck for six hours trying to confirm whether I owned this dog or not.\"</p><p/><p>What is going on behind the scenes according to reports that NASDAQ system took an extra two milliseconds to calculate Facebook shares' opening price. In the meantime, the system was trying to process orders.</p><p/><p>And that resulted in NASDAQ having to manually override the system, an override which took 20 minutes. One simple glitch in the middle of a massive public stock offering gets magnified.</p><p/><p>There is no room for error. Now, that is the official explanation. But we talked to those in the marketplace. And what is going on is a lot of finger-pointing.</p><p/><p>NASDAQ says they fixed the problem that caused the delay and that it won't happen again. As for the order confirmations that are still pending, all NASDAQ will say is that after clearing up the unintended consequences of their pricing system, they cleared their backlog of outstanding orders and cancellations at 1:50 p.m. Friday afternoon.</p><p/><p>Now, the implication - look, any delays people have had since then must be at the broker-dealer end. Online brokers though, for their part, say the fault was with NASDAQ and market makers.</p><p/><p>Scottrade, for example, says NASDAQ issues caused their customer orders to be delayed, which in turn caused some of those investors to try to change or modify their order.</p><p/><p>And that put in place a cascade of errors. Scottrade told THE WILLIS REPORT that the company had staffed up to deal with questions even before problems arose across its 505 branch offices, its national service center and even on Facebook and Twitter.</p><p/><p>When it was clear big problems had occurred, the company kept its trading services team working throughout the weekend to manually process several thousand transactions.</p><p/><p>Can you imagine? Now, some of these brokerages managed to turn the trouble to their advantage. Scottrade opened 431 percent more new accounts Friday than a typical day, and today's trading volumes were up 70 percent versus monthly average.</p><p/><p>Fidelity spoke to us as well saying, quote, \"Fidelity continues to deal with the aftermath of Friday's market issues and delayed processing of orders for Facebook.\"</p><p/><p>\"As they did Friday and yesterday, Fidelity systems continued to operate normally. Unfortunately, our clients continue to feel the effects of these issues in some cases, and we're working aggressive to address them.\"</p><p/><p>E-trade declined to comment to us. So far, at least one investor has already filed a lawsuit against NASDAQ alleging negligence.</p><p/><p>If you've been impacted, the right thing to do is contact your broker pronto, even an online broker. Register what they call a dispute.</p><p/><p>You don't even need to have details of your trade on hand because the brokerage will have it in their computer system. Any reimbursement will come from the brokerage. But ultimately, NASDAQ will be on the hook.</p><p/><p>Frankly, I hate to see this kind of trouble for small investors. We need a system in place that treats everybody fairly, not just the deep pocketed investors looking to cash out of their investments.</p><p/><p>The market needs small investors and small investors need an even playing field in the stock market in order to fulfill their own financial goals, fix the problem, do it fast.</p><p/><p>Look, ultimately, it is in everybody's interest for the markets to work efficiently, openly and fairly.</p><p/><p>Coming up, it's a story you have to hear to believe - a father of 30 asking the government to pay his bills.</p><p/><p>And next, more evidence as if we needed it, on how Obamacare is crushing small business and how it's only going to get worse. Former CBO director Doug Holtz-Eakin gives us his take, next.</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>WILLIS: Many Catholic organizations not waiting for the Supreme Court to decide the fate of Obamacare. They're suing now. Douglas Holtz-Eakin gives us his take in 60 seconds.</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>WILLIS: A new report out this afternoon showing the country will go over a fiscal cliff if Congress doesn't act.</p><p/><p>Joining me now, Douglas Holtz-Eakin, former director of the CBO, now the president of the American Action Forum. Doug, welcome to the show again.</p><p/><p>DOUGLAS HOLTZ-EAKIN, PRESIDENT, AMERICAN ACTION FORUM: Thanks, Gerri.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: And your old organization, the CBO, out with a study - I've got to get you to comment on this - just this afternoon saying that allowing the Bush-era tax cuts to expire and a scheduled round of automatic spending cuts will send this economy spiraling into a recession. Do you agree and how big is the threat to the economy?</p><p/><p>EAKIN: Well, I think this is a very real threat, Gerri. Imagine investors who have a dividend tax rate 15 percent now, facing potential dividend tax rate of 44 percent come January 1st.</p><p/><p>It's not going to take until January for the implications to start showing up. Investors are going to start getting nervous this fall.</p><p/><p>I think markets are going to react. We're going to see some severe economic impact. So it is time to address the real problems that face the United States, the overspending, the uncertainty about the tax code.</p><p/><p>Put in place something investors can count on. And it is a reminder our problems are not because we have debt limits and things like that. The problems are, we have problems.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: we have problems and our main problem is spending too much money and money we don't have.</p><p/><p>EAKIN: Absolutely. Absolutely.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: You know, I want to talk to you about John Boehner because the Speaker of the House has been out talking about, how, OK, OK, we'll come to agreement on lifting the debt ceiling.</p><p/><p>But if you do that, let's have commensurate cuts. And he has taken hell for that. I mean the Democrats are all over him. You can't initiate in this country, it seems to me, a meaningful conversation about cutting spending because the left just won't allow it.</p><p/><p>EAKIN: Well, I mean, no one wants to default on the debt, but also no one wants to have a downgrade. And remember, Japan doesn't have a debt limit. Japan just got downgraded. Why? They have too much debt.</p><p/><p>The fundamental problem is the debt. Speaker Boehner is talking about an approach to addressing the real problem which is spending that causes debt. And we have to deal with that, not just the symptom.</p><p/><p>The notion we have clean debt, limit increase and everything is going to be fine is really badly mistaken.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: Well, you know, the president, just this weekend, meeting with world leaders, he said essentially this idea that we need to spend more is fundamentally right, to pull Europe out of recession and of course the threat that the U.S. would go into recession too.</p><p/><p>That seems to be diametrically opposed to what you just said.</p><p/><p>EAKIN: There is this great fear of austerity in the United States. But no one is talking about austerity. We're talking about sensible reforms to the big spending programs that are driving the debt.</p><p/><p>Take social security as an example. If we were to reform social security, all that would happen is that anyone working now would know what the deal was in retirement.</p><p/><p>International investors would know that we could deal with traditional third rail of politics. There would be no cut in immediate spending. There would be no impact on the recovery.</p><p/><p>So fear of austerity is just an excuse to not make reforms we need and which our citizens really deserve.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: You know, big headlines around Catholic institutions now suing the Federal Government over Obamacare and these requirements really that these institutions fund birth control, fund things that they're just fundamentally opposed to.</p><p/><p>I want you to respond to comments from Cardinal Timothy Dolan from right here in New York City. Here is what he had to say.</p><p/><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>TIMOTHY CARDINAL DOLAN, ARCHBISHOP OF NEW YORK: What the federal government did, unfortunately, and which got our Irish up is when they said, \"Oh, by the way, we'll define what a church is.\"</p><p/><p>\"We'll tell you what you can and can't do. We'll set the parameters as to how you can minister, to whom you may minister and the motives that should direct your ministry.\"</p><p/><p>That is the character, that is the tone of these straitjacketing exemptions.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: Your response?</p><p/><p>EAKIN: Well, I mean what you're hearing is the cardinal saying Obamacare tramples on religious freedoms that are at the core of what America is built on. It also tramples on economic freedoms, the individual mandate.</p><p/><p>And as you know it tramples on small businesses. This is a reform that really did not serve its intended goal of cutting costs. Costs are going up, not down, and in the process, has trampled all over things which we count on in America.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: Well, you know, it is interesting you bring up small business, because there was just a story today about how small businesses are not signing up for this tax credit.</p><p/><p>They have expected four million small businesses to get the free money. I mean, we're talking about free money here. But in fact, about 170,000 did it. Does that surprise you?</p><p/><p>EAKIN: There's a lot of research that says this credit is not particularly valuable because it penalizes you if you hire more. It penalizes if you pay better.</p><p/><p>It is incredibly complicated and hard to figure out and it is temporary, whereas the burdens that Obamacare imposes are permanent. So the research said, this isn't so good.</p><p/><p>We're now seeing evidence that is exactly right. It is not going to work.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: Well, you know, in just a few short weeks we're going to get answer from the Supreme Court on what they think about the individual mandate and Obamacare, generally.</p><p/><p>There's a lot of talk about what is going to happen, Doug. And I know you spent a lot of time thinking about that. Do you have any fresh insights into what the Supreme Court might do?</p><p/><p>EAKIN: I haven't had a vision of what the vote is. But certainly, I think the likely scenarios are ones in which if there is something overturned, it's just the individual mandate.</p><p/><p>And Supreme Court says, \"Out of abundance of caution, we'll do no more. You Congress, go fix this.\" Or since there is nowhere to stop between that and everything, they overturn everything.</p><p/><p>So there are only three things I'm looking for. If it upholds the law, we go from there, get rid of the individual mandate or throw out the entire law. Most of the other outcomes I don't think are very likely.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: All right. Well, Doug, thanks for coming on tonight. We appreciate your time.</p><p/><p>EAKIN: Thank you.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: Come back soon. All right. If you're fired up about this or any of the issues on the program, drop me an E-mail, <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:gerri@foxbusiness.com\">gerri@foxbusiness.com</email></p><p/><p>ANNOUNCER: Coming up on THE WILLIS REPORT, some people wait until they're financially stable to have kids, but not this Tennessee man who is calling on taxpayers to help them support his 30 children. Can he do this? Gerri gets to the bottom of this outrage.</p><p/><p>And lawmakers are calling to break up big banks in the wake of the J.P. Morgan multibillion-dollar trading fiasco, but is there another solution to this? We'll ask our expert. We're on the case, next on THE WILLIS REPORT.</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>WILLIS: Fresh details in the MF Global debacle. In the year leading up to the company's collapse, CEO Jon Corzine raked in the $8 million in compensation.</p><p/><p>Keep in mind we've got some $1.6 billion still missing. Now, granted $5 million of his compensation came in the form of stock options, which are now worthless, but $3 million came in straight up cash.</p><p/><p>While $1.6 billion, as I said, in customer money is still gone with the wind.</p><p/><p>Time to bring out our panel. Katie Pavlich is the news editor for TownHall.com in D.C. Marjorie Clifton is founder of SpikeTheWatercooler.com, also in D.C. And Al Lewis, columnist for \"Dow Jones Newswires\" in Denver. Katie, start with you.</p><p/><p>KATIE PAVLICH, NEWS EDITOR, TOWNHALL.COM: Look, when is President Obama and Vice President Joe Biden going to come out and denounce Jon Corzine?</p><p/><p>I mean, he did help craft the failed stimulus package after all. And I think they should reassure us that they're not going to go and get advice from people like Jon Corzine who are willing to cut and run and then cost their investors millions of dollars, billions of dollars, and then cost the taxpayers at least $1 trillion in addition, too.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: Crazy. Al, do you agree?</p><p/><p>AL LEWIS, COLUMNIST, \"DOW JONES NEWS WIRES\": I second what she said. And you know what? I want to add that every time one of these big banks blow up, what we do is we look back and we see how much the CEO got paid and it's a lot.</p><p/><p>And shat this shows is that CEO's get paid to take enormous risks with other people's money. And if it doesn't work out, oh, well.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: Oh, well. Yes, definitely, sometimes there is a disconnect between performance and pay. Marjorie, what do you say?</p><p/><p>MARJORIE CLIFTON, FOUNDER, SPIKETHEWATERCOOLER.COM: Well, it is part of the Wall Street culture. And right now, unfortunately, there is no retribution for anyone who unwisely spends investors' money.</p><p/><p>So unless there is an overall change in Wall Street and how we - and obviously, we don't regulate Wall Street - it's going to continue to happen.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: All right. Here's one of my favorite stories tonight. Former presidential candidate, Newt Gingrich, is having cash problems. Gingrich dropped out of the race nearly five million in debt and his own business is now going bankrupt. And yet, on the campaign trail, Gingrich said he knew exactly how to manage money.</p><p/><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>NEWT GINGRICH, (R) FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I am for capitalism. I am for honest entrepreneurs investing. I'm for people creating businesses. Callista and I have created four small businesses in the last decade. I get it.</p><p/><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>WILLIS: Marjorie, does Gingrich really get it when it comes to money?</p><p/><p>CLIFTON: Well, Gingrich doesn't get it when it comes to campaigns, because most politicians who don't end up cutting it are able to actually profit and make money when they come out of the election season. But what was unique about Gingrich is that he really was ego driven.</p><p/><p>I mean, you saw with Santorum, he stood for ideals. Gingrich stood for ego. And people saw right through it. So, I think he needs to take a lesson from Sarah Palin on how to capitalize on your image and rebrand himself.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: I think he needs more than capitalizing in his image. Katie, what do you say?</p><p/><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p>KATIE PAVLICH, TOWNHALL.COM NEWS EDITOR: I say (ph) that truth is looks like he is in a lot of trouble here. And I think he's probably bouncing off of what Marjorie just said. He's probably reassessing why he stayed in the GOP primary race so long and whether he should have run for president, in the first place.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: You're probably right. Al, what do you say?</p><p/><p>AL LEWIS, \"DOW JONES NEWSWIRES\" COLUMNIST: Oh, I just love the words bankrupt fiscal conservative in the same headline. You know, I think the Republicans made the right choice. The question is, what took them so long? I mean, this is a guy who says he doesn't like Fannie and Freddie and he takes money from Fannie and Freddie.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: Yes.</p><p/><p>LEWIS: He complains about adultery. Why he commits adultery? Now, we see all his money problems while he is trying to straighten out the money problems of America. How does this guy have any credibility left? Why are we even talking about him?</p><p/><p>WILLIS: And send your e-mails to AlLewis.com.</p><p/><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p>WILLIS: All right. Here's a man bite dog, bites man, bites newspaper story. There's a new reason to be aware of dog bites. Guess what? They're driving up insurance rates. In fact, dog bites account for more than a third of homeowners insurance liability claims in 2011, costing hundreds of millions of dollars. Al, I would never have guessed this.</p><p/><p>LEWIS: Well, first I want to say that e-mail is <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:Al.Lewis@DowJones.com\">Al.Lewis@DowJones.com</email></p><p/><p>WILLIS: Oh, you're going to --</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>WILLIS: Oh, my goodness. I wish I was saving you.</p><p/><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p>LEWIS: And the second thing is buy a cat, OK? Get a cat.</p><p/><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p>LEWIS: That's basically all I got to say about this story.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: Marjorie.</p><p/><p>CLIFTON: Well, it was actually $479 million went out last year which is just a shocking number. And I do agree. Either, I would go with the cat, a gerbil, a poodle, maybe one of those small little dogs. But yes, in general, this does not farewell for dog owners.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: Katie, how about nice dogs, nice dogs?</p><p/><p>PAVLICH: Yes, you know, some of the most vicious dogs I've ever met are the little ones. I don't say a get a little dog. I'd say --</p><p/><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p>CLIFTON: Little dog syndrome.</p><p/><p>PAVLICH: Get a breed that is nice. And hello, homeowners, keep your dog away from your visitors. Keep them on a leash. Keep them away from kids and people visiting and people on the street. Keep your kids away from front yards and dogs that you're not familiar with. It's basic common sense.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: My favorite pick is the lab. I want a lab.</p><p/><p>PAVLICH: Yes, exactly.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: The private space industry taking off for the first time in history. SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket, doesn't that sound cool? It took flight this morning delivering 1,000 pounds of cargo to the International Space Station. Al, what do you say?</p><p/><p>LEWIS: Well, we're a far cry away from private space. This is highly subsidized by NASA, but it's good to see. This is a small step for mankind, I think, but nonetheless, a good one.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: Marjorie, I want us to have NASA. I want the country to be involved in this. This whole idea that we just leave it to entrepreneurs, not very satisfying for me. What do you say?</p><p/><p>CLIFTON: Well, NASA was excited because it actually privatizing space is a more lucrative prospect given our government spending right now. We don't have the funds for it. I want to know if office space is cheaper on the moon because gas prices are pretty high, and I'm wondering, how can we figure this out, because something is not working with the economy here in the United States.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: Katie, can we not afford it? Is that the reason we're not doing it?</p><p/><p>PAVLICH: Well, unfortunately, because the government has spent out of control, we can't afford it. And I am with you. I think that space exploration is actually crucial to our national and international security.</p><p/><p>But on the brighter note, I like idea that the founder of this company that sent this private jet into space invested millions of his own dollars into this project which just proves that the top one percent are doing amazing things for the country.</p><p/><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p>WILLIS: Yes. It's not all taking your money. All right. Katie, Marjorie, and Al, thanks for coming on tonight. You guys were great as always.</p><p/><p>LEWIS: Thank you.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: Excellent job. Appreciate your time. Thank you.</p><p/><p>PAVLICH: Thanks.</p><p/><p>CLIFTON: Thank you.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: And we'll be right back.</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>WILLIS: The media is dubbing him, \"Octodad.\" Desmond Hatchet is a 33-year-old Knoxville, Tennessee resident. He's the father of not eight, though, not 12, but 30 kids, with 11 different mothers. Only making minimum wage, he's struggling to keep up with child support payments and is asking taxpayers to lend him a hand.</p><p/><p>Here to weigh in, Kelly Saindon, a family law attorney. Kelly, I can't get over this story. What do you make of this?</p><p/><p>KELLY SAINDON, FAMILY LAW ATTORNEY: It's outrageous. I mean, it's very socially irresponsible. It's terrible for the children. Taxpayers are very upset. And what is wrong with these women that the second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eight, ninth, 10th, 11th, didn't say no?</p><p/><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p>WILLIS: Well, -- I mean, I just can't get my mind wrapped around this. OK. So, the dad here, Desmond Hatchet, has a minimum wage job which means that some of the moms are getting as little as $1.49 a month. So, ultimately, the state would not be on the hook for a lot of dough, but should the state pay? Should government pay for this?</p><p/><p>SAINDON: Well, let's back up really quickly, and I'm sorry to sort of derail that a little bit, but the government is on the hook, because you have to assume that if dad can only pay 1.49, then there's likely welfare involved.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: True.</p><p/><p>SAINDON: There's medical insurance involved. There's doctors that's involved. There's free lunches involved. And so, the $1.49 a month for some of these women is laughable. And so, in tells of him asking for help, he's saying hey, give me a break, I make 7.25 an hour, and 50 percent of his gross income goes to child support based on the laws there.</p><p/><p>That's the maximum allowed. But the reality is this is a burden, and lots of people in Tennessee are outraged by this.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: And, isn't the solution simple here? Stop having children.</p><p/><p>SAINDON: Well, you would think so, and this guy was in some interviews in 2009, and at that point in time, he had 21 children. And they said, are you going to keep having kids? He said, no, I'm done. Three-years later, nine children later.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: Wow.</p><p/><p>SAINDON: What scares me is he's only 33. I mean, he could arguably procreate for another 40 years.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: Yes. When I heard he was 33, that's what really turned me around on this. OK. Everybody is listening to the story, talking to the story. It's gone viral. Do you think people feel like you do? I mean, that it's an outrage, and that we should definitely not be subsidizing this kind of behavior?</p><p/><p>SAINDON: You know, I posted it on Twitter and Facebook and everyone said, this guy is crazy. The women are crazy. What is he thinking with? Force him to get another job. They're saying, suggesting should castration become legal. Can we punish him for having more children? The answer is no. It's not legal, and you can't force him to stop having babies.</p><p/><p>But lots of people are angry saying, why are my tax dollars subsidizing his irresponsible lifestyle?</p><p/><p>WILLIS: Well, Kelly, what do you do about this? I mean, as a practical matter, what can the state do? Because if there's one Desmond, there's probably 20 Desmonds, there's 50 Desmonds, maybe different scales, fewer kids, more kids, who knows. But what can the state of Tennessee really do here?</p><p/><p>SAINDON: You know, I arguably come to education. And, while some people may disagree with this, accessible birth control, because some guy making $7 an hour who's now giving $3.50 of that to his multiple children isn't going to spend his money on appropriate safe sex. So, that's a possible solution.</p><p/><p>The reality of the situation is, I don't think there's an answer, unless, a judge forces him to get another job to support his children, because if that possibility, maybe he won't have as much free time to procreate.</p><p/><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p>WILLIS: Well, I got to tell you, I think birth control is everywhere and easy to get. I doubt it's about the money. Kelly, thanks for coming on today. Really appreciate your time. Interesting conversation, thanks.</p><p/><p>SAINDON: Thanks for having me.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: Great. All right.</p><p/><p>Well, now, we want to know what you think about this story. Should the Tennessee father of 30, 30 kids, get government help paying for child support? We took to the streets of New York asking people from all over the country what they thought. Here's what they said.</p><p/><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p/><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He has that many kids? He should pay for all those kids. Shouldn't be the -- shouldn't be the government. Shouldn't be us.</p><p/><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I think that's pretty sad commentary, 33 children and --</p><p/><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Thirty children, 33 years old.</p><p/><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Thirty-three years old. Where's the accountability? You know? That's really irresponsibile.</p><p/><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Promiscuous enough to do that with that many chicks, --</p><p/><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's his mistake, and they're alive. So, you got to like be a man. Take your responsibility and live with that.</p><p/><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We deal in California with octomom. So, it's not OK. It's not OK. we worked hard all our life, you know, to have what we have, and when we have to pay extra, when we see this kind of stuff going on, it's just not OK.</p><p/><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He enjoyed making them so he should pay for them. You know? It's quite obvious that he enjoyed it, right?</p><p/><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p/><p>WILLIS: I love that. It's not OK. We worked hard all our lives. Don't want to pay for this. Agree with you.</p><p/><p>Here's what some of you are saying on my Facebook page. David writes this, \"No. There are too many people that do just that now, have kids just for the government support.\"</p><p/><p>And Beverly agrees. She says, \"Talk about wanting a free ride? I feel sorry for the kids.\"</p><p/><p>Laura says, \"Give him a government job, make him earn the money, then garnish his wages to pay the child support. Otherwise, the taxpayers foot the entire bill.\"</p><p/><p>And finally, Gary says this, \"The only government help he should get is a free vasectomy.\"</p><p/><p>Here's your chance to weigh in on our question tonight, log on to GerriWillis.com, vote on the right-hand side of the screen. I'll share the results at the end of tonight's show. And, in addition to liking me on Facebook, don't forget to follow me on Twitter. We love to hear what you have to say.</p><p/><p>All right. Is breaking up the banks the only way to prevent another JPMorgan mess? Details after the break.</p><p/><p>And coming up in just a few minutes, Neil Cavuto will be joined by former Minnesota governor, Tim Pawlenty. Don't go away.</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>WILLIS: Federal regulators aren't giving up insisting more must be done in the wake of the huge trading loss at JPMorgan, but there may be a better option. Find out next.</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>WILLIS: In focus tonight, JPMorgan's multibillion-dollar trading loss. New reports claiming those losses may have exceeded $7 billion. That's much higher than previous estimates of more than 2 billion. So, is more regulation the answer? James Grant is publisher for Grant's Interest Rate Observer. Jim, welcome to the show.</p><p/><p>JAMES GRANT, GRANT'S INTEREST RATE OBSERVER PUBLISHER: No, it's not.</p><p/><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p>WILLIS: I'm sorry?</p><p/><p>GRANT: It's not the answer.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: It's not the answer.</p><p/><p>GRANT: No.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: Why not? I mean, look at this. This is a lot of money. It brings back all the memories of what happened in 2007 and 2008.</p><p/><p>GRANT: It does.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: Doesn't this make you worry that we could be in for another round of banks blowing up?</p><p/><p>GRANT: One memory it brings back is the utter inability of the regulators in 2006 and 2007 to spot the most obvious and crying shame of an excuse for bank underwriting in modern American financial history. They saw nothing. And we are now to believe that the answer to the difficulties --</p><p/><p>WILLIS: They had more of that.</p><p/><p>GRANT: Right. So, you know, banking is hard-line of work. They start with a relatively small equity capital. They pile assets and liabilities. And, it takes a lot of judgment and it takes a certain -- a great amount of skill. And, it's not clear that the government has that skill. Bankers may not be very good at it, but the government is not --</p><p/><p>WILLIS: Even worse, because they sure didn't see the last blowup coming. Gary Gensler, who runs the CFTC, big regulator, Commodities Future Trading Commission, had this to say about how he found out about what was going on at JPMorgan.</p><p/><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>GARY GENSLER, CFTC CHAIRMAN: I would say that the trades that came to, I think, many of our attention personal attention with press reports.</p><p/><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Press reports?</p><p/><p>GENSLER: But our staff was aware of trades that are in the clearinghouses, because they monitor the clearinghouses daily.</p><p/><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>WILLIS: It goes right to your point that these regulators don't know what's going on.</p><p/><p>GRANT: The regulators are all -- over this bank -- they're quartered in the banks. Bank of any size has a permanent staff of regulators on the premises like the marine detachments at American embassies. The federal government is present constantly.</p><p/><p>What the regulators had to know because it was in JPMorgan's own SEC filing was that there was no claim by the bank that these transactions were hedged transactions. You have to do -- in order to have a hedged transaction, you have to file extensive documents and you have to show that the transaction in which you were meant to hedge a position could hedge it.</p><p/><p>And it wasn't merely a bet (ph). None of that took place in Morgan. So, the regulators had to know what was going on knowing they did nothing. And now, we are meant to believe that the answer is still more regulation. The answer is the personal accountability of the bankers in question. The answer is --</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>WILLIS: Jim, Jim, how do you make that happen? Because at the end of the day, these guys do not have a fall from grace. They just go to another bank. They don't even typically have to earn less.</p><p/><p>GRANT: I'm going to tell you a story about capitalism. Way back when up until 1935 from the dawn of American modern banking system until 1935, if a bank got into trouble, it became impaired with respect to capital or became insolvent. The stockholders of that bank got a capital call. The taxpayers did not get a capital call, because --</p><p/><p>WILLIS: That was the right way to do it.</p><p/><p>GRANT: It was the stockholders bank and not the taxpayers. It would be easy today to institute a first approximation of this very healthy regime. One could, for example, claw back the income of any of our big- earring bankers above a certain decent minimum if the bank in which they have been working and have not been performing well gets into trouble.</p><p/><p>There are all sorts of possibilities for reinstituting personal accountability in banking without subjecting it to the --</p><p/><p>WILLIS: Wow! I can not -- I can't imagine how that would go over.</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>WILLIS: -- you're going to claw back -- I mean, just interesting. As a practical matter, do you think that could ever become a reality?</p><p/><p>GRANT: Doesn't it sound good, though? I mean, it sounds that has a nice bipartisan appeal. Anyone who makes, for example, more than 10 times the manufacturing wage would be susceptible to claw back for seven years after he or she departs his or her --</p><p/><p>WILLIS: Would anybody go to work in a bank if you did that?</p><p/><p>GRANT: Sure, because people going to work into banks don't believe that they're going to run into trouble. And furthermore, susceptible to that kind of penalty, they would, perhaps, bear down a little bit harder with regard to risk management. It seems to me that the way forward is not with more government. The way forward is with more capitalism.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: There's even been talk of Glass-Steagall, bringing Glass- Steagall back. And I'm not even sure that would have an impact on what happened here with JPMorgan, would it?</p><p/><p>GRANT: I don't think so.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: Yes.</p><p/><p>GRANT: I think what is wanted again is the accountability of people who make decisions. What is not wanted is still more asphyxiating regulation as it is now. If you are a bank examiner, you have to worry about the following things. You have to worry about the card act. You have to worry about regulation E, the community reinvestment act. You have to worry about U.S. patriot act.</p><p/><p>There are half a dozen or more major preoccupations of these regulators without any attention paid to the quality of the assets of the institutions they are regulating. And the answer supposedly to difficulties at JPMorgan and others is to give them still more to do, more regulations, more recondite rules that we will draft later, right?</p><p/><p>WILLIS: All right. Fascinating. Fascinating stuff. Interesting. We'll have to put your idea to a few people and see how they react to it.</p><p/><p>GRANT: Well, good.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: Jim Grant, Grant's Interest Rate Observer, thanks for coming on tonight. We appreciate it.</p><p/><p>All right. We'll be right back with my \"Two Cents More\" and the answer to our question of the day, should a Tennessee father of 30 get government help paying his child support? Coming up next.</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>WILLIS: A Tennessee man says he has problems paying child support. Why? Because he says he makes minimum wage and has 30 children. Now, Desmond Hatchett is pleading with the state to help him pay. So, we asked on GerriWillis.com, should the Tennessee father of 30 get government help to pay his child support.</p><p/><p>No big surprise here. Ninety-seven percent of you say no way. Log on to GerriWillis.com for our online question every weekday.</p><p/><p>All right. It may not feel like it for a lot of drivers out there, but traffic congestion dropped 30 percent last year across the country. Now, all that's good news. The bad news is the drop is because of higher gas prices and unemployment.</p><p/><p>And tonight's top five, the city is seeing the biggest decreases in gridlock. Number five, Provo, Utah, number four, Sacramento -- Sacramento, that is, California. That's one positive for the Golden State. Number three, Honolulu, Hawaii. Number two, Akron, Ohio.</p><p/><p>And the number one city where traffic congestion has decreased, Minneapolis, Minnesota, with stimulus funds drying road construction plummeted in 2011 making traffic less of an issue. Tampa, Jacksonville, Florida have the biggest increases in traffic from 2010 to 2011. You probably already know that if you're living it.</p><p/><p>All right. Here are some of your e-mails. Cathy writes this, \"The next time VP Biden or anybody else talks about the mess inherited by Obama, he or they should be reminded that in the last two years of the Bush administration, both Houses of Congress were controlled by Democrats.\"</p><p/><p>And finally, here's Lynn from Texas, \"Gerri, you were spot on with my opinions. Why don't you run for president? Oh, I forget. You're too sensible.\" Lynn, thank you for that.</p><p/><p>Appreciate your comment. We love to hear from you and send me an e- mail to <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:Gerri@FoxBusiness.com\">Gerri@FoxBusiness.com</email></p><p/><p>And finally, tonight, listen, airlines are officially out of control. Fees for bags, fees for boarding, fees to change tickets, and even fees if you want to schlep your own stuff. This summer, they're going to force all of us to cough up another fee. It's going to cost extra for friends and family to sit together.</p><p/><p>So, if you're flying in the coming months, get ready to pay more for buying the seat next to you. In they're never ending quest to squeeze every possibly penny out of the American public airlines are now charging extra seats for windows and aisle seats. About 50 bucks each per trip. Now, the airlines (INAUDIBLE) to constantly trying to improve customer service.</p><p/><p>Well, I've got a special announcement for them, forcing folks to fly solo on family vacations, it's not the way to do it. My advice to them, be honest enough about (ph) your pricing. As Americans, we love to fly. We don't like being taken for a ride. That is my \"Two Cents more.\"</p><p/><p>That's it for tonight's WILLIS REPORT. Thanks for joining us. Don't forget to DVR the show if you can't catch us live. Have a great night.

And father of 30 asking taxpayers to bail him out. Hello, everybody, I'm Gerri Willis.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">You know, I've gotten a lot of flak over the years for warning small investors of the perils of putting their hard-earned money into red-hot initial public offerings.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I warned here Friday about Facebook and it has become a prime example of what I'm talking about. My savvy viewers already know that Wall Street bait and switch.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We're now learning while banks were selling Facebook stock to the public, they were quietly cutting their own outlook for the company. Can you believe that?</p><p>It's the same thing happened during the housing bust. Bankers were selling mortgages to investors, mortgages they knew were worthless.</p><p>Today, NASDAQ and brokerages pointing fingers at each other over the whole Facebook flop. Regulators say that small investors should have confidence in the market.</p><p>You've got to be kidding. Those same regulators started investigations into what went wrong with the most hyped IPO in history.</p><p>This is exactly the reason that many feel there is an uneven playing field when it comes to investing. Stock message boards were lit up with Facebook comments today. \"Biggest IPO fraud ever,\" said one. The biggest sting of all time.</p><p>One person saying simply, \"The worst investment decision I have ever made.\" Unfortunately, that is the story for some small investors. They learn the hard way, and it shouldn't be that way. That's my two cents and this is THE WILLIS REPORT.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>The market still not liking Facebook, shares dropping eight percent today. And reportedly, one investor is suing NASDAQ over its handling of the debut and seeking class-action status.</p><p>So should investors feel zuckered - or maybe \"suckered\" is the better word - over the Facebook hype?</p><p>To Gary Kaltbaum, president of Kaltbaum management. Gary, let's start with this lawsuit. Not a big surprise? I've been expecting it. You probably have been, too. Can they be successful?</p><p>GARY KALTBAUM, PRESIDENT, KALTBAUM MANAGEMENT: Let's just say there's going to be a lot more of these lawsuits to come, and they're going to go after everybody.</p><p>Whenever you see a company blow up on earnings, the lawyers who like these class actions are looking into the market and finding these things. So you're going to see it. It's going to go after the underwriters.</p><p>It's probably going to be Facebook also. It's already on the NASDAQ and the free-for-all starts.</p><p>WILLIS: Well, the free-for-all starts. But look, individual investors feel like the biggest losers here.</p><p>KALTBAUM: Yes.</p><p>WILLIS: Let's just be honest. And frankly, they were, because the investors, the original investors and the founders - they're the ones who made out.</p><p>You know, individual investors aren't doing well here. This stock is trading lower than its offer price.</p><p>KALTBAUM: A lot lower. And some people actually paid higher than the offering price. Look, the bottom line here is, the bankers overreached, overhyped.</p><p>The price was an absolute joke. I've been yelling and screaming about this price, $100 billion market cap with less than $4 billion in revenues.</p><p>And by the way, their earnings have been decelerating over the last three quarters. Now, I didn't know where the stock would open. When I saw it open in the 40s, I knew something was up. And you see what is happening here.</p><p>And frankly, I think at even these levels that it is too expensive. And I think there will be more pain to come especially since there is so much negativity on the deal at this point.</p><p>WILLIS: So the valuation, at the time it went public, four times Google's valuation based on earnings. Now, today, this was supposed to be the biggest tech IPO of all time. Its market cap now, $84.84 billion, down from $104 billion.</p><p>What is going on here? And you know, what we had heard is that the major underwriters of this stock, their analysts had come out while they were doing the road show saying, look, this - you know, reduce your expectations particularly for revenue here. What do you make of that?</p><p>KALTBAUM: I think the bankers were simply greedy. That is what this came out to. The more fees - they get more fees because of higher price and more shares and they didn't listen to sound advice.</p><p>They put their own wallets first, the investors second. And guess what happens now? All those fees are going to be bye-bye. The credibility is shot, and they're going to lose a lot of money just defending the lawsuits going forward.</p><p>So it is a lose-lose for these guys. And you would think they would learn a lesson. I still remember back in '99. They did the same thing, but it was actually worse back then.</p><p>They brought companies public in the Internet space that had no revenues and brought them out with billion-dollar market caps. But then, investors would bid them up to $2 billion and $3 billion.</p><p>WILLIS: Not anymore.</p><p>KALTBAUM: And I think they were trying to get the same - yes, exactly. I think they were trying to get the same thing done here and it bit back on them.</p><p>WILLIS: Bit back on them. But you know, look, we're sort of in a delicate time here for individual investors.</p><p>KALTBAUM: Yes.</p><p>WILLIS: You know, we had our hopes dashed for many years on returns in the stock market broadly. And just seeing this through the hype around this IPO for Facebook reminded people of the big tech boom, the big tech bubble.</p><p>What do you think individual investors, what is the lesson they're going to take away from this?</p><p>KALTBAUM: Well, they'd better take the lesson of the more noise, the more you better investigate. When Wall Street is very noisy on something, you've got to look at fine print and you've got to look at numbers.</p><p>And this one was easy. You can look at amazon, which has 13 times the sales of this company and less the valuation, yet they don't care. They still bring it out at this price.</p><p>If the individual investor did a little bit of work here, they would have looked at number and said, \"No way, I'm going to take a pass regardless what happens.\"</p><p>But what happened was everybody thought this thing was going to open, $60, $70. I heard some people talking $80 and $90, and everybody figured OK.</p><p>And of course, the big letdown came when it opened in the $40s. And now, we're seeing it at $31 and probably lower prices to come.</p><p>WILLIS: All right. Hey, Gary -</p><p>KALTBAUM: Yes.</p><p>WILLIS: We've got some breaking news here that I want you to respond to on Facebook. The State of Massachusetts is investigating Morgan Stanley over its handling of Facebook and specifically the thing I mentioned earlier, this issuance of analyst guidance on the stock itself.</p><p>There are subpoenas apparently is what I'm hearing. Details are just beginning to emerge just this moment. What do you make of that? It seems like a pile on to me, buddy.</p><p>KALTBAUM: Well, you're going to see individual investors go to the state security's regulators. And states are going to go after them and investigate.</p><p>I don't know the exact timing of the Morgan Stanley analyst, and I know exactly what he did. They talked about the mobile apps, that more people are on mobile than on the regular computers and that is going to hurt them, and also as far as numbers being a little bit on the soft side.</p><p>So if the timing was bad, Morgan Stanley and especially the analysts, the way they did it, could be in some trouble. I'm not so sure of that.</p><p>But you can expect everybody to get involved. This was a big deal. It was all over the news. It was all over the place. And just remember, there are 900 million people on Facebook.</p><p>And when you are front and center, I can promise you the regulators want to make sure they cover their side of it. And that's where you're going to see a lot of this going on in the weeks to come, especially if the stock keeps getting hit.</p><p>WILLIS: All right. Gary, we'll come back when they do. We want to talk to you some more. Thanks for being with us today. Really appreciate it.</p><p>KALTBAUM: Thanks for having me.</p><p>WILLIS: All right. Just to repeat here because this is just coming out moments ago, the State of Massachusetts investigating Morgan Stanley over Facebook and specifically some of the analyst guidance they had out about that stock.</p><p>Apparently, subpoenas have been issued. We'll be following that. If we get more details in the hour, we'll let you know.</p><p>In the meantime, coming up, why a small business tax credit is going virtually unused.</p><p>And next, as Facebook stock continues its downward spiral, what should small investor be doing? I will break it down, next.</p><p>WILLIS: The nation's lead securities regulator, Mary Schapiro, had a message for small investors stung by the Facebook IPO.</p><p>In spite of the problems with the social network's public stock launch, you should be confident in the markets. But it is too late. They've already lost confidence.</p><p>The IPO that was supposed to take the market by storm and reignite small investor interest in stocks - well, it did just the opposite.</p><p>Small investors are complaining. They were prevented from confirming trades or trade cancellations. Orders to buy and sell that normally take two seconds took two hours and even longer.</p><p>People who bought are angry. Those who didn't are shrugging their soldiers and saying, \"I told you so.\" One investor commented to the \"Wall Street Journal,\" \"I was stuck for six hours trying to confirm whether I owned this dog or not.\"</p><p>What is going on behind the scenes according to reports that NASDAQ system took an extra two milliseconds to calculate Facebook shares' opening price. In the meantime, the system was trying to process orders.</p><p>And that resulted in NASDAQ having to manually override the system, an override which took 20 minutes. One simple glitch in the middle of a massive public stock offering gets magnified.</p><p>There is no room for error. Now, that is the official explanation. But we talked to those in the marketplace. And what is going on is a lot of finger-pointing.</p><p>NASDAQ says they fixed the problem that caused the delay and that it won't happen again. As for the order confirmations that are still pending, all NASDAQ will say is that after clearing up the unintended consequences of their pricing system, they cleared their backlog of outstanding orders and cancellations at 1:50 p.m. Friday afternoon.</p><p>Now, the implication - look, any delays people have had since then must be at the broker-dealer end. Online brokers though, for their part, say the fault was with NASDAQ and market makers.</p><p>Scottrade, for example, says NASDAQ issues caused their customer orders to be delayed, which in turn caused some of those investors to try to change or modify their order.</p><p>And that put in place a cascade of errors. Scottrade told THE WILLIS REPORT that the company had staffed up to deal with questions even before problems arose across its 505 branch offices, its national service center and even on Facebook and Twitter.</p><p>When it was clear big problems had occurred, the company kept its trading services team working throughout the weekend to manually process several thousand transactions.</p><p>Can you imagine? Now, some of these brokerages managed to turn the trouble to their advantage. Scottrade opened 431 percent more new accounts Friday than a typical day, and today's trading volumes were up 70 percent versus monthly average.</p><p>Fidelity spoke to us as well saying, quote, \"Fidelity continues to deal with the aftermath of Friday's market issues and delayed processing of orders for Facebook.\"</p><p>\"As they did Friday and yesterday, Fidelity systems continued to operate normally. Unfortunately, our clients continue to feel the effects of these issues in some cases, and we're working aggressive to address them.\"</p><p>E-trade declined to comment to us. So far, at least one investor has already filed a lawsuit against NASDAQ alleging negligence.</p><p>If you've been impacted, the right thing to do is contact your broker pronto, even an online broker. Register what they call a dispute.</p><p>You don't even need to have details of your trade on hand because the brokerage will have it in their computer system. Any reimbursement will come from the brokerage. But ultimately, NASDAQ will be on the hook.</p><p>Frankly, I hate to see this kind of trouble for small investors. We need a system in place that treats everybody fairly, not just the deep pocketed investors looking to cash out of their investments.</p><p>The market needs small investors and small investors need an even playing field in the stock market in order to fulfill their own financial goals, fix the problem, do it fast.</p><p>Look, ultimately, it is in everybody's interest for the markets to work efficiently, openly and fairly.</p><p>Coming up, it's a story you have to hear to believe - a father of 30 asking the government to pay his bills.</p><p>And next, more evidence as if we needed it, on how Obamacare is crushing small business and how it's only going to get worse. Former CBO director Doug Holtz-Eakin gives us his take, next.</p><p>WILLIS: Many Catholic organizations not waiting for the Supreme Court to decide the fate of Obamacare. They're suing now. Douglas Holtz-Eakin gives us his take in 60 seconds.</p><p>WILLIS: A new report out this afternoon showing the country will go over a fiscal cliff if Congress doesn't act.</p><p>Joining me now, Douglas Holtz-Eakin, former director of the CBO, now the president of the American Action Forum. Doug, welcome to the show again.</p><p>DOUGLAS HOLTZ-EAKIN, PRESIDENT, AMERICAN ACTION FORUM: Thanks, Gerri.</p><p>WILLIS: And your old organization, the CBO, out with a study - I've got to get you to comment on this - just this afternoon saying that allowing the Bush-era tax cuts to expire and a scheduled round of automatic spending cuts will send this economy spiraling into a recession. Do you agree and how big is the threat to the economy?</p><p>EAKIN: Well, I think this is a very real threat, Gerri. Imagine investors who have a dividend tax rate 15 percent now, facing potential dividend tax rate of 44 percent come January 1st.</p><p>It's not going to take until January for the implications to start showing up. Investors are going to start getting nervous this fall.</p><p>I think markets are going to react. We're going to see some severe economic impact. So it is time to address the real problems that face the United States, the overspending, the uncertainty about the tax code.</p><p>Put in place something investors can count on. And it is a reminder our problems are not because we have debt limits and things like that. The problems are, we have problems.</p><p>WILLIS: we have problems and our main problem is spending too much money and money we don't have.</p><p>EAKIN: Absolutely. Absolutely.</p><p>WILLIS: You know, I want to talk to you about John Boehner because the Speaker of the House has been out talking about, how, OK, OK, we'll come to agreement on lifting the debt ceiling.</p><p>But if you do that, let's have commensurate cuts. And he has taken hell for that. I mean the Democrats are all over him. You can't initiate in this country, it seems to me, a meaningful conversation about cutting spending because the left just won't allow it.</p><p>EAKIN: Well, I mean, no one wants to default on the debt, but also no one wants to have a downgrade. And remember, Japan doesn't have a debt limit. Japan just got downgraded. Why? They have too much debt.</p><p>The fundamental problem is the debt. Speaker Boehner is talking about an approach to addressing the real problem which is spending that causes debt. And we have to deal with that, not just the symptom.</p><p>The notion we have clean debt, limit increase and everything is going to be fine is really badly mistaken.</p><p>WILLIS: Well, you know, the president, just this weekend, meeting with world leaders, he said essentially this idea that we need to spend more is fundamentally right, to pull Europe out of recession and of course the threat that the U.S. would go into recession too.</p><p>That seems to be diametrically opposed to what you just said.</p><p>EAKIN: There is this great fear of austerity in the United States. But no one is talking about austerity. We're talking about sensible reforms to the big spending programs that are driving the debt.</p><p>Take social security as an example. If we were to reform social security, all that would happen is that anyone working now would know what the deal was in retirement.</p><p>International investors would know that we could deal with traditional third rail of politics. There would be no cut in immediate spending. There would be no impact on the recovery.</p><p>So fear of austerity is just an excuse to not make reforms we need and which our citizens really deserve.</p><p>WILLIS: You know, big headlines around Catholic institutions now suing the Federal Government over Obamacare and these requirements really that these institutions fund birth control, fund things that they're just fundamentally opposed to.</p><p>I want you to respond to comments from Cardinal Timothy Dolan from right here in New York City. Here is what he had to say.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TIMOTHY CARDINAL DOLAN, ARCHBISHOP OF NEW YORK: What the federal government did, unfortunately, and which got our Irish up is when they said, \"Oh, by the way, we'll define what a church is.\"</p><p>\"We'll tell you what you can and can't do. We'll set the parameters as to how you can minister, to whom you may minister and the motives that should direct your ministry.\"</p><p>That is the character, that is the tone of these straitjacketing exemptions.</p><p>WILLIS: Your response?</p><p>EAKIN: Well, I mean what you're hearing is the cardinal saying Obamacare tramples on religious freedoms that are at the core of what America is built on. It also tramples on economic freedoms, the individual mandate.</p><p>And as you know it tramples on small businesses. This is a reform that really did not serve its intended goal of cutting costs. Costs are going up, not down, and in the process, has trampled all over things which we count on in America.</p><p>WILLIS: Well, you know, it is interesting you bring up small business, because there was just a story today about how small businesses are not signing up for this tax credit.</p><p>They have expected four million small businesses to get the free money. I mean, we're talking about free money here. But in fact, about 170,000 did it. Does that surprise you?</p><p>EAKIN: There's a lot of research that says this credit is not particularly valuable because it penalizes you if you hire more. It penalizes if you pay better.</p><p>It is incredibly complicated and hard to figure out and it is temporary, whereas the burdens that Obamacare imposes are permanent. So the research said, this isn't so good.</p><p>We're now seeing evidence that is exactly right. It is not going to work.</p><p>WILLIS: Well, you know, in just a few short weeks we're going to get answer from the Supreme Court on what they think about the individual mandate and Obamacare, generally.</p><p>There's a lot of talk about what is going to happen, Doug. And I know you spent a lot of time thinking about that. Do you have any fresh insights into what the Supreme Court might do?</p><p>EAKIN: I haven't had a vision of what the vote is. But certainly, I think the likely scenarios are ones in which if there is something overturned, it's just the individual mandate.</p><p>And Supreme Court says, \"Out of abundance of caution, we'll do no more. You Congress, go fix this.\" Or since there is nowhere to stop between that and everything, they overturn everything.</p><p>So there are only three things I'm looking for. If it upholds the law, we go from there, get rid of the individual mandate or throw out the entire law. Most of the other outcomes I don't think are very likely.</p><p>WILLIS: All right. Well, Doug, thanks for coming on tonight. We appreciate your time.</p><p>EAKIN: Thank you.</p><p>WILLIS: Come back soon. All right. If you're fired up about this or any of the issues on the program, drop me an E-mail, <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:gerri@foxbusiness.com\">gerri@foxbusiness.com</email></p><p>ANNOUNCER: Coming up on THE WILLIS REPORT, some people wait until they're financially stable to have kids, but not this Tennessee man who is calling on taxpayers to help them support his 30 children. Can he do this? Gerri gets to the bottom of this outrage.</p><p>And lawmakers are calling to break up big banks in the wake of the J.P. Morgan multibillion-dollar trading fiasco, but is there another solution to this? We'll ask our expert. We're on the case, next on THE WILLIS REPORT.</p><p>WILLIS: Fresh details in the MF Global debacle. In the year leading up to the company's collapse, CEO Jon Corzine raked in the $8 million in compensation.</p><p>Keep in mind we've got some $1.6 billion still missing. Now, granted $5 million of his compensation came in the form of stock options, which are now worthless, but $3 million came in straight up cash.</p><p>While $1.6 billion, as I said, in customer money is still gone with the wind.</p><p>Time to bring out our panel. Katie Pavlich is the news editor for TownHall.com in D.C. Marjorie Clifton is founder of SpikeTheWatercooler.com, also in D.C. And Al Lewis, columnist for \"Dow Jones Newswires\" in Denver. Katie, start with you.</p><p>KATIE PAVLICH, NEWS EDITOR, TOWNHALL.COM: Look, when is President Obama and Vice President Joe Biden going to come out and denounce Jon Corzine?</p><p>I mean, he did help craft the failed stimulus package after all. And I think they should reassure us that they're not going to go and get advice from people like Jon Corzine who are willing to cut and run and then cost their investors millions of dollars, billions of dollars, and then cost the taxpayers at least $1 trillion in addition, too.</p><p>WILLIS: Crazy. Al, do you agree?</p><p>AL LEWIS, COLUMNIST, \"DOW JONES NEWS WIRES\": I second what she said. And you know what? I want to add that every time one of these big banks blow up, what we do is we look back and we see how much the CEO got paid and it's a lot.</p><p>And shat this shows is that CEO's get paid to take enormous risks with other people's money. And if it doesn't work out, oh, well.</p><p>WILLIS: Oh, well. Yes, definitely, sometimes there is a disconnect between performance and pay. Marjorie, what do you say?</p><p>MARJORIE CLIFTON, FOUNDER, SPIKETHEWATERCOOLER.COM: Well, it is part of the Wall Street culture. And right now, unfortunately, there is no retribution for anyone who unwisely spends investors' money.</p><p>So unless there is an overall change in Wall Street and how we - and obviously, we don't regulate Wall Street - it's going to continue to happen.</p><p>WILLIS: All right. Here's one of my favorite stories tonight. Former presidential candidate, Newt Gingrich, is having cash problems. Gingrich dropped out of the race nearly five million in debt and his own business is now going bankrupt. And yet, on the campaign trail, Gingrich said he knew exactly how to manage money.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NEWT GINGRICH, (R) FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I am for capitalism. I am for honest entrepreneurs investing. I'm for people creating businesses. Callista and I have created four small businesses in the last decade. I get it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILLIS: Marjorie, does Gingrich really get it when it comes to money?</p><p>CLIFTON: Well, Gingrich doesn't get it when it comes to campaigns, because most politicians who don't end up cutting it are able to actually profit and make money when they come out of the election season. But what was unique about Gingrich is that he really was ego driven.</p><p>I mean, you saw with Santorum, he stood for ideals. Gingrich stood for ego. And people saw right through it. So, I think he needs to take a lesson from Sarah Palin on how to capitalize on your image and rebrand himself.</p><p>WILLIS: I think he needs more than capitalizing in his image. Katie, what do you say?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>KATIE PAVLICH, TOWNHALL.COM NEWS EDITOR: I say (ph) that truth is looks like he is in a lot of trouble here. And I think he's probably bouncing off of what Marjorie just said. He's probably reassessing why he stayed in the GOP primary race so long and whether he should have run for president, in the first place.</p><p>WILLIS: You're probably right. Al, what do you say?</p><p>AL LEWIS, \"DOW JONES NEWSWIRES\" COLUMNIST: Oh, I just love the words bankrupt fiscal conservative in the same headline. You know, I think the Republicans made the right choice. The question is, what took them so long? I mean, this is a guy who says he doesn't like Fannie and Freddie and he takes money from Fannie and Freddie.</p><p>WILLIS: Yes.</p><p>LEWIS: He complains about adultery. Why he commits adultery? Now, we see all his money problems while he is trying to straighten out the money problems of America. How does this guy have any credibility left? Why are we even talking about him?</p><p>WILLIS: And send your e-mails to AlLewis.com.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>WILLIS: All right. Here's a man bite dog, bites man, bites newspaper story. There's a new reason to be aware of dog bites. Guess what? They're driving up insurance rates. In fact, dog bites account for more than a third of homeowners insurance liability claims in 2011, costing hundreds of millions of dollars. Al, I would never have guessed this.</p><p>LEWIS: Well, first I want to say that e-mail is <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:Al.Lewis@DowJones.com\">Al.Lewis@DowJones.com</email></p><p>WILLIS: Oh, you're going to --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WILLIS: Oh, my goodness. I wish I was saving you.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>LEWIS: And the second thing is buy a cat, OK? Get a cat.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>LEWIS: That's basically all I got to say about this story.</p><p>WILLIS: Marjorie.</p><p>CLIFTON: Well, it was actually $479 million went out last year which is just a shocking number. And I do agree. Either, I would go with the cat, a gerbil, a poodle, maybe one of those small little dogs. But yes, in general, this does not farewell for dog owners.</p><p>WILLIS: Katie, how about nice dogs, nice dogs?</p><p>PAVLICH: Yes, you know, some of the most vicious dogs I've ever met are the little ones. I don't say a get a little dog. I'd say --</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CLIFTON: Little dog syndrome.</p><p>PAVLICH: Get a breed that is nice. And hello, homeowners, keep your dog away from your visitors. Keep them on a leash. Keep them away from kids and people visiting and people on the street. Keep your kids away from front yards and dogs that you're not familiar with. It's basic common sense.</p><p>WILLIS: My favorite pick is the lab. I want a lab.</p><p>PAVLICH: Yes, exactly.</p><p>WILLIS: The private space industry taking off for the first time in history. SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket, doesn't that sound cool? It took flight this morning delivering 1,000 pounds of cargo to the International Space Station. Al, what do you say?</p><p>LEWIS: Well, we're a far cry away from private space. This is highly subsidized by NASA, but it's good to see. This is a small step for mankind, I think, but nonetheless, a good one.</p><p>WILLIS: Marjorie, I want us to have NASA. I want the country to be involved in this. This whole idea that we just leave it to entrepreneurs, not very satisfying for me. What do you say?</p><p>CLIFTON: Well, NASA was excited because it actually privatizing space is a more lucrative prospect given our government spending right now. We don't have the funds for it. I want to know if office space is cheaper on the moon because gas prices are pretty high, and I'm wondering, how can we figure this out, because something is not working with the economy here in the United States.</p><p>WILLIS: Katie, can we not afford it? Is that the reason we're not doing it?</p><p>PAVLICH: Well, unfortunately, because the government has spent out of control, we can't afford it. And I am with you. I think that space exploration is actually crucial to our national and international security.</p><p>But on the brighter note, I like idea that the founder of this company that sent this private jet into space invested millions of his own dollars into this project which just proves that the top one percent are doing amazing things for the country.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>WILLIS: Yes. It's not all taking your money. All right. Katie, Marjorie, and Al, thanks for coming on tonight. You guys were great as always.</p><p>LEWIS: Thank you.</p><p>WILLIS: Excellent job. Appreciate your time. Thank you.</p><p>PAVLICH: Thanks.</p><p>CLIFTON: Thank you.</p><p>WILLIS: And we'll be right back.</p><p>WILLIS: The media is dubbing him, \"Octodad.\" Desmond Hatchet is a 33-year-old Knoxville, Tennessee resident. He's the father of not eight, though, not 12, but 30 kids, with 11 different mothers. Only making minimum wage, he's struggling to keep up with child support payments and is asking taxpayers to lend him a hand.</p><p>Here to weigh in, Kelly Saindon, a family law attorney. Kelly, I can't get over this story. What do you make of this?</p><p>KELLY SAINDON, FAMILY LAW ATTORNEY: It's outrageous. I mean, it's very socially irresponsible. It's terrible for the children. Taxpayers are very upset. And what is wrong with these women that the second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eight, ninth, 10th, 11th, didn't say no?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>WILLIS: Well, -- I mean, I just can't get my mind wrapped around this. OK. So, the dad here, Desmond Hatchet, has a minimum wage job which means that some of the moms are getting as little as $1.49 a month. So, ultimately, the state would not be on the hook for a lot of dough, but should the state pay? Should government pay for this?</p><p>SAINDON: Well, let's back up really quickly, and I'm sorry to sort of derail that a little bit, but the government is on the hook, because you have to assume that if dad can only pay 1.49, then there's likely welfare involved.</p><p>WILLIS: True.</p><p>SAINDON: There's medical insurance involved. There's doctors that's involved. There's free lunches involved. And so, the $1.49 a month for some of these women is laughable. And so, in tells of him asking for help, he's saying hey, give me a break, I make 7.25 an hour, and 50 percent of his gross income goes to child support based on the laws there.</p><p>That's the maximum allowed. But the reality is this is a burden, and lots of people in Tennessee are outraged by this.</p><p>WILLIS: And, isn't the solution simple here? Stop having children.</p><p>SAINDON: Well, you would think so, and this guy was in some interviews in 2009, and at that point in time, he had 21 children. And they said, are you going to keep having kids? He said, no, I'm done. Three-years later, nine children later.</p><p>WILLIS: Wow.</p><p>SAINDON: What scares me is he's only 33. I mean, he could arguably procreate for another 40 years.</p><p>WILLIS: Yes. When I heard he was 33, that's what really turned me around on this. OK. Everybody is listening to the story, talking to the story. It's gone viral. Do you think people feel like you do? I mean, that it's an outrage, and that we should definitely not be subsidizing this kind of behavior?</p><p>SAINDON: You know, I posted it on Twitter and Facebook and everyone said, this guy is crazy. The women are crazy. What is he thinking with? Force him to get another job. They're saying, suggesting should castration become legal. Can we punish him for having more children? The answer is no. It's not legal, and you can't force him to stop having babies.</p><p>But lots of people are angry saying, why are my tax dollars subsidizing his irresponsible lifestyle?</p><p>WILLIS: Well, Kelly, what do you do about this? I mean, as a practical matter, what can the state do? Because if there's one Desmond, there's probably 20 Desmonds, there's 50 Desmonds, maybe different scales, fewer kids, more kids, who knows. But what can the state of Tennessee really do here?</p><p>SAINDON: You know, I arguably come to education. And, while some people may disagree with this, accessible birth control, because some guy making $7 an hour who's now giving $3.50 of that to his multiple children isn't going to spend his money on appropriate safe sex. So, that's a possible solution.</p><p>The reality of the situation is, I don't think there's an answer, unless, a judge forces him to get another job to support his children, because if that possibility, maybe he won't have as much free time to procreate.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>WILLIS: Well, I got to tell you, I think birth control is everywhere and easy to get. I doubt it's about the money. Kelly, thanks for coming on today. Really appreciate your time. Interesting conversation, thanks.</p><p>SAINDON: Thanks for having me.</p><p>WILLIS: Great. All right.</p><p>Well, now, we want to know what you think about this story. Should the Tennessee father of 30, 30 kids, get government help paying for child support? We took to the streets of New York asking people from all over the country what they thought. Here's what they said.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He has that many kids? He should pay for all those kids. Shouldn't be the -- shouldn't be the government. Shouldn't be us.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I think that's pretty sad commentary, 33 children and --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Thirty children, 33 years old.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Thirty-three years old. Where's the accountability? You know? That's really irresponsibile.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Promiscuous enough to do that with that many chicks, --</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's his mistake, and they're alive. So, you got to like be a man. Take your responsibility and live with that.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We deal in California with octomom. So, it's not OK. It's not OK. we worked hard all our life, you know, to have what we have, and when we have to pay extra, when we see this kind of stuff going on, it's just not OK.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He enjoyed making them so he should pay for them. You know? It's quite obvious that he enjoyed it, right?</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>WILLIS: I love that. It's not OK. We worked hard all our lives. Don't want to pay for this. Agree with you.</p><p>Here's what some of you are saying on my Facebook page. David writes this, \"No. There are too many people that do just that now, have kids just for the government support.\"</p><p>And Beverly agrees. She says, \"Talk about wanting a free ride? I feel sorry for the kids.\"</p><p>Laura says, \"Give him a government job, make him earn the money, then garnish his wages to pay the child support. Otherwise, the taxpayers foot the entire bill.\"</p><p>And finally, Gary says this, \"The only government help he should get is a free vasectomy.\"</p><p>Here's your chance to weigh in on our question tonight, log on to GerriWillis.com, vote on the right-hand side of the screen. I'll share the results at the end of tonight's show. And, in addition to liking me on Facebook, don't forget to follow me on Twitter. We love to hear what you have to say.</p><p>All right. Is breaking up the banks the only way to prevent another JPMorgan mess? Details after the break.</p><p>And coming up in just a few minutes, Neil Cavuto will be joined by former Minnesota governor, Tim Pawlenty. Don't go away.</p><p>WILLIS: Federal regulators aren't giving up insisting more must be done in the wake of the huge trading loss at JPMorgan, but there may be a better option. Find out next.</p><p>WILLIS: In focus tonight, JPMorgan's multibillion-dollar trading loss. New reports claiming those losses may have exceeded $7 billion. That's much higher than previous estimates of more than 2 billion. So, is more regulation the answer? James Grant is publisher for Grant's Interest Rate Observer. Jim, welcome to the show.</p><p>JAMES GRANT, GRANT'S INTEREST RATE OBSERVER PUBLISHER: No, it's not.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>WILLIS: I'm sorry?</p><p>GRANT: It's not the answer.</p><p>WILLIS: It's not the answer.</p><p>GRANT: No.</p><p>WILLIS: Why not? I mean, look at this. This is a lot of money. It brings back all the memories of what happened in 2007 and 2008.</p><p>GRANT: It does.</p><p>WILLIS: Doesn't this make you worry that we could be in for another round of banks blowing up?</p><p>GRANT: One memory it brings back is the utter inability of the regulators in 2006 and 2007 to spot the most obvious and crying shame of an excuse for bank underwriting in modern American financial history. They saw nothing. And we are now to believe that the answer to the difficulties --</p><p>WILLIS: They had more of that.</p><p>GRANT: Right. So, you know, banking is hard-line of work. They start with a relatively small equity capital. They pile assets and liabilities. And, it takes a lot of judgment and it takes a certain -- a great amount of skill. And, it's not clear that the government has that skill. Bankers may not be very good at it, but the government is not --</p><p>WILLIS: Even worse, because they sure didn't see the last blowup coming. Gary Gensler, who runs the CFTC, big regulator, Commodities Future Trading Commission, had this to say about how he found out about what was going on at JPMorgan.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GARY GENSLER, CFTC CHAIRMAN: I would say that the trades that came to, I think, many of our attention personal attention with press reports.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Press reports?</p><p>GENSLER: But our staff was aware of trades that are in the clearinghouses, because they monitor the clearinghouses daily.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILLIS: It goes right to your point that these regulators don't know what's going on.</p><p>GRANT: The regulators are all -- over this bank -- they're quartered in the banks. Bank of any size has a permanent staff of regulators on the premises like the marine detachments at American embassies. The federal government is present constantly.</p><p>What the regulators had to know because it was in JPMorgan's own SEC filing was that there was no claim by the bank that these transactions were hedged transactions. You have to do -- in order to have a hedged transaction, you have to file extensive documents and you have to show that the transaction in which you were meant to hedge a position could hedge it.</p><p>And it wasn't merely a bet (ph). None of that took place in Morgan. So, the regulators had to know what was going on knowing they did nothing. And now, we are meant to believe that the answer is still more regulation. The answer is the personal accountability of the bankers in question. The answer is --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WILLIS: Jim, Jim, how do you make that happen? Because at the end of the day, these guys do not have a fall from grace. They just go to another bank. They don't even typically have to earn less.</p><p>GRANT: I'm going to tell you a story about capitalism. Way back when up until 1935 from the dawn of American modern banking system until 1935, if a bank got into trouble, it became impaired with respect to capital or became insolvent. The stockholders of that bank got a capital call. The taxpayers did not get a capital call, because --</p><p>WILLIS: That was the right way to do it.</p><p>GRANT: It was the stockholders bank and not the taxpayers. It would be easy today to institute a first approximation of this very healthy regime. One could, for example, claw back the income of any of our big- earring bankers above a certain decent minimum if the bank in which they have been working and have not been performing well gets into trouble.</p><p>There are all sorts of possibilities for reinstituting personal accountability in banking without subjecting it to the --</p><p>WILLIS: Wow! I can not -- I can't imagine how that would go over.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WILLIS: -- you're going to claw back -- I mean, just interesting. As a practical matter, do you think that could ever become a reality?</p><p>GRANT: Doesn't it sound good, though? I mean, it sounds that has a nice bipartisan appeal. Anyone who makes, for example, more than 10 times the manufacturing wage would be susceptible to claw back for seven years after he or she departs his or her --</p><p>WILLIS: Would anybody go to work in a bank if you did that?</p><p>GRANT: Sure, because people going to work into banks don't believe that they're going to run into trouble. And furthermore, susceptible to that kind of penalty, they would, perhaps, bear down a little bit harder with regard to risk management. It seems to me that the way forward is not with more government. The way forward is with more capitalism.</p><p>WILLIS: There's even been talk of Glass-Steagall, bringing Glass- Steagall back. And I'm not even sure that would have an impact on what happened here with JPMorgan, would it?</p><p>GRANT: I don't think so.</p><p>WILLIS: Yes.</p><p>GRANT: I think what is wanted again is the accountability of people who make decisions. What is not wanted is still more asphyxiating regulation as it is now. If you are a bank examiner, you have to worry about the following things. You have to worry about the card act. You have to worry about regulation E, the community reinvestment act. You have to worry about U.S. patriot act.</p><p>There are half a dozen or more major preoccupations of these regulators without any attention paid to the quality of the assets of the institutions they are regulating. And the answer supposedly to difficulties at JPMorgan and others is to give them still more to do, more regulations, more recondite rules that we will draft later, right?</p><p>WILLIS: All right. Fascinating. Fascinating stuff. Interesting. We'll have to put your idea to a few people and see how they react to it.</p><p>GRANT: Well, good.</p><p>WILLIS: Jim Grant, Grant's Interest Rate Observer, thanks for coming on tonight. We appreciate it.</p><p>All right. We'll be right back with my \"Two Cents More\" and the answer to our question of the day, should a Tennessee father of 30 get government help paying his child support? Coming up next.</p><p>WILLIS: A Tennessee man says he has problems paying child support. Why? Because he says he makes minimum wage and has 30 children. Now, Desmond Hatchett is pleading with the state to help him pay. So, we asked on GerriWillis.com, should the Tennessee father of 30 get government help to pay his child support.</p><p>No big surprise here. Ninety-seven percent of you say no way. Log on to GerriWillis.com for our online question every weekday.</p><p>All right. It may not feel like it for a lot of drivers out there, but traffic congestion dropped 30 percent last year across the country. Now, all that's good news. The bad news is the drop is because of higher gas prices and unemployment.</p><p>And tonight's top five, the city is seeing the biggest decreases in gridlock. Number five, Provo, Utah, number four, Sacramento -- Sacramento, that is, California. That's one positive for the Golden State. Number three, Honolulu, Hawaii. Number two, Akron, Ohio.</p><p>And the number one city where traffic congestion has decreased, Minneapolis, Minnesota, with stimulus funds drying road construction plummeted in 2011 making traffic less of an issue. Tampa, Jacksonville, Florida have the biggest increases in traffic from 2010 to 2011. You probably already know that if you're living it.</p><p>All right. Here are some of your e-mails. Cathy writes this, \"The next time VP Biden or anybody else talks about the mess inherited by Obama, he or they should be reminded that in the last two years of the Bush administration, both Houses of Congress were controlled by Democrats.\"</p><p>And finally, here's Lynn from Texas, \"Gerri, you were spot on with my opinions. Why don't you run for president? Oh, I forget. You're too sensible.\" Lynn, thank you for that.</p><p>Appreciate your comment. We love to hear from you and send me an e- mail to <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:Gerri@FoxBusiness.com\">Gerri@FoxBusiness.com</email></p><p>And finally, tonight, listen, airlines are officially out of control. Fees for bags, fees for boarding, fees to change tickets, and even fees if you want to schlep your own stuff. This summer, they're going to force all of us to cough up another fee. It's going to cost extra for friends and family to sit together.</p><p>So, if you're flying in the coming months, get ready to pay more for buying the seat next to you. In they're never ending quest to squeeze every possibly penny out of the American public airlines are now charging extra seats for windows and aisle seats. About 50 bucks each per trip. Now, the airlines (INAUDIBLE) to constantly trying to improve customer service.</p><p>Well, I've got a special announcement for them, forcing folks to fly solo on family vacations, it's not the way to do it.

And father of 30 asking taxpayers to bail him out.   Hello, everybody, I'm Gerri Willis.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">You know, I've gotten a lot of flak over the years for warning small  investors of the perils of putting their hard-earned money into red-hot  initial public offerings.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I warned here Friday about Facebook and it has become a prime example of  what I'm talking about.  My savvy viewers already know that Wall Street  bait and switch. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We're now learning while banks were selling Facebook stock to the public,  they were quietly cutting their own outlook for the company.  Can you  believe that?  </p><p>It's the same thing happened during the housing bust.  Bankers were selling  mortgages to investors, mortgages they knew were worthless.  </p><p>Today, NASDAQ and brokerages pointing fingers at each other over the whole  Facebook flop.  Regulators say that small investors should have confidence  in the market.  </p><p>You've got to be kidding.  Those same regulators started investigations  into what went wrong with the most hyped IPO in history.  </p><p>This is exactly the reason that many feel there is an uneven playing field  when it comes to investing.  Stock message boards were lit up with Facebook  comments today.  \"Biggest IPO fraud ever,\" said one.  The biggest sting of  all time.  </p><p>One person saying simply, \"The worst investment decision I have ever made.\"   Unfortunately, that is the story for some small investors.  They learn the  hard way, and it shouldn't be that way.  That's my two cents and this is  THE WILLIS REPORT. </p><p>(MUSIC) </p><p>The market still not liking Facebook, shares dropping eight percent today.   And reportedly, one investor is suing NASDAQ over its handling of the debut  and seeking class-action status.  </p><p>So should investors feel zuckered - or maybe \"suckered\" is the better word  - over the Facebook hype?  </p><p>To Gary Kaltbaum, president of Kaltbaum management.  Gary, let's start with  this lawsuit.  Not a big surprise?  I've been expecting it.  You probably  have been, too.  Can they be successful?  </p><p>GARY KALTBAUM, PRESIDENT, KALTBAUM MANAGEMENT:  Let's just say there's  going to be a lot more of these lawsuits to come, and they're going to go  after everybody.  </p><p>Whenever you see a company blow up on earnings, the lawyers who like these  class actions are looking into the market and finding these things.  So  you're going to see it.  It's going to go after the underwriters.  </p><p>It's probably going to be Facebook also.  It's already on the NASDAQ and  the free-for-all starts.  </p><p>WILLIS:  Well, the free-for-all starts.  But look, individual investors  feel like the biggest losers here.  </p><p>KALTBAUM:  Yes.  </p><p>WILLIS:  Let's just be honest.  And frankly, they were, because the  investors, the original investors and the founders - they're the ones who  made out.  </p><p>You know, individual investors aren't doing well here.  This stock is  trading lower than its offer price.  </p><p>KALTBAUM:  A lot lower.  And some people actually paid higher than the  offering price.  Look, the bottom line here is, the bankers overreached,  overhyped.  </p><p>The price was an absolute joke.  I've been yelling and screaming about this  price, $100 billion market cap with less than $4 billion in revenues.  </p><p>And by the way, their earnings have been decelerating over the last three  quarters.  Now, I didn't know where the stock would open.  When I saw it  open in the 40s, I knew something was up.  And you see what is happening  here.  </p><p>And frankly, I think at even these levels that it is too expensive.  And I  think there will be more pain to come especially since there is so much  negativity on the deal at this point.  </p><p>WILLIS:  So the valuation, at the time it went public, four times Google's  valuation based on earnings.  Now, today, this was supposed to be the  biggest tech IPO of all time.  Its market cap now, $84.84 billion, down  from $104 billion.  </p><p>What is going on here?  And you know, what we had heard is that the major  underwriters of this stock, their analysts had come out while they were  doing the road show saying, look, this - you know, reduce your expectations  particularly for revenue here.  What do you make of that?  </p><p>KALTBAUM:  I think the bankers were simply greedy.  That is what this came  out to.  The more fees - they get more fees because of higher price and  more shares and they didn't listen to sound advice.  </p><p>They put their own wallets first, the investors second.  And guess what  happens now?  All those fees are going to be bye-bye.  The credibility is  shot, and they're going to lose a lot of money just defending the lawsuits  going forward.  </p><p>So it is a lose-lose for these guys.  And you would think they would learn  a lesson.  I still remember back in '99.  They did the same thing, but it  was actually worse back then.  </p><p>They brought companies public in the Internet space that had no revenues  and brought them out with billion-dollar market caps.  But then, investors  would bid them up to $2 billion and $3 billion.  </p><p>WILLIS:  Not anymore.  </p><p>KALTBAUM:  And I think they were trying to get the same - yes, exactly.  I  think they were trying to get the same thing done here and it bit back on  them.  </p><p>WILLIS:  Bit back on them.  But you know, look, we're sort of in a delicate  time here for individual investors.  </p><p>KALTBAUM:  Yes.  </p><p>WILLIS:  You know, we had our hopes dashed for many years on returns in the  stock market broadly.  And just seeing this through the hype around this  IPO for Facebook reminded people of the big tech boom, the big tech bubble.  </p><p>What do you think individual investors, what is the lesson they're going to  take away from this?  </p><p>KALTBAUM:  Well, they'd better take the lesson of the more noise, the more  you better investigate.  When Wall Street is very noisy on something,  you've got to look at fine print and you've got to look at numbers.  </p><p>And this one was easy.  You can look at amazon, which has 13 times the  sales of this company and less the valuation, yet they don't care.  They  still bring it out at this price.  </p><p>If the individual investor did a little bit of work here, they would have  looked at number and said, \"No way, I'm going to take a pass regardless  what happens.\"  </p><p>But what happened was everybody thought this thing was going to open, $60,  $70.  I heard some people talking $80 and $90, and everybody figured OK.  </p><p>And of course, the big letdown came when it opened in the $40s.  And now,  we're seeing it at $31 and probably lower prices to come.  </p><p>WILLIS:  All right.  Hey, Gary - </p><p>KALTBAUM:  Yes.</p><p>WILLIS:  We've got some breaking news here that I want you to respond to on  Facebook.  The State of Massachusetts is investigating Morgan Stanley over  its handling of Facebook and specifically the thing I mentioned earlier,  this issuance of analyst guidance on the stock itself.  </p><p>There are subpoenas apparently is what I'm hearing.  Details are just  beginning to emerge just this moment.  What do you make of that?  It seems  like a pile on to me, buddy.  </p><p>KALTBAUM:  Well, you're going to see individual investors go to the state  security's regulators.  And states are going to go after them and  investigate.  </p><p>I don't know the exact timing of the Morgan Stanley analyst, and I know  exactly what he did.  They talked about the mobile apps, that more people  are on mobile than on the regular computers and that is going to hurt them,  and also as far as numbers being a little bit on the soft side.  </p><p>So if the timing was bad, Morgan Stanley and especially the analysts, the  way they did it, could be in some trouble.  I'm not so sure of that.  </p><p>But you can expect everybody to get involved.  This was a big deal.  It was  all over the news.  It was all over the place.  And just remember, there  are 900 million people on Facebook.  </p><p>And when you are front and center, I can promise you the regulators want to  make sure they cover their side of it.  And that's where you're going to  see a lot of this going on in the weeks to come, especially if the stock  keeps getting hit.  </p><p>WILLIS:  All right.  Gary, we'll come back when they do.  We want to talk  to you some more.  Thanks for being with us today.  Really appreciate it.  </p><p>KALTBAUM:  Thanks for having me.  </p><p>WILLIS:  All right.  Just to repeat here because this is just coming out  moments ago, the State of Massachusetts investigating Morgan Stanley over  Facebook and specifically some of the analyst guidance they had out about  that stock.  </p><p>Apparently, subpoenas have been issued.  We'll be following that.  If we  get more details in the hour, we'll let you know.  </p><p>In the meantime, coming up, why a small business tax credit is going  virtually unused.  </p><p>And next, as Facebook stock continues its downward spiral, what should  small investor be doing?  I will break it down, next. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>WILLIS:  The nation's lead securities regulator, Mary Schapiro, had a  message for small investors stung by the Facebook IPO.  </p><p>In spite of the problems with the social network's public stock launch, you  should be confident in the markets.  But it is too late.  They've already  lost confidence.  </p><p>The IPO that was supposed to take the market by storm and reignite small  investor interest in stocks - well, it did just the opposite.  </p><p>Small investors are complaining.  They were prevented from confirming  trades or trade cancellations.  Orders to buy and sell that normally take  two seconds took two hours and even longer.  </p><p>People who bought are angry.  Those who didn't are shrugging their soldiers  and saying, \"I told you so.\"  One investor commented to the \"Wall Street  Journal,\" \"I was stuck for six hours trying to confirm whether I owned this  dog or not.\"  </p><p>What is going on behind the scenes according to reports that NASDAQ system  took an extra two milliseconds to calculate Facebook shares' opening price.   In the meantime, the system was trying to process orders.  </p><p>And that resulted in NASDAQ having to manually override the system, an  override which took 20 minutes.  One simple glitch in the middle of a  massive public stock offering gets magnified.  </p><p>There is no room for error.  Now, that is the official explanation.  But we  talked to those in the marketplace.  And what is going on is a lot of  finger-pointing.  </p><p>NASDAQ says they fixed the problem that caused the delay and that it won't  happen again.  As for the order confirmations that are still pending, all  NASDAQ will say is that after clearing up the unintended consequences of  their pricing system, they cleared their backlog of outstanding orders and  cancellations at 1:50 p.m. Friday afternoon.  </p><p>Now, the implication - look, any delays people have had since then must be  at the broker-dealer end.  Online brokers though, for their part, say the  fault was with NASDAQ and market makers.  </p><p>Scottrade, for example, says NASDAQ issues caused their customer orders to  be delayed, which in turn caused some of those investors to try to change  or modify their order.</p><p>And that put in place a cascade of errors.  Scottrade told THE WILLIS  REPORT that the company had staffed up to deal with questions even before  problems arose across its 505 branch offices, its national service center  and even on Facebook and Twitter.</p><p>When it was clear big problems had occurred, the company kept its trading  services team working throughout the weekend to manually process several  thousand transactions.  </p><p>Can you imagine?  Now, some of these brokerages managed to turn the trouble  to their advantage.  Scottrade opened 431 percent more new accounts Friday  than a typical day, and today's trading volumes were up 70 percent versus  monthly average.  </p><p>Fidelity spoke to us as well saying, quote, \"Fidelity continues to deal  with the aftermath of Friday's market issues and delayed processing of  orders for Facebook.\"  </p><p>\"As they did Friday and yesterday, Fidelity systems continued to operate  normally.  Unfortunately, our clients continue to feel the effects of these  issues in some cases, and we're working aggressive to address them.\"  </p><p>E-trade declined to comment to us.  So far, at least one investor has  already filed a lawsuit against NASDAQ alleging negligence.  </p><p>If you've been impacted, the right thing to do is contact your broker  pronto, even an online broker.  Register what they call a dispute.  </p><p>You don't even need to have details of your trade on hand because the  brokerage will have it in their computer system.  Any reimbursement will  come from the brokerage.  But ultimately, NASDAQ will be on the hook.  </p><p>Frankly, I hate to see this kind of trouble for small investors.  We need a  system in place that treats everybody fairly, not just the deep pocketed  investors looking to cash out of their investments.  </p><p>The market needs small investors and small investors need an even playing  field in the stock market in order to fulfill their own financial goals,  fix the problem, do it fast.  </p><p>Look, ultimately, it is in everybody's interest for the markets to work  efficiently, openly and fairly.  </p><p>Coming up, it's a story you have to hear to believe - a father of 30  asking the government to pay his bills.  </p><p>And next, more evidence as if we needed it, on how Obamacare is crushing  small business and how it's only going to get worse.  Former CBO director  Doug Holtz-Eakin gives us his take, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>WILLIS:  Many Catholic organizations not waiting for the Supreme Court to  decide the fate of Obamacare.  They're suing now.  Douglas Holtz-Eakin  gives us his take in 60 seconds.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>WILLIS:  A new report out this afternoon showing the country will go over a  fiscal cliff if Congress doesn't act.  </p><p>Joining me now, Douglas Holtz-Eakin, former director of the CBO, now the  president of the American Action Forum.  Doug, welcome to the show again.  </p><p>DOUGLAS HOLTZ-EAKIN, PRESIDENT, AMERICAN ACTION FORUM:  Thanks, Gerri.  </p><p>WILLIS:  And your old organization, the CBO, out with a study - I've got to  get you to comment on this - just this afternoon saying that allowing the  Bush-era tax cuts to expire and a scheduled round of automatic spending  cuts will send this economy spiraling into a recession.  Do you agree and  how big is the threat to the economy?  </p><p>EAKIN:  Well, I think this is a very real threat, Gerri.  Imagine investors  who have a dividend tax rate 15 percent now, facing potential dividend tax  rate of 44 percent come January 1st.  </p><p>It's not going to take until January for the implications to start showing  up.  Investors are going to start getting nervous this fall.  </p><p>I think markets are going to react.  We're going to see some severe  economic impact.  So it is time to address the real problems that face the  United States, the overspending, the uncertainty about the tax code.  </p><p>Put in place something investors can count on.  And it is a reminder our  problems are not because we have debt limits and things like that.  The  problems are, we have problems.  </p><p>WILLIS:  we have problems and our main problem is spending too much money  and money we don't have.  </p><p>EAKIN:  Absolutely.  Absolutely. </p><p>WILLIS:  You know, I want to talk to you about John Boehner because the  Speaker of the House has been out talking about, how, OK, OK, we'll come to  agreement on lifting the debt ceiling.</p><p>But if you do that, let's have commensurate cuts.  And he has taken hell  for that.  I mean the Democrats are all over him.  You can't initiate in  this country, it seems to me, a meaningful conversation about cutting  spending because the left just won't allow it.  </p><p>EAKIN:  Well, I mean, no one wants to default on the debt, but also no one  wants to have a downgrade.  And remember, Japan doesn't have a debt limit.   Japan just got downgraded.  Why?  They have too much debt.</p><p>The fundamental problem is the debt.  Speaker Boehner is talking about an  approach to addressing the real problem which is spending that causes debt.   And we have to deal with that, not just the symptom.  </p><p>The notion we have clean debt, limit increase and everything is going to be  fine is really badly mistaken.  </p><p>WILLIS:  Well, you know, the president, just this weekend, meeting with  world leaders, he said essentially this idea that we need to spend more is  fundamentally right, to pull Europe out of recession and of course the  threat that the U.S. would go into recession too.  </p><p>That seems to be diametrically opposed to what you just said.  </p><p>EAKIN:  There is this great fear of austerity in the United States.  But no  one is talking about austerity.  We're talking about sensible reforms to  the big spending programs that are driving the debt.  </p><p>Take social security as an example.  If we were to reform social security,  all that would happen is that anyone working now would know what the deal  was in retirement.  </p><p>International investors would know that we could deal with traditional  third rail of politics.  There would be no cut in immediate spending.   There would be no impact on the recovery.  </p><p>So fear of austerity is just an excuse to not make reforms we need and  which our citizens really deserve.  </p><p>WILLIS:  You know, big headlines around Catholic institutions now suing the  Federal Government over Obamacare and these requirements really that these  institutions fund birth control, fund things that they're just  fundamentally opposed to.  </p><p>I want you to respond to comments from Cardinal Timothy Dolan from right  here in New York City.  Here is what he had to say.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>TIMOTHY CARDINAL DOLAN, ARCHBISHOP OF NEW YORK:  What the federal  government did, unfortunately, and which got our Irish up is when they  said, \"Oh, by the way, we'll define what a church is.\"  </p><p>\"We'll tell you what you can and can't do.  We'll set the parameters as to  how you can minister, to whom you may minister and the motives that should  direct your ministry.\"  </p><p>That is the character, that is the tone of these straitjacketing  exemptions.  </p><p>WILLIS:  Your response?  </p><p>EAKIN:  Well, I mean what you're hearing is the cardinal saying Obamacare  tramples on religious freedoms that are at the core of what America is  built on.  It also tramples on economic freedoms, the individual mandate.  </p><p>And as you know it tramples on small businesses.  This is a reform that  really did not serve its intended goal of cutting costs.  Costs are going  up, not down, and in the process, has trampled all over things which we  count on in America.  </p><p>WILLIS:  Well, you know, it is interesting you bring up small business,  because there was just a story today about how small businesses are not  signing up for this tax credit.  </p><p>They have expected four million small businesses to get the free money.  I  mean, we're talking about free money here.  But in fact, about 170,000 did  it.  Does that surprise you?  </p><p>EAKIN:  There's a lot of research that says this credit is not particularly  valuable because it penalizes you if you hire more.  It penalizes if you  pay better.  </p><p>It is incredibly complicated and hard to figure out and it is temporary,  whereas the burdens that Obamacare imposes are permanent.  So the research  said, this isn't so good.  </p><p>We're now seeing evidence that is exactly right.  It is not going to work.  </p><p>WILLIS:  Well, you know, in just a few short weeks we're going to get  answer from the Supreme Court on what they think about the individual  mandate and Obamacare, generally.  </p><p>There's a lot of talk about what is going to happen, Doug.  And I know you  spent a lot of time thinking about that.  Do you have any fresh insights  into what the Supreme Court might do?  </p><p>EAKIN:  I haven't had a vision of what the vote is.  But certainly, I think  the likely scenarios are ones in which if there is something overturned,  it's just the individual mandate.</p><p>And Supreme Court says, \"Out of abundance of caution, we'll do no more.   You Congress, go fix this.\"  Or since there is nowhere to stop between that  and everything, they overturn everything.  </p><p>So there are only three things I'm looking for.  If it upholds the law, we  go from there, get rid of the individual mandate or throw out the entire  law.  Most of the other outcomes I don't think are very likely.  </p><p>WILLIS:  All right.  Well, Doug, thanks for coming on tonight.  We  appreciate your time.  </p><p>EAKIN:  Thank you.  </p><p>WILLIS:  Come back soon.  All right.  If you're fired up about this or any  of the issues on the program, drop me an E-mail, <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:gerri@foxbusiness.com\">gerri@foxbusiness.com</email></p><p>ANNOUNCER:  Coming up on THE WILLIS REPORT, some people wait until they're  financially stable to have kids, but not this Tennessee man who is calling  on taxpayers to help them support his 30 children.  Can he do this?  Gerri  gets to the bottom of this outrage.  </p><p>And lawmakers are calling to break up big banks in the wake of the  J.P. Morgan multibillion-dollar trading fiasco, but is there another  solution to this?  We'll ask our expert.  We're on the case, next on THE  WILLIS REPORT.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>WILLIS:  Fresh details in the MF Global debacle.  In the year leading up to  the company's collapse, CEO Jon Corzine raked in the $8 million in  compensation.  </p><p>Keep in mind we've got some $1.6 billion still missing.  Now, granted $5  million of his compensation came in the form of stock options, which are  now worthless, but $3 million came in straight up cash.  </p><p>While $1.6 billion, as I said, in customer money is still gone with the  wind.  </p><p>Time to bring out our panel.  Katie Pavlich is the news editor for  TownHall.com in D.C.  Marjorie Clifton is founder of  SpikeTheWatercooler.com, also in D.C.  And Al Lewis, columnist for \"Dow  Jones Newswires\" in Denver.  Katie, start with you.  </p><p>KATIE PAVLICH, NEWS EDITOR, TOWNHALL.COM:  Look, when is President Obama  and Vice President Joe Biden going to come out and denounce Jon Corzine?  </p><p>I mean, he did help craft the failed stimulus package after all.  And I  think they should reassure us that they're not going to go and get advice  from people like Jon Corzine who are willing to cut and run and then cost  their investors millions of dollars, billions of dollars, and then cost the  taxpayers at least $1 trillion in addition, too.  </p><p>WILLIS:  Crazy.  Al, do you agree?  </p><p>AL LEWIS, COLUMNIST, \"DOW JONES NEWS WIRES\":  I second what she said.  And  you know what?  I want to add that every time one of these big banks blow  up, what we do is we look back and we see how much the CEO got paid and  it's a lot.  </p><p>And shat this shows is that CEO's get paid to take enormous risks with  other people's money.  And if it doesn't work out, oh, well.</p><p>WILLIS:  Oh, well.  Yes, definitely, sometimes there is a disconnect  between performance and pay.  Marjorie, what do you say?  </p><p>MARJORIE CLIFTON, FOUNDER, SPIKETHEWATERCOOLER.COM:  Well, it is part of  the Wall Street culture.  And right now, unfortunately, there is no  retribution for anyone who unwisely spends investors' money.  </p><p>So unless there is an overall change in Wall Street and how we - and  obviously, we don't regulate Wall Street - it's going to continue to  happen.  </p><p>WILLIS:  All right.  Here's one of my favorite stories tonight.   Former presidential candidate, Newt Gingrich, is having cash problems.   Gingrich dropped out of the race nearly five million in debt and his own  business is now going bankrupt.  And yet, on the campaign trail, Gingrich  said he knew exactly how to manage money.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NEWT GINGRICH, (R) FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  I am for  capitalism.  I am for honest entrepreneurs investing.  I'm for people  creating businesses.  Callista and I have created four small businesses in  the last decade.  I get it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILLIS:  Marjorie, does Gingrich really get it when it comes to money?</p><p>CLIFTON:  Well, Gingrich doesn't get it when it comes to campaigns,  because most politicians who don't end up cutting it are able to actually  profit and make money when they come out of the election season.  But what  was unique about Gingrich is that he really was ego driven.</p><p>I mean, you saw with Santorum, he stood for ideals.  Gingrich stood  for ego.  And people saw right through it.  So, I think he needs to take a  lesson from Sarah Palin on how to capitalize on your image and rebrand  himself.</p><p>WILLIS:  I think he needs more than capitalizing in his image.  Katie,  what do you say?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>KATIE PAVLICH, TOWNHALL.COM NEWS EDITOR:  I say (ph) that truth is  looks like he is in a lot of trouble here.  And I think he's probably  bouncing off of what Marjorie just said.  He's probably reassessing why he  stayed in the GOP primary race so long and whether he should have run for  president, in the first place.</p><p>WILLIS:  You're probably right.  Al, what do you say?</p><p>AL LEWIS, \"DOW JONES NEWSWIRES\" COLUMNIST:  Oh, I just love the words  bankrupt fiscal conservative in the same headline.  You know, I think the  Republicans made the right choice.  The question is, what took them so  long?  I mean, this is a guy who says he doesn't like Fannie and Freddie  and he takes money from Fannie and Freddie.</p><p>WILLIS:  Yes.</p><p>LEWIS:  He complains about adultery.  Why he commits adultery?  Now,  we see all his money problems while he is trying to straighten out the  money problems of America.  How does this guy have any credibility left?   Why are we even talking about him?</p><p>WILLIS:  And send your e-mails to AlLewis.com.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>WILLIS:  All right.  Here's a man bite dog, bites man, bites newspaper  story.  There's a new reason to be aware of dog bites.  Guess what?   They're driving up insurance rates.  In fact, dog bites account for more  than a third of homeowners insurance liability claims in 2011, costing  hundreds of millions of dollars.  Al, I would never have guessed this.</p><p>LEWIS:  Well, first I want to say that e-mail is  <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:Al.Lewis@DowJones.com\">Al.Lewis@DowJones.com</email></p><p>WILLIS:  Oh, you're going to -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WILLIS:  Oh, my goodness.  I wish I was saving you.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>LEWIS:  And the second thing is buy a cat, OK?  Get a cat.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>LEWIS:  That's basically all I got to say about this story.</p><p>WILLIS:  Marjorie.</p><p>CLIFTON:  Well, it was actually $479 million went out last year which  is just a shocking number.  And I do agree.  Either, I would go with the  cat, a gerbil, a poodle, maybe one of those small little dogs.  But yes, in  general, this does not farewell for dog owners.</p><p>WILLIS:  Katie, how about nice dogs, nice dogs?</p><p>PAVLICH:  Yes, you know, some of the most vicious dogs I've ever met  are the little ones.  I don't say a get a little dog.  I'd say -- </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CLIFTON:  Little dog syndrome.</p><p>PAVLICH:  Get a breed that is nice.  And hello, homeowners, keep your  dog away from your visitors.  Keep them on a leash.  Keep them away from  kids and people visiting and people on the street.  Keep your kids away  from front yards and dogs that you're not familiar with.  It's basic common  sense.</p><p>WILLIS:  My favorite pick is the lab.  I want a lab.</p><p>PAVLICH:  Yes, exactly.</p><p>WILLIS:  The private space industry taking off for the first time in  history.  SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket, doesn't that sound cool?  It took  flight this morning delivering 1,000 pounds of cargo to the International  Space Station.  Al, what do you say?</p><p>LEWIS:  Well, we're a far cry away from private space.  This is highly  subsidized by NASA, but it's good to see.  This is a small step for  mankind, I think, but nonetheless, a good one.</p><p>WILLIS:  Marjorie, I want us to have NASA.  I want the country to be  involved in this.  This whole idea that we just leave it to entrepreneurs,  not very satisfying for me.  What do you say?</p><p>CLIFTON:  Well, NASA was excited because it actually privatizing space  is a more lucrative prospect given our government spending right now.  We  don't have the funds for it.  I want to know if office space is cheaper on  the moon because gas prices are pretty high, and I'm wondering, how can we  figure this out, because something is not working with the economy here in  the United States.</p><p>WILLIS:  Katie, can we not afford it?  Is that the reason we're not  doing it?</p><p>PAVLICH:  Well, unfortunately, because the government has spent out of  control, we can't afford it.  And I am with you.  I think that space  exploration is actually crucial to our national and international security.</p><p>But on the brighter note, I like idea that the founder of this company  that sent this private jet into space invested millions of his own dollars  into this project which just proves that the top one percent are doing  amazing things for the country.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>WILLIS:  Yes.  It's not all taking your money.  All right.  Katie,  Marjorie, and Al, thanks for coming on tonight.  You guys were great as  always.</p><p>LEWIS:  Thank you.</p><p>WILLIS:  Excellent job.  Appreciate your time.  Thank you.</p><p>PAVLICH:  Thanks.</p><p>CLIFTON:  Thank you.</p><p>WILLIS:  And we'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>WILLIS:  The media is dubbing him, \"Octodad.\"  Desmond Hatchet is a  33-year-old Knoxville, Tennessee resident.  He's the father of not eight,  though, not 12, but 30 kids, with 11 different mothers.  Only making  minimum wage, he's struggling to keep up with child support payments and is  asking taxpayers to lend him a hand.</p><p>Here to weigh in, Kelly Saindon, a family law attorney.  Kelly, I  can't get over this story.  What do you make of this?</p><p>KELLY SAINDON, FAMILY LAW ATTORNEY:  It's outrageous.  I mean, it's  very socially irresponsible.  It's terrible for the children.  Taxpayers  are very upset.  And what is wrong with these women that the second, third,  fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eight, ninth, 10th, 11th, didn't say no?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>WILLIS:  Well, -- I mean, I just can't get my mind wrapped around  this.  OK.  So, the dad here, Desmond Hatchet, has a minimum wage job which  means that some of the moms are getting as little as $1.49 a month.  So,  ultimately, the state would not be on the hook for a lot of dough, but  should the state pay?  Should government pay for this? </p><p>SAINDON:  Well, let's back up really quickly, and I'm sorry to sort of  derail that a little bit, but the government is on the hook, because you  have to assume that if dad can only pay 1.49, then there's likely welfare  involved.</p><p>WILLIS:  True.</p><p>SAINDON:  There's medical insurance involved.  There's doctors that's  involved.  There's free lunches involved.  And so, the $1.49 a month for  some of these women is laughable.  And so, in tells of him asking for help,  he's saying hey, give me a break, I make 7.25 an hour, and 50 percent of  his gross income goes to child support based on the laws there.</p><p>That's the maximum allowed.  But the reality is this is a burden, and  lots of people in Tennessee are outraged by this.</p><p>WILLIS:  And, isn't the solution simple here?  Stop having children.</p><p>SAINDON:  Well, you would think so, and this guy was in some  interviews in 2009, and at that point in time, he had 21 children.  And  they said, are you going to keep having kids?  He said, no, I'm done.   Three-years later, nine children later.</p><p>WILLIS:  Wow.</p><p>SAINDON:  What scares me is he's only 33.  I mean, he could arguably  procreate for another 40 years.</p><p>WILLIS:  Yes.  When I heard he was 33, that's what really turned me  around on this.  OK.  Everybody is listening to the story, talking to the  story.  It's gone viral.  Do you think people feel like you do?  I mean,  that it's an outrage, and that we should definitely not be subsidizing this  kind of behavior?</p><p>SAINDON:  You know, I posted it on Twitter and Facebook and everyone  said, this guy is crazy.  The women are crazy.  What is he thinking with?   Force him to get another job.  They're saying, suggesting should castration  become legal.  Can we punish him for having more children?  The answer is  no.  It's not legal, and you can't force him to stop having babies.</p><p>But lots of people are angry saying, why are my tax dollars  subsidizing his irresponsible lifestyle?</p><p>WILLIS:  Well, Kelly, what do you do about this?  I mean, as a  practical matter, what can the state do?  Because if there's one Desmond,  there's probably 20 Desmonds, there's 50 Desmonds, maybe different scales,  fewer kids, more kids, who knows.  But what can the state of Tennessee  really do here? </p><p>SAINDON:  You know, I arguably come to education.  And, while some  people may disagree with this, accessible birth control, because some guy  making $7 an hour who's now giving $3.50 of that to his multiple children  isn't going to spend his money on appropriate safe sex.  So, that's a  possible solution.</p><p>The reality of the situation is, I don't think there's an answer,  unless, a judge forces him to get another job to support his children,  because if that possibility, maybe he won't have as much free time to  procreate.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>WILLIS:  Well, I got to tell you, I think birth control is everywhere  and easy to get.  I doubt it's about the money.  Kelly, thanks for coming  on today.  Really appreciate your time.  Interesting conversation, thanks.</p><p>SAINDON:  Thanks for having me.</p><p>WILLIS:  Great.  All right.</p><p>Well, now, we want to know what you think about this story.  Should  the Tennessee father of 30, 30 kids, get government help paying for child  support?  We took to the streets of New York asking people from all over  the country what they thought.  Here's what they said.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  He has that many kids?  He should pay for all  those kids.  Shouldn't be the -- shouldn't be the government.  Shouldn't be  us.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I think that's pretty sad commentary, 33  children and -- </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Thirty children, 33 years old.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Thirty-three years old.  Where's the  accountability?  You know?  That's really irresponsibile.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Promiscuous enough to do that with that many  chicks, -- </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It's his mistake, and they're alive.  So, you got  to like be a man.  Take your responsibility and live with that.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  We deal in California with octomom.  So, it's  not OK.  It's not OK.  we worked hard all our life, you know, to have what  we have, and when we have to pay extra, when we see this kind of stuff  going on, it's just not OK.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  He enjoyed making them so he should pay for them.   You know?  It's quite obvious that he enjoyed it, right?</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>WILLIS:  I love that.  It's not OK.  We worked hard all our lives.   Don't want to pay for this.  Agree with you.</p><p>Here's what some of you are saying on my Facebook page.  David writes  this, \"No.  There are too many people that do just that now, have kids just  for the government support.\"</p><p>And Beverly agrees.  She says, \"Talk about wanting a free ride?  I  feel sorry for the kids.\"</p><p>Laura says, \"Give him a government job, make him earn the money, then  garnish his wages to pay the child support.  Otherwise, the taxpayers foot  the entire bill.\"</p><p>And finally, Gary says this, \"The only government help he should get  is a free vasectomy.\"</p><p>Here's your chance to weigh in on our question tonight, log on to  GerriWillis.com, vote on the right-hand side of the screen.  I'll share the  results at the end of tonight's show.  And, in addition to liking me on  Facebook, don't forget to follow me on Twitter.  We love to hear what you  have to say.</p><p>All right.  Is breaking up the banks the only way to prevent another  JPMorgan mess?  Details after the break.</p><p>And coming up in just a few minutes, Neil Cavuto will be joined by  former Minnesota governor, Tim Pawlenty.  Don't go away.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>WILLIS:  Federal regulators aren't giving up insisting more must be  done in the wake of the huge trading loss at JPMorgan, but there may be a  better option.  Find out next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>WILLIS:  In focus tonight, JPMorgan's multibillion-dollar trading  loss.  New reports claiming those losses may have exceeded $7 billion.   That's much higher than previous estimates of more than 2 billion.  So, is  more regulation the answer?  James Grant is publisher for Grant's Interest  Rate Observer.  Jim, welcome to the show.</p><p>JAMES GRANT, GRANT'S INTEREST RATE OBSERVER PUBLISHER:  No, it's not.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>WILLIS:  I'm sorry?</p><p>GRANT:  It's not the answer.</p><p>WILLIS:  It's not the answer.</p><p>GRANT:  No.</p><p>WILLIS:  Why not?  I mean, look at this.  This is a lot of money.  It  brings back all the memories of what happened in 2007 and 2008.</p><p>GRANT:  It does.</p><p>WILLIS:  Doesn't this make you worry that we could be in for another  round of banks blowing up?</p><p>GRANT:  One memory it brings back is the utter inability of the  regulators in 2006 and 2007 to spot the most obvious and crying shame of an  excuse for bank underwriting in modern American financial history.  They  saw nothing.  And we are now to believe that the answer to the difficulties  -- </p><p>WILLIS:  They had more of that.</p><p>GRANT:  Right.  So, you know, banking is hard-line of work.  They  start with a relatively small equity capital.  They pile assets and  liabilities.  And, it takes a lot of judgment and it takes a certain -- a  great amount of skill.  And, it's not clear that the government has that  skill.  Bankers may not be very good at it, but the government is not -- </p><p>WILLIS:  Even worse, because they sure didn't see the last blowup  coming.  Gary Gensler, who runs the CFTC, big regulator, Commodities Future  Trading Commission, had this to say about how he found out about what was  going on at JPMorgan.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GARY GENSLER, CFTC CHAIRMAN:  I would say that the trades that came  to, I think, many of our attention personal attention with press reports.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Press reports? </p><p>GENSLER:  But our staff was aware of trades that are in the  clearinghouses, because they monitor the clearinghouses daily.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILLIS:  It goes right to your point that these regulators don't know  what's going on.</p><p>GRANT:  The regulators are all -- over this bank -- they're quartered  in the banks.  Bank of any size has a permanent staff of regulators on the  premises like the marine detachments at American embassies.  The federal  government is present constantly.</p><p>What the regulators had to know because it was in JPMorgan's own SEC  filing was that there was no claim by the bank that these transactions were  hedged transactions.  You have to do -- in order to have a hedged  transaction, you have to file extensive documents and you have to show that  the transaction in which you were meant to hedge a position could hedge it.</p><p>And it wasn't merely a bet (ph).  None of that took place in Morgan.   So, the regulators had to know what was going on knowing they did nothing.   And now, we are meant to believe that the answer is still more regulation.   The answer is the personal accountability of the bankers in question.  The  answer is -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WILLIS:  Jim, Jim, how do you make that happen?  Because at the end of  the day, these guys do not have a fall from grace.  They just go to another  bank.  They don't even typically have to earn less.</p><p>GRANT:  I'm going to tell you a story about capitalism.  Way back when  up until 1935 from the dawn of American modern banking system until 1935,  if a bank got into trouble, it became impaired with respect to capital or  became insolvent.  The stockholders of that bank got a capital call.  The  taxpayers did not get a capital call, because -- </p><p>WILLIS:  That was the right way to do it.</p><p>GRANT:  It was the stockholders bank and not the taxpayers.  It would  be easy today to institute a first approximation of this very healthy  regime.  One could, for example, claw back the income of any of our big- earring bankers above a certain decent minimum if the bank in which they  have been working and have not been performing well gets into trouble.</p><p>There are all sorts of possibilities for reinstituting personal  accountability in banking without subjecting it to the -- </p><p>WILLIS:  Wow!  I can not -- I can't imagine how that would go over.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WILLIS:  -- you're going to claw back -- I mean, just interesting.  As  a practical matter, do you think that could ever become a reality?</p><p>GRANT:  Doesn't it sound good, though?  I mean, it sounds that has a  nice bipartisan appeal.  Anyone who makes, for example, more than 10 times  the manufacturing wage would be susceptible to claw back for seven years  after he or she departs his or her -- </p><p>WILLIS:  Would anybody go to work in a bank if you did that?</p><p>GRANT:  Sure, because people going to work into banks don't believe  that they're going to run into trouble.  And furthermore, susceptible to  that kind of penalty, they would, perhaps, bear down a little bit harder  with regard to risk management.  It seems to me that the way forward is not  with more government.  The way forward is with more capitalism.</p><p>WILLIS:  There's even been talk of Glass-Steagall, bringing Glass- Steagall back.  And I'm not even sure that would have an impact on what  happened here with JPMorgan, would it?</p><p>GRANT:  I don't think so.</p><p>WILLIS:  Yes.</p><p>GRANT:  I think what is wanted again is the accountability of people  who make decisions.  What is not wanted is still more asphyxiating  regulation as it is now.  If you are a bank examiner, you have to worry  about the following things.  You have to worry about the card act.  You  have to worry about regulation E, the community reinvestment act.  You have  to worry about U.S. patriot act.</p><p>There are half a dozen or more major preoccupations of these  regulators without any attention paid to the quality of the assets of the  institutions they are regulating.  And the answer supposedly to  difficulties at JPMorgan and others is to give them still more to do, more  regulations, more recondite rules that we will draft later, right?</p><p>WILLIS:  All right.  Fascinating.  Fascinating stuff.  Interesting.   We'll have to put your idea to a few people and see how they react to it.</p><p>GRANT:  Well, good.</p><p>WILLIS:  Jim Grant, Grant's Interest Rate Observer, thanks for coming  on tonight.  We appreciate it.</p><p>All right.  We'll be right back with my \"Two Cents More\" and the  answer to our question of the day, should a Tennessee father of 30 get  government help paying his child support?  Coming up next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>WILLIS:  A Tennessee man says he has problems paying child support.   Why?  Because he says he makes minimum wage and has 30 children.  Now,  Desmond Hatchett is pleading with the state to help him pay.  So, we asked  on GerriWillis.com, should the Tennessee father of 30 get government help  to pay his child support.</p><p>No big surprise here.  Ninety-seven percent of you say no way.  Log on  to GerriWillis.com for our online question every weekday.</p><p>All right.  It may not feel like it for a lot of drivers out there,  but traffic congestion dropped 30 percent last year across the country.   Now, all that's good news.  The bad news is the drop is because of higher  gas prices and unemployment.</p><p>And tonight's top five, the city is seeing the biggest decreases in  gridlock.  Number five, Provo, Utah, number four, Sacramento -- Sacramento,  that is, California.  That's one positive for the Golden State.  Number  three, Honolulu, Hawaii.  Number two, Akron, Ohio.</p><p>And the number one city where traffic congestion has decreased,  Minneapolis, Minnesota, with stimulus funds drying road construction  plummeted in 2011 making traffic less of an issue.  Tampa, Jacksonville,  Florida have the biggest increases in traffic from 2010 to 2011.  You  probably already know that if you're living it.</p><p>All right.  Here are some of your e-mails.  Cathy writes this, \"The  next time VP Biden or anybody else talks about the mess inherited by Obama,  he or they should be reminded that in the last two years of the Bush  administration, both Houses of Congress were controlled by Democrats.\"</p><p>And finally, here's Lynn from Texas, \"Gerri, you were spot on with my  opinions.  Why don't you run for president?  Oh, I forget.  You're too  sensible.\"  Lynn, thank you for that.  </p><p>Appreciate your comment.  We love to hear from you and send me an e- mail to <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:Gerri@FoxBusiness.com\">Gerri@FoxBusiness.com</email></p><p>And finally, tonight, listen, airlines are officially out of control.   Fees for bags, fees for boarding, fees to change tickets, and even fees if  you want to schlep your own stuff.  This summer, they're going to force all  of us to cough up another fee.  It's going to cost extra for friends and  family to sit together.</p><p>So, if you're flying in the coming months, get ready to pay more for  buying the seat next to you.  In they're never ending quest to squeeze  every possibly penny out of the American public airlines are now charging  extra seats for windows and aisle seats.  About 50 bucks each per trip.   Now, the airlines (INAUDIBLE) to constantly trying to improve customer  service.</p><p>Well, I've got a special announcement for them, forcing folks to fly  solo on family vacations, it's not the way to do it.  My advice to them, be  honest enough about (ph) your pricing.  As Americans, we love to fly.  We  don't like being taken for a ride.  That is my \"Two Cents more.\"</p><p>That's it for tonight's WILLIS REPORT.  Thanks for joining us.  Don't  forget to DVR the show if you can't catch us live.  Have a great night.   We'll see you right back here tomorrow.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2012 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2012 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.

And father of 30 asking taxpayers to bail him out.   Hello, everybody, I'm Gerri Willis.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">You know, I've gotten a lot of flak over the years for warning small  investors of the perils of putting their hard-earned money into red-hot  initial public offerings.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I warned here Friday about Facebook and it has become a prime example of  what I'm talking about.  My savvy viewers already know that Wall Street  bait and switch. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We're now learning while banks were selling Facebook stock to the public,  they were quietly cutting their own outlook for the company.  Can you  believe that?  </p><p>It's the same thing happened during the housing bust.  Bankers were selling  mortgages to investors, mortgages they knew were worthless.  </p><p>Today, NASDAQ and brokerages pointing fingers at each other over the whole  Facebook flop.  Regulators say that small investors should have confidence  in the market.  </p><p>You've got to be kidding.  Those same regulators started investigations  into what went wrong with the most hyped IPO in history.  </p><p>This is exactly the reason that many feel there is an uneven playing field  when it comes to investing.  Stock message boards were lit up with Facebook  comments today.  \"Biggest IPO fraud ever,\" said one.  The biggest sting of  all time.  </p><p>One person saying simply, \"The worst investment decision I have ever made.\"   Unfortunately, that is the story for some small investors.  They learn the  hard way, and it shouldn't be that way.  That's my two cents and this is  THE WILLIS REPORT. </p><p>(MUSIC) </p><p>The market still not liking Facebook, shares dropping eight percent today.   And reportedly, one investor is suing NASDAQ over its handling of the debut  and seeking class-action status.  </p><p>So should investors feel zuckered - or maybe \"suckered\" is the better word  - over the Facebook hype?  </p><p>To Gary Kaltbaum, president of Kaltbaum management.  Gary, let's start with  this lawsuit.  Not a big surprise?  I've been expecting it.  You probably  have been, too.  Can they be successful?  </p><p>GARY KALTBAUM, PRESIDENT, KALTBAUM MANAGEMENT:  Let's just say there's  going to be a lot more of these lawsuits to come, and they're going to go  after everybody.  </p><p>Whenever you see a company blow up on earnings, the lawyers who like these  class actions are looking into the market and finding these things.  So  you're going to see it.  It's going to go after the underwriters.  </p><p>It's probably going to be Facebook also.  It's already on the NASDAQ and  the free-for-all starts.  </p><p>WILLIS:  Well, the free-for-all starts.  But look, individual investors  feel like the biggest losers here.  </p><p>KALTBAUM:  Yes.  </p><p>WILLIS:  Let's just be honest.  And frankly, they were, because the  investors, the original investors and the founders - they're the ones who  made out.  </p><p>You know, individual investors aren't doing well here.  This stock is  trading lower than its offer price.  </p><p>KALTBAUM:  A lot lower.  And some people actually paid higher than the  offering price.  Look, the bottom line here is, the bankers overreached,  overhyped.  </p><p>The price was an absolute joke.  I've been yelling and screaming about this  price, $100 billion market cap with less than $4 billion in revenues.  </p><p>And by the way, their earnings have been decelerating over the last three  quarters.  Now, I didn't know where the stock would open.  When I saw it  open in the 40s, I knew something was up.  And you see what is happening  here.  </p><p>And frankly, I think at even these levels that it is too expensive.  And I  think there will be more pain to come especially since there is so much  negativity on the deal at this point.  </p><p>WILLIS:  So the valuation, at the time it went public, four times Google's  valuation based on earnings.  Now, today, this was supposed to be the  biggest tech IPO of all time.  Its market cap now, $84.84 billion, down  from $104 billion.  </p><p>What is going on here?  And you know, what we had heard is that the major  underwriters of this stock, their analysts had come out while they were  doing the road show saying, look, this - you know, reduce your expectations  particularly for revenue here.  What do you make of that?  </p><p>KALTBAUM:  I think the bankers were simply greedy.  That is what this came  out to.  The more fees - they get more fees because of higher price and  more shares and they didn't listen to sound advice.  </p><p>They put their own wallets first, the investors second.  And guess what  happens now?  All those fees are going to be bye-bye.  The credibility is  shot, and they're going to lose a lot of money just defending the lawsuits  going forward.  </p><p>So it is a lose-lose for these guys.  And you would think they would learn  a lesson.  I still remember back in '99.  They did the same thing, but it  was actually worse back then.  </p><p>They brought companies public in the Internet space that had no revenues  and brought them out with billion-dollar market caps.  But then, investors  would bid them up to $2 billion and $3 billion.  </p><p>WILLIS:  Not anymore.  </p><p>KALTBAUM:  And I think they were trying to get the same - yes, exactly.  I  think they were trying to get the same thing done here and it bit back on  them.  </p><p>WILLIS:  Bit back on them.  But you know, look, we're sort of in a delicate  time here for individual investors.  </p><p>KALTBAUM:  Yes.  </p><p>WILLIS:  You know, we had our hopes dashed for many years on returns in the  stock market broadly.  And just seeing this through the hype around this  IPO for Facebook reminded people of the big tech boom, the big tech bubble.  </p><p>What do you think individual investors, what is the lesson they're going to  take away from this?  </p><p>KALTBAUM:  Well, they'd better take the lesson of the more noise, the more  you better investigate.  When Wall Street is very noisy on something,  you've got to look at fine print and you've got to look at numbers.  </p><p>And this one was easy.  You can look at amazon, which has 13 times the  sales of this company and less the valuation, yet they don't care.  They  still bring it out at this price.  </p><p>If the individual investor did a little bit of work here, they would have  looked at number and said, \"No way, I'm going to take a pass regardless  what happens.\"  </p><p>But what happened was everybody thought this thing was going to open, $60,  $70.  I heard some people talking $80 and $90, and everybody figured OK.  </p><p>And of course, the big letdown came when it opened in the $40s.  And now,  we're seeing it at $31 and probably lower prices to come.  </p><p>WILLIS:  All right.  Hey, Gary - </p><p>KALTBAUM:  Yes.</p><p>WILLIS:  We've got some breaking news here that I want you to respond to on  Facebook.  The State of Massachusetts is investigating Morgan Stanley over  its handling of Facebook and specifically the thing I mentioned earlier,  this issuance of analyst guidance on the stock itself.  </p><p>There are subpoenas apparently is what I'm hearing.  Details are just  beginning to emerge just this moment.  What do you make of that?  It seems  like a pile on to me, buddy.  </p><p>KALTBAUM:  Well, you're going to see individual investors go to the state  security's regulators.  And states are going to go after them and  investigate.  </p><p>I don't know the exact timing of the Morgan Stanley analyst, and I know  exactly what he did.  They talked about the mobile apps, that more people  are on mobile than on the regular computers and that is going to hurt them,  and also as far as numbers being a little bit on the soft side.  </p><p>So if the timing was bad, Morgan Stanley and especially the analysts, the  way they did it, could be in some trouble.  I'm not so sure of that.  </p><p>But you can expect everybody to get involved.  This was a big deal.  It was  all over the news.  It was all over the place.  And just remember, there  are 900 million people on Facebook.  </p><p>And when you are front and center, I can promise you the regulators want to  make sure they cover their side of it.  And that's where you're going to  see a lot of this going on in the weeks to come, especially if the stock  keeps getting hit.  </p><p>WILLIS:  All right.  Gary, we'll come back when they do.  We want to talk  to you some more.  Thanks for being with us today.  Really appreciate it.  </p><p>KALTBAUM:  Thanks for having me.  </p><p>WILLIS:  All right.  Just to repeat here because this is just coming out  moments ago, the State of Massachusetts investigating Morgan Stanley over  Facebook and specifically some of the analyst guidance they had out about  that stock.  </p><p>Apparently, subpoenas have been issued.  We'll be following that.  If we  get more details in the hour, we'll let you know.  </p><p>In the meantime, coming up, why a small business tax credit is going  virtually unused.  </p><p>And next, as Facebook stock continues its downward spiral, what should  small investor be doing?  I will break it down, next. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>WILLIS:  The nation's lead securities regulator, Mary Schapiro, had a  message for small investors stung by the Facebook IPO.  </p><p>In spite of the problems with the social network's public stock launch, you  should be confident in the markets.  But it is too late.  They've already  lost confidence.  </p><p>The IPO that was supposed to take the market by storm and reignite small  investor interest in stocks - well, it did just the opposite.  </p><p>Small investors are complaining.  They were prevented from confirming  trades or trade cancellations.  Orders to buy and sell that normally take  two seconds took two hours and even longer.  </p><p>People who bought are angry.  Those who didn't are shrugging their soldiers  and saying, \"I told you so.\"  One investor commented to the \"Wall Street  Journal,\" \"I was stuck for six hours trying to confirm whether I owned this  dog or not.\"  </p><p>What is going on behind the scenes according to reports that NASDAQ system  took an extra two milliseconds to calculate Facebook shares' opening price.   In the meantime, the system was trying to process orders.  </p><p>And that resulted in NASDAQ having to manually override the system, an  override which took 20 minutes.  One simple glitch in the middle of a  massive public stock offering gets magnified.  </p><p>There is no room for error.  Now, that is the official explanation.  But we  talked to those in the marketplace.  And what is going on is a lot of  finger-pointing.  </p><p>NASDAQ says they fixed the problem that caused the delay and that it won't  happen again.  As for the order confirmations that are still pending, all  NASDAQ will say is that after clearing up the unintended consequences of  their pricing system, they cleared their backlog of outstanding orders and  cancellations at 1:50 p.m. Friday afternoon.  </p><p>Now, the implication - look, any delays people have had since then must be  at the broker-dealer end.  Online brokers though, for their part, say the  fault was with NASDAQ and market makers.  </p><p>Scottrade, for example, says NASDAQ issues caused their customer orders to  be delayed, which in turn caused some of those investors to try to change  or modify their order.</p><p>And that put in place a cascade of errors.  Scottrade told THE WILLIS  REPORT that the company had staffed up to deal with questions even before  problems arose across its 505 branch offices, its national service center  and even on Facebook and Twitter.</p><p>When it was clear big problems had occurred, the company kept its trading  services team working throughout the weekend to manually process several  thousand transactions.  </p><p>Can you imagine?  Now, some of these brokerages managed to turn the trouble  to their advantage.  Scottrade opened 431 percent more new accounts Friday  than a typical day, and today's trading volumes were up 70 percent versus  monthly average.  </p><p>Fidelity spoke to us as well saying, quote, \"Fidelity continues to deal  with the aftermath of Friday's market issues and delayed processing of  orders for Facebook.\"  </p><p>\"As they did Friday and yesterday, Fidelity systems continued to operate  normally.  Unfortunately, our clients continue to feel the effects of these  issues in some cases, and we're working aggressive to address them.\"  </p><p>E-trade declined to comment to us.  So far, at least one investor has  already filed a lawsuit against NASDAQ alleging negligence.  </p><p>If you've been impacted, the right thing to do is contact your broker  pronto, even an online broker.  Register what they call a dispute.  </p><p>You don't even need to have details of your trade on hand because the  brokerage will have it in their computer system.  Any reimbursement will  come from the brokerage.  But ultimately, NASDAQ will be on the hook.  </p><p>Frankly, I hate to see this kind of trouble for small investors.  We need a  system in place that treats everybody fairly, not just the deep pocketed  investors looking to cash out of their investments.  </p><p>The market needs small investors and small investors need an even playing  field in the stock market in order to fulfill their own financial goals,  fix the problem, do it fast.  </p><p>Look, ultimately, it is in everybody's interest for the markets to work  efficiently, openly and fairly.  </p><p>Coming up, it's a story you have to hear to believe - a father of 30  asking the government to pay his bills.  </p><p>And next, more evidence as if we needed it, on how Obamacare is crushing  small business and how it's only going to get worse.  Former CBO director  Doug Holtz-Eakin gives us his take, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>WILLIS:  Many Catholic organizations not waiting for the Supreme Court to  decide the fate of Obamacare.  They're suing now.  Douglas Holtz-Eakin  gives us his take in 60 seconds.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>WILLIS:  A new report out this afternoon showing the country will go over a  fiscal cliff if Congress doesn't act.  </p><p>Joining me now, Douglas Holtz-Eakin, former director of the CBO, now the  president of the American Action Forum.  Doug, welcome to the show again.  </p><p>DOUGLAS HOLTZ-EAKIN, PRESIDENT, AMERICAN ACTION FORUM:  Thanks, Gerri.  </p><p>WILLIS:  And your old organization, the CBO, out with a study - I've got to  get you to comment on this - just this afternoon saying that allowing the  Bush-era tax cuts to expire and a scheduled round of automatic spending  cuts will send this economy spiraling into a recession.  Do you agree and  how big is the threat to the economy?  </p><p>EAKIN:  Well, I think this is a very real threat, Gerri.  Imagine investors  who have a dividend tax rate 15 percent now, facing potential dividend tax  rate of 44 percent come January 1st.  </p><p>It's not going to take until January for the implications to start showing  up.  Investors are going to start getting nervous this fall.  </p><p>I think markets are going to react.  We're going to see some severe  economic impact.  So it is time to address the real problems that face the  United States, the overspending, the uncertainty about the tax code.  </p><p>Put in place something investors can count on.  And it is a reminder our  problems are not because we have debt limits and things like that.  The  problems are, we have problems.  </p><p>WILLIS:  we have problems and our main problem is spending too much money  and money we don't have.  </p><p>EAKIN:  Absolutely.  Absolutely. </p><p>WILLIS:  You know, I want to talk to you about John Boehner because the  Speaker of the House has been out talking about, how, OK, OK, we'll come to  agreement on lifting the debt ceiling.</p><p>But if you do that, let's have commensurate cuts.  And he has taken hell  for that.  I mean the Democrats are all over him.  You can't initiate in  this country, it seems to me, a meaningful conversation about cutting  spending because the left just won't allow it.  </p><p>EAKIN:  Well, I mean, no one wants to default on the debt, but also no one  wants to have a downgrade.  And remember, Japan doesn't have a debt limit.   Japan just got downgraded.  Why?  They have too much debt.</p><p>The fundamental problem is the debt.  Speaker Boehner is talking about an  approach to addressing the real problem which is spending that causes debt.   And we have to deal with that, not just the symptom.  </p><p>The notion we have clean debt, limit increase and everything is going to be  fine is really badly mistaken.  </p><p>WILLIS:  Well, you know, the president, just this weekend, meeting with  world leaders, he said essentially this idea that we need to spend more is  fundamentally right, to pull Europe out of recession and of course the  threat that the U.S. would go into recession too.  </p><p>That seems to be diametrically opposed to what you just said.  </p><p>EAKIN:  There is this great fear of austerity in the United States.  But no  one is talking about austerity.  We're talking about sensible reforms to  the big spending programs that are driving the debt.  </p><p>Take social security as an example.  If we were to reform social security,  all that would happen is that anyone working now would know what the deal  was in retirement.  </p><p>International investors would know that we could deal with traditional  third rail of politics.  There would be no cut in immediate spending.   There would be no impact on the recovery.  </p><p>So fear of austerity is just an excuse to not make reforms we need and  which our citizens really deserve.  </p><p>WILLIS:  You know, big headlines around Catholic institutions now suing the  Federal Government over Obamacare and these requirements really that these  institutions fund birth control, fund things that they're just  fundamentally opposed to.  </p><p>I want you to respond to comments from Cardinal Timothy Dolan from right  here in New York City.  Here is what he had to say.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>TIMOTHY CARDINAL DOLAN, ARCHBISHOP OF NEW YORK:  What the federal  government did, unfortunately, and which got our Irish up is when they  said, \"Oh, by the way, we'll define what a church is.\"  </p><p>\"We'll tell you what you can and can't do.  We'll set the parameters as to  how you can minister, to whom you may minister and the motives that should  direct your ministry.\"  </p><p>That is the character, that is the tone of these straitjacketing  exemptions.  </p><p>WILLIS:  Your response?  </p><p>EAKIN:  Well, I mean what you're hearing is the cardinal saying Obamacare  tramples on religious freedoms that are at the core of what America is  built on.  It also tramples on economic freedoms, the individual mandate.  </p><p>And as you know it tramples on small businesses.  This is a reform that  really did not serve its intended goal of cutting costs.  Costs are going  up, not down, and in the process, has trampled all over things which we  count on in America.  </p><p>WILLIS:  Well, you know, it is interesting you bring up small business,  because there was just a story today about how small businesses are not  signing up for this tax credit.  </p><p>They have expected four million small businesses to get the free money.  I  mean, we're talking about free money here.  But in fact, about 170,000 did  it.  Does that surprise you?  </p><p>EAKIN:  There's a lot of research that says this credit is not particularly  valuable because it penalizes you if you hire more.  It penalizes if you  pay better.  </p><p>It is incredibly complicated and hard to figure out and it is temporary,  whereas the burdens that Obamacare imposes are permanent.  So the research  said, this isn't so good.  </p><p>We're now seeing evidence that is exactly right.  It is not going to work.  </p><p>WILLIS:  Well, you know, in just a few short weeks we're going to get  answer from the Supreme Court on what they think about the individual  mandate and Obamacare, generally.  </p><p>There's a lot of talk about what is going to happen, Doug.  And I know you  spent a lot of time thinking about that.  Do you have any fresh insights  into what the Supreme Court might do?  </p><p>EAKIN:  I haven't had a vision of what the vote is.  But certainly, I think  the likely scenarios are ones in which if there is something overturned,  it's just the individual mandate.</p><p>And Supreme Court says, \"Out of abundance of caution, we'll do no more.   You Congress, go fix this.\"  Or since there is nowhere to stop between that  and everything, they overturn everything.  </p><p>So there are only three things I'm looking for.  If it upholds the law, we  go from there, get rid of the individual mandate or throw out the entire  law.  Most of the other outcomes I don't think are very likely.  </p><p>WILLIS:  All right.  Well, Doug, thanks for coming on tonight.  We  appreciate your time.  </p><p>EAKIN:  Thank you.  </p><p>WILLIS:  Come back soon.  All right.  If you're fired up about this or any  of the issues on the program, drop me an E-mail, <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:gerri@foxbusiness.com\">gerri@foxbusiness.com</email></p><p>ANNOUNCER:  Coming up on THE WILLIS REPORT, some people wait until they're  financially stable to have kids, but not this Tennessee man who is calling  on taxpayers to help them support his 30 children.  Can he do this?  Gerri  gets to the bottom of this outrage.  </p><p>And lawmakers are calling to break up big banks in the wake of the  J.P. Morgan multibillion-dollar trading fiasco, but is there another  solution to this?  We'll ask our expert.  We're on the case, next on THE  WILLIS REPORT.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>WILLIS:  Fresh details in the MF Global debacle.  In the year leading up to  the company's collapse, CEO Jon Corzine raked in the $8 million in  compensation.  </p><p>Keep in mind we've got some $1.6 billion still missing.  Now, granted $5  million of his compensation came in the form of stock options, which are  now worthless, but $3 million came in straight up cash.  </p><p>While $1.6 billion, as I said, in customer money is still gone with the  wind.  </p><p>Time to bring out our panel.  Katie Pavlich is the news editor for  TownHall.com in D.C.  Marjorie Clifton is founder of  SpikeTheWatercooler.com, also in D.C.  And Al Lewis, columnist for \"Dow  Jones Newswires\" in Denver.  Katie, start with you.  </p><p>KATIE PAVLICH, NEWS EDITOR, TOWNHALL.COM:  Look, when is President Obama  and Vice President Joe Biden going to come out and denounce Jon Corzine?  </p><p>I mean, he did help craft the failed stimulus package after all.  And I  think they should reassure us that they're not going to go and get advice  from people like Jon Corzine who are willing to cut and run and then cost  their investors millions of dollars, billions of dollars, and then cost the  taxpayers at least $1 trillion in addition, too.  </p><p>WILLIS:  Crazy.  Al, do you agree?  </p><p>AL LEWIS, COLUMNIST, \"DOW JONES NEWS WIRES\":  I second what she said.  And  you know what?  I want to add that every time one of these big banks blow  up, what we do is we look back and we see how much the CEO got paid and  it's a lot.  </p><p>And shat this shows is that CEO's get paid to take enormous risks with  other people's money.  And if it doesn't work out, oh, well.</p><p>WILLIS:  Oh, well.  Yes, definitely, sometimes there is a disconnect  between performance and pay.  Marjorie, what do you say?  </p><p>MARJORIE CLIFTON, FOUNDER, SPIKETHEWATERCOOLER.COM:  Well, it is part of  the Wall Street culture.  And right now, unfortunately, there is no  retribution for anyone who unwisely spends investors' money.  </p><p>So unless there is an overall change in Wall Street and how we - and  obviously, we don't regulate Wall Street - it's going to continue to  happen.  </p><p>WILLIS:  All right.  Here's one of my favorite stories tonight.   Former presidential candidate, Newt Gingrich, is having cash problems.   Gingrich dropped out of the race nearly five million in debt and his own  business is now going bankrupt.  And yet, on the campaign trail, Gingrich  said he knew exactly how to manage money.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NEWT GINGRICH, (R) FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  I am for  capitalism.  I am for honest entrepreneurs investing.  I'm for people  creating businesses.  Callista and I have created four small businesses in  the last decade.  I get it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILLIS:  Marjorie, does Gingrich really get it when it comes to money?</p><p>CLIFTON:  Well, Gingrich doesn't get it when it comes to campaigns,  because most politicians who don't end up cutting it are able to actually  profit and make money when they come out of the election season.  But what  was unique about Gingrich is that he really was ego driven.</p><p>I mean, you saw with Santorum, he stood for ideals.  Gingrich stood  for ego.  And people saw right through it.  So, I think he needs to take a  lesson from Sarah Palin on how to capitalize on your image and rebrand  himself.</p><p>WILLIS:  I think he needs more than capitalizing in his image.  Katie,  what do you say?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>KATIE PAVLICH, TOWNHALL.COM NEWS EDITOR:  I say (ph) that truth is  looks like he is in a lot of trouble here.  And I think he's probably  bouncing off of what Marjorie just said.  He's probably reassessing why he  stayed in the GOP primary race so long and whether he should have run for  president, in the first place.</p><p>WILLIS:  You're probably right.  Al, what do you say?</p><p>AL LEWIS, \"DOW JONES NEWSWIRES\" COLUMNIST:  Oh, I just love the words  bankrupt fiscal conservative in the same headline.  You know, I think the  Republicans made the right choice.  The question is, what took them so  long?  I mean, this is a guy who says he doesn't like Fannie and Freddie  and he takes money from Fannie and Freddie.</p><p>WILLIS:  Yes.</p><p>LEWIS:  He complains about adultery.  Why he commits adultery?  Now,  we see all his money problems while he is trying to straighten out the  money problems of America.  How does this guy have any credibility left?   Why are we even talking about him?</p><p>WILLIS:  And send your e-mails to AlLewis.com.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>WILLIS:  All right.  Here's a man bite dog, bites man, bites newspaper  story.  There's a new reason to be aware of dog bites.  Guess what?   They're driving up insurance rates.  In fact, dog bites account for more  than a third of homeowners insurance liability claims in 2011, costing  hundreds of millions of dollars.  Al, I would never have guessed this.</p><p>LEWIS:  Well, first I want to say that e-mail is  <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:Al.Lewis@DowJones.com\">Al.Lewis@DowJones.com</email></p><p>WILLIS:  Oh, you're going to -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WILLIS:  Oh, my goodness.  I wish I was saving you.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>LEWIS:  And the second thing is buy a cat, OK?  Get a cat.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>LEWIS:  That's basically all I got to say about this story.</p><p>WILLIS:  Marjorie.</p><p>CLIFTON:  Well, it was actually $479 million went out last year which  is just a shocking number.  And I do agree.  Either, I would go with the  cat, a gerbil, a poodle, maybe one of those small little dogs.  But yes, in  general, this does not farewell for dog owners.</p><p>WILLIS:  Katie, how about nice dogs, nice dogs?</p><p>PAVLICH:  Yes, you know, some of the most vicious dogs I've ever met  are the little ones.  I don't say a get a little dog.  I'd say -- </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CLIFTON:  Little dog syndrome.</p><p>PAVLICH:  Get a breed that is nice.  And hello, homeowners, keep your  dog away from your visitors.  Keep them on a leash.  Keep them away from  kids and people visiting and people on the street.  Keep your kids away  from front yards and dogs that you're not familiar with.  It's basic common  sense.</p><p>WILLIS:  My favorite pick is the lab.  I want a lab.</p><p>PAVLICH:  Yes, exactly.</p><p>WILLIS:  The private space industry taking off for the first time in  history.  SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket, doesn't that sound cool?  It took  flight this morning delivering 1,000 pounds of cargo to the International  Space Station.  Al, what do you say?</p><p>LEWIS:  Well, we're a far cry away from private space.  This is highly  subsidized by NASA, but it's good to see.  This is a small step for  mankind, I think, but nonetheless, a good one.</p><p>WILLIS:  Marjorie, I want us to have NASA.  I want the country to be  involved in this.  This whole idea that we just leave it to entrepreneurs,  not very satisfying for me.  What do you say?</p><p>CLIFTON:  Well, NASA was excited because it actually privatizing space  is a more lucrative prospect given our government spending right now.  We  don't have the funds for it.  I want to know if office space is cheaper on  the moon because gas prices are pretty high, and I'm wondering, how can we  figure this out, because something is not working with the economy here in  the United States.</p><p>WILLIS:  Katie, can we not afford it?  Is that the reason we're not  doing it?</p><p>PAVLICH:  Well, unfortunately, because the government has spent out of  control, we can't afford it.  And I am with you.  I think that space  exploration is actually crucial to our national and international security.</p><p>But on the brighter note, I like idea that the founder of this company  that sent this private jet into space invested millions of his own dollars  into this project which just proves that the top one percent are doing  amazing things for the country.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>WILLIS:  Yes.  It's not all taking your money.  All right.  Katie,  Marjorie, and Al, thanks for coming on tonight.  You guys were great as  always.</p><p>LEWIS:  Thank you.</p><p>WILLIS:  Excellent job.  Appreciate your time.  Thank you.</p><p>PAVLICH:  Thanks.</p><p>CLIFTON:  Thank you.</p><p>WILLIS:  And we'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>WILLIS:  The media is dubbing him, \"Octodad.\"  Desmond Hatchet is a  33-year-old Knoxville, Tennessee resident.  He's the father of not eight,  though, not 12, but 30 kids, with 11 different mothers.  Only making  minimum wage, he's struggling to keep up with child support payments and is  asking taxpayers to lend him a hand.</p><p>Here to weigh in, Kelly Saindon, a family law attorney.  Kelly, I  can't get over this story.  What do you make of this?</p><p>KELLY SAINDON, FAMILY LAW ATTORNEY:  It's outrageous.  I mean, it's  very socially irresponsible.  It's terrible for the children.  Taxpayers  are very upset.  And what is wrong with these women that the second, third,  fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eight, ninth, 10th, 11th, didn't say no?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>WILLIS:  Well, -- I mean, I just can't get my mind wrapped around  this.  OK.  So, the dad here, Desmond Hatchet, has a minimum wage job which  means that some of the moms are getting as little as $1.49 a month.  So,  ultimately, the state would not be on the hook for a lot of dough, but  should the state pay?  Should government pay for this? </p><p>SAINDON:  Well, let's back up really quickly, and I'm sorry to sort of  derail that a little bit, but the government is on the hook, because you  have to assume that if dad can only pay 1.49, then there's likely welfare  involved.</p><p>WILLIS:  True.</p><p>SAINDON:  There's medical insurance involved.  There's doctors that's  involved.  There's free lunches involved.  And so, the $1.49 a month for  some of these women is laughable.  And so, in tells of him asking for help,  he's saying hey, give me a break, I make 7.25 an hour, and 50 percent of  his gross income goes to child support based on the laws there.</p><p>That's the maximum allowed.  But the reality is this is a burden, and  lots of people in Tennessee are outraged by this.</p><p>WILLIS:  And, isn't the solution simple here?  Stop having children.</p><p>SAINDON:  Well, you would think so, and this guy was in some  interviews in 2009, and at that point in time, he had 21 children.  And  they said, are you going to keep having kids?  He said, no, I'm done.   Three-years later, nine children later.</p><p>WILLIS:  Wow.</p><p>SAINDON:  What scares me is he's only 33.  I mean, he could arguably  procreate for another 40 years.</p><p>WILLIS:  Yes.  When I heard he was 33, that's what really turned me  around on this.  OK.  Everybody is listening to the story, talking to the  story.  It's gone viral.  Do you think people feel like you do?  I mean,  that it's an outrage, and that we should definitely not be subsidizing this  kind of behavior?</p><p>SAINDON:  You know, I posted it on Twitter and Facebook and everyone  said, this guy is crazy.  The women are crazy.  What is he thinking with?   Force him to get another job.  They're saying, suggesting should castration  become legal.  Can we punish him for having more children?  The answer is  no.  It's not legal, and you can't force him to stop having babies.</p><p>But lots of people are angry saying, why are my tax dollars  subsidizing his irresponsible lifestyle?</p><p>WILLIS:  Well, Kelly, what do you do about this?  I mean, as a  practical matter, what can the state do?  Because if there's one Desmond,  there's probably 20 Desmonds, there's 50 Desmonds, maybe different scales,  fewer kids, more kids, who knows.  But what can the state of Tennessee  really do here? </p><p>SAINDON:  You know, I arguably come to education.  And, while some  people may disagree with this, accessible birth control, because some guy  making $7 an hour who's now giving $3.50 of that to his multiple children  isn't going to spend his money on appropriate safe sex.  So, that's a  possible solution.</p><p>The reality of the situation is, I don't think there's an answer,  unless, a judge forces him to get another job to support his children,  because if that possibility, maybe he won't have as much free time to  procreate.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>WILLIS:  Well, I got to tell you, I think birth control is everywhere  and easy to get.  I doubt it's about the money.  Kelly, thanks for coming  on today.  Really appreciate your time.  Interesting conversation, thanks.</p><p>SAINDON:  Thanks for having me.</p><p>WILLIS:  Great.  All right.</p><p>Well, now, we want to know what you think about this story.  Should  the Tennessee father of 30, 30 kids, get government help paying for child  support?  We took to the streets of New York asking people from all over  the country what they thought.  Here's what they said.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  He has that many kids?  He should pay for all  those kids.  Shouldn't be the -- shouldn't be the government.  Shouldn't be  us.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I think that's pretty sad commentary, 33  children and -- </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Thirty children, 33 years old.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Thirty-three years old.  Where's the  accountability?  You know?  That's really irresponsibile.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Promiscuous enough to do that with that many  chicks, -- </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It's his mistake, and they're alive.  So, you got  to like be a man.  Take your responsibility and live with that.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  We deal in California with octomom.  So, it's  not OK.  It's not OK.  we worked hard all our life, you know, to have what  we have, and when we have to pay extra, when we see this kind of stuff  going on, it's just not OK.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  He enjoyed making them so he should pay for them.   You know?  It's quite obvious that he enjoyed it, right?</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>WILLIS:  I love that.  It's not OK.  We worked hard all our lives.   Don't want to pay for this.

Is breaking up the banks the only way to prevent another  JPMorgan mess?  Details after the break.</p><p>And coming up in just a few minutes, Neil Cavuto will be joined by  former Minnesota governor, Tim Pawlenty.  Don't go away.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>WILLIS:  Federal regulators aren't giving up insisting more must be  done in the wake of the huge trading loss at JPMorgan, but there may be a  better option.  Find out next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>WILLIS:  In focus tonight, JPMorgan's multibillion-dollar trading  loss.  New reports claiming those losses may have exceeded $7 billion.   That's much higher than previous estimates of more than 2 billion.  So, is  more regulation the answer?  James Grant is publisher for Grant's Interest  Rate Observer.  Jim, welcome to the show.</p><p>JAMES GRANT, GRANT'S INTEREST RATE OBSERVER PUBLISHER:  No, it's not.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>WILLIS:  I'm sorry?</p><p>GRANT:  It's not the answer.</p><p>WILLIS:  It's not the answer.</p><p>GRANT:  No.</p><p>WILLIS:  Why not?  I mean, look at this.  This is a lot of money.  It  brings back all the memories of what happened in 2007 and 2008.</p><p>GRANT:  It does.</p><p>WILLIS:  Doesn't this make you worry that we could be in for another  round of banks blowing up?</p><p>GRANT:  One memory it brings back is the utter inability of the  regulators in 2006 and 2007 to spot the most obvious and crying shame of an  excuse for bank underwriting in modern American financial history.  They  saw nothing.  And we are now to believe that the answer to the difficulties  -- </p><p>WILLIS:  They had more of that.</p><p>GRANT:  Right.  So, you know, banking is hard-line of work.  They  start with a relatively small equity capital.  They pile assets and  liabilities.  And, it takes a lot of judgment and it takes a certain -- a  great amount of skill.  And, it's not clear that the government has that  skill.  Bankers may not be very good at it, but the government is not -- </p><p>WILLIS:  Even worse, because they sure didn't see the last blowup  coming.  Gary Gensler, who runs the CFTC, big regulator, Commodities Future  Trading Commission, had this to say about how he found out about what was  going on at JPMorgan.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GARY GENSLER, CFTC CHAIRMAN:  I would say that the trades that came  to, I think, many of our attention personal attention with press reports.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Press reports? </p><p>GENSLER:  But our staff was aware of trades that are in the  clearinghouses, because they monitor the clearinghouses daily.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILLIS:  It goes right to your point that these regulators don't know  what's going on.</p><p>GRANT:  The regulators are all -- over this bank -- they're quartered  in the banks.  Bank of any size has a permanent staff of regulators on the  premises like the marine detachments at American embassies.  The federal  government is present constantly.</p><p>What the regulators had to know because it was in JPMorgan's own SEC  filing was that there was no claim by the bank that these transactions were  hedged transactions.  You have to do -- in order to have a hedged  transaction, you have to file extensive documents and you have to show that  the transaction in which you were meant to hedge a position could hedge it.</p><p>And it wasn't merely a bet (ph).  None of that took place in Morgan.   So, the regulators had to know what was going on knowing they did nothing.   And now, we are meant to believe that the answer is still more regulation.   The answer is the personal accountability of the bankers in question.  The  answer is -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WILLIS:  Jim, Jim, how do you make that happen?  Because at the end of  the day, these guys do not have a fall from grace.  They just go to another  bank.  They don't even typically have to earn less.</p><p>GRANT:  I'm going to tell you a story about capitalism.  Way back when  up until 1935 from the dawn of American modern banking system until 1935,  if a bank got into trouble, it became impaired with respect to capital or  became insolvent.  The stockholders of that bank got a capital call.  The  taxpayers did not get a capital call, because -- </p><p>WILLIS:  That was the right way to do it.</p><p>GRANT:  It was the stockholders bank and not the taxpayers.  It would  be easy today to institute a first approximation of this very healthy  regime.  One could, for example, claw back the income of any of our big- earring bankers above a certain decent minimum if the bank in which they  have been working and have not been performing well gets into trouble.</p><p>There are all sorts of possibilities for reinstituting personal  accountability in banking without subjecting it to the -- </p><p>WILLIS:  Wow!  I can not -- I can't imagine how that would go over.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WILLIS:  -- you're going to claw back -- I mean, just interesting.  As  a practical matter, do you think that could ever become a reality?</p><p>GRANT:  Doesn't it sound good, though?  I mean, it sounds that has a  nice bipartisan appeal.  Anyone who makes, for example, more than 10 times  the manufacturing wage would be susceptible to claw back for seven years  after he or she departs his or her -- </p><p>WILLIS:  Would anybody go to work in a bank if you did that?</p><p>GRANT:  Sure, because people going to work into banks don't believe  that they're going to run into trouble.  And furthermore, susceptible to  that kind of penalty, they would, perhaps, bear down a little bit harder  with regard to risk management.  It seems to me that the way forward is not  with more government.  The way forward is with more capitalism.</p><p>WILLIS:  There's even been talk of Glass-Steagall, bringing Glass- Steagall back.  And I'm not even sure that would have an impact on what  happened here with JPMorgan, would it?</p><p>GRANT:  I don't think so.</p><p>WILLIS:  Yes.</p><p>GRANT:  I think what is wanted again is the accountability of people  who make decisions.  What is not wanted is still more asphyxiating  regulation as it is now.  If you are a bank examiner, you have to worry  about the following things.  You have to worry about the card act.  You  have to worry about regulation E, the community reinvestment act.  You have  to worry about U.S. patriot act.</p><p>There are half a dozen or more major preoccupations of these  regulators without any attention paid to the quality of the assets of the  institutions they are regulating.  And the answer supposedly to  difficulties at JPMorgan and others is to give them still more to do, more  regulations, more recondite rules that we will draft later, right?</p><p>WILLIS:  All right.  Fascinating.  Fascinating stuff.  Interesting.   We'll have to put your idea to a few people and see how they react to it.</p><p>GRANT:  Well, good.</p><p>WILLIS:  Jim Grant, Grant's Interest Rate Observer, thanks for coming  on tonight.  We appreciate it.</p><p>All right.  We'll be right back with my \"Two Cents More\" and the  answer to our question of the day, should a Tennessee father of 30 get  government help paying his child support?  Coming up next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>WILLIS:  A Tennessee man says he has problems paying child support.   Why?  Because he says he makes minimum wage and has 30 children.  Now,  Desmond Hatchett is pleading with the state to help him pay.  So, we asked  on GerriWillis.com, should the Tennessee father of 30 get government help  to pay his child support.</p><p>No big surprise here.  Ninety-seven percent of you say no way.  Log on  to GerriWillis.com for our online question every weekday.</p><p>All right.  It may not feel like it for a lot of drivers out there,  but traffic congestion dropped 30 percent last year across the country.   Now, all that's good news.  The bad news is the drop is because of higher  gas prices and unemployment.</p><p>And tonight's top five, the city is seeing the biggest decreases in  gridlock.  Number five, Provo, Utah, number four, Sacramento -- Sacramento,  that is, California.  That's one positive for the Golden State.  Number  three, Honolulu, Hawaii.  Number two, Akron, Ohio.</p><p>And the number one city where traffic congestion has decreased,  Minneapolis, Minnesota, with stimulus funds drying road construction  plummeted in 2011 making traffic less of an issue.  Tampa, Jacksonville,  Florida have the biggest increases in traffic from 2010 to 2011.  You  probably already know that if you're living it.</p><p>All right.  Here are some of your e-mails.  Cathy writes this, \"The  next time VP Biden or anybody else talks about the mess inherited by Obama,  he or they should be reminded that in the last two years of the Bush  administration, both Houses of Congress were controlled by Democrats.\"</p><p>And finally, here's Lynn from Texas, \"Gerri, you were spot on with my  opinions.  Why don't you run for president?  Oh, I forget.  You're too  sensible.\"  Lynn, thank you for that.  </p><p>Appreciate your comment.  We love to hear from you and send me an e- mail to <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:Gerri@FoxBusiness.com\">Gerri@FoxBusiness.com</email></p><p>And finally, tonight, listen, airlines are officially out of control.   Fees for bags, fees for boarding, fees to change tickets, and even fees if  you want to schlep your own stuff.  This summer, they're going to force all  of us to cough up another fee.  It's going to cost extra for friends and  family to sit together.</p><p>So, if you're flying in the coming months, get ready to pay more for  buying the seat next to you.  In they're never ending quest to squeeze  every possibly penny out of the American public airlines are now charging  extra seats for windows and aisle seats.  About 50 bucks each per trip.   Now, the airlines (INAUDIBLE) to constantly trying to improve customer  service.</p><p>Well, I've got a special announcement for them, forcing folks to fly  solo on family vacations, it's not the way to do it.  My advice to them, be  honest enough about (ph) your pricing.  As Americans, we love to fly.  We  don't like being taken for a ride.  That is my \"Two Cents more.\"</p><p>That's it for tonight's WILLIS REPORT.  Thanks for joining us.  Don't  forget to DVR the show if you can't catch us live.  Have a great night.   We'll see you right back here tomorrow.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2012 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2012 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.

O Facebook estava finalmente entrando na lucrativa arena de servi\u00e7os financeiros com um servi\u00e7o de pagamentos na maior economia da Am\u00e9rica Latina. O lan\u00e7amento em junho, planejado h\u00e1 anos, deveria ser o piloto de uma poss\u00edvel iniciativa global. Mas oito dias ap\u00f3s a opera\u00e7\u00e3o ter come\u00e7ado, o Banco Central a tirou da tomada.    A decis\u00e3o do BC ressalta o desafio do Facebook em tentar ganhar a aprova\u00e7\u00e3o dos reguladores financeiros e as complexidades que esses \u00f3rg\u00e3os de controle enfrentam na avalia\u00e7\u00e3o de riscos de deixar as gigantes de tecnologia soltas pelo mundo. No Brasil, o epis\u00f3dio tamb\u00e9m levantou quest\u00f5es sobre a comunica\u00e7\u00e3o em torno do lan\u00e7amento. Executivos do WhatsApp e autoridades do BC realizaram pelo menos tr\u00eas reuni\u00f5es nos 21 meses anteriores, incluindo duas na semana anterior ao lan\u00e7amento. O presidente do BC, Roberto Campos Neto, disse \u00e0 Reuters, em sua primeira fala com mais detalhes a respeito da decis\u00e3o, que a autarquia n\u00e3o havia decidido ainda como lidar com o modelo de pagamentos proposto \u2014 uma novidade no Brasil, onde n\u00e3o \u00e9 poss\u00edvel transferir recursos por meio de aplicativos usando cart\u00f5es.    VEJA TAMB\u00c9M: Inscreva-se no Canal Forbes Pitch, no Telegram, e fique por dentro de tudo sobre empreendedorismo    \u201cTeve uma reuni\u00e3o pr\u00e9via, onde foi mais ou menos explicado o que era a inten\u00e7\u00e3o, mas n\u00f3s fomos pegos de surpresa com o lan\u00e7amento no dia 15 de junho porque n\u00f3s entend\u00edamos que uma coisa relevante teria que ter passado por um trilho de aprova\u00e7\u00e3o como todos os outros passaram\u201d, disse ele em entrevista. O BC, que afirmou nunca ter recebido um pedido formal de autoriza\u00e7\u00e3o conforme esperado, suspendeu o servi\u00e7o, o Facebook Pay, em 23 de junho. Campos Neto e outras autoridades do BC disseram que as preocupa\u00e7\u00f5es se concentram em concorr\u00eancia, privacidade de dados \u2014 eles n\u00e3o forneceram detalhes \u2014 e em delibera\u00e7\u00f5es em curso quanto \u00e0 necessidade de uma licen\u00e7a para o WhatsApp operar enquanto ofertante ou parte integrante de um arranjo de pagamento.    O WhatsApp disse \u00e0 Reuters que respondeu \u00e0s perguntas do BC e forneceu o cronograma de lan\u00e7amento do servi\u00e7o durante as reuni\u00f5es finais. \u201cConversamos abertamente sobre nossos planos de trazer pagamentos pelo WhatsApp para o Brasil\u201d, afirmou. A empresa acrescentou estar profundamente preocupada com a privacidade dos usu\u00e1rios, informou que os detalhes financeiros seriam armazenados em uma rede apartada segura, e disse possuir contratos de seguran\u00e7a de dados com todos seus parceiros.    O WhatsApp afirmou que n\u00e3o quer se tornar uma empresa de servi\u00e7os financeiros. No Brasil, institui\u00e7\u00f5es financeiras est\u00e3o sujeitas a requisitos de reserva de capital e regras r\u00edgidas. Como uma maneira de contornar o entrave, mas jogar conforme as regras em vigor, o WhatsApp procurou usar as bandeiras Visa e Mastercard, que j\u00e1 possu\u00edam licen\u00e7as do BC, para realizar as transfer\u00eancias de dinheiro. A informa\u00e7\u00e3o foi corroborada tanto pela Visa quanto pela Mastercard.    \u201cO WhatsApp entrou em contato conosco h\u00e1 cerca de dois anos para criar uma solu\u00e7\u00e3o de pagamentos que trouxesse conveni\u00eancia a seus usu\u00e1rios e tamb\u00e9m porque n\u00e3o queria se tornar uma institui\u00e7\u00e3o financeira\u201d, disse o presidente da Visa no Brasil, Fernando Teles.    \u201cFASE DE ADAPTA\u00c7\u00c3O\u201d    O WhatsApp afirmou que usou sistemas de pagamentos existentes da Visa e da Mastercard, que s\u00e3o reguladas no Brasil. No entanto, Campos Neto pontuou que um servi\u00e7o de transfer\u00eancia de dinheiro via cart\u00f5es fornecido por uma grande empresa de tecnologia nunca existiu no Brasil, e que o BC ainda n\u00e3o havia decidido se o WhatsApp precisava de uma licen\u00e7a.    LEIA MAIS: Por que a perda de US$ 8 bilh\u00f5es nos \u00faltimos 2 dias na fortuna de Jeff Bezos n\u00e3o significa muito    \u201cVale lembrar que big tech n\u00e3o est\u00e1 em pagamentos em grande parte do mundo\u201d, disse ele \u00e0 Reuters em 8 de julho. \u201cEnt\u00e3o a gente ainda est\u00e1 numa fase de adapta\u00e7\u00e3o regulat\u00f3ria em rela\u00e7\u00e3o ao que vai vir.\u201d    N\u00e3o \u00e9 a primeira vez que o Facebook parece ter interpretado mal os meandros da regula\u00e7\u00e3o enquanto busca entrar no mundo financeiro, riqu\u00edssimo em dados. H\u00e1 um ano, a empresa divulgou planos para a criptomoeda Libra, mas foi confrontada com a contundente rea\u00e7\u00e3o dos bancos centrais. No caso do Brasil, a oportunidade \u00e9 grande, com um mercado de pagamentos via cart\u00f5es crescente que registrou 1,8 trilh\u00e3o de reais em transa\u00e7\u00f5es no ano passado.    Nos est\u00e1gios iniciais de seu servi\u00e7o, o WhatsApp tamb\u00e9m buscou fazer uso de uma regulamenta\u00e7\u00e3o de pagamentos que permitia \u00e0s empresas iniciar servi\u00e7os sem licen\u00e7a at\u00e9 atingirem R$ 500 milh\u00f5es ou 25 milh\u00f5es de transa\u00e7\u00f5es em um per\u00edodo de 12 meses, segundo fonte pr\u00f3xima \u00e0 companhia. Isso, novamente, estava dentro das regras. No entanto, o dispositivo, segundo Campos Neto, foi constru\u00eddo para incentivar pequenas empresas a entrar no mercado, em oposi\u00e7\u00e3o a uma grande companhia de tecnologia como o WhatsApp, com 120 milh\u00f5es de usu\u00e1rios brasileiros.    \u201cO que o Whatsapp fez \u00e9 que eles tentaram se valer dessa prerrogativa, de que \u2018n\u00f3s vamos come\u00e7ar com uma volumetria muito baixa porque uma hora que eu j\u00e1 estou no sistema depois \u00e9 dif\u00edcil tirar'\u201d, afirmou o presidente do BC, classificando a investida como um \u201cartif\u00edcio de volumetria\u201d.    O BC alterou a regra em 23 de junho, dando amparo \u00e0 possibilidade de suspens\u00e3o dos servi\u00e7os de empresas de arranjo de pagamento por ele supervisionadas.    Tr\u00eas reuni\u00f5es foram realizadas entre o WhatsApp e o BC sobre o servi\u00e7o de pagamento antes do lan\u00e7amento, de acordo com registros p\u00fablicos da autoridade monet\u00e1ria: em outubro de 2018 e neste ano, nos dias 9 e 12 de junho, com um desses encontros finais contando com a participa\u00e7\u00e3o de Campos Neto e do diretor de opera\u00e7\u00f5es do WhatsApp, Matthew Idema.    O WhatsApp disse que tamb\u00e9m apresentou ao BC seu modelo de parceria com a Visa e a Mastercard em 2019, embora a Reuters n\u00e3o tenha conseguido verificar de maneira independente essa reuni\u00e3o e o BC tenha se recusado a comentar encontros ou datas.    LEIA MAIS: Amazon lan\u00e7ar\u00e1 fundo de US$ 2 bilh\u00f5es para investir em energias limpas    Visa e Mastercard disseram \u00e0 Reuters que n\u00e3o notificaram o BC acerca dos planos de realiza\u00e7\u00e3o de transfer\u00eancias de recursos em parceria com o WhatsApp porque acreditavam que j\u00e1 tinham as licen\u00e7as necess\u00e1rias. \u201cN\u00e3o havia uma regra espec\u00edfica sobre pagamentos via servi\u00e7os de mensagens no Brasil, por isso fizemos (a parceria) dentro das regras que existiam\u201d, disse Jo\u00e3o Pedro Paro, presidente da Mastercard para o Cone Sul da Am\u00e9rica Latina.    AMBI\u00c7\u00d5ES GLOBAIS    O rev\u00e9s \u00e9 o mais recente golpe nas ambi\u00e7\u00f5es globais em pagamentos do Facebook, fundamentais para aumentar sua receita nos mercados em desenvolvimento, que respondem pela maior parte do seu crescimento em n\u00famero de usu\u00e1rios.    O WhatsApp tenta lan\u00e7ar um servi\u00e7o de pagamentos desde 2018 na \u00cdndia, seu maior mercado, mas segue empacado em testes beta.    O servi\u00e7o de pagamentos no Brasil n\u00e3o iria cobrar por transfer\u00eancias para usu\u00e1rios individuais, mas os lojistas pagariam uma taxa por transa\u00e7\u00e3o. Uma preocupa\u00e7\u00e3o envolvendo a concorr\u00eancia, de acordo com uma fonte pr\u00f3xima ao BC, \u00e9 o uso pelo WhatsApp da Cielo como sua processadora de pagamentos \u2013 ou adquirente \u2013 para cart\u00f5es como Visa e Mastercard. A Cielo j\u00e1 possui uma participa\u00e7\u00e3o de mercado dominante de 40% no Brasil.    \u201cEu preciso que me mostrem que \u00e9 aberto. Ou seja, que se algum outro adquirente quer entrar nesse novo arranjo, ele tem liberdade de entrar\u201d, disse Campos Neto, embora n\u00e3o tenha mencionado a Cielo.    LEIA MAIS: D\u00f3lar segue exterior e cai com mercado de olho em balan\u00e7os nos EUA    O WhatsApp afirmou que o acordo que assinou com a Cielo n\u00e3o envolve exclusividade. A Cielo se recusou a comentar, mas j\u00e1 afirmou anteriormente que n\u00e3o existe exclusividade. Um outro ponto que esquenta a discuss\u00e3o entre as partes \u00e9 que o BC planeja lan\u00e7ar em novembro sua plataforma de pagamentos instant\u00e2neos, o Pix. Ele possibilitar\u00e1 transfer\u00eancias entre contas correntes de consumidores, um terreno diferente do que o Facebook Pay buscou inicialmente trilhar, envolvendo cart\u00f5es.    O WhatsApp j\u00e1 disse que est\u00e1 aberto a integrar seu servi\u00e7o ao Pix, o que pode ser uma maneira de ajudar a quebrar o impasse, mas mant\u00e9m seus planos de lan\u00e7ar os servi\u00e7os com Visa e Mastercard. Entretanto, o futuro permanece incerto. Desde que o Facebook Pay foi suspenso, autoridades do BC se reuniram com executivos do WhatsApp, Mastercard e Visa na tentativa de encontrar um caminho.    Visa e Mastercard entregaram novos planos de neg\u00f3cios ao \u00f3rg\u00e3o regulador na semana passada, em que o WhatsApp aparece formalmente como o iniciador dos pagamentos a serem processados pelas duas outras empresas. \u201cO WhatsApp n\u00e3o precisava, e ainda n\u00e3o precisa, solicitar uma licen\u00e7a para trabalhar com nossos parceiros\u201d, afirmou o WhatsApp. \u201cSe uma mudan\u00e7a exigir que o WhatsApp obtenha uma licen\u00e7a, faremos isso.\u201d (Com Reuters)    Siga FORBES Brasil nas redes sociais:    FacebookTwitterInstagramYouTubeLinkedIn    Participe do canal Forbes Sa\u00fade Mental , no Telegram, e tire suas d\u00favidas.

''There's unusual constituencies arising,'' he said. He later went on Mr. Hilton's show, ''The Next Revolution,'' for a congenial interview.</p><p>  The antitrust movement has been revived by a bipartisan loathing of Big Tech that extends beyond lawmakers to the furthest firmaments of the right and the left.</p><p>  On one side is the progressive left, whose members have been appalled by Facebook's handling of pro-Trump Russian disinformation campaigns and Silicon Valley's consolidated power. On the other side is the Trumpist right, whose members see the power of social media companies to ban content as censorship and worry that the arteries of communication are controlled by young liberals.</p><p>  The common cause has made for some strange new bedfellows. The left and the right now often have similar anti-tech talking points on cable news and at congressional hearings. Conservatives are showing up at largely liberal conferences, while liberals are going on conservative TV shows.</p><p>  On Tuesday, that alignment will be evident at an antitrust hearing on Capitol Hill featuring executives from Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple, as well as policy experts like Mr. Wu. The hearing, held by the House Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust, will examine ''the impact of market power of online platforms on innovation and entrepreneurship.''</p><p>  ''To the bewilderment of many observers, the ascendant pressures for antitrust reforms are flowing from both wings of the political spectrum,'' Daniel A. Crane, a law professor at the University of Michigan, wrote last year in a paper called ''Antitrust's Unconventional Politics.''</p><p>  Now those who have found mutual understanding need to figure out if they can actually get along.</p><p>  It is not easy. Often, it is awkward.</p><p>  ''I think we should be skeptical,'' said Sabeel Rahman, the president of the progressive think tank Demos and an associate law professor at Brooklyn Law School. ''What are the coalitions that we ought to embrace? Who's the we?''</p><p>  Mr. Rahman said that he was wary of these new conservative allies and that progressives in the movement needed to be cautious. Yes, they both want to take power out of the hands of large tech companies -- but then the two sides have to agree on whose hands that power falls into.</p><p>  ''How do we operationalize this? Who's doing the moderating? Are these new allies coming in good faith?'' Mr. Rahman asked. ''The devil's in the details.''</p><p>  The detail here is who exactly should be in charge of a company like Facebook, if it is not Mark Zuckerberg. The two sides may both want third-party ombudsmen of some sort, but agreement seems to fall apart beyond that.</p><p>  ''Most people getting involved haven't really gamed out what this means,'' said Katy Glenn Bass, the research director at the Knight First Amendment Institute, an advocacy group for free speech.</p><p>  Regulation of online speech is not exclusively an antitrust concern, but today these threads are becoming interwoven. Critics argue that big tech companies need to be broken up or regulated because they are suppressing speech.</p><p>  Ms. Bass, who is organizing a Knight Institute symposium in October on tech giants, monopoly power and public discourse, said she worried that popular enthusiasm for aggressive regulation of speech on the platforms could get out of hand. She worries that now arguments for moderating speech are coming from groups that once stood against government intervention.</p><p>  ''The idea that these platforms should be pretty tightly regulated on what speech they can host is not a traditional conservative argument,'' Ms. Bass said. ''This has all been a real whiplash.''</p><p>  A case in point: On Thursday, The Washington Post published an essay by Charlie Kirk, the president of Turning Point USA, a group for young conservatives, proposing that digital platforms be regulated the way publishers are.</p><p>  ''Fighting back against private companies with governmental action is a politically and ideologically fraught idea for those of us on the right,'' he wrote. But he went on to add, ''There is now ample reason to believe the market's normal corrective powers are being blocked by anti-competitive forces.''</p><p>  Traditional conservatives said they were feeling the whiplash. James Pethokoukis, an analyst at the American Enterprise Institute, a pro-market think tank, was at a party this spring that included Republican donors in Washington when the conversation took a turn toward big tech companies.</p><p>  ''They were talking about breaking them up, turning them into utilities,'' Mr. Pethokoukis said. ''It's a breathtaking change from even a year ago.''</p><p>  He was shocked. To him these companies were American jewels and some of the best bulwarks against rising power abroad. He has since been writing against the movement with pieces like ''The Astonishingly Weak Antitrust Case Against Facebook, Google, and Amazon.''</p><p>  Tech bias has been a longtime concern for the right, and Stephen K. Bannon, President Trump's former chief strategist, frequently mentioned it. Little came of it.</p><p>  Now the movement is finding more mainstream allies. Mr. Kirk and others who have complained of an anti-conservative bias by Facebook, Google and Twitter attended a social media summit at the White House on Thursday. At the event, Mr. Trump accused the companies of exhibiting ''terrible bias'' and said he was calling representatives from all of them to the White House over the next month.</p><p>  On Friday, Mr. Trump took the tech companies to task again, calling them ''crooked'' and ''dishonest'' and adding that ''something is going to be done.''</p><p>  ''In my circles right now,'' Mr. Pethokoukis said, ''if you say, 'I don't think we're seeing systemic bias against conservatives,' it's like they wonder about your sanity.''</p><p>  Matt Stoller, a former Democratic congressional staff member who is now at the antimonopoly think tank Open Markets Institute, which leans liberal, said he noticed the same thing.</p><p>  ''The white supremacists liked to appropriate this language around antimonopoly and free speech,'' said Mr. Stoller, who has written a book on the antimonopoly movement, ''Goliath.'' ''But now there are real networks on the right that are not white supremacist networks, and the people in them are genuinely concerned about the power of Big Tech.''</p><p>  He said he was having to reassess his relationships with conservatives.</p><p>  ''I always knew we were aiming at different things,'' he said. ''Now, we have some of the same goals.''</p><p>  And so they are building wary coalitions. Mr. Wu said he was working on a movement of state attorneys general to take the antitrust fight to individual courtrooms across the country. The most eager allies are Republicans, he said.</p><p>  Mr. Hilton, a former British political adviser, built his Fox News show in 2017 around what he predicted would be an anti-elitist populism movement. The 2016 presidential election was just the start, he figured. But the rallying cries fizzled out, and party lines remained unchanged.</p><p>  Today, he sees a bright spot: the shared antipathy for big tech companies.</p><p>  ''Three years on, it looks like the only remnant of that is this antitrust issue and, if we're really specific about it, anti-Big Tech,'' Mr. Hilton said.</p><p>  On Mr. Hilton's show, Mr. Wu argued for breaking up Facebook by forcing its two other popular apps -- Instagram and WhatsApp -- to be spun off.</p><p>  But Mr. Wu worried about being seen as having a friendly chat on Fox News and felt uncomfortable sharing his appearance on the show with his mostly liberal followers.</p><p>  ''I didn't publicize it a great deal,'' he said.

It focuses on whether Facebook's dominance is stifling competition, limiting choice for consumers and costing advertisers more money.</p><p> \"Big Tech must account for its actions,\" Louisiana Attorney General Jeff Landry, a Republican, said in a statement.</p><p> The group of attorneys general also worries about Facebook's handling of customer data, James said.

The list also includes several states that cannot confirm their participation in pending investigations, James said.</p><p>Facebook and other tech giants have also been feeling the heat from federal regulators.</p><p> The Federal Trade Commission recently fined Facebook $5 billion for privacy violations, but consumer advocates and some public officials criticized that as too lenient.</p><p>MAINE</p><p> Charge dropped against man arrested after speaking Spanish</p><p> PORTLAND - Federal prosecutors dismissed a felony charge against a Guatemalan who was arrested after coming to the attention of Border Patrol agents for speaking Spanish in public in a case that raised concerns about racial profiling.</p><p> The Border Patrol acknowledged in a court document that suspicions about members of a family that included Mateo Carmelo-Bartolo were aroused because they appeared to be of \"Central-American origin\" and because they spoke Spanish while shopping at a Goodwill store in Bangor, Maine.</p><p> Pursuing the felony charge, a prosecutor wrote, was not \"in the interest of justice.\"</p><p> The charge, of reentering the U.S. after removal, was formally dropped Monday.</p><p> Defense attorney Ronald Bourget said the federal prosecutor did the right thing but noted that his client faces further proceedings in immigration court in Boston.</p><p> \"In this day and age, it's hard to believe that racial profiling is something that's occurring,\" Bourget said Tuesday, describing the Border Patrol's conduct as \"atrocious.\"</p><p> He added: \"It's not illegal to speak Spanish in a Goodwill store in Maine.\"</p><p>TENNESSEE</p><p> Man seen riding atop car has 1 charge dropped</p><p> NASHVILLE - A man accused of riding for 20 miles atop a car that sped down a Tennessee interstate has had one of his charges dropped.</p><p> Ronnie Sellars, 31, no longer faces a \"clinging to a vehicle\" charge in Wilson County, but disorderly conduct charges are still pending in neighboring Davidson County, The Tennessean reported on Monday.</p><p> The district attorney's office said Judge Haywood Barry ruled that the language of the law doesn't match what Sellars was accused of doing. Sellars was arrested in September after a joyride during which witnesses recorded him sitting, lying, smiling and waving from atop a four-door sedan.</p><p> Sellars told the newspaper he stood up for part of the ride from Mt. Juliet to Nashville, and it felt like being on a surfboard going 80 mph. Sellars said he thinks the courts should \"put their attention on other things.\"</p><p>ILLINOIS</p><p> Police chief skipping Trump's visit to Chicago</p><p> CHICAGO - Donald Trump's appearance next week at a police chiefs conference will be his first visit as president to Chicago, a city he has ridiculed for years. The city's top cop plans to skip the speech, even though he's hosting the event.</p><p> Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson's apparent snub of Trump's speech Monday at the International Association of Chiefs of Police Conference is the latest chapter in a long and contentious relationship between the Republican president and the nation's third-largest city, a Democratic stronghold.</p><p> \"The values of the people of Chicago are more important to him than anything that could be discussed at that speech,\" Johnson's spokesman, Anthony Guglielmi, said shortly after the White House announced Trump's planned address at the conference.</p><p> Guglielmi added that Johnson will be hosting and attending several events at the conference.</p><p> The Associated Press</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKOK-8a0cfe63bf53fef834d147e2ab2fd877</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F28970EC3C2EDA0 NWBKOK2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XBR-DP71-JBCN-430H-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">401975</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"752\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Daily Ardmoreite<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

It focuses on whether Facebook\u2019s dominance is stifling competition, limiting choice for consumers and costing advertisers more money.</p><p> \u201cBig Tech must account for its actions,\u201d Louisiana Attorney General Jeff Landry, a Republican, said in a statement.</p><p> The group of attorneys general also worries about Facebook\u2019s handling of customer data, James said. That drew scrutiny after firms were able to harvest information in attempts to influence the 2016 presidential election.</p><p>Facebook didn\u2019t immediately respond to an email seeking comment.</p><p> The group backing the state-level probe by the seven states and Washington now includes 21 Democratic attorneys general, 18 Republicans and an independent from 39 states and Guam. The list also includes several states that cannot confirm their participation in pending investigations, James said.</p><p>Facebook and other tech giants have also been feeling the heat from federal regulators. The Federal Trade Commission recently fined Facebook $5 billion for privacy violations, but consumer advocates and some public officials criticized that as too lenient.</p><p>Maine</p><p>     Charge dropped against man arrested after speaking Spanish</p><p> PORTLAND \u2014 Federal prosecutors dismissed a felony charge against a Guatemalan who was arrested after coming to the attention of Border Patrol agents for speaking Spanish in public in a case that raised concerns about racial profiling.</p><p> The Border Patrol acknowledged in a court document that suspicions about members of a family that included Mateo Carmelo-Bartolo were aroused because they appeared to be of \u201cCentral-American origin\u201d and because they spoke Spanish while shopping at a Goodwill store in Bangor, Maine.</p><p> Pursuing the felony charge, a prosecutor wrote, was not \u201cin the interest of justice.\u201d The charge, of reentering the U.S. after removal, was formally dropped Monday.</p><p> Defense attorney Ronald Bourget said the federal prosecutor did the right thing but noted that his client faces further proceedings in immigration court in Boston.</p><p> \u201cIn this day and age, it\u2019s hard to believe that racial profiling is something that\u2019s occurring,\u201d Bourget said Tuesday, describing the Border Patrol\u2019s conduct as \u201catrocious.\u201d He added: \u201cIt\u2019s not illegal to speak Spanish in a Goodwill store in Maine.\u201d</p><p>Tennessee</p><p>     Man seen riding atop car has 1 charge dropped</p><p> NASHVILLE  \u2014 A man accused of riding for 20 miles atop a car that sped down a Tennessee interstate has had one of his charges dropped.</p><p> Ronnie Sellars, 31, no longer faces a \u201cclinging to a vehicle\u201d charge in Wilson County, but disorderly conduct charges are still pending in neighboring Davidson County, The Tennessean reported on Monday.</p><p> The district attorney\u2019s office said Judge Haywood Barry ruled that the language of the law doesn\u2019t match what Sellars was accused of doing. Sellars was arrested in September after a joyride during which witnesses recorded him sitting, lying, smiling and waving from atop a four-door sedan.</p><p> Sellars told the newspaper he stood up for part of the ride from Mt. Juliet to Nashville, and it felt like being on a surfboard going 80 mph. Sellars said he thinks the courts should \u201cput their attention on other things.\u201d</p><p>Illinois</p><p>     Police chief skipping Trump\u2019s visit to Chicago</p><p> CHICAGO \u2014 Donald Trump\u2019s appearance next week at a police chiefs conference will be his first visit as president to Chicago, a city he has ridiculed for years. The city\u2019s top cop plans to skip the speech, even though he\u2019s hosting the event.</p><p> Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson\u2019s apparent snub of Trump\u2019s speech Monday at the International Association of Chiefs of Police Conference is the latest chapter in a long and contentious relationship between the Republican president and the nation\u2019s third-largest city, a Democratic stronghold.</p><p> \u201cThe values of the people of Chicago are more important to him than anything that could be discussed at that speech,\u201d Johnson\u2019s spokesman, Anthony Guglielmi, said shortly after the White House announced Trump\u2019s planned address at the conference.</p><p> Guglielmi added that Johnson will be hosting and attending several events at the conference.</p><p>     \u2014The Associated Press</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKOK-5130995</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F28970EC3C2EDA0 NWBKOK2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y08-WR71-JBCN-423T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">401975</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"755\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Daily Ardmoreite<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

As a result, the overall share of national income going to workers, rather than investors, has declined on average in the OECD, led by the United States, Ireland, South Korea and Japan.</p><p>It said for now there was no evidence that emergence of superstar firms was creating anti-competitive forces, but it also did not rule that out as a future danger.</p><p>\"A key challenge for product market regulation and competition policy going forward will be to prevent emerging dominant players from engaging in anti-competitive practices,\" the OECD said.</p><p>Instead of recommending an anti-trust clampdown, as some politicians in the US have proposed, the OECD said the way to help workers would be to give them better skills and education.</p><p>It also said collective bargaining between workers' reps and employers could help reduce wage inequality.</p><p>While criticising centralised bargaining as associated with lower productivity, the report backed a certain level of \"co-ordinated\" wage bargaining that allowed firms flexibility to tailor conditions of sector-level agreements.</p><p>Such \"organised decentralisation... tends to deliver good employment performance, better productivity outcomes and higher wages for covered workers,\" it said. It also helped create \"labour market resilience\" in the aftermath of an economic downturn.</p><p>\"By contrast, other forms of decentralisation that simply replace sector with firm-level bargaining, without co-ordination within and across sectors, tend to be associated with somewhat poorer labour market outcomes.\"</p><p>WITH REUTERS</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFREVW-doc70vlr2khg9u7aqvn920</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFREVW2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SR3-7XM1-JD34-V3P9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">390780</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"544\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

given new powers to hold social media companies accountable for hosting potentially harmful content on their platforms.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The legislation, which is reportedly still being drafted, will place a legal \"duty of care\" on social media companies such as Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Snapchat, Instagram, and TikTok to ensure users are protected from illegal or harmful content.</p><p>The platforms are largely self-regulating and have their own rules about filtering and taking down unacceptable content on their own terms.</p><p>However, concerns about how social media impacts vulnerable people have been raised amid suicides, including that of schoolgirl Molly Russell, who died in 2017.</p><p>The 14-year-old was found to have viewed harmful content on Instagram, prompting the platform to<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/instagram-molly-russell-images-posts-graphic-self-harm-images-suicide-a8768496.html\">ban all images of self-harm</url>

to the Financial Times</url>, which first reported the story, culture secretary Nicky Morgan will announce Ofcom's widened remit as an Internet watchdog on Wednesday.</p><p>In April last year, the government released a joint white paper on online harms that included proposals to introduce an independent regulator and hold bosses of social media companies personally liable for harmful content on their platforms.</p><p>                     It would be up to Ofcom to decide when and how social media firms have breached the \"duty of care\" and choose how to punish them, which could include issuing \"substantial fines, block access to sites and potentially impose liability on individual members of senior management\".</p><p>The legislation aims to regulate \"illegal activity and content to behaviours which are harmful but no necessarily illegal\".</p><p>Ofcom and the Department for Culture, Media and Sport declined to comment on the report.</p><p>Critics of the proposal said the legislation could cause damage to freedom of speech, comparing it to \"North Korean-style censorship\".</p><p>But campaigners for stricter regulation of social media content, particularly for children, have welcomed the \"duty of care\" model.</p><p>Andy Burrows, head of child safety online policy at the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC), said: \"Any

\"Lawmakers often tell me we have too much power over speech, and frankly I agree.

nitf:lede=\"true\">Social media companies will be held to account for potentially harmful material on their platforms by broadcasting regulator Ofcom, it has been reported.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Government has previously mooted a statutory duty of care for internet companies with an independent regulator enforcing new guidelines against so-called online harms.</p><p>The Financial Times has reported that Culture Secretary Nicky Morgan will announce a widened remit for Ofcom as an internet watchdog on Wednesday.</p><p>A role for Ofcom in dealing with technology firms like Facebook, Instagram and YouTube has previously been suggested and followed the publication of a Government white paper into online harms in April.</p><p>Proposals were put forward in August which suggested allowing the regulator to issue fines against platforms and websites it judges to have failed to protect users from seeing harmful videos such as those depicting violence or child abuse.</p><p>The suggested Ofcom scheme would serve as an interim arrangement until an online harms regulator is appointed under future legislation.</p><p>But the latest proposal could extend the remit of the regulator further with the Government white paper looking to regulate ``illegal activity and content to behaviours which are harmful but not necessarily illegal''.</p><p>Concerns about the impact of social media on vulnerable people come amid suicides such as that of 14-year-old schoolgirl Molly Russell in 2017, who was found to have viewed harmful content online.</p><p>Molly's father Ian spoke of the urgent need for greater action in an emotional foreword to a Royal College of Psychiatrists report, in which he described the ``wrecking ball of suicide'' that ``smashed brutally'' into his family, blaming ``pushy algorithms''.</p><p>He said of her social media accounts: ``Among the usual schoolfriends, pop groups and celebrities followed by 14-year-olds, we found bleak depressive material, graphic self-harm content and suicide-encouraging memes.</p><p>``I have no doubt that social media helped kill my daughter.''</p><p>Ofcom was established in 2003 and took on duties previously performed by the separate regulators of broadcasting, telecommunications and radio.</p><p>Andy Burrows, the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children's head of child safety online policy, said: ``Any regulator will only succeed if it has the power to hit rogue companies hard in the pocket and hold named directors criminally accountable for putting children at risk on their sites.</p><p>``Boris Johnson can protect families and support law enforcement by standing firm against some of the world's most powerful companies.</p><p>``To do that it's imperative that we have a duty of care model that puts the onus on big tech to prevent online harms or answer to an independent regulator.''</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

their platforms by broadcasting regulator Ofcom, it has been reported.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Government has previously mooted a statutory duty of care for internet companies with an independent regulator enforcing new guidelines against so-called online harms.</p><p>The Financial Times has reported that Culture Secretary Nicky Morgan will announce a widened remit for Ofcom as an internet watchdog on Wednesday.</p><p>A role for Ofcom in dealing with technology firms like Facebook, Instagram and YouTube has previously been suggested and followed the publication of a Government white paper into online harms in April.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/uk/article38949597.ece\">Ofcom 'to get increased powers to punish social media firms for harmful content' Code 1</url></p><p>Proposals were put forward in August which suggested allowing the regulator to issue fines against platforms and websites it judges to have failed to protect users from seeing harmful videos such as those depicting violence or child abuse.</p><p>The suggested Ofcom scheme would serve as an interim arrangement until an online harms regulator is appointed under future legislation.</p><p>But the latest proposal could extend the remit of the regulator further with the Government white paper looking to regulate \"illegal activity and content to behaviours which are harmful but not necessarily illegal\".</p><p>Concerns about the impact of social media on vulnerable people come amid suicides such as that of 14-year-old schoolgirl Molly Russell in 2017, who was found to have viewed harmful content online.</p><p>Molly's father Ian spoke of the urgent need for greater action in an emotional foreword to a Royal College of Psychiatrists report, in which he described the \"wrecking ball of suicide\" that \"smashed brutally\" into his family, blaming \"pushy algorithms\".</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/uk/article38949597.ece\">Ofcom 'to get increased powers to punish social media firms for harmful content' Code 2</url></p><p>He said of her social media accounts: \"Among the usual schoolfriends, pop groups and celebrities followed by 14-year-olds, we found bleak depressive material, graphic self-harm content and suicide-encouraging memes.</p><p>\"I have no doubt that social media helped kill my daughter.\"</p><p>Ofcom was established in 2003 and took on duties previously performed by the separate regulators of broadcasting, telecommunications and radio.</p><p>Andy Burrows, the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children's head of child safety online policy, said: \"Any regulator will only succeed if it has the power to hit rogue companies hard in the pocket and hold named directors criminally accountable for putting children at risk on their sites.</p><p>\"Boris Johnson can protect families and support law enforcement by standing firm against some of the world's most powerful companies.</p><p>\"To do that it's imperative that we have a duty of care model that puts the onus on big tech to prevent online harms or answer to an independent regulator.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

The report specifically looked at UK websites, and there is no concrete indication that this is the case for the U.S. However, the revelation about health data's place in the advertising information ecosystem is still revealing no matter the country: When you search websites like WebMD, advertisers know about it and can use that data to build upon what they know about you, and sell you things.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> To which we say: duh. Anyone who doesn't think advertisers are watching your every move online hasn't been paying attention. In our ad-driven, data-sucking digital universe, why would your WebMD visits be any different?</p><p> The types of information advertisers learn about are physical symptoms you could be experiencing, women's health information like menstruation or pregnancy, or prescriptions you're taking. The FT report specifically ties WebMD search queries to Facebook: When you visit WebMD and enter your stuffy nose and sore throat into its \"symptom finder,\" and then get a diagnosis (it's lupus!), Facebook, thanks to a data-sharing agreement, knows about it.</p><p> That could be troubling purely if you care about your privacy, but also because it could be used as part of discriminatory marketing campaigns. For example, if these health searches reveal that you have a disability, then advertisers for services like jobs, housing, and credit could adjust the offers they show based on that fact.</p><p> The report sounds especially alarming because it categorizes searches people conduct online on websites including WebMD, Healthline, Drugs.com, BabyCentre (a website owned by Mashable's parent company, J2) and others, as \"health data.\" But, are your Google searches really in the same category as the health information gathered by your doctor?</p><p> Activity on these websites can certainly include revealing information with the potential for privacy violations and discriminatory advertising. But as a whole, we're not so sure lumping data from your doctor in with your hypochondriacal Google searches is so clear-cut.</p><p> Even if the issue is a bit murky, the European Union has taken a stand: It views health-related activity online as \"sensitive.\"</p><p> FT's report points out that the EU categorizes online health information as \"special category data,\" which gives it more stringent protections under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the broad privacy legislation the EU passed in 2018. Under GDPR, collecting and using online health data for advertising is illegal if the websites don't get explicit consent and transparently explain what they're doing with your data, and who's getting it.</p><p> Websites have until the end of the year to clean up their act in the UK, but the FT's report suggests that the online architecture will make disentangling online health data from other types of activity difficult.</p><p> Take Facebook's response. Facebook basically told Mashable and FT that it doesn't want websites doing this, and that they should stop. Then again, Facebook built the system, via the Facebook pixel \u2014 a line of code embedded in websites that allows Facebook to track online activity \u2014 that allows it to follow people around the internet wherever they go (whether they're Facebook users or not).</p><p> It opened the door to the hen house. Are advertisers just supposed to not go in?</p><p> Here's Facebook's statement.</p><p> \"We don't want websites sharing people's personal health information with us \u2014 it's a violation of our rules, and we enforce against sites we find doing this. We're conducting an investigation and will take action against those sites in violation of our terms.\"</p><p>Google says that it does treat data from health-based websites differently from other types of web activity. Apparently, it's able to flag sites like WebMD as \"sensitive,\" and does not use web activity for general ad targeting. It does use pixel tracking for other purposes like measuring interactions with ads and preventing the same ads from being shown too many times.</p><p> \"Google does not build advertising profiles from sensitive data, including health conditions such as depression or heart disease, and has strict policies preventing advertisers from using such data to target ads. Third-party cookies have a variety of uses, from enabling basic site functions such as payment processing and video player embeds to serving and measuring advertising.\"</p><p> That sounds reassuring. Then again, the report found that Google (via its advertising arm DoubleClick) receives nearly twice as much browser health data as the next largest advertiser, Amazon.</p><p> Whether or not you're more alarmed by the collection of health data than other types of data, there's a question of who should be responsible: the advertisers, or the websites? Advertisers are the ones collecting and using the data, but websites are the ones that build the way in and then make money off the data collection, too. Mashable has reached out to health websites including WebMD and Healthline about this particular conundrum, and will update this story when and if we hear back.</p><p> Until the issue shakes out, though, there are a few things you can do. First of all, maybe don't turn to the internet for every sniffle. But if you do want to access these resources, take these privacy precautions first.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>It's either a cold, or you're dying.

Unregulated Crypto Assets can facilitate unlawful behavior, including drug trade and other illegal activity.\"</p><p>If they want to get into the financial business, Facebook and its dozens of partner companies in the venture will have to accept the kind of tight regulation that banks are under, the president said.</p><p>The Treasury chief's comments went further, though, tying Libra directly to concerns over potential use for money laundering, drug and human trafficking, tax evasion and other crimes.</p><p>Facebook has \"a lot of work to do before we get to the point where we're comfortable with it,\" Mnuchin said.</p><p>On Tuesday, Congress begins two days of hearings on Facebook's Libra plan. The head of the Federal Reserve also raised an alarm about the plan last week.</p><p>Facebook's plan \"raises a lot of serious concerns, and those would include privacy, money laundering, consumer protection, financial stability,\" Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said in congressional testimony. \"Those are going to need to be thoroughly and publicly assessed and evaluated before this proceeds.\"</p><p>Unlike Mnuchin, Powell -- as head of the central bank -- is an independent regulator who is separate from the administration and political influence.</p><p>Already under intense scrutiny from regulators and Congress over privacy and market dominance, Facebook stirred anger on Capitol Hill last month with the unveiling of its plan to create a new financial ecosystem based on a digital currency. Senate and House hearings went on the calendar, and the Democratic head of the House Financial Services Committee called on Facebook to suspend the plan until Congress and regulators can review it.</p><p>Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., said that Facebook, with some 2 billion users around the world, \"is continuing its unchecked expansion and extending its reach into the lives of its users.\" She called Libra \"a new Swiss-based financial system\" that potentially is too big to fail and could require a taxpayer bailout.</p><p>David Marcus, the Facebook executive leading the project, says in his testimony prepared for Tuesday's hearing by the Financial Services panel that Libra \"is about developing a safe, secure and low-cost way for people to move money efficiently around the world. We believe that Libra can make real progress toward building a more inclusive financial infrastructure.\"</p><p>Facebook agrees with Powell's view that the government's review of Libra must be \"patient and thorough, rather than a sprint to implementation,\" Marcus' statement says. \"The time between now and launch is designed to be an open process and subject to regulatory oversight and review. In fact, I expect that this will be the broadest, most extensive and most careful pre-launch oversight by regulators and central banks in FinTech's history. We know we need to take the time to get this right.\"</p><p>The planned digital currency is billed as a \"stablecoin\" backed by deposits in sovereign currencies such as the dollar, euro and Japanese yen -- unlike bitcoin, ether or other digital currencies. Promising low fees, it could open online commerce to millions of people around the world who lack access to bank accounts and make it cheaper to send money across borders. But it also raises concerns over the privacy of users' data and the potential for criminals to use it for money laundering and fraud.</p><p>To address privacy concerns, Facebook created a nonprofit oversight association, with dozens of partners including PayPal, Uber, Spotify, Visa and MasterCard to govern Libra. As one among many in the association, Facebook says it won't have any special rights or privileges. It also created a \"digital wallet\" subsidiary, Calibra, to work on the technology, separately from its main social media business. While Facebook owns and controls Calibra, it won't see financial data from Calibra, the company says.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin speaks during a news briefing at the White House in Washington on Monday.

The Santa Claus rally has come to an end on Wall Street. The Dow is off around half of one percent. Volume is low and this is what investors are watching.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Tesla delivers its first Chinese made cars, but analysts warn the company may not hit its targets. Shares are down.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">On strike. Cabin crew at German Wings walk off the job. The Union warns the industrial action may go longer than expected.</p><p>And most chefs can only dream of getting a Michelin star. But one chef who has been awarded nine has decided he no longer wants any.</p><p>Live from the world's financial capital, New York City. It's Monday, December the 30th. I'm Eleni Giokos, in for Richard Quest and this is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS.</p><p>A very good evening to you and great to have you with me. U.S. markets are slipping at the end of a stellar 2019. The Dow is down 100 points on very thin trading volume right before the New Year's Holiday, so it's no surprise. Now, usually these days we do get very light volume coming through and it exacerbates moves either to the up or downside.</p><p>Still, all three U.S. indices are up more than 20 percent in 2019. The S&amp;P 500 is on track for its best year since 1997. Trade optimism and easing from the Fed have driven stocks higher.</p><p>Steven Englander is the Global Head of G10 FX Research and North American Macro Strategy at Standard Chartered Bank. He now joins me.</p><p>Great to have you on the show. So let's talk about this. I mean, look, what a stellar 2019? If you were in these markets, you've obviously had double digit returns. But the question is, are the bulls going to still be in play in 2020?</p><p>STEVEN ENGLANDER, GLOBAL HEAD OF G10 FX RESEARCH AND NORTH AMERICAN MACRO STRATEGY, STANDARD CHARTERED BANK: Well, I think it depends where they're going to be in play. I mean, you know, Standard Chartered is a bank in emerging markets and we think that the cycle is swinging in favor of emerging markets that they've lagged behind some of the U.S. equity indices.</p><p>A lot of discussion about their tapping out what's the new, new thing and U.S. equities, whereas I think the low rates and the low inflation globally and the easing of trade talks will do very well for emerging economies, both in economic terms and in asset market terms.</p><p>GIOKOS: Yes. Okay. So I get there are going to be risks. And even the IMF has said that the global trade war has the potential of wiping off billions of the global economy, but the point is, you're going to see a recalibration and you've got Central Banks ready to pounce.</p><p>In fact, we are still very much sitting in an accommodative monetary policy scenario. So how do you weigh up the pros and the cons here?</p><p>ENGLANDER: Well, you look at what's priced in and you look at which asset prices and asset markets have been weighed on most heavily by risk aversion, by fears of disaster. I think it's pretty clear U.S. equities have done very well through this.</p><p>But it's also clear that the main victim of the concern about the trade war was emerging markets. And I think a lot of those concerns are dissipating plus low inflation not just in the U.S., but globally means that Central Banks are in no hurry to, you know, reverse the accommodation.</p><p>GIOKOS: Okay, so what about emerging market strategies going into next year? We know that they have been the victims of global trade wars or just negative sentiment, and even though lots of money is chasing yield, a lot of people have been staying away from EMs because they are just worried about the risk profile of a lot of these countries.</p><p>ENGLANDER: Well, then -- I think that that perception of risk is dissipating and the risk return that you've been alluding to between these days and the S&amp;P or do you do you go into emerging markets where historically there's been more upside potential, but also more risk?</p><p>This year, I think that the countries that have continued to have high rates that those rates are going to be coming down and capital will flow into them.</p><p>GIOKOS: Okay, so let's talk about the elections here in the U.S. What are you guys pricing in right now putting into your economic models, a Democratic win versus Trump staying in power?</p><p>ENGLANDER: Well, let me put it this way. As far as we can tell, there's no evidence that markets are pricing in anything but a Trump win. So the risk is very skewed or you know, with respect to any kind of development that if we do get a Democrat, even the most centrist Democrat, they are advocating unwinding all or part of the tax bill. Asset markets will respond.</p><p>[15:05:14]</p><p>ENGLANDER: For us, the question is what's the best way of edging a year in advance against that kind of risk? We actually like the end on that basis.</p><p>GIOKOS: So, I know in your notes, you said if a Democrat wins the presidency, equities rates and the U.S. dollar likely to fall initially, because there would be an anticipation of economic weakness?</p><p>ENGLANDER: Indeed, and that's not only what I've written, we did a survey a couple of months ago of our client base and it is very much the view that they have.</p><p>GIOKOS: All right, Steven, thank you very much for those insights and Happy New Year to you. All the best.</p><p>ENGLANDER: And to you, too. Always a pleasure.</p><p>GIOKOS: Take care.</p><p>ENGLANDER: Thank you.</p><p>GIOKOS: All right. So Tesla shares tumbled Monday after a Cowen analyst issued a dire forecast, he predicts Tesla will miss its sales targets in the fourth quarter, and that shares could be cut in half next year. The stock is down around four percent right now.</p><p>At the same time, Tesla reached a major milestone delivering its first batch of the Model 3 made in China. The carmaker only broke ground on its Shanghai factory less than a year ago. The first customers were 15 Tesla employees, one of which seized the moment with a marriage proposal to his girlfriend.</p><p>He lifted the car's hood revealing flowers underneath before asking her to marry him, it looks like she said yes. How romantic.</p><p>All right, so we've got Ross Gerber, the CEO of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth and Investment Management joining us now. I'm not going to ask you about the proposal. Let's talk about Tesla. Okay, so really good to have you on the show, Ross.</p><p>And look, I noticed the shares are not performing well today. And I just wonder if it's because we not seeing very high volumes in the market or whether it's just people are not feeling excited about this new, you know, China production or whether it's the fact that Tesla has actually been doing quite well on the share price front for quite some time.</p><p>ROSS GERBER, CEO, GERBER KAWASAKI WEALTH AND INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT: Yes, it's the third reason. I mean, Tesla's had an amazing run in the last six months. And if you would ask me six months ago that I'd be looking at Tesla 420, I would have said, probably two percent chance. So we're super excited. And it's very normal to take little profits here, especially with the selling on the news with the first deliveries in China and the market is down anyway.</p><p>So we're looking at any opportunity for Tesla to drop to add to our position at this point.</p><p>GIOKOS: So you are buying today, is that what you're saying?</p><p>GERBER: Not today. No, I'm not buying today. I'm not doing anything today, actually, in the markets. We're going to wait until the New Year, and then we're going to start again.</p><p>GIOKOS: Yes. So tell me about how significant China production is going to be for Tesla? And I know you've actually said that this is a really good sign in terms of U.S.-China cooperation in a way.</p><p>GERBER: Oh, this is great. I mean, people just do not understand how big this is. Okay, so when China allowed Tesla to be the first U.S. factory to be wholly owned in China, they were hopefully betting that this would be the model for cooperation in the future. And that's what's happening.</p><p>With the timing of Phase 1 being signed, hopefully this month and the first deliveries, this is the best advertising that China can have to show the world that they can partner with a U.S. company, make a great product and serve the market well.</p><p>And so, you know, we think Tesla is going to just have an amazing experience in China and we're so excited.</p><p>GIOKOS: I mean, Ross, we know that if a company can tackle the Chinese markets and can tap into that consumer base, it is an incredible markets for any company and in fact, I want to take a look at Chinese rival Neo. Those shares are up more than 50 percent. The company delivered more cars in the third quarter than in the second, and total revenue rose nearly 25 percent compared to a year earlier.</p><p>So this is a really interesting company, it is up of 63 percent. Do you think Tesla is going to come up against local competitors? And how will it perform in that space?</p><p>GERBER: Well, yes, I think China has the best competitors to Tesla than any car company in Europe by far. So really the competitor to Tesla is Geely, which owns Volvo and their released this Polestar 2 car that is a really nice EV, it's a bit more expensive, but they're making very good cars.</p><p>I think Neo has issues and I'm not an investor in Neo and not planning on being, but I think the EV market in China is really exciting. What China is doing and saying, we're going to take the lead in the two biggest themes of the next decade. One is dealing with energy. So I think solar power and such and EVs and the second is 5G.</p><p>So if China is successful with their EV development power initiatives and 5G, they know they'll be a leader in the global economy in the next decade.</p><p>[15:10:06]</p><p>GIOKOS: So Ross, when you are buying into Tesla, are you buying into Elon Musk and his vision? Are you buying into the company and what it will be able to do in the next few decades? Is this a long term play for you?</p><p>GERBER: Yes, it's a long term play for us because we think the biggest risk to our society going forward is climate change, and it's just going to become the focus of every government in the world to address this so that our society exists in 50 years in the way that it exists today.</p><p>So Tesla is the only player that does all of this. So part of it is Elon Musk and I've got to give Elon credit for getting this product out and done. Nobody thought he could do it. The analysts have been so wrong about this company for so long and it's all because of the fortitude of Elon to just keep pushing through despite enormous odds against him.</p><p>So this is an incredibly exciting company and I think one of the best opportunities over the next decade.</p><p>GIOKOS: Ross, great to have you on the show. Happy New Year to you. All the best. We will speak soon.</p><p>GERBER: Thank you.</p><p>GIOKOS: Thanks. All right, so Lufthansa subsidiary, Eurowings says more than 85 percent of its flights will take place despite a Germanwings cabin crew strike.</p><p>More than 170 flights have been canceled across three days. That's Monday to Wednesday. The Workers Union wants higher pay and better benefits for staff. But Eurowings has called the strike incomprehensible.</p><p>Let's get over to London now, \"The Independent's\" travel editor, Simon Calder is there for us. Simon great to have you on the show. Firstly, what do you make of the talks breaking down over the weekend and of course the Union wanting more and the airline, you know, pushing back?</p><p>SIMON CALDER, TRAVEL EDITOR, THE INDEPENDENT: The airline is extraordinarily frustrated with the attitude of UFO which is the cabin crew union. They've been saying that actually the Union is in some state of disarray itself.</p><p>There have been various questions about some of the senior staff at the Union over the past year. But what the cabin crew union has done not just to this particular strike, which is the Germanwings unit of Eurowings, which of course is the bread budget brand of Lufthansa. They've also been taking action. There's been a number of strikes with Lufthansa itself.</p><p>And this comes at the end of the year in which we've seen also, for example, pilots of British Airways going on strike, as well as many other airlines and a threatened strike by pilots at Ryanair, the biggest budget airline in Europe.</p><p>And everything we know about strikes in the airline business is that the only beneficiaries are the other rival airlines.</p><p>GIOKOS: That's a really interesting point, Simon. I mean, at the end of the day, airlines are not as profitable as they were, say around 12 years ago. It's tough times in many ways. Competition is very high. But at the same time, the unions are saying that they want a better environment for staff. There has got to be some kind of compromise here. Are they going to find it?</p><p>CALDER: Well, ultimately they will because it is inevitable. Lufthansa and Eurowings are certainly not going out of business and like Air FranceKLM and like IAG which owns British Airways and Iberia or Spain and a number of other smaller European airlines, they are making billions of dollars collectively in profit.</p><p>The trouble is, of course, as anybody knows, the airline business and particularly working in it has become much, much tougher. So everyone from ground staff to cabin crew to pilots is having to work harder and not necessarily get any extra pay as a result.</p><p>So yes, there will be a solution found, but every day that this goes on, it sends passengers, well, an awful lot of flights canceled had been -- fairly short one. So it sends Eurowings passengers to the railways in Europe because that is a reasonable substitute and it will also send them to other airlines particularly the low cost carriers such as EasyJet and Ryanair.</p><p>GIOKOS: All right, fantastic. Thank you very much for that insight, Simon. Great to have you on the show. All the best. All right, still to come, the owner of \"Time\" magazine is not mincing his words taking aim at the social media superpower, Facebook, our interview with him up next.</p><p>And tempers flare as fires burn across Australia. In Sydney, the New Year's Eve fireworks will go ahead as planned despite outrage from residents</p><p>[15:17:21]</p><p>GIOKOS: Welcome back. Now the owner of \"Time\" magazine says the world is facing a crisis of trust, and he is pointing his finger squarely at Facebook. We will hear from him in a moment.</p><p>But first, it's been a difficult year for the social media giant. Let's take a look at some of the heats it's faced in 2019.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ZAIN ASHER, CNN INTERNATIONAL HOST: Facebook.</p><p>RICHARD QUEST, CNN INTERNATIONAL HOST, QUEST MEANS BUSINESS: Facebook.</p><p>JULIA CHATTERLEY, CNN INTERNATIONAL HOST: Facebook.</p><p>QUEST: It's time to break up big tech according to the U.S. presidential hopeful, Senator Elizabeth Warren. She wants to take a saw to Amazon, Google and Facebook.</p><p>SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN (D-MA), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Here's the problem. These giant tech companies have so much power.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Facebook, one of the Facebook cofounders, Chris Hughes is calling for the social media giant to be broken up.</p><p>ANA CABRERA, CNN HOST: Obviously, Facebook feeling a lot of heat.</p><p>DONIE O'SULLIVAN, CNN BUSINESS REPORTER: Mark Zuckerberg has published an op-ed in \"The Washington Post\" saying, lawmakers we need help. We need regulation in four main areas: Harmful content. I mean, this stuff we saw with the New Zealand attack where it was streamed live on Facebook. Election integrity. We all know about that from 2016 and the Russian disinformation efforts and privacy and data.</p><p>So that's a whole range of issues, which really I think crystallized by the Cambridge Analytica scandal.</p><p>PAUL LA MONICA, CNN BUSINESS REPORTER: Facebook, their stock is down pretty significantly today as well as Amazon.

You would have those issues, it would just be much less equipped to deal with them.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GIOKOS: Well, as we just mentioned, the owner of \"Time\" magazine has zeroed in on Facebook. Marc Benioff is calling Facebook the new cigarette and says the social media giant needs to be regulated. He spoke to our Brian Stelter earlier. Take a listen.</p><p>[15:20:08]</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MARC BENIOFF, CEO, SALESFORCE.COM: Facebook is the new cigarette for our society. It's something that badly needs to be regulated. It's something that is not good for us. It's something that the company is out for our kids, and they're certainly not exactly about truth and advertising even they have said that.</p><p>That's why we're really in squarely a crisis of trust when the core vendor themselves cannot say that trust is our most important value. Look, we're at a moment in time where each one of us at every company has to ask a question, what is our highest value? What is the most important thing to us?</p><p>And you asked why we got involved with \"Time\" magazine because that value of trust, well, that's been associated with them from the very first day of their founding.</p><p>BRIAN STELTER, CNN CHIEF MEDIA CORRESPONDENT: I know Facebook has been on a lot of scrutiny and you and others have said it should be broken up. Do you expect that to actually happen?</p><p>BENIOFF: I do. I expect a fundamental reconceptualization of what Facebook's role is in the world and what Facebook's role is in regards to the word, not just trust, but truth.</p><p>And when you have an entity that large with that much potential impact, and not fundamentally doing good things to improve the state of the world, well, then I think everyone is going to have it in its crosshairs.</p><p>And since I first kind of made that statement, which was in January 2018. At the time, I don't think people really understood what I was saying. Today, I think it's crystal clear that our fundamental role and our relationship with Facebook needs to change.</p><p>STELTER: And what about your own media consumptions? Patterns? How do you consume news media these days?</p><p>BENIOFF: Well, I consume media in a lot of different ways. And of course, one of my favorite ways to consume media is \"Time\" Magazine.</p><p>The second -- the second part of consuming media for me is, you know, I'm an avid user, actually of one of the social networks, Twitter. I know that you and I are both on there. And that's been important to me.</p><p>And then also I have subscriptions, physical and digital subscriptions. And I spend a lot of time with that every single day.</p><p>STELTER: You mentioned Twitter. If Facebook is cigarettes, is Twitter heroin? What is -- what is Twitter?</p><p>BENIOFF: Well, I think Twitter is actually quite a bit different. And I - - you know, they still -- there's no finish line when it comes to building trust. They've gone through their set of challenges.</p><p>But for sure, Facebook has been the biggest offender and as an example, you know, you can see both organizations made very different positions in regards to political advertising.</p><p>STELTER: That's true. That's a good point. So let me wrap up with, a big prediction for the next 10 years. Where will we all be in 2030? No pressure.</p><p>BENIOFF: Well, I think -- well, artificial intelligence is probably the biggest driver of change in media, and also in all of our lives. You can see that. I'm sure you, like I have a voice based ambient computing, you know, we're talking to our Alexa or Google Home or our Apple Home Pod to get some of our news, to get our entertainment, to get information.</p><p>Our software and the systems that are around us -- our phones, our cars, our homes -- they're paying attention to us. They're listening to us. And we're talking back to them. And that is going to become a huge major change in terms of media over the next 10 years because as those systems know more about you and understand what you want, if you opt into that, it is going to start to give you feedback, and you're going to start to see things that look a lot more like a scene out of the \"Minority Report\" than out of a page of \"Time\" magazine 10 years ago.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GIOKOS: Well as lawmakers call to break up Facebook, let's go to a merger.</p><p>Truist has become the sixth largest bank in the U.S. after a $28 billion combination between SunTrust and BB&amp;T. Matt Egan sat down with the CEO of Truist to talk about the name, as well as financial regulation.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>KELLY KING, CEO, TRUIST: I would be less critical today of Dodd-Frank than I might have been 10 years ago, because what we've seen is that it has generally been applied reasonably well.</p><p>And there's some really good things that came out of Dodd-Frank. For example, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. At its core, it is a really good agency. We needed that. We needed broader consumer regulation.</p><p>Coming out of Dodd Frank was a requirement that the banks do more robust capital planning. Their so-called CCAR Process has turned out to be a really healthy thing.</p><p>And so are there some things that we would like to change? Have there been a few things changed? Sure. But overall, you know, I would say that as a long term banker, I'm comfortable with the level of regulation we have. I don't particularly think we need a lot more.</p><p>[15:25:08]</p><p>KING: Because if you over regulate the banks, then you stymie the economy.</p><p>MATT EGAN, CNN BUSINESS SENIOR WRITER: Elizabeth Warren has pointed out that the Federal Reserve has not declined any of the 3,800 or so bank merger applications that it's received between 2006 and 2017. Isn't that a little alarming?</p><p>KING: The process that the regulators go through is very thorough. And what does happen oftentimes, is that as companies contemplate merging, and then they discover more about what's required to be the new institution, they realize they don't have the capacity to perform according to the regulatory requirements, and so they withdraw their application because they know they will not be approved.</p><p>And so to say that they don't approve -- reject any is a bit overstating the case. There are in fact lots and lots of lots of mergers that are proposed that get withdrawn, which is effectively or de facto, a rejection.</p><p>EGAN: Can you tell me a little bit about how you came up with the Truist name?</p><p>KING: We want a name that doesn't carry baggage. We really wanted a name that we could build on what the future looks like for Truist and that's what we got.</p><p>So the word Truist was a made up word and actually, when we did a lot of scientific research, we got exactly what we wanted, which was 91 percent of the people said, I'm just kind of neutral to that word. Perfect.</p><p>Because what we want to be able to do is build on Truist now to be what we stand for.</p><p>EGAN: But there's also been some pushback to the Truist name. There was an informal Twitter poll by American Banker that found 68 percent of users hated the name. Have you had any second thoughts?</p><p>KING: No. Because you know that's natural. People tend to think about words and names that they've always liked. But they don't think about words that were created in the last 20 to 30 years. Take Nike, Verizon, et cetera et cetera things that we love now that are household words and are all the same kind of scenario.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GIOKOS: Australian officials are warning it's too late to leave as fires as approach towns in the State of Victoria. We will have a report from the ground and an update from the World Weather Center, up next. Don't go anywhere.</p><p>[15:30:00]</p><p>GIOKOS: Hello, I'm Eleni Giokos, there's more QUEST MEANS BUSINESS in a moment. When authorities in some parts of Australia warn it's too late for residents to leave as fires rage. And a food fight. A French court is set to rule on whether the Michelin Guide must reveal why it stripped a chef of his third Michelin star. Before that, the headlines this hour.</p><p>Syria has joined Iraq in denouncing U.S. airstrikes against an Iran-backed militia group. A report in Syria's state news agency says the strikes were an act of aggression against Iraq and its people. The U.S. says the strikes in Iraq and Syria were a defensive measure after a series of rocket attacks, including one that killed a U.S. contractor on Friday.</p><p>Somalia says it conducted several airstrikes in coordination with U.S. military against Al-Shabaab. The group has claimed responsibility for a car bombing in Mogadishu on Saturday. That left at least 85 people dead and dozens wounded. Officials say Sunday's retaliatory strikes killed four members of the terror group, including a senior operative.</p><p>A British woman accused of making a false gang rape claim in Cyprus has been found guilty of public mischief. She could face up to a year in jail. She had accused 12 Israeli men of raping her, but recounted days later. Her lawyer says she was coerced into doing so and they will appeal.</p><p>The suspect in the stabbing attack at a Hanukkah celebration in New York has now been detained on federal hate crimes charges. Grafton Thomas had already pleaded not guilty to charges of attempted murder as well as burglary. His lawyer told the court that Thomas was taking medication and has issues with bipolar and schizophrenia.</p><p>Chinese state media says the scientist who helped produce the world's first gene-edited babies has been sentenced to three years in jail. The twin girls were born last year with modified DNA to make them resistant to HIV. Many other scientists condemned He Jiankui's work as monstrous as well as unethical.</p><p>All right, so, more than a 100 fires are burning across Australia despite a prolonged drought, a total ban on fires and city already sharded in smoke. Authorities say they will move ahead with Sydney's annual new year's eve fireworks. CNN's Rosemary Church has more on the story. Take a look.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ROSEMARY CHURCH, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): As the new year approaches, Australian authorities have a clear message for anyone in eastern Victoria.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: If you're holidaying in that part of the state, it's time that you left.</p><p>CHURCH: Tens of thousands of residents and vacationers in southeastern Australia are being told to evacuate as strong winds and soaring temperatures fuel massive bush fires. Across the country, extreme warnings in effect as firefighters battle dozens of blazes. The worst blaze near Sydney, where fireworks are set to be lit on new year's eve, despite a total fire ban there.</p><p>Officials say the world-famous display will ring in 2020.</p><p>SHANE FITZSIMMONS, RURAL FIRE SERVICE, NEW SOUTH WALES: Obviously, well, this is not a -- this is not a new thing, new year's eve and other events coincide with bad fire weather and total fire bans. But what we will be doing is working with local fire and rescue, the authorities, and just making sure that any perceived risk based on the conditions are ameliorated appropriately to ensure they can go ahead safely.</p><p>CHURCH: Despite assurances from officials, calls grow louder to cancel the fireworks. More than a quarter million people signed a petition to scrap the event, asking that millions of dollars usually spent on the display be redistributed to efforts like firefighting and animal care instead. But organizers say canceling would only hurt local businesses.</p><p>[15:35:00]</p><p>TANYA GOLDBERG, SYDNEY CITY COUNCIL EVENTS: Preparations for these celebrations began 15 months ago, which means that most of the budget largely used for crowd safety and cleansing measures has already been spent. So, canceling would have little practical benefit for devastated communities.</p><p>CHURCH: In some of those devastated communities, homes and businesses are left in ruins. Since September, the prolonged fires have left little respite for those fighting the destructive flames, and they're often volunteers.</p><p>SCOTT MORRISON, PRIME MINISTER, AUSTRALIA: Payments for income lost --</p><p>CHURCH: The Prime Minister says volunteers will now be compensated for their efforts in the worst-hit state of New South Wales.</p><p>STEWART TEMESVARY, VOLUNTEER FIREFIGHTER: Fifteen, 16-hour shifts in a row, you're exhausted at the end of that, and you might have one-day break and then they want you to go again. It's tough. It's tough. The payment is just a recognition of what we're doing. It doesn't compensate us for what we're losing, but it's recognition.</p><p>CHURCH: Some volunteers saying they appreciate the acknowledgement after fighting weeks of raging fires that show few signs of stopping. Rosemary Church, CNN.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GIOKOS: Tom Sater is at the World Weather Center for us. Tom, you and I have been covering these fires for the past week, especially over the Christmas holidays.</p><p>TOM SATER, METEOROLOGIST: Right --</p><p>GIOKOS: And there was a little bit of reprieve when you had a bit of moisture --</p><p>SATER: Yes --</p><p>GIOKOS: Coming through, but it's just these heat waves and the wind that is relentless. What are you seeing right now?</p><p>SATER: Yesterday, Eleni, was a bad day. It only takes one day of --</p><p>GIOKOS: Yes --</p><p>SATER: Erratic winds, that humidity drops into the single digits and everything goes haywire. This home was destroyed, but notice the one back behind it, firefighters were able to save. I mean, they have saved well over 7,000 homes, many more structures and out-buildings. Something's wrong, it's not just a fire crisis. Take a look at this, temperature anomalies.</p><p>Look at this, climate crisis, Australia, compare you to the rest of the world.</p><p>GIOKOS: Wow --</p><p>SATER: Something is not right here, and it's not going to end any time soon. Yes, it's Summer, we expect things to be dry, but we've got such a depletion in soil moisture, we do not have the rains, the monsoon rains at the top end, so they're looking at fires, but we did have a front-move through.</p><p>Notice the color of green, that is a cool change. Fires across Australia, again, we shouldn't have this, this time of year, so much up to the north. Darwin's now reporting their warmest year on record. We have records broken everywhere. In fact, yesterday every state topped at 40 degrees, even Hobart. In fact, look at the numbers from yesterday, Port Augusta, 46, the average is 31.</p><p>That's just north of Adelaide, Hobart broke a December record at 41. Since 1882, Hobart's topped 40 degrees only nine times. Let that sink in. Adelaide, 41, that's after 40 yesterday and the day before that, 40 degrees, even Cambra. This was yesterday's fire map for south Australia. This is a critical fire threat.</p><p>That's the worst it gets, and then you head in towards Victoria, where it was severe, and that's where we saw this, pyro-cumulus, where the heat from these fires is so intense, develops like a thunderstorm, not producing rain, but those towering thunder heads with some lightning. And that's the last thing you want, is more lightning.</p><p>Firefighters had their hands full east of Melbourne, again, where of course tens of thousands were evacuated. These fires were encroaching on those homes. Yesterday, Adelaide before 10:00 a.m. was at 35 degrees, so this is nice to see 17. Now, yes, we still have some heat, but now our focus is back into areas of Victoria where we're getting some rain on radar.</p><p>Got a little bit in Adelaide Hills where a week and a half ago, we lost over 100 homes, and the wine industry getting hit hard. They believe, if they're assessing it right, they may have lost a third of their vines. But we want to see returns. Now, everything is not good news. We were down to 72 active fires, and we're back up to 115 with at least 49 that are uncontained.</p><p>Here's the smoke in Sydney, offshore and well inland to the Blue Mountains. Some of the biggest fires are in northwest of Sydney and to the southwest. When you look at the air quality, this is like New Delhi in the Winter. You want to see areas of green and yellow. That's decent. We can handle that.</p><p>And there's a little bit here. Anything above 150 is considered unhealthy, and that's Cambra. But look at this, 364, these are some fires that are burning, 999, it doesn't get any higher than that. Now, off to the fire threat now for New South Wales. Most of the activity is on the south coast now, and where we have this extreme. It's not critical, but that's bad enough because the winds are going to be blowing here.</p><p>Sydney is looking at a high of 37, Cambra as well, but these low 20s, that's great news for south Australia, Adelaide over towards Melbourne. The front will continue to move through, we might have a chance of rain. The winds are going to continue to kind of come in off the shoreline, so hopefully, that smoke will disperse. Yes, the fireworks going on.</p><p>They're going to be ready for that. It will add a little more smoke to the atmosphere. But again, 37 today, we're going to watch Sydney for Friday and Saturday. Well, not just the winds pick up again, but the heat as well. Firefighters are doing an unbelievable job working these long hours.</p><p>[15:40:00]</p><p>In fact, it's been well over two months now --</p><p>GIOKOS: Yes --</p><p>SATER: That these fires have been burning across the area --</p><p>GIOKOS: Yes, stopping this kind of fire is -- just sounds almost impossible with the heat and --</p><p>SATER: Yes --</p><p>GIOKOS: The wind. And of course, we wish them all the best. Tom, thank you very much --</p><p>SATER: Yes --</p><p>GIOKOS: For that update, appreciate it, and happy holidays and happy new year to you.</p><p>SATER: You too --</p><p>GIOKOS: See you, soon. All right, the outgoing governor of the Bank of England issuing a stock warning for corporate assets. He says companies and investors need to step up planning for climate change, or else.</p><p>GIOKOS: Welcome back. You're watching QUEST MEANS BUSINESS. Now, the Bank of England's outgoing governor says finance firms must act faster to cut investment into fossil fuels. In a \"BBC\" radio interview, Mark Carney said slow progress could lead to sharp temperature increases. The results, he warns, could make certain financial assets worthless.</p><p>There is one fossil fuel, however, that's helping the energy transition -- natural gas. It may be key to reaching net zero emissions. John Defterios has more in this edition of \"THE GLOBAL ENERGY CHALLENGE\". Take a look.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JOHN DEFTERIOS, CNN EMERGING MARKETS EDITOR (voice-over): Here on the edge of the Norio(ph) Sea, the energy tides are changing. Oil and gas rigs are being decommissioned, and renewable assets are populating the energy landscape.</p><p>(on camera): But as the U.K. gears up for net zero emissions by 2050, there's also a realization that renewable production will not meet the needs of power demand, and that's why there's a role for natural gas in the energy mix.</p><p>(voice-over): Around a third of the U.K.'s electricity generation mix currently comes from gas, more than any other source. In the United States, it's even higher. By 2025, the International Energy Agency predicts the U.S. will be producing more than 1 trillion cubic meters of natural gas a year, almost double its production back in 2000, and it's continuing to rise.</p><p>(on camera): What role is a natural gas playing, whether from the offshore fields of Scotland or elsewhere in the aims of the Paris Climate Agreement?</p><p>(voice-over): It is the cleanest fossil fuel with 40 percent less CO2 emissions than coal, and 20 percent less than oil per unit of energy output.</p><p>[15:45:00]</p><p>MASSIMO DI ODOARDO, VICE PRESIDENT, GLOBAL GAS &amp; LNG, WOOD MACKENZIE: Just over the last eight years, the switching that we've seen between gas -- between coal and gas globally has accounted for about 500 million tons of reduction in CO2. And this is about 4 percent of global CO2 emission in the power sector.</p><p>DEFTERIOS: But it is a hydrocarbon, and by 2050, countries like the U.K. and Japan plan to reduce its presence.</p><p>(on camera): As natural gas begins its steady decline in this part of the world, for countries like China and India, there is recognition that natural gas can help cut emissions, vis-a-vis coal.</p><p>DI ODOARDO: Combined, India and China account for about two-thirds of all coal consumption globally. This means that if those countries can move part of this coal consumption into gas, and certainly other, you know, technology with the impact on CO2 reduction could be tremendous, and that's really what the policy needs to focus.</p><p>We think that actually China could be on track to achieve that 15 percent share of gas in the energy mix that it wants to achieve by 2030. On the other side, India has been lagging behind quite substantially.</p><p>DEFTERIOS: It may not be a permanent solution, but clearly, natural gas has a role in the energy transition. John Defterios, CNN, Aberdeen.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GIOKOS: And you'll see much more in a new CNN documentary. John Defterios takes us around the U.S. to see how the shale, oil, and gas boom has revolutionized the nation's energy policy and transformed the global landscape. It's part of our \"GLOBAL ENERGY\" series, which examines how we can transition to cleaner energy while also satisfying our demand for more power.</p><p>\"THE GLOBAL ENERGY CHALLENGE\" airs Tuesday, 6:30 a.m. in London, 2:30 p.m. in Hong Kong. All right, so, a celebrated French chef has said he no longer wants his Michelin Stars. The dispute began over a souffle that allegedly tasted like Cheddar cheese. We'll tell you what the issue is right after this.</p><p>GIOKOS: Welcome back to QUEST MEANS BUSINESS. Now, we know souffles are very important things, and this chocolate souffle, I hear, does not taste like cheese. But a souffle that allegedly tastes of Cheddar has caused a dispute between a celebrated chef and the Michelin Guide. French chef Marc Veyrat lost one of his three stars at his restaurant, Maison de Bois, and now he's taking the Michelin Guide to court.</p><p>[15:50:00]</p><p>The ruling is expected on Tuesday, while you watch Saskya Vandoome report, I'm going to dig in.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SASKYA VANDOOME, CNN CORRESPONDENT (on camera): In France, food is given a special place. In the best restaurants, it is given an almost ceremonial reverence. And for the top chefs, the ultimate measure of their success is the Michelin star. But what if far from being something to wish for, the Michelin star was more of a curse?</p><p>(voice-over): Marc Veyrat, one of France's most famous chefs has earned nine stars in all. But in January, his Maison de Bois restaurant in the alps lost its third star over a souffle that a critic said tasted of Cheddar, an affront that Mr. Veyrat has not even begun to digest.</p><p>MARC VEYRAT, CHEF: (SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE)</p><p>VANDOOME: Now, the 69-year-old is taking the Michelin guide to court. He says he no longer wants its stars and wants the Guide to clarify the reasons behind its decision. But it turns out, it's not that simple. While Michelin says Veyrat's talent is not in dispute, it insists its first duty is to inform the consumer.</p><p>GWENDAL POULLENNEC, INTERNATIONAL DIRECTOR, THE MICHELIN GUIDE: The food, especially in France, is about passion, it's about emotion. Chefs are real artists, so they're quite proud, sometimes excessive, fragile. And I think in that case, it's saying, OK, I deserve three stars because I am who I am. We have to avoid any kind of -- let's say emotional blackmail.</p><p>VANDOOME: It isn't the first time that the pressure placed on chefs by the star system has caused controversy. The 2003 suicide of the three-star chef Bernard Loiseau was linked to a system of intense gourmet critique. Several chefs have even asked for their stars to be removed, citing the psychological as well as financial pressure of maintaining their rating.</p><p>VEYRAT: (SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE)</p><p>VANDOOME: Veyrat hopes the case will force the Guide to be more transparent about how it awards stars, and more importantly, why it takes them away. Saskya Vandoome, CNN, Paris.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GIOKOS: OK, my souffle definitely not Michelin star quality, but I'm sure many of you feel like you over ate this holiday season, and I'm sure many of you are planning to sweat it out as part of your new year's resolutions, of course. And right now, CrossFit is one of the biggest fitness trains in the world. CNN's Anna Stewart has more on why people are using this sport to work up a sweat.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ANNA STEWART, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): It was in Santa Cruz, California when CrossFit first popped up on the scene almost two decades ago. Since then, it's spread, now operating in more than 15,000 gyms around the world. And setting up one of those gyms is relatively easy.</p><p>PATRICK VELLNER, PROFESSIONAL CROSSFIT ATHLETE: The accessibility is one of the major things about Crossfit that makes it so big. Is that it doesn't take much, it just takes somebody with the will and the want to do it, and you can -- you can set up a gym in a warehouse, and if you've got the interest in the public around, and you can captivate the right number of people, then off you go.</p><p>STEWART: The gyms are independently owned and operated, and that's the appeal.</p><p>NOOR GREENE, HEAD OF SANCTIONALS, CROSSFIT INC.: We require a license agreement, affiliate fee, a level one certificate course. Beyond that, it is their affiliate to run, they open when they want to open, they close when they want to close, they charge the clients whatever they want.</p><p>STEWART: CrossFit gyms or Boxes as they're called, due to their simple structure, has seen a meteoric international rise.</p><p>VELLNER: It's trying to spread roots deeper and farther, and that's sort of the best way to do it, is to allow large communities in other parts of the world to take that mantle and then spread it how they see fit.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Two, one, go!</p><p>STEWART: There are millions of CrossFit enthusiasts around the world. While most are in it for the workout, some have made it a career. Athletes can make money from sponsorships and by competing in CrossFit games and sanctionals. The Dubai CrossFit Championship awarded more prize money than any other sanctional last year, around $700,000. Athletes aren't the only ones making money, big brands are also cashing in.</p><p>[15:55:00]</p><p>BRENT FIKOWSKI, PROFESSIONAL CROSSFIT ATHLETE: I think what's really interesting about CrossFit from a business perspective, and that has made it appealing for brands is the fan base is very active. So, you go to a football game, and I think the percentage of people that have played organized football at a football game is extremely low.</p><p>You go to a CrossFit competition, it's like 90 percent, 95 percent of those people are actively pursuing recreationally that same stuff that the pros are doing.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Go!</p><p>STEWART: CrossFit's long-running success is proving to be more than a fad.</p><p>FIKOWSKI: I think every year people doubt it, and every year it's still here. I know when I first started, people said two years ago was the sweet spot. And I think that just keeps moving. So, I think it continues to grow, and I mean, I'll be here.</p><p>STEWART: It seems for now that CrossFit is on pace to keep racking up the dollars. Anna Stewart for CNN.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GIOKOS: So, after you get the body you want, and if your new year's resolution is also to find love, we have a cautionary tale. An a-list celebrity took a chance with a dating app, and it didn't go so well. The dating app Bumble blocked Sharon Stone's account, yes, Sharon Stone after users reported her account as fake, but it actually wasn't fake.</p><p>The 61-year-old \"Basic Instincts\" actress posted on Twitter, \"I went on the Bumble dating site and they closed my account. Some users reported that it couldn't possibly be me! Hey, Bumble, it's being me exclusionary? Don't shut me out of the hive.\"</p><p>Eventually, Bumble restored her account, so the company says they reached out to Stone with an apology and says, they, quote, \"hope it will be easier to find her honey.\"</p><p>Well, there are just moments left to trade on Wall Street, we'll have the final numbers and the closing bell right after this -- and we're down six- tens of a percent on the Dow.</p><p>GIOKOS: With just moments left to trade on Wall Street.

But the committee has \"reached out to virtually all those\" who have raised concerns about the bill and asked them to submit language to improve it, he said.</p><p>Tumblr Vice President and former White House deputy technology officer Andrew McLaughlin voiced concerns that the bill could damage an Internet security protocol called DNSSEC. He also argued that the bill would force Internet users to use plug-ins and other tools to visit websites of their choosing, something he said Hollywood would ultimately regret.</p><p>Weitzner danced around answering what the White House's stance is on SOPA. He stressed that copyright legislation needs to strike a balance between cracking down on intellectual property theft abroad and protecting the Internet's security.</p><p>\"I'm confident we'll all get this right. This is one of the cases where the government moving a little bit slowly is a good thing,\" Weitzner said.</p><p>The issue of ICANN's new top-level domain name system, which the Senate Commerce Committee will examine this week, also came up during the panel discussion.</p><p>Goodlatte said he was \"very concerned\" about the new system, which ICANN approved this year. The Virginia Republican said he feared it will cause \"far more problems than they will solve\" and would lead to a proliferation in \"unneeded domain names for people to protect themselves from who knows what.\"</p><p>This article first appeared on POLITICO Pro at 7:21 p.m. on December 6, 2011.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">POLTCO-69952</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">POLTCO2011</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:54DT-YK41-JDJ6-K0GK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">334576</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-12-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"468\"/><timeReceived>10:42 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright  2011  Capitol News Company, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Politico.com</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"12\" year=\"2011\"><dateText>December 6, 2011 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0009NKR</classCode><className>INTERNET CORP FOR ASSIGNED NAMES &amp;

They will surely be confounded by media policy in the post-broadcast era by looking at these two events. And they will struggle to reconcile what is claimed to be policy against what is actually practised on the ground...</p><p><br/>-<br/>Hypocrisy, contradictions, absurdity   two media conferences held earlier this year in July had it all.<br/><br/>Firstly, to London. Who s going to denounce a conference held by the UK foreign office that announces a \u00a33m fund to support global press freedom? The Media Freedom Conference was co-sponsored by friendly Canada (kudos) and keynoted by Jeremy Hunt, UK Foreign Secretary and best chance of denying a Boris Johnson a prime ministership. Everyone s favourite human rights lawyer, Amal Clooney, was the star speaker, lending it credibility and a guarantee the event would receive great media exposure.<br/><br/>This is the same Jeremy Hunt who, after the furore around the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi embassy in Istanbul, lobbied to resume the shipments of arms to that regime. Bear in mind Khashoggi was a critic of Saudi intervention in Yemen and the arms that Hunt was so eager to flog would unquestionably be used in that war.<br/><br/>&lt;!--EMBED:<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bizcommunity.com/Article/196/466/183448.html\">https://www.bizcommunity.com/Article/196/466/183448.html</url> :EMBED--&gt;<br/>Hunt is also involved in the extradition of Julian Assange, who seems to have to learn the hard way that investigative journalists are celebrated when they expose  them  but not when they expose  us . Helpfully pointing out that  we  are assisting  them  contrary to  our  stated policy may also not receive any gratitude.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, it seems that most major news outlets have dropped both the Assange arrest story and the Wikileaks expos\u00e9s.<br/><br/>To toss some drift on to the already spinning ball, news was leaked at the time of the conference that Clooney had advised Assange on how to: Leave Europe without a visa; take up residence in Ecuador; and acquire that country s citizenship. Fair enough: this was while she acted as Assange s lawyer until the run-up to the 2016 US presidential election. But Clooney apparently had no compunction about appearing alongside the man pushing to ensure Assange tastes  justice  of one form or another.<br/><br/>However, Hunt and Clooney appeared to shrug off the issue and presented a united front on stage. Hunt had banned Russia Today and some other outlets from the event and both were notably unquestioned on Assange. Clooney has a long track record of defending journalists around the world, and the current cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre Filipina journalist Maria Ressa.<br/><br/>&lt;!--EMBED:<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bizcommunity.africa/Article/410/466/133795.html\">https://www.bizcommunity.africa/Article/410/466/133795.html</url> :EMBED--&gt;<br/>Furthermore, she has also won acclaim for a measured criticism of the Australian raids on newsrooms and the Trump administration for instigating violence against journalists with its constant tirade against media outlets it deems unfavourable. She will be assembling a panel to consult with governments on reforming media law and providing protections for journalists. So how can this Lebanese-British barrister be running with the foxes while she is hounding Assange with Hunt?<br/><br/>Which brings us to Washington DC, and the Social Media summit. While summits usually signify key parties convening around mutual issues, it appears Trump chose to keep the occasion limited to conservative supporters who have built followings on the tech platforms and their concerns around censorship. So it was a small-tent affair, and will probably do nothing to stop those outside the tent   Facebook, Twitter, Google   from pissing in.<br/><br/>Today, I am directing my Administration to explore all regulatory and legislative solutions to protect the free speech rights of ALL AMERICANS. We hope to see more transparency, more accountability, and more FREEDOM! 5Etfw%#SocialMediaSummit <url normalizedValue=\"https://t.co/i6th5qtfAj\">https://t.co/i6th5qtfAj</url><br/>  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) 5Etfw%July 11, 2019<br/><br/>Big Tech is a catchall phrase that includes the highest valued companies in the world that exercise an inordinate influence in all the digital fields of privacy, enablement, monopoly, censorship and security. Excluding these behemoths from dialogue or even making a statement is a missed opportunity; instead, Facebook chooses this period to quietly release updated community standards that refuse to disallow calls to violence against whatever they decide constitute  dangerous organisations .<br/><br/>Trump arguably drives the most traffic on Twitter, not as a function of the number of his followers (61.9 million at the time of writing) but due to the exponential amplification that his every social utterance gets: retweeting, liking and reposting to start, print and broadcast coverage to finish. Newsrooms have been denuded of real journalists; Trump supplies excellent copy to fill the space. Yet Twitter secured a court ruling   in this of all weeks   that cautioned Trump that blocking users unsympathetic to him would deny them First Amendment protection.<br/><br/>Twitter and Trump are both in a toxic relationship where the sex is worth the ugly drama but one party is getting his friends to send threatening messages and the other has the cops on speed dial.<br/><br/>&lt;!--EMBED:<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bizcommunity.com/Article/196/11/142189.html\">https://www.bizcommunity.com/Article/196/11/142189.html</url> :EMBED--&gt;<br/>Two events, two governments extolling the needs for media freedom yet both acting unequivocally against journalists and media. In the selfsame week.<br/><br/>Of course, it s impossible to expect politicians to champion an unfettered press, much less decide who they will release taxpayer funds to. It s a situation ripe for abuse and the natural position of the press is to reject this. But times have changed.<br/><br/>Big Tech, meanwhile, is the press s current nemesis to a far greater extent than presidents and prime ministers: the advertising model that allowed the press to flourish is now broken for everyone but Big Tech and its vassals. In this country, and indeed nearly every other one, 90% of digital advertising revenue spend goes to a software company and industry bodies are not mobilising against it.<br/><br/>The paradoxes are instructive for South African media. Politicians need to be seen as supportive of media freedom while at the same time safeguarding their collective, but mainly personal, interests. Government s mouthpiece, the SABC, is a failure. Behind the scenes, it can influence media through the Public Investment Corporation (PIC) which still has an appetite for spending on underperforming media outlets. Yet it yearns for more, knowing that a mouthpiece requires amplification and craftsmanship to turn a blast of hot air into a resounding melody. That s where Big Tech comes in and what keeps it in the megabucks. It is the distributor and gold mine, market expert and price-giver.<br/><br/>&lt;!--EMBED:<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bizcommunity.com/Article/196/466/190375.html\">https://www.bizcommunity.com/Article/196/466/190375.html</url> :EMBED--&gt;<br/>Government still holds the most power, unaware of how best to wield it in a digital marketplace, rather like a naive prince seizing a castle but clueless how to hold it against the enemies within and without. Who will influence policy? The earlier model of ownership and the Fourth Estate is in turmoil; the prestige of owning titles that was enjoyed by the media barons is now gone. They ve become less a Blackadder, more a Baldrick.<br/><br/>Prepare for this trend of government  assistance  to the media, while it sizes up Big Tech and considers regulation against both. Know the state of play. Be like Amal Clooney who seems to exploit the paradoxes of media freedom by dancing with the prince in the castle but lowering the drawbridge when the cause is just.<br/><br/>*This article was originally published on Daily Maverick.</p><table frame=\"none\"><tgroup cols=\"1\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_1\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"632\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">-</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BIZSAM-1195647</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BIZSAM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X2R-XHK1-DY06-8005-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">376638</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1292\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Bizcommunity Publishing SA (Pty) Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Bizcommunity.com (South Africa: Marketing and Media)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"13292\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 17, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletter</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Donald Trump</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Derek Abdinor</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Amal Clooney</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Jeremy Hunt</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Media Freedom</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>media policy</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000365</classCode><className>CONFERENCES &amp;

Professor Theodore Woodward of Maryland University coined the expression when he admonished his students 'When you hear hoofbeats, think of horses not zebras.' As the zebra phenomenon illustrates, even experts tend to judge more memorable events as more likely - a bias known as availability - and to remember unusual events more clearly than more mundane ones. Uncorrected, such predispositions can lead to bad prescriptions, whether in medicine or further afield. </p><p>Woodward's rule-of-thumb came to mind as policymakers around the world reacted to the announcement of Libra, the Facebook-led digital currency that is to launch in the first half of 2020. To say that their responses[1] struck a note of caution is an understatement. Representative Maxine Waters called[2] on Facebook to halt the project. Her Senate ally Sherrod Brown warned[3] that 'we cannot allow Facebook to run a risky new cryptocurrency out of a Swiss bank account.' The international reactions were perhaps less shrill but not much warmer, with French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire openly worrying[4] that Libra might dispute states' currency monopolies. Hearings before the House Financial Services Committee, which Rep. Waters chairs, and the Senate Banking Committee, of which Sen. Brown is the Ranking Member, are due to take place on July 17 and 16, respectively. Policymakers here and elsewhere, however, appear to already have made up their minds about Libra. In so doing, I fear that the gatekeepers of the global financial system are mistaking horses for zebras: focusing on improbable risks and discounting the tangible but less headline-grabbing benefits of a global low-cost payments application such as Libra's founders envisage. Because Facebook is leading the effort and marketing Libra as a cryptocurrency, the official responses are informed more by connotation (risk, monopoly, market power, data abuses), than by any actual knowledge concerning what Libra will do. Ironically, the fears being expressed about Libra reflect the implicit belief that it may prove to be an extremely important and popular innovation. The new venture will take advantage of an existing user base among the partner organizations of easily more than three billion. Thanks to network effects[5], the prospects for Libra's further growth should it become popular at all appear great. Those potential users include tens of millions of people who do not currently hold bank accounts, but who are increasingly likely to own smartphones. To condemn Libra, simply because it appears capable of capturing a wide network of users, before it even has a chance of proving its worth would foreclose better provision of banking and payment services to millions of lower-income consumers. Are there in fact sufficient grounds for intervening to put a stop to or otherwise limit the spread of Libra? In this and a forthcoming post, I examine four types of risk that Libra skeptics have warned against: systemic risk, monopoly risk, security risk, and discrimination risk. My purpose is not to defend, which is as yet untested. I only wish to show that a close look at the alleged risks of Libra makes them appear more remote than the fears expressed by certain high-profile officials suggest. They're zebras, not horses. In today's essay I consider Libra's potential to present a systemic risk to the banking system. In the follow-up post, I will discuss the likelihood that Libra will create significant monopoly, discrimination, and national security risks.Systemic riskMark Carney, Governor of the Bank of England, has said[6] that 'Libra, if it achieves its ambitions, would be systemically important.' A cryptocurrency commentator has suggested[7] that Libra 'wants to be too big to regulate.' Matt Stoller, one of Big Tech's loudest critics, recently asked[8] in the New York Times: 'What happens if all users want to sell their Libra currency at once, causing the Libra Reserve to hold a fire sale of assets?' So fresh is the memory of the last crisis in regulators' minds, and so large looms the size of the technology giants, that many unquestioningly accept claims such as the ones cited above. But a different picture emerges if we attempt to answer Stoller's question by reference to what we know so far about Libra. For every unit of Libra that it issues, the Libra Association[9] will hold a combination of bank deposits and 'short-term government securities in currencies from stable and reputable central banks.' These assets will form the Libra Reserve[10], which by its promise of redemption will, Libra's backers hope, lend the digital currency credibility and thus stability of purchasing power. My colleague Larry White recently explained[11] the Libra white paper's ambiguity regarding the convertibility of Libra into the Reserve's component assets. He concludes that Libra will resemble a government-bond money-market fund, which is liquid and relatively stable (and often treated by holders and regulators as a cash equivalent[12]) but whose net asset value does fluctuate. Despite being backed by various national currencies, relative to the value of any one national currency (whether or not that currency forms part of the Libra Reserve), Libra's exchange rate will be free-floating rather than fixed. That fact may hinder adoption[13], because users may be wary of holding an unstable medium of exchange. But it also casts doubt on the claim that Libra poses systemic concerns. Would a simultaneous decision by users to sell their Libra holdings pose a systemic risk? Larry, in his piece, suggests not. Systemic problems in banking typically arise when people realize the bank has less in liquid assets than in demandable liabilities such as deposits. Every depositor then has reason to rush to cash out before others have done so. The bank has promised to satisfy all depositor claims one-for-one, and it does so until the money runs out. Hence the incentive to 'run' on the bank. As Larry explains, such an incentive is absent in the case of a mutual fund such as the Libra Reserve, because any loss in net asset value is proportionately distributed among Libra holders, whether they cash out soon after the depreciation or not. Libra holders will therefore lack any incentive to 'run' on the Libra Reserve. Given that a drop in Libra's value, however large, would be unlikely to cause a massive redemption by Libra holders, could a large-scale redemption (whatever the reason for it) endanger financial stability anyway? After all, users' exchanging Libras for cash would mean banks' having to pay out on the deposits that formed part of the Libra Reserve. It would also mean proportionate declines in the price of the government securities included in the Reserve, if the new supply was not met by offsetting demand. I believe a rapid and massive sell-off of Libra could not, on its own, set off a systemic crisis. Consider a scenario in which there is $100,000,000 worth of Libras in circulation, of which holders in the U.S. suddenly wish to exchange $20,000,000 worth for U.S. dollars. Assume that 10 percent of the Libra Reserve is made up of bank deposits denominated in U.S. dollars, euros, yen, and pound sterling; and that the remaining 90 percent consists of (comparably) safe bonds issued by rich-country governments.[1][14] The specific share of each currency and country bond matters little for our purposes. The $20,000,000 redemption would cause the Libra Association to shrink its Libra Reserve by 20 percent, selling Libra's component assets (presumably) in proportion to their share in the Reserve (and not in proportion to the currencies into which holders wanted to exchange it). So, as holders sought to sell Libra, the authorized resellers managing the Reserve would sell deposits and bonds in equal proportion for every unit of Libra that was redeemed. Could that process cause a liquidity crisis among the banks who held Libra Reserve deposits? Further, could that liquidity crunch turn into a full-fledged solvency crisis if the Libra redemption was large and fast enough? There are reasons to think either of those crises unlikely. First, deposits will not be held by one bank in one country but by many banks in many countries. They would thus form a small liability on any individual bank's balance sheet. Second, Libra users are unlikely to hold the redeemed amount in cash and will instead re-deposit it at a bank, statistically returning a significant proportion of deposits to the banks affected.[2][15] Because banks, unlike what Libra has promised to do, keep only a fraction of their deposits in reserves, it may well be the case that the total amount of bank deposits grows following a large Libra redemption. Third, bank deposits are typically government-insured up to very generous limits - $250,000 in the United States. While deposit insurance presents moral hazard and there is evidence[16] that more generous insurance schemes encourage[17] greater risk-taking, for our purposes deposit insurance would largely eliminate the incentive by both Libra holders and non-holders to run on their banks following a large-scale Libra redemption. Fourth, bankers who were asked to pay out on Libra Reserve-related deposits would have ample access to short-term emergency liquidity from their central banks. As in other instances when they act as lenders of last resort, central banks would run the risk of mistaking insolvent for illiquid institutions. But that distinction would not depend on Libra. Rather, it would depend on individual banks' (and the financial regulators') prudential management. Unless banks had solvency problems of their own, a mass Libra deposit redemption would not cause a systemic crisis. What about the redemption's impact on bond markets? Could Libra holders rushing to cash out cause a sovereign debt crisis? Again, it is doubtful that they could, absent other reasons to 'run' on a country's bonds. According to the Libra Association's white paper, the Libra Reserve will consist of a diversified portfolio of historically (relatively) stable bonds. When Libra holders redeem, the capital outflow will not be concentrated on one country's bonds. Rather, Libra will sell government securities from a number of jurisdictions in proportion to their share in the Reserve. Moreover, it is unclear that there would be an outflow at all, since the jurisdictions whose securities are likely to be chosen also serve as safe havens for investors in times of uncertainty. As with bank deposits, the very issuers of the bonds affected by a large Libra redemption would probably see those funds return as direct bond purchases. In other words, a massive redemption caused by factors unique to Libra would not seem enough to cause a wider systemic crisis. Things might turn out differently if the Libra Association went back on its commitment to purchase stable assets on a one-for-one basis for every unit of Libra it issued. However, the prospect of a rapid loss of confidence in Libra as a result of such a turnabout, and the potential for customer lawsuits, provide strong disincentives against the Libra Association's reneging on its promise of full backing. Still, given the commitments that the Libra Association has made so far, the grounds for expecting Libra to present a new systemic risk are lacking.[1][18] I assume the share of bonds in the Reserve to be much greater than that of bank deposits, because deposits typically pay lower interest rates, resulting in an opportunity cost for the Libra Association. [2][19] I assume, I hope realistically, that the Libra Association will hold deposits at large and reputable banks across jurisdictions with comparably stable and reliable financial markets. These are the same institutions at which Libra holders who cashed out would bank. [I suspect they might prefer to keep deposits at TBTF banks.] [Cross-posted from Alt-M.org[20]] [ 1]: <url

To condemn Libra, simply because it appears capable of capturing a wide network of users, before it even has a chance of proving its worth would foreclose better provision of banking and payment services to millions of lower-income consumers.</p><p>Are there in fact sufficient grounds for intervening to put a stop to or otherwise limit the spread of Libra? In this and a forthcoming post, I examine four types of risk that Libra skeptics have warned against: systemic risk, monopoly risk, security risk, and discrimination risk. My purpose is not to defend, which is as yet untested. I only wish to show that a close look at the alleged risks of Libra makes them appear more remote than the fears expressed by certain high-profile officials suggest. They're zebras, not horses.</p><p>In today's essay I consider Libra's potential to present a systemic risk to the banking system. In the follow-up post, I will discuss the likelihood that Libra will create significant monopoly, discrimination, and national security risks.</p><p>Systemic risk</p><p>Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of England, has said that \"Libra, if it achieves its ambitions, would be systemically important.\" A cryptocurrency commentator has suggested that Libra \"wants to be too big to regulate.\" Matt Stoller, one of Big Tech's loudest critics, recently asked in the New York Times: \"What happens if all users want to sell their Libra currency at once, causing the Libra Reserve to hold a fire sale of assets?\"</p><p>So fresh is the memory of the last crisis in regulators' minds, and so large looms the size of the technology giants, that many unquestioningly accept claims such as the ones cited above. But a different picture emerges if we attempt to answer Stoller's question by reference to what we know so far about Libra.</p><p>For every unit of Libra that it issues, the Libra Association will hold a combination of bank deposits and \"short-term government securities in currencies from stable and reputable central banks.\" These assets will form the Libra Reserve, which by its promise of redemption will, Libra's backers hope, lend the digital currency credibility and thus stability of purchasing power.</p><p>My colleague Larry White recently explained the Libra white paper's ambiguity regarding the convertibility of Libra into the Reserve's component assets. He concludes that Libra will resemble a government-bond money-market fund, which is liquid and relatively stable (and often treated by holders and regulators as a cash equivalent) but whose net asset value does fluctuate.</p><p>Despite being backed by various national currencies, relative to the value of any one national currency (whether or not that currency forms part of the Libra Reserve), Libra's exchange rate will be free-floating rather than fixed. That fact may hinder adoption, because users may be wary of holding an unstable medium of exchange. But it also casts doubt on the claim that Libra poses systemic concerns. Would a simultaneous decision by users to sell their Libra holdings pose a systemic risk?</p><p>Larry, in his piece, suggests not. Systemic problems in banking typically arise when people realize the bank has less in liquid assets than in demandable liabilities such as deposits. Every depositor then has reason to rush to cash out before others have done so. The bank has promised to satisfy all depositor claims one-for-one, and it does so until the money runs out. Hence the incentive to \"run\" on the bank.</p><p>As Larry explains, such an incentive is absent in the case of a mutual fund such as the Libra Reserve, because any loss in net asset value is proportionately distributed among Libra holders, whether they cash out soon after the depreciation or not. Libra holders will therefore lack any incentive to \"run\" on the Libra Reserve.</p><p>Given that a drop in Libra's value, however large, would be unlikely to cause a massive redemption by Libra holders, could a large-scale redemption (whatever the reason for it) endanger financial stability anyway? After all, users' exchanging Libras for cash would mean banks' having to pay out on the deposits that formed part of the Libra Reserve. It would also mean proportionate declines in the price of the government securities included in the Reserve, if the new supply was not met by offsetting demand.</p><p>I believe a rapid and massive sell-off of Libra could not, on its own, set off a systemic crisis. Consider a scenario in which there is $100,000,000 worth of Libras in circulation, of which holders in the U.S. suddenly wish to exchange $20,000,000 worth for U.S. dollars. Assume that 10 percent of the Libra Reserve is made up of bank deposits denominated in U.S. dollars, euros, yen, and pound sterling; and that the remaining 90 percent consists of (comparably) safe bonds issued by rich-country governments.[1] The specific share of each currency and country bond matters little for our purposes.</p><p>The $20,000,000 redemption would cause the Libra Association to shrink its Libra Reserve by 20 percent, selling Libra's component assets (presumably) in proportion to their share in the Reserve (and not in proportion to the currencies into which holders wanted to exchange it). So, as holders sought to sell Libra, the authorized resellers managing the Reserve would sell deposits and bonds in equal proportion for every unit of Libra that was redeemed.</p><p>Could that process cause a liquidity crisis among the banks who held Libra Reserve deposits? Further, could that liquidity crunch turn into a full-fledged solvency crisis if the Libra redemption was large and fast enough? There are reasons to think either of those crises unlikely. First, deposits will not be held by one bank in one country but by many banks in many countries. They would thus form a small liability on any individual bank's balance sheet. Second, Libra users are unlikely to hold the redeemed amount in cash and will instead re-deposit it at a bank, statistically returning a significant proportion of deposits to the banks affected.[2] Because banks, unlike what Libra has promised to do, keep only a fraction of their deposits in reserves, it may well be the case that the total amount of bank deposits grows following a large Libra redemption.</p><p>Third, bank deposits are typically government-insured up to very generous limits $250,000 in the United States. While deposit insurance presents moral hazard and there is evidence that more generous insurance schemes encourage greater risk-taking, for our purposes deposit insurance would largely eliminate the incentive by both Libra holders and non-holders to run on their banks following a large-scale Libra redemption.</p><p>Fourth, bankers who were asked to pay out on Libra Reserve-related deposits would have ample access to short-term emergency liquidity from their central banks. As in other instances when they act as lenders of last resort, central banks would run the risk of mistaking insolvent for illiquid institutions. But that distinction would not depend on Libra. Rather, it would depend on individual banks' (and the financial regulators') prudential management. Unless banks had solvency problems of their own, a mass Libra deposit redemption would not cause a systemic crisis.</p><p>What about the redemption's impact on bond markets? Could Libra holders rushing to cash out cause a sovereign debt crisis? Again, it is doubtful that they could, absent other reasons to \"run\" on a country's bonds.</p><p>According to the Libra Association's white paper, the Libra Reserve will consist of a diversified portfolio of historically (relatively) stable bonds. When Libra holders redeem, the capital outflow will not be concentrated on one country's bonds. Rather, Libra will sell government securities from a number of jurisdictions in proportion to their share in the Reserve. Moreover, it is unclear that there would be an outflow at all, since the jurisdictions whose securities are likely to be chosen also serve as safe havens for investors in times of uncertainty. As with bank deposits, the very issuers of the bonds affected by a large Libra redemption would probably see those funds return as direct bond purchases.</p><p>In other words, a massive redemption caused by factors unique to Libra would not seem enough to cause a wider systemic crisis. Things might turn out differently if the Libra Association went back on its commitment to purchase stable assets on a one-for-one basis for every unit of Libra it issued. However, the prospect of a rapid loss of confidence in Libra as a result of such a turnabout, and the potential for customer lawsuits, provide strong disincentives against the Libra Association's reneging on its promise of full backing. Still, given the commitments that the Libra Association has made so far, the grounds for expecting Libra to present a new systemic risk are lacking.</p><p>[1] I assume the share of bonds in the Reserve to be much greater than that of bank deposits, because deposits typically pay lower interest rates, resulting in an opportunity cost for the Libra Association.</p><p>[2] I assume, I hope realistically, that the Libra Association will hold deposits at large and reputable banks across jurisdictions with comparably stable and reliable financial markets. These are the same institutions at which Libra holders who cashed out would bank. [I suspect they might prefer to keep deposits at TBTF banks.]</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1123060304</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WJF-2TY1-JCBF-S0MF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2010\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 11, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Trump told Bill O'Reilly last night that the senator hasn't done anything for war veterans.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p><person><nameText>DONALD TRUMP, </nameText></person>CHAIRMAN &amp; PRESIDENT, THE TRUMP ORGANIZATIONS &amp; FOUNDER, TRUMP ENTERTAINMENT RESORTS: He's supposed to be doing it, and I see him on television all the time and he is always talking, but nothing gets done.</p><p>These veterans are living in hell, Bill, they're hurting and they're crying.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SMITH: Verizon reporting second quarter earnings last hour, earnings per share, a $1.04, that topped Wall Street estimate.</p><p>Apple reporting after the close today, the \"Wall Street Journal\" says the iPhone accounts for nearly 70 percent of Apple's sales and remains the company's most profitable product.</p><p>Qualcomm which supplies many of the chips for the iPhone, looking at the possibility of a breakup.</p><p>The journal says the company will review its options after an activist investor pushed for change at the chip maker.</p><p>Zach Johnson, and he is your 2015 British Open champ.

But according to a new \"Washington Post-Abc News\" poll, he still holds 24 percent of Republican support.</p><p>The largest lead recorded by any GOP candidate this year, although this number is strong, it must be noted that the poll was finalized before coverage of his comments about Senator McCain went widespread.</p><p>But the headlines don't stop there, \"The Des Moines Register\", Iowa's largest newspaper is now calling on Trump to drop out of the 2016 race, saying \"Trump should pull the plug on his bloviating sideshow.\"</p><p>Mike, some pretty strong words from the key primary state newspaper --</p><p>MIKE MURPHY, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, ROSECLIFF CAPITAL: Absolutely --</p><p>SMITH: This morning --</p><p>MURPHY: Yes, and you know, we talked about a month ago, saying that I didn't believe that Trump would really be a true contender in this race.</p><p>But now fast forward roughly 30 days, he is leading by far in the polls, and I think the longer he stays there -- he released his financials.</p><p>And one thing about him, he is way better than anyone else in the race in getting publicity and getting himself on Bill O'Reilly's show and getting a big following on Twitter.</p><p>So, I think the longer Trump stays in this race, the worse it is for the Governor Walkers and the Governor Bushs in the race.</p><p>SMITH: But I mean, all the other Republican candidates are having to answer, Dagen, as we just -- we did it to Governor Pataki, you know, they're having to respond to all the things that <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>is saying right now including his criticism of Senator McCain.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS: Right, the new \"New Yorker\" cover portrays him as -- this is even before him attacking John McCain as doing a giant belly-flop in the swimming pool and all other Republican candidates have been as you've been sent to the sides of the poll.</p><p>But he's gotten down the nasty name-calling that's completely unnecessary. And if you think that, that's not -- it will be shocking and breath-taking if that does not hurt him in the polls.</p><p>And now -- but now, he's given -- he is given -- maybe the GOP contenders are worried about him, but now he's given them a reason to turn on him.</p><p>And he's got to cut -- but he's got to get down to the issues and cut back on -- I mean, he's going after John McCain and all prisoners of war and then refuses to apologize.</p><p>I mean people are at the point of getting sick of him, I mean, you look at what did \"The Des Moines Register\" called him? A feckless blowhard, a distraction with traction.</p><p>And he has problems in terms of their Christian base as well, when he talks about his faith, it doesn't resonate with some GOP primary voters.</p><p>MURPHY: Agreed, but I mean, who would have thought that he would be in this position today. You know, he's really in a position to disrupt and if he is pushed aside by the Republican Party --</p><p>MCDOWELL: He will run as a third party candidate --</p><p>SMITH: Yes, but --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>Still <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>has taken -- and then I go back to -- these have to be calculated statements. He has been planning on running for president for quite some time, he is pouring money into this machine, OK?</p><p><person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>does not plan from the -- so, you, when you look at the comments he makes about John McCain, those words don't leave your mouth without knowing the repercussion --</p><p>MCDOWELL: So, he --</p><p>SMITH: OK? --</p><p>MCDOWELL: Always make it a joke probably, like I like people who weren't captured, he thinks he's funny. And --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SMITH: And you know what they did draw -- if it was truly a mistake, you don't think he's willing --</p><p>MCDOWELL: No --</p><p>SMITH: To look back and say --</p><p>MCDOWELL: Absolutely not --</p><p>SMITH: Across --</p><p>MCDOWELL: He --</p><p>SMITH: Poorly --</p><p>MCDOWELL: Does not -- he does -- well, he's doing it in his own way --</p><p>SMITH: Because he's turned it --</p><p>MCDOWELL: Because he --</p><p>SMITH: Into a fight for the veterans and for the VA and the --</p><p>MURPHY: Right --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL: The \"Ap\" did a fact check on that by the way, and a lot of what he was saying and accusing McCain of doing -- saying not -- he hasn't been an advocate for veterans is absolutely untrue.</p><p>In terms of trying to reform the VA, <person><nameText>Senator John McCain </nameText></person>was -- worked tirelessly to try and turn the VA around, given the horrible state of healthcare for our veterans --</p><p>SMITH: But <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>is --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>Turning this into a message that he can do more and saying, \"that he's done nothing to help the vets, referring to Senator McCain, he said I will tell you they are living in hell.</p><p>He says he's going to do more for veterans --</p><p>MCDOWELL: But he didn't serve! --</p><p>SMITH: And everybody else --</p><p>MCDOWELL: He got military deferments, he didn't serve in Vietnam and then attacks prisoners of war.</p><p>SMITH: I'm just --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL: Attacking John McCain --</p><p>SMITH: Saying there got to be a calculated purpose for these kind of statements, I don't think that they're just --</p><p>MCDOWELL: Or --</p><p>SMITH: Flew out of his mouth --</p><p>MCDOWELL: Or he didn't --</p><p>SMITH: He got --</p><p>MCDOWELL: Have control over his own mouth?</p><p>MURPHY: I think it's more of that, I think his calculations are to just mix there up as much controversy as possible, and then if you saw last night with Bill O'Reilly, if he had just simply -- we've all made mistakes.</p><p>Simply apologize, I made a mistake and moved on --</p><p>SMITH: Yes --</p><p>MURPHY: It would have been much better for him.</p><p>SMITH: Right, and he said if there was a mistake, he would admit to it, but he didn't do that last night.</p><p>MCDOWELL: What mistake has he admitted to?</p><p>SMITH: Yes --</p><p>MCDOWELL: What mistake?</p><p>SMITH: No, not really any. All right, ISIS on the rise across the Turkish region, a suicide bombing of the border -- on the border, I should say, of Syria, claiming the lives of 31 people yesterday.</p><p>Joining us now is Gillian Turner, Fox Newscontributor and former White House National Security Council member. Gillian, good morning --</p><p>GILLIAN TURNER, FORMER MEMBER, WHITE HOUSE NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL: Good morning --</p><p>SMITH: Thank you for being here this morning. What do you make of the latest on this attack in Turkey?</p><p>TURNER: Well, in order to understand the significance of this attack, you really have to understand the strategic symbolism that the town of Kobani has in the broader fight against ISIS.</p><p>This attack was against a rally to rebuild the town of Kobani which was really decimated over four-month long period of the battle between Syrian Kurds and ISIS fighters last year.</p><p>For a long time, this town was the last stronghold of the U.S.-led coalition on the border region between Turkey and Syria. So, it's a lot of symbolism here.</p><p>SMITH: And we were talking to K.T. McFarland last hour, sort of references it as a game changer now that we've had this happen in Turkey.</p><p>TURNER: Absolutely, that's exactly right. The border region between the two countries eight months ago was entirely controlled by ISIS.</p><p>It's now -- its presence there has been gradually reduced in the last eight months, which is one of the only good news stories to come out of the U.S. fight against ISIS, because as we know, they're really on the rise in the region.</p><p>SMITH: And as far as the fight with ISIS continues, it's -- you don't have to look far to see a headline that ISIS continues to gain strength and power and money.</p><p>Where do you see the overall fight right now as far as combating ISIS as they do continue to gain power and quite frankly continue to gain territory?</p><p>TURNER: Well, they're on the rise across Iraq and Syria in spite of some now five thousand airstrikes led by the United States against them.</p><p>They can currently control a majority of Syria as well as large sways of Iraq, including Mosul which they've now held for over a year.</p><p>As you mentioned, they've got hundreds of millions of dollars in the bank, tens of thousands of recruits and you know, just a couple of weeks ago, celebrated their one-year anniversary.</p><p>MURPHY: So, Gillian, in that one year, you know, they've gone from really something in after-thought, something that no one really knew about to really taking all the headlines away from al Qaeda.</p><p>And they're really the main terrorist organization out there right now. It seems like you talk about five thousand airstrikes, but it's just not enough.</p><p>What we're doing -- if it's not stopping them, it's not slowing them down, it's not hurting them.</p><p>And the longer they exist, the more powerful they get just as a fact. So, what do we do? How do -- is it just putting more troops on the ground, is that the simple answer? How do we stop them?</p><p>TURNER: There isn't a simply answer as much as we would all like there to be one, I don't think it's as easier as saying boots on the ground, no boots on the ground, diplomacy, no diplomacy.</p><p>What we really have to fight here in addition to the security situation is the powerful hold that radical Islamic ideology has really had across the region.</p><p>It's now expanding across the globe, ISIS recruits are increasing in multiples at this point, you know, when they started a year ago, not very many.</p><p>Now we have reports of up to thirty thousand actively fighting recruits, plus up to a hundred thousand more in the kind of close-hold pool.</p><p>So, this is an organization that's really increasing exponentially, so the sooner we come up with a really good plan, the better.</p><p>SMITH: All right, Gillian Turner on the latest deadly attack in Turkey, thank you.</p><p>TURNER: Thanks.</p><p>SMITH: All right, coming up, gold prices continue to fall after plunging to their lowest level in five years on rate-hike fears.</p><p>And take a look at some of the other big headlines that we're watching for you on the \"Wall Street Journal\" this morning.</p><p>Fed tells big banks to shrink, Toshiba CEO fouled by accounting scandal, Chattanooga shooting and the highlight online gun sales.</p><p>And we're also watching for you this morning, a lot of other breaking news and headlines, keep it right there on Fox Business.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>SMITH: All right, gold prices edging lower this morning after plunging to their lowest level in five years on rate hike fears. Phil Flynn is watching this selloff and following every move of the CME Group in Chicago.</p><p>Phil, it looks like it's holding a $1,100 an ounce right now, but broadly - -</p><p>PHIL FLYNN, CHICAGO MERCANTILE EXCHANGE GROUP: Yes --</p><p>SMITH: Speaking, what is the selloff in gold or commodities in general, what is it telling us?</p><p>FLYNN: I think that's what the market is trying to decide right now. You know, we're starting to call at the midnight massacre of gold.</p><p>And we saw that huge $2.5 billion sell order come in the middle of the night, driving down gold, raising bigger questions about the global economy.</p><p>I think the sell-off in gold because it came along with a lot of the other industrial metals with the oil, price of oil that they could be raising.</p><p>It could be like the canary in the coal mine raising larger concerns about the global economy and economic growth. And now the market is trying to stabilize to see if those fears are justified or overplayed.</p><p>FLYNN: Yes, and when you look at the selloff happening and commodities across the globe, you wonder what a big influence is U.S. dollar situation is going to be.</p><p>We were just talking about real estate, Phil, I mean, you've got a stronger U.S. dollar, all that foreign investment, where does it go?</p><p>FLYNN: Well, a lot of that is, of course, obviously has been coming to the United States and we've seen that over the last couple of years.</p><p>We've seen a lot of Chinese money, throwing money into the United States, trying to get away from the Chinese stock market.</p><p>Obviously, as those interest rates start to go up and the stronger dollar goes up, that could slow a little bit. So obviously, that's a concern with the marketplace right now.</p><p>But I think if you look at what we're seeing throughout a lot of the commodity complex, you know actually, commodities last quarter were doing pretty good.</p><p>I mean look at oil demand for example, you know, we saw oil demand in the first half of the year rise by 1.6 million barrels. That's like twice as fast that we've seen over the last four years.</p><p>So, there are a lot of signs that the stimulus and other parts of the globe was actually starting to stimulate demand for --</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes --</p><p>FLYNN: Its commodities --</p><p>MCDOWELL: And --</p><p>FLYNN: But everything changed after Greece and China and after Sunday night.</p><p>SMITH: And the bold calls, Mike, are already out there for gold did not only sell off below a $1,000 an ounce, but saw 800, 600 bucks this morning.</p><p>I mean, where is it -- where is it going --</p><p>MURPHY: Yes --</p><p>SMITH: From here?</p><p>MURPHY: A lot of people are piling on gold right now, but you talk about support of 1,100, I think 1,000 is going to be the key level.</p><p>And if it will go down, I think in test 1,000 as it breaks through that, it could go down to the 950, to the 900 level.</p><p>But I think it's not just gold, it's the entire commodity space that's getting hit because we're seeing a lot of the global fears of the Greece and the China dissipating.</p><p>But the growth, the global growth isn't very strong, so a lot of --</p><p>SMITH: Yes --</p><p>MURPHY: People calling on less demand out there --</p><p>MCDOWELL: Maybe if you don't bet on gold, if you're betting on growth, I mean worry about down draft in copper or oil which has economic uses.</p><p>MURPHY: Great point.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But with gold, just remember if you're buying gold -- like tradeable gold, you're betting against Goldman Sachs, you're not smarter than Goldman Sachs, you're on the wrong side of a trade --</p><p>MURPHY: But I think --</p><p>MCDOWELL: It is a zero-sum game.</p><p>MURPHY: I think people realize now that there's not too many -- why would you buy gold? Right now what's --</p><p>SMITH: Right --</p><p>MURPHY: The point to go out --</p><p>MCDOWELL: And by the way --</p><p>MURPHY: And invest in gold? --</p><p>MCDOWELL: He did 2011, this down draft started in 2011 five years ago, it just continues now.</p><p>SMITH: Right, if you're a contrarian on the U.S. dollar, you might buy gold.</p><p>MURPHY: You might --</p><p>SMITH: I'm just saying --</p><p>MURPHY: But I think there's a lot of other ways to play it rather than --</p><p>MCDOWELL: You're contrarian --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>On the U.S. dollar, you buy other currencies, you buy bonds, denominated in other currencies, right?</p><p>SMITH: All right, so, Flynn, I'll let you answer that question, then we have to go --</p><p>FLYNN: Yes, well, bottom line is, you know, if you started to buy gold in 1999 when we had this commodity crash, it returned better than the stock market in nominal terms, up until a couple of years ago.</p><p>And yes, we've had a major correction in gold. But I wouldn't throw, you know, gold totally out of your investment portfolio. You want to buy when there's blood in the streets, there's blood in the streets in the gold market.</p><p>Probably time to add some to your commodity portfolio.</p><p>SMITH: All right, so Flynn, thank you. Coming up, well, conservative anchor comments towards President Obama's efforts to fight terrorism going viral. We'll have the video next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>SMITH: Investigators are learning more about the Muslim man who killed five American servicemen in Tennessee, Cheryl Casone is here with the headlines there. Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS: Hey, good morning, Sandra. Well, the gunman behind the Chattanooga terror attack reportedly wrote about becoming a martyr.</p><p>Reports say that Muhammad Abdulazeez also wrote about committing suicide after he lost a job two years ago because of drug abuse.</p><p>The 24-year-old opened fire at two military facilities on Thursday, killing four Marines and a sailor before he was killed by police. And one news anchor's rant about President Obama's reaction to the tragedy has gone viral.</p><p>Twenty two-year-old Tomi Lahren from \"One America News Network\" has become an internet sensation, blasting what she called the President's half-baked ISIS policy. Take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TOMI LAHREN, ONE AMERICA NEWS NETWORK: President Obama, if you won't say it, I will. Radical Islam, this is not workplace violence, this is not a criminal act with motives unknown, this is terrorism?</p><p>I'm sorry but radical Islam is becoming the rule, not the exception. Our commander-in-chief is more concerned with Muslim sensitivity than the honor and sacrifice made by these Marines.</p><p>Be a leader, someone.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE: OK, let's be clear, she's 22 years old, guys, she's 22 years old, she is from South Dakota, she's raised in a conservative family, a Marine family we should be clear.</p><p>And as just was very fired up, she was very personal, she's now all over the place including -- she was on \"FOX &amp; FRIENDS\" about an hour ago and she sticks by everything that she said in those videos --</p><p>SMITH: But looks like a --</p><p>CASONE: She's very --</p><p>SMITH: Drop mic moment for Cheryl, I'm looking at the YouTube clip right now, Dagen, Mike, 1.6 --</p><p>MURPHY: Yes --</p><p>SMITH: Million views and counting.</p><p>MURPHY: Rightfully so, I mean, she's --</p><p>SMITH: Striking a cord?</p><p>MURPHY: Yes, she is --</p><p>CASONE: Yes --</p><p>MURPHY: She was spot-on, and you know, she doesn't look like the typical person who would say that, she is young, she may be -- speaks to a different -- sorry, I take that back.</p><p>MCDOWELL: When you say --</p><p>CASONE: Yes --</p><p>MCDOWELL: What?</p><p>MURPHY: Big towards in a big --</p><p>MCDOWELL: And who will burn that saying --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MURPHY: Speaks to a different generation possibly, but I think she was spot-on with all of her points, so it does -- the more people who view this clip, the better I think.</p><p>CASONE: She's got like 800,000 clips as of like midnight, I mean so by now it's what? 8:25 Eastern, she's got more than that.</p><p>So, and she -- you know the thing about her too is that, she's coming out and saying, you know, she also could and defend, so that we talked about yesterday where, you know, that these guard members should have protection.</p><p>They should be armed as well as talking about the issues with regards to ISIS. And that the president has -- as she -- well, she said it better than I did. Failed her and all of us.</p><p>SMITH: I should -- and you know -- and you can't speak that stuff, I mean, she was actually very passionate, Dagen, you may disagree, I don't know, but --</p><p>MCDOWELL: No --</p><p>SMITH: She was very passionate about it and it came across and I think that's why --</p><p>MCDOWELL: That would resonate with people --</p><p>CASONE: Yes --</p><p>MCDOWELL: In general. Whether you're talking about internet clips, whether you're talking about television or any kind of video is -- if it's comes from the heart and you mean it, and you speak your truth, and you're authentic, then people connect with that.</p><p>SMITH: And Mike will be leaving now. Yes, all right, thank you Cheryl Casone --</p><p>CASONE: Thank you --</p><p>SMITH: All right, Chicago now home to the nation's highest sales tax, so we'll tell you how much it costs to shop in the Windy City and what the locals have to say about that, I may chime in my hometown, that's coming up next.</p><p>CASONE: No!</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>SMITH: All right, don't let us catch you calling Chicago the second city anymore especially when it comes to sales taxes. And their all new you make it, they take it report.</p><p>Jeff Flock is in the Windy City asking shoppers what they think about the city's new number one ranking. Jeff, I always tell New Yorkers they got it wrong when it comes to Chicago.</p><p>It's the second city because it burned down the first time in the great Chicago fire and they had to rebuild it. New Yorkers always think that it's second to New York, false.</p><p>JEFF FLOCK, FOX BUSINESS: I agree with you a 100 percent, this is the rejuvenation of Chicago. But as it's getting expensive to live here, maybe you're lucky here in New York at this point.</p><p>You know where I am, don't you? Looks familiar, if it does, Oak Street in Chicago. Take a look at the numbers now, the Cook County board having passed an additional percentage of tax, sales tax, give Chicago the number one or at least it will on January 1st to 2016.</p><p>Ten-point-two-five percent sales tax, worse than New York or maybe we should say, higher than New York, better than New York, better than L.A., better than Milwaukee.</p><p>It's not the city itself that passed the increase, it was Cook County. If you take a look at the break down, there's a state sales tax, then there is the county sales tax which went up an additional percent and then of course the city itself has 2.25 percent sales tax as well.</p><p>What does this mean for this city? Well, it means that actually some more money is going to go into the pension coffers. That's the reason the county passed the sales tax increase. They're trying to get their credit rating improved. But I'll tell you, if you take a look at the credit ratings of cities around the country, it is Chicago Detroit that are still in junk status. Other places like Seattle, Dallas, Denver, those guys are doing fine, but not so much here Sandra.</p><p>SMITH: Unbelievable. Well, that's what happens when you're cities bankrupt, okay? Yes, Raise taxes. Jeff Fox, thank you.</p><p>FOX: Hard to believe.</p><p>SMITH: Alright.</p><p>FOX: Thanks Sandra.</p><p>SMITH: Dagen, this could have been a big impact on buyer behavior, but as we're seeing actually Chicago housing sales are doing quite well at the moment. A pocket of strength from the country.</p><p>MCDOWELL: These taxes are regressive. Your higher sales tax, you have the cell phone tax went up not long ago. Higher property taxes. They hit the poor even harder than they do because it eats up more of a greater percentage of their income and what they take home. It's really shocking that the city's not in better financial shape. The fact they they've put in place all these revenue raisers. But - leave it to Robert Manual. I mean he got reelected didn't he?</p><p>SMITH: Not the situation. When you look at the sales tax go to these lofty numbers I also worry about restaurant chains or just restaurants in general in the city. I mean, you're talking about asking tourists to come into the city and they're paying substantially more than they had expected over were a year ago.</p><p>MIKE MURPHY, ROSECLIFF FINANCIAL: Absolutely. So you know, I understand why this tax hike went through, but to say that there's strength in the real estate market today is one thing. But what's going to happen after this is out there for six months or 12 months. Are you going to see restaurant chains, stores leaving. Are you going to see the values of homes decreasing. So, I think it's kind of a risky bet they're taking. I agree they had to do something because you can't run a city bankrupt or no money -</p><p>SMITH: That's the business.</p><p>MURPHY: I think it is.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And by the way, the second city in the minds of New York is Los Angeles.</p><p>SMITH: Whatever.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And then San Fran and then Boston.</p><p>SMITH: Whatever.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Chicago's is like fifth, maybe six behind Atlanta.</p><p>SMITH: As a New Yorker you probably really didn't even understand -</p><p>MCDOWELL: I am not a New Yorker!</p><p>SMITH: -- what second city meant.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I only say New Yorker after when, you know, you have to walk through like garbage and the small of like a dumpster behind a fishmonger on the way. I only consider myself a New Yorker when I have to brave through that.</p><p>SMITH: Alright. Somewhere in -- She's from somewhere in Virginia.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MCDOWELL: (INAUDIBLE) Sandra was about the insult the entire South. She was this close. (INAUDIBLE) Alright. Ohio<person><nameText>Governor John Kasich </nameText></person>set to jump into the 2016 White House race. Bake Burman has the latest from Washington. Help Blake?</p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FOX BUSINESS: Here I am for you Sandra. John Kasich will make it 16 later today. The current Governor of Ohio and Former Congressman will launch his second White House run with about one to two percent of support from Republicans. Everyone in the GOP field is currently staring up at <person><nameText>Donald Trump. </nameText></person>A new \"Washington Post\" poll shows 24 percent of Republicans currently favored Trump. That is double his nearest opponents and his highest mark yet. However, much of that poll was taken before his widely panned comments about John McCain.</p><p>In Iowa, home to the first caucus, the main newspaper, \"The Des Moines Register\", speaking about comments Sandra. Take a listen to this. They published a blistering op-ed of Trump this morning. Here's what they wrote, quote \"If he were merely a self absorbed B-list celebrity, his unchecked ego could be tolerated as some source of mild amusement\". That op-ed went on to say as you might image that Trump is unqualified to be President. Sandra?</p><p>SMITH: Wow. Alright, Blake, thank you. I guess there's enough to talk about there, but he is jumping to into a very contentious GOP race. I mean, we heard from Governor Pataki earlier. He's all fired up. <person><nameText>Donald Trump's </nameText></person>so fired up, he's saying things maybe he shouldn't. I mean, there is an intense heated battle going on right now.</p><p>MURPHY: There is an 16 candidates we all know is too much. But it's funny how the start of that report was about Kasich joining the race, but it ended with Trump. You know, it seems like right now everything's coming back to Trump. He's gotten all the press that surrounded - a lot of the press that's surrounded it. I think when we get to the first debate in August, we're going to be done 10 candidates at that point. And from 10, we need to get down to the top four or five. Right now, there's too many people out there. We need to weed through that and find the most qualified people who can actually win the election.</p><p>SMITH: An I'm still trying to find somebody who will talk about the economy. You know, Governor Pataki had a lot of great things to say, however, Dagen, you noticed when I started asking about the economy, it went to national security, which is one of his strengths and what he wants to focus on. I just have not heard even on the left, Hillary Clinton, she's trying really hard to talk about the economy right now. But that's No. 1, what's polling with the American voter. They want to know who's going to fix the economy.</p><p>MCDOWELL: The big broad stripes - and that will work initially. It's not going pay for any of these GOP candidates to get into the nitty-gritty of how they would fix the economy at least in the short run. They're going to paint, use broad stokes and - I mean, that's what's worked for Trump quite frankly.</p><p>SMITH: By the way, you know, Joe Biden hasn't entered the race yet and there's a lot of talk about will he or won't. I should've asked Michael Berlin. I'm sure he had an opinion on that. But -</p><p>MCDOWELL: It's after the first debate. That'll be critical where you get, the first debate, the first tier, it He gets it down a ten. Governor Pataki will not be in that first tier the way the polls numbers look like right now and maybe not Kasich either.</p><p>SMITH: Alright. So exciting. From presidential season to earnings season in full swing, we'll hear from Apple after the bell today. We'll have a preview of that and \"Breaking Bad's\" Stephen Michael Quezada announcing plans to run for public office in New Mexico. He's going to be joining us next. Keep it right here on the Fox Business Network.</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING: \" GET IN MY WAY\" - ROBIN THICKE)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>SMITH: News alert for you. Capitol flags will fly at half staff to remember the victims of the Chattanooga shooting. Cheryl Casone has the details on that.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS: Hi, good morning Sandra. Well, yes. House Speaker John Boehner has just ordered that flags on Capitol Hill fly at half staff in honor of the four marines and one sailor killed in a Tennessee terror attack. The gunman Mohammed Abdulazeez opened fire at two military facilities on Thursday before he was killed by police. We were just looking at that tweet coming out from Speaker Boehner's office, Speaker Boehner's Twitter account, saying, of course, that we're going to be honoring those victims.</p><p>Killed by police in other headlines. New York City - excuse me. In other headlines this morning, New York City doctors are evaluating a patient who was rushed to hospital last night with some symptoms of Ebola. We're just getting this story in as well folks. The city's Health Department says the patient recently returned from Guinea and had no known exposure to the deadly disease. We're going to bring you, of course, the latest on that story as it develops. We're following that.</p><p>And then finally, we've talked about this earlier, appliance makers say that President Obama's new dishwasher rules are going to take us back to the days of handwashing. This is serious news. The White House wants to cut the amount of water that dishwashers use, but the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers says that won't get your dishes clean enough Sandra. And also, the Association saying that they did tests and photographs, which they sent to the Department of Energy with food on the dishes they sent to the Department of Energy with food on the dishes. So, it's a big story. I'll continue to follow it for you.</p><p>SMITH: Thank you very much Cheryl. Alright. Well, immigration reform becoming a key topic of debate for the 2016 presidential race and my next guest played a New Mexico law enforcement officer in the hit series, \"Breaking Bad\". Now he wants to make a difference in real life by running for public office in Albuquerque. Joining me now in a first on Fox Business interview with actor Stephen Michael Quezada. Steven, welcome. Good morning to you.</p><p>STEPHEN MICHAEL QUEZADA, ACTOR: Good morning. How are you?</p><p>SMITH: Alright. What is driving you to run for public office?</p><p>QUEZADA: Well, I already have -- I sit on the Albuquerque school board. I've been involved in my community way before I was any kind of actor or any kind of comedian. I've always worked with kids, did gang intervention programs. So, this is something I've always been involved in. This isn't new for me. And so this is a gradual step for me to be able to help the people in the community that I love. I love this community. I'm a New Mexican. We're really proud of our culture and we're really proud of who we are and one of the main reasons why I'm running for office is because I'm an American and I can.</p><p>SMITH: Stephen, immigration has been a hot topic mostly of late because of <person><nameText>Donald Trump's </nameText></person>comment that have been interpreted many different ways, but specifically, his comment on immigration. How, what was your response to that?</p><p>QUEZADA: You know, immigration is a big topic for sure in the areas where we live. Those are our - that's our workforce. I mean, nobody eats without them working in America. Nobody - you know, they do the jobs that most Americans won't do. I know <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>wants to build a wall and I'm asking who's going to build the wall for $8 an hour? It's going to be the workforce that he wants out.</p><p>So, we need to figure out immigration reform. Are we against criminals? Of course, we are. But to say that all Mexican people are drug dealers and rapist was something that should've never been said. I was just performing in front of 800 people and when I got into the elevator, I had man with his 7-year old son told me to go back to Mexico because I was a rapist and a drug dealer. And then, when I walked out of the elevator he spit at me. I mean, is this what we're try to promote as Americans because, you know, my family goes back here 300 years. My father fought in World War II, Korea and Vietnam. And for me to have to travel the country and deal with stuff like that, I think it's unfair and it's something that wasn't thought out. When you make a comment like that - because some of us Americans have to live with that.</p><p>MURPHY: Hey Stephen, when you're in your campaign against the other two candidates, how much does your acting background or really your celebrity - I would like that put you at a huge advantage. Is that how the race is shaping up right now?</p><p>QUEZADA: Well, you know, a lot of people use money as a huge advantage. I don't have that luxury. I'm just a regular old actor and comedian. But, locally I think most people know me here as a community member, as somebody, you know, as somebody who raises money for children, who does programs through youth development incorporated, who's been involved in education. So, the rest of the country knows me as \"Breaking Bad\" actor Steve Gomez. But, here in New Mexico, they know me as Stephen Michael Quezada, the community member.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Stephen, it's Dagen McDowell. I work here at Fox Business. County Commissioner now, do you - is that where you see your career? Are you going to be an actor 20 years for now or do you want to be a politician?</p><p>QUEZADA: I'm going to do both. I don't understand why anybody who runs for office can't do - you know, you never see anybody quit their job to run for office if they're a lawyer or if they own - if they're wealthy and they own a construction company or any kind of business. You know, nobody quits their job or --</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well, Schwarzenegger did. I mean, Schwarzenegger did. There a number of actors that when they were serving their terms in office, they weren't doing film work or television work.</p><p>QUEZADA: Well, I do the work because I have three children. I have two daughters in college. I'm not wealthy. Arnold Schwarzenegger and those other actors are very wealthy. You're not talking to Brian Cranson here, you're talking to a guy who played a - you know?</p><p>SMITH: So, Steve, we don't have much time left. Who do you like right now as the presidential race heats up? There are lot of talk about the GOP field. Who do you like on the left?</p><p>QUEZADA: Well, I'm going to tell you, I'm waiting to see who the most Democratic person is going to step up. I don't believe what I read or believe what I read all the time. I want somebody to be honest, so I'm looking at the person who's going to be the most honest and the person that I think is really going to look at the economic position of this country and who's going to look at immigration.</p><p>SMITH: Do you like Hillary Clinton?</p><p>QUEZADA: I like a couple of them. Hillary is definitely one of my top runners.</p><p>SMITH: Alright. Stephen Michael Quezada, thank you for joining us this morning and sharing your thoughts and your run at office. Good luck to you.</p><p>QUEZADA: Thank you. Thanks, I appreciate it.</p><p>SMITH: Alright. Tesla shares set to be a major mover in today's trade. Why the stock is selling off straight ahead.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>SMITH: Welcome back. We're about 40 minutes away from the opening bell. Let's get to Nicole Petallides at the New York Stock Exchange. It's already lunch time for you Nicole. An hour and a half to - sorry, less than an hour to the opening bell.</p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX BUSINESS: Good morning, Sandra. That's right. So, let's take a look at what we're watching. First of all, gold continues to be a story, right? Five-year lows, but we're keeping a keen eye on a big mover today. And that's Tesla. Tesla this morning is looking down about more than $10 this morning. And that is on a UBS downgrade. It turns out for the third time recently, they're cutting Telsa again. For the third time this month to a sell rating in this case and that is because they actually believe that the energy business, the energy storage business is unlikely to live up to the expectations. In fact, they also have power wall where they said some of the order that they're seeing are just solicitations. People don't actually have to put money down. And so with that, cutting into a sell (INAUDIBLE) on the stock is looking nowhere. Back to you.</p><p>SMITH: Alright. Nicole, thank you. And don't forget to start your day off with Nicole, Lauren and me on \"FBN:AM\" every morning at 5:00 a.m. right here on the Fox Business Network. We get you ready for your day.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Get down.</p><p>SMITH: Alright! Here we go. Is it Friday? One stock to watch today. Apple reporting third-quarter earnings after the closing bell. Wall Street expecting the tech giant to report $29.9 billion dollars in Iphone sales versus $19.8 billion dollars last year. Analyst expect strong sales to be bowied by bigger-than-expected demand in China and this quarter represents the first for Apple watch sales. Apple's been tightlipped on watch sells specifically and many on Wall Street are keeping expectations muted. I don't know. As my read on that should be nobody really knows how well the watch is doing for Apple. Like so far, Tim Cook hasn't really released any details specifically about it.</p><p>MURPY: He hasn't got a lot of press, but remember, in the last three months since Apple last reported. The stocks essentially flat. It was around 132, it's still around 132. So, I think going into this quarter, the bars set pretty high for them as far as Iphone sales go. But, if you look at the sales projection or what they did this past quarter, sales for the Iphones were great. The Iphone 6, iphone 6 Plus. China, U.S., I think the risk to Apple right now is to the upside. I think it breaks above recent highs on a very strong number today.</p><p>SMITH: Really? So we at $132 a share. You think it's going to continue to run higher?</p><p>MURPHY: Well, And I'd say, don't focus on the price of $132 because that's essentially flat in the last three months as the NASDAQ has gone up to all- time highs. But, really focus on is the company growing, is the company increasing their sales --</p><p>SMITH: Not worried about valuations, you're just worried about gross period. And Dagen, as much as I've always say, I got Apple fatigue. I can't talk another day about Apple and this watch. And people love to buy the stocks, the love to buy the watch, they love to buy the Apple products. And it's like you can't ignore it. It's a growth engine that hasn't stopped.</p><p>MCDOWELL: No, it's Google getting surprised at the upside Apple can't do. And it's an juggernaut and it's in the world of technology are you going to - it's relatively safe. Well, I say safe, but it's a safer bet than a lot of the questionable companies that are younger and newer with business models that are great deal shakier than that one.</p><p>MURPHY: And we have the watch, but we also have Apple music that was just launched. I mean, it'll be interesting to see if they speak at about that because now, they're moving in a whole new space, but they still have that Apple mote.</p><p>MCDOWELL: How many people they got to sign up for the free trial, which I did and I was not a subscriber to Spotify either and I signed up for Apple.</p><p>SMTIH: There you have it. Alright. All this. Don't miss \"After the Bell's\" complete coverage on earnings after the close of trade today, right here on the Fox Business Network. David and Melissa will have that for you, 4:00 p.m. Eastern time. We are just over 30 minutes away from the opening bell. Futures right now pointing to a mixed open. NASDAQ on pace for a record day. Keep it right here on Fox Business. We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>SMITH: All right. IBM is poised to shave off nearly 60 points from the Dow when it begins trading just a about an a half hour from now. Dagen, Mike, final thoughts ahead of the opening bell this morning? Mike, go first.</p><p>MCDOWELL: You can go first.</p><p>SMITH: You're on the spot. Think of something.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Because I'm going to talk about something - uncomfortable.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MURPHY: Okay. I think the focus right now is on earnings. You know, we've heard from a lot of big banks. They've come out with strong earnings. So, I think the market is sitting at all-time highs. You talk about valuations, but I think if you look at it, we're not trading at historically high levels. So, there's talk out there about bubbles. We're not in a bubble right now. I think the market on strong earnings can take out highs and go higher. That's what I'll be watching today.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And I'm watching any additional information on the Ashley Madison hack, the site for people looking for--</p><p>SMITH: Cheating.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes, who want to cheat on their spouses. So, what happened yesterday, it was a group that said they hacked into the Ashley Madison website and accessed 37 million users information because the full delete option that Ashley Madison charges for, it wasn't real. They weren't deleting these account. Ashley Madison said yesterday yes, it does. And it's offering free delete of all your accounts on Ashley Madison. And there was no new information that was posted on-line yesterday.</p><p>SMITH: By the way, this is a story in the 'Wall Street Journal\" questioning whether or not the IPO that had been planned for Ashley Madison will actually happen. So, that's continued fallout from that story as well. Thank goodness they're going to let me delete my account.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>SMITH: Alright, IBM, by the way, we're saying is going shave off 60 points from the Dow out of the gate this morning. United Technologies, part of that sell-off as well. Right now, combined IBM and United Technologies expected to shave off about 93 points from the Dow when it opens this morning. United Technologies UTX right now off $5 bucks in the pre-market ahead of the bell a half hour from now. And there was IBM off about $10 as well.</p><p>Alright, I want to say thank you to Dagen McDowell and Mike Murphy for joining us this morning.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Thank you.</p><p>MURPHY: Thank you.</p><p>SMITH: Busy couple of hours guys. You don't want to miss MORNINGS WITH MARIA tomorrow. Maria will be back. Presidential Candidate and Former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee will be here to talking about the latest in the always exciting campaign.

Well, gold prices edging lower after plunging to the lowest level in five years on rate hikes feared. Phil Flynn is now at the CME Group watching this sell-off nearing $1,100 a troy ounce in gold. Phil, will gold dip below $1,000 an ounce?</p><p>PHIL FLYNN, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Well, it did earlier and I think it has a chance to because it is so close. But you know, a lot of people are talking about this bear raid that happened on Sunday night. That's what they're calling it. This massive sell orders that came in that broke the gold market down. And it's either -- it's a critical turning point.</p><p>This is either a sign of capitulation or a sign that the market is going down. Consider the fact that we saw over $2 billion wiped off -- commodity, ETFs -- in the matter of a couple of hours yesterday. And that's raising a lot of concerns whether this trade was real, if it's really signaling a bigger problem with the global economy, or a bigger meltdown in China.</p><p>Now what's kind of interesting here when we look at what's happened to gold here the couple of days central banks around the globe have been buying gold. We just saw reports that Russia, Kazakhstan, Afghanistan -- all these countries have been buying gold while the rest of the world is selling them. But it's raising a lot of concerns.</p><p>But look what's done. You know, it's kind of interesting, people don't realize Sandra last month commodities as an asset class in the last quarter actually outperformed the stock market. What a turn-around in just the first couple of days of the quarter when we see this massive sell off in commodities. The index near a 13-year-low of all commodities, putting a lot of downward pressure on prices and the sell-off in gold really has, you know, trickled down to other markets, you know.</p><p>Gold is the first one to sell off but it even impacted things like crude oil, gasoline prices, RBA (ph) prices. So it's raising concerns that this drop in gold could be signaling the bigger deflationary cycle which is going to create bigger problems for the fed as we go forward.</p><p>SMITH: All right. So the cover of the \"Financial Times\" this morning, by the way, it's all about this commodity sell-off -- gold, lowest level in five years amid broader commodity sell-off. A lot of this, Michael, based on the strength that we're seeing in the U.S. dollar. To be clear in the overnight session we saw gold dip below $1,100 a troy ounce but, of course, the big round number we're now all watching is $1,000. Could that happen? Could we dip below there?</p><p>MICHAEL BLOCK, RHINO TRADING PARTNERS: It could happen but I'm noticing some very interesting things here -- Sandra. I'm noticing, you know, there's the cover of the FT saying the death of gold. On the Twitter- sphere, you know, there's talk amongst traders and investors, no one wants to touch. The gold bugs are being burned at the stake here.</p><p>SMITH: Dagen said it yesterday, actually.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN HOST: Yes, you finish your thought. I'll get into it. But when people point to gold and argue that gold, in and of itself, is some sort of economic indicator I go \"pooh, really\". Because copper is used around the global economy, oil is a critical global economic commodity.</p><p>SMITH: People buy and sell gold versus copper for very different reasons. That being said what is the trade in gold right now?</p><p>BLOCK: The trade, you know, I see right now is you know, sentiment getting worse. I think it could get worse, you know, when the screaming gets really loud as I like to say. People ask when is gold going to stop going down, I always give them a sardonic reply \"when you stop asking me\", which is my way of saying when there's total capitulation. I think we're getting close. Maybe we are there. For smart investors I have a lot of guys who are saying five years out I want to own gold miners and say hell yes, own an ETF here. This is an interesting interest spot where you want to start picking away at it.</p><p>You know, look, gold is like anything else. Is it an inflation flight? Is it a flight to safety? No and no.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right. They can't answer that question. If you want safety you go into treasury bonds because the U.S. government will at least pay you back. If you want an inflation hedge, you go out and buy a house or you buy stocks because they're going to raise the price. I'm just saying that people have this wonderment around gold.</p><p>SMITH: I hear Phil Flynn chomping at the bit down there -- Phil.</p><p>FLYNN: Well, you know, it's kind of interesting here. I just mentioned Russia improve their gold reserves, a lot of that was because of the weakness in the ruble. We talk about China. A lot of talk that they didn't increase their gold reserves as much as a lot of people thought as they're trying to bring their currency back to a global market.</p><p>And I agree with Dagen. On a day to day basis gold can, you know, react with no really strong economic purpose. But at the end of the day, central banks still use gold as the backdrop of their foreign currency whether they acknowledge it or not. So it's a very, very important commodity from that standpoint.</p><p>SMITH: All right. That being said, we just checked the last time we did see gold below $1,000 an ounce, we'll have to go back to 2009 to see that - - so certainly a big round number to watch. Phil Flynn -- thank you for joining us from the CME Group there in Chicago.</p><p><person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>taking a step back on \"THE O'REILLY FACTOR\" last night over his comments about <person><nameText>Senator John McCain </nameText></person>when he called the former POW, quote, \"not a war hero\".</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: I have respect for senator McCain. I used to like him a lot, I supported him, raise money for his campaign against President Obama and certainly if there was a misunderstanding I would totally take that back.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SMITH: Get ready because my next guest says the latest flip is far worse than those about Mexican immigrants and will cost Trump dearly. The latest polling data does suggest otherwise. A new poll ABC News and the \"Washington Post\" show he is the favorite at 24 percent. Mind you, that poll did happen before those comments occurred.</p><p>Mike Berland is a former strategic adviser to Hillary Clinton and CEO of Edelman Berland and joins us now. And Mike, we very much look forward to having you on the show this morning to react to not only to what <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>said but then how he has responded now to our very own Bill O'Reilly last night.</p><p>MIKE BERLAND, EDELMAN BERLAND: Well, if you like \"Celebrity Apprentice\" waiting for the August 6th Republican debate because <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>is building his viewership, he's building his base and he will be ready to go.</p><p>What we're seeing is that <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>is a master brand builder. I've been studying brands for 25 years, he knows what he is about, he's very clear he's a straight shooter and he's now setting the dialogue.</p><p>Sandra we've been talking about <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>for two weeks. We are watching what's happening on social media. In his first issue with Mexican illegal immigrants, it was a corporate play and we saw the issues that he had. Now we're seeing that this was much broader.</p><p>You know who broke this? Mitt Romney. He tweeted out and 60,000 shared it. And over the next three days we saw this go from Politico and Mitt Romney to Democrats, Republicans, Independents -- everybody is talking about <person><nameText>Donald Trump.</nameText></person></p><p>SMITH: Well first of all we've been talking a lot about <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>for a lot longer than two weeks.</p><p>BERLAND: Well, he's a -- viable presidential candidates.</p><p>SMITH: Ok. But the branding aspect Dagen is one that every time -- because if anything he continues to establish his brand and get his name out there. Polling shows that -- the last poll that I saw showed that only two percent of American voter respondents didn't know who he was. I mean more people know <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>than any other presidential candidate out there.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Real-estate billionaire used to be his brand. Now it's \"feckless blowhard\" according to the \"Des Moines Register\" which called for him to step out of a race but you know who he is like? And to Michael's credit we were talking about this before he walked out here. He's Ross Perot -- right.</p><p>That's the best comparison to Trump is Ross Perot getting into the race.</p><p>BERLAND: But what does Trump have that Ross Perot didn't have?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Money.</p><p>BERLAND: No, he had. Ross Perot had billion dollars, <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>has social media and when we look at how this story is spreading we see that <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>is now becoming political provocateur. He is talking about issues that people are scared about and I think what is really interesting is that this is not just a Republican Party issue. This is about presidential politics in America and we see that everybody is responding.</p><p>Look at this analysis that I've done. The story started with Politico on one side, Mitt Romney on the other and watch how the story spread over Twitter. It started to connect and this became ubiquitous issue over three days.</p><p>Sandra most stories died down after three days. This one actually built. And by the time we get to August 6th we're going to see Trump continue to build support and I think if you are Jeb Bush, if you're Marco Rubio, if you're Rick Perry and you are in that debate with him you got to watch out.</p><p>SMITH: Ok. But we have not had your reactions yet on O'Malley and apologizing for saying \"all lives matter\"? I am dying to know your take on that.</p><p>BERLAND: I think that what we are seeing is a debate now is spreading bigger -- that we are seeing a lot of issues on the Republican and on Democratic side and we're talking about straight shooting.</p><p>SMITH: Ok. That's it?</p><p>BLOCK: Does straight shooting from O'Malley's sell though? That's the question.</p><p>BERLAND: Right. He doesn't have the brand that <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>does to get it out. I think that we're seeing really -- on the Democratic side, here we have <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>who is talking very candidly about the issues. We have Hillary Clinton who is being very careful and scripted and what's going to happen with the American voter it's he's raising the bar. And we're going to see on both sides, we're going to see Sanders, we're going to see O'Malley, we're going to see Clinton. They're all going to have to take their game up.</p><p>But Trump is drowning everybody out right now.</p><p>SMITH: I think you let O'Malley of the hook a little easy compared to what you're doing to <person><nameText>Donald Trump.</nameText></person></p><p>BERLAND: No, hold on. I'm saying <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>is absolutely very much in control of the dialogue. I think I'm actually --</p><p>SMITH: Is it that he is or you want him to be because that is better for the left?</p><p>BERLAND: For the left I think they want <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>to go away. I think that the Republicans would as well.</p><p>SMITH: Really.</p><p>BERLAND: Of course.</p><p>MCDOWELL: A better comparison is Bernie Sanders because they're really appealing to the same anti-establishment feeling on the right as Trump and on the left as Sanders.</p><p>BERLAND: I'll give you an example. John Kasich today is going to announce that he is running for president. And nobody's going to hear it and no one is going to care because they're going to keep talking about <person><nameText>Donald Trump. </nameText></person>So you are drowning out both sides.</p><p>If you're Hillary Clinton you can't get your economic message out there. If you're Bernie Sanders you're getting drowned out.</p><p>SMITH: What's her economic message?</p><p>BERLAND: Her economic message, she's talking about increasing wages --</p><p>MCDOWELL: Her economic message is more Obama and she doesn't go as far left as Bernie Sanders. That's in essence what her economy --</p><p>SMITH: But that is my defense of Hillary Clinton, is that she is the one who is trying to get her economic message out there. More so than I say to a lot of other candidates aside from maybe Jeb Bush who's a real fan on the table for growth in the United States.</p><p>All right. We unfortunately have to leave it there. Mike Berland -- great conversation.</p><p>BERLAND: Thanks for having me.</p><p>SMITH: Thanks for joining us early this morning.</p><p>All right. Well, the Nasdaq notching its third record close in a row and major members of the index scheduled to report earnings today. Are we approaching another technology bubble? Is that happening right now? We will discuss that next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>SMITH: President Obama's new dishwasher rules are under fire by appliance makers. Cheryl, you get down.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT: We had it.</p><p>SMITH: What's your story? Take it away.</p><p>CASONE: You've got it Sandra. Yes, dishwasher rules, not kidding about this one -- Sandra. Are you ready to start hand washing your dishes again folks? I'm serious. This is a real story. The Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers says that is exactly what is going to happen if the White House's new dishwasher regulations go into law.</p><p>The new rules cut the amount of water that dishwashers can use. But the industry group says that's going to only lead to dirtier dishes and we're all going to be unhappy and we're going to blame the President for dirty dishes. True story.</p><p>Intelligent life anywhere in the universe if it exists, Stephen Hawking wants to find it.

ET if you're out there, you can call us.</p><p>And finally Microsoft reporting quarterly results after the close today, the software giant expected to pose a drop in revenue, as buyers wait for the next version of Windows. That's due out later this month. Investors also hoping to hear more details about the company's latest job cuts. Unfortunately that is the problem.</p><p>The Nasdaq, we didn't get the record close yesterday intra-day Sandra but, you know, everybody keeps saying are we in a bubble? Is this a bubble? Is technology a bubble? But when Apple comes in after the close I think all of those questions are going to be deleted because Apple is probably going to have another really strong quarter.</p><p>SMITH: I mean is it reasonable that we're having fears of the year 2000 and these lofty valuations on these stocks? I mean I'm looking at the triple cues (ph), the power share's triple cues, trusts tracks Nasdaq -- a ten-year high there as well. Everybody is worried, you know. Is this sustainable?</p><p>BLOCK: Look, we're breaking 200 highs, I'm not going to use the word \"bubble\" here. What I'm seeing here is -- the key word here is \"scarcity\". Google came out last week. They had great earnings with the Ruth Porat as the CFO now. They have a great cost cutting story; over the weekend that hey they can use some of their cash to buy back stock, hitting on all cylinders.</p><p>Here's the problem, what goes for Google does not necessarily go for Microsoft or Qualcomm or Sandisk or Texan or some of these other companies coming out. I don't think the valuations are too lofty. You see some of these venture capital valuations and then there are certain companies out there with no earnings that are going on. Amazon --</p><p>CASONE: Well, Jet.com is what came up yesterday. That is where this whole discussion started out. It was like really? That is not making any money and come on.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Some of the valuations on the private companies even Uber are where you get nosebleeds in there. A lot of companies getting funding, that are actually companies -- they're the exact same model of a company that went out of business during the first dot.com crash and then it came back. Whether the (INAUDIBLE) sticks with the originally company, it basically got shut down and then they refunded at a higher price which makes no sense.</p><p>SMITH: And look, there's no fun in looking at financials these days with the lack of growth potential that most analysts point out in the financial sector. It's like where is that money that's chasing growth in the stock market, where are they going to look?</p><p>BLOCK: It's going to tech and to biotech, and you have Chipotle reporting as well and it's going to these rogue companies because there's scarcity of growth. Organic growth isn't coming from many places, even Google's coming down but there still is some growth. The question is, is Microsoft there. Apple -- I think everyone thinks is going to be there --</p><p>CASONE: You know what I don't want to see though, you guys. I don't want to see another year where you have what we saw back in 2000 which was Goldman Sachs and the investment bankers that extend these IPOs. They're the ones that made all the money and the retail investors, the (INAUDIBLE) got the shaft once again.</p><p>MCDOWELL: The retail investor except in a few instances is very shy of a lot of these companies. This is an indicator of nothing but I bought my first Mac. I've never owned a Mac. I've always been Windows-based my entire life. Yesterday -- it arrived yesterday.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BLOCK: -- growth exposure.</p><p>SMITH: Everybody wants to talk about tech bubbles. We're going to be right back. Stay with us</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KT MCFARLAND, FOX NEWSNATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST: It's truly (INAUDIBLE). They have famously last year in the battle for Kobani which is a big city near there on the other side of the Turkish border that ISIS took Turkish tanks out on the Turkish border and they watched as ISIS came in, took the town, slaughtered the Kurdish population there.</p><p>So will Turkey join the battle? Will Turkey join the battle in Syria and Iraq, you know, the Islamic state? Or will Turkey just say I'm going to defend our borders? Will Turkey tighten up its borders?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SMITH: That was K.T. McFarland weighing in on one of the top stories in the Journal this morning. Reading \"Suicide bomber killed at least 31 in Turkish border towns\".</p><p>For more on this let's bring in Fox Newscorrespondent and former navy fighter pilot Lea Gabriel. Good morning. Thanks for joining us on this story this morning. What do you make of the latest developments out of Turkey?</p><p>LEA GABRIEL, FOX NEWSCORRESPONDENT: Well, you know, actually what we just heard K.T. saying, in Turkey we watched as Kobani was under siege for months and months. Turkey sat there, did very little. Turkey has been very difficult to influence to get engaged in this fight against ISIS even though ISIS is essentially -- this alligator called ISIS has been chomping at their canoe for a long time.</p><p>Now Turkey is saying, ok, well this is probably retaliation because now we are joined with, you know, the other fight against ISIS and now we're helping to train some Syrian rebels. So this is probably retaliation.</p><p>I see that as a bit of a cop out from Turkey because they really have not wanted to be engaged in this fight. And what they really want I think is for the U.S. and for other countries to step in and fight this so they can sit back and watch.</p><p>SMITH: So you don't think Turkey is going to join the battle here?</p><p>GABRIEL: I think Turkey will but I think they're going to continue to do as little as possible. And there's a lot of reasons for this. For one, it's that Turkey does not want to see the rise of the Kurds. Turkey does not want to see an independent Kurdistan. They have seen the Kurdish power rising. The Kurds have been our biggest ally in this fight against ISIS. And that's a big problem for Turkey so I think that is one of the main reasons that they're wanting to kind of sit back.</p><p>You know, they wanted the U.S. to do a lot. They wanted us to establish a no-fly zone. They wanted a humanitarian zone. They wanted others to come in and take care of this threat and I think we'll continue to see them do as little as possible.</p><p>SMITH: Cover of the \"Wall Street Journal\" this morning -- Dagen. ISIS's leader takes steps to ensure group's survival. Not just ensuring survival, it seems that they're gaining territory and they're gaining power.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Lea, Turkey has one of the largest armies in the world.</p><p>GABRIEL: Second largest in NATO.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right. And one of I think the fourth largest overall. Would we be willing to step in and help Turkey knowing that they have basically the power to take care of themselves if they so choose?</p><p>GABRIEL: This is a little diplomatic game that I think we have been playing for months. Since Kobani was going on a lot of people said why aren't we doing more in Kobani? Why just an air campaign? I think a lot of this was to basically say look, this is a regional problem.</p><p>As I said this alligator is chomping at your canoe. We may be in the same river but it's not right here on our borders, it's on yours Turkey. And I think that's a quiet little diplomatic game that is being played, that's the soft power.</p><p>BLOCK: I mean look, there's a new power here, what is El Baghdadi and ISIS really worried about here? They're worried about the fact that the United States is making this groundbreaking deal with Iran. Why are we making the deal with Iran? You know, the thing that no one wants to talk about is this sort of takes the shackles off the revolutionary guard, our sworn enemies. Maybe now and certainly in the past that says hey they're going to join the fight more overtly now. And you know, for someone looking at Erdogan in Turkey, looking at the U.S., looking at all the players in the region suddenly there's this new big player there and you know, I think is really what ISIS is responding to here.</p><p>GABRIEL: But definitely a positive spin on the nuclear deal and not to say a spin --</p><p>BLOCK: No, it's my view on it. I get asked about it constantly.</p><p>GABRIEL: There's good and there's bad. There's definitely a good side of it but at the same time what Iran really wants in the region is influence.</p><p>BLOCK: Here it is.</p><p>GABRIEL: So Iran may be battling ISIS, but Iran wants to grow its influence and in no way would I consider Iran any sort of an ally with us in the region at any point.</p><p>SMITH: All right. Thank you to Lea Gabriel. And by the way, check out Lea's new web segment called the \"Fox Patriot Report\". Log onto foxnews.com for more -- right?</p><p>GABRIEL: Yes. Thank you.</p><p>SMITH: All right. Thank you very much to Lea.</p><p>A new poll this morning showing <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>taking the lead in the Republican race but could his comments on Senator McCain the damper on his White House run? Some think so, some think not. Former New York governor and current Republican candidate for president George Pataki is here to weigh in.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>SANDRA SMITH, FOX BUSINESS: Ohio<person><nameText>Governor, John Kasich </nameText></person>set to jump into the 2016 White House race. Blake Burman has the latest from Washington. Blake?</p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FOX BUSINESS: Sandra, John Kasich will make it 16 later today. He is expected to be the final in a long list of candidates in the Republican primary. Kasich is the Governor of the swing state of Ohio and a former Congressman. In between those two stints, he also worked at Lehman Brothers. This will be Kasich's second attempt at a White House run and he'll start with a lot of ground to make up. Kasich currently sits just outside the top 10 pulling in around one to two percent of support from Republicans and for the moment, is among the packs staring up at <person><nameText>Donald Trump. </nameText></person>A poll released by \"The Washington Post\" shows the billionaire businessman has widened his lead. Trump's 24 percent is double his nearest competitors. However Sandra, some of that poll was taken before his controversial comments on John McCain. So, the full effect of that for Trump is still unknown and the Post points out that on the final day of that poll, they saw a drop for Trump. So it's something we'll have to look forward - look to going forward. Sandra?</p><p>SMITH: Alright. Thank you for that Blake. And following his comments on Senator McCain, \"The Des Moines Register\" is now calling for Trump to end his run for the White House. My next guest has taken <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>to task for his recent comments on Senator McCain, and demeaning Mexicans.</p><p>Joining me now is former New York governor and current Republican candidate for president, George Pataki. Governor, thank you for being here this morning.</p><p>GEORGE PATAKI (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Good morning. Nice being on with you.</p><p>SMITH: All right, so where do you stand on Trump's most recent comments on <person><nameText>Senator John McCain?</nameText></person></p><p>PATAKI: Can I tell I something? <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>is not going to be President of the United States. Period. Whether it's his McCain comments, his comments earlier demeaning Mexicans.</p><p>SMITH: Why do you rule him out?</p><p>PATAKI: First of all, he's never held public office and we've had two people in 150 years -- Dwight Eisenhower and U.S. Grant -- who hadn't held public office. And then he makes comments that are simply outrageous. The media loves this. I mean, look what we're talking about. The day after the U.N. Security Council --</p><p>SMITH: The media loves it.</p><p>PATAKI: -- approves the Iran agreement, we're talking about <person><nameText>Donald Trump.</nameText></person></p><p>SMITH: This is true.</p><p>PATAKI: <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>is not going to be president. The IranSecurity Council vote is meaningful; that's what we should be talking about. Forgive me.</p><p>SMITH: Well, the media loves it, but the polling shows the American voters like it as well. Now you're in this race, and we've got another GOP contender jumping in today as well. The field, the bench, is deep, Governor.</p><p>PATAKI: I think that's a great thing.</p><p>SMITH: It is? .</p><p>PATAKI: I think it's a great thing for the country, a great thing for the party. It's July of 2015. The election is November of 2016. And I've had people come up to me and say what's going on? Normally this is -- three or four months before the election, not year and three or four months before the election.</p><p>People will have a chance to make their case. People will rise up, drop out, and <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>I think has disqualified himself. He's a celebrity. The media loves him. But ultimately he is not going to be President of the United States.</p><p>PATAKI: So do you think he has been a bad thing for the Republican Party, considering that most GOP candidates are having to respond to his comments?</p><p>PATAKI: I do. I do. In particular, I think the Republicans --</p><p>SMITH: Because you're sitting there talking about it right now.</p><p>PATAKI: Yes, and I think the Republicans who did not stand up to his comments about Mexicans are going to regret it next year. I mean it's one thing to stand up for an icon, a war hero, John McCain. Everybody did that, but you have to stand up --</p><p>SMITH: Or all POWs, quite frankly. He took a shot at anybody --</p><p>PATAKI: All POWs, absolutely.</p><p>SMITH: -- who had ever been a prisoner of war.</p><p>PATAKI: And all those who have served our country. But you have to stand up for those who aren't famous, who aren't rich and powerful or hold important position. And they didn't -- so many of my running mates didn't do that when it came to Mexicans, and they're going to regret that.</p><p>SMITH: And there's been criticism of the Republican Party for not focusing on most important issue for the American voter, and that is the economy. Where is the GOP on that?</p><p>PATAKI: Yes. Well, first of all, we have to talk about the economy, but I honestly think what happened yesterday in the U.N. Security Council is critical. And when you think back to September 11, the economic consequence. Obviously it had horrible human personal consequences that we still feel, but the economic consequences of an insecure America are enormous.</p><p>And after that deal -- and I am outraged that this president bypassed Congress, basically gutted the law that he signed giving Congress 60 days to reject that deal and seven different U.N. sanctions -- decades of work by presidents since Bill Clinton are out the window regardless what Congress has done. That's an outrage. And ultimately when our security's at risk, it affects our economy.</p><p>MICHAEL BLOCK, RHINO TRADING PARTNERS CHIEF STRATEGIST: Governor. You know, everyone's still focused on Trump. In a perfect world, it would be about issues. How do you intend to get public back on issues.</p><p>PATAKI: You know, when you're out on the hustings, when you don't have the cameras there -- and sadly I don't get that many cameras when I'm out on the hustings because they're all with Trump or Hillary or someone else. People care about the issues, they care about jobs, they care about the fact that we've had one of the weakest recoveries ever since a terrible recession. They care about, you know, the fact that we are now having great relations with Cuba but we have hard relations with our ally Israel. And it's like a bad \"Saturday Night Live\" skit when the president -- when four Marines who are putting their -- put their lives on the line for our country are murdered in the United States, are told -- the Marines are told, well, you can't wear your uniform in the United States. That's a disgrace.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS: But I think that -- but I think that you -- that Trump does touch on the issues, to defend why he is popular among Americans. He takes a very hard line on immigration. He uses language that is objectionable, but he takes a hard line on immigration, he takes a hard line on China, he takes a hard line on the lack of economic growth and wage growth in this country. And that is what's connecting him.</p><p>PATAKI: He's great at pointing out problems. But what America needs are solutions. And when it comes to immigration, I don't think there's a Republican candidate who doesn't stand up there and say we have got to secure our borders. We have got to make sure everybody comes here legally. They just don't demean millions of people in the process.</p><p>And that is, to me, a part of the politics that I don't like. We have to talk about solutions, talk about bringing people together, and not inflammatory rhetoric that seems, you know, wonderful for a headline at the moment but ultimately divides us and doesn't solve problems.</p><p>SMITH: You talked about the four Marines and now the sailor that has also died in those shootings last week. Do you -- should military men and women in this country be armed?</p><p>PATAKI: Absolutely. It is a despicable surrender, tyrannical Islam here, when this president goes to our Marine recruiters in response to this and says don't wear a uniform and keep your blinds drawn. This is absurd. They should have arms; every military person in uniform in this country should be allowed to carry an arm. I'll tell you, I'll feel a lot better if I see a Marine in a uniform with a gun on his side than if I do seeing that this strong solid guy, knowing he could be a target and can't defend himself. By the way, my son was a Marine, in Iraq, so I'm --</p><p>SMITH: Well, we thank you for his service and your family's service.</p><p>PATAKI: Thank you.</p><p>SMITH: All right, Governor Pataki, full of energy. Love your passion. Thanks for being here this morning.</p><p>PATAKI: Thank you. Alright. Well coming up, bidding wars are back for homes. Are they a good thing or a bad thing. We're going to discus that next, stay tuned.</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING: UNIDENTIFIED SONG)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>SMITH: Alright. Let's take a look futures ahead of the opening bell on Wall Street this morning. Dow and S&amp;P futures, the broader market averages or the futures on them at least, are down, pointing to lower open. Look at the NASDAQ futures though following up on yesterday's record close. NASDAQ futures looking like a higher open. That would be a record on Wall Street when things get going at 9:30 a.m. Eastern this morning. And look at gold prices. That sell-off continues. Dropped below $1100 dollars an ounce in the overnight session. We've come off those lows but still down at $1106 an ounce.</p><p>Call it a flashback to the housing boom. Bidding wars are back in housing market, but unlike the 2000 characterized by easy money mortgages, bidding wars are now sparked by too few homes offered for sale. Michael, what's your take on this. Is this a red flag or sign of a robust housing market?</p><p>BLOCK: Housing has already come a long way and we've seen it do well. It's well-off lows the lows and if you look at chart on new home sales and housing starts, they've come well off the lows and they still have a ways to run that's in 2007, 2006, the era like that. A couple things that I'm looking at. I look at stocks for a living and I noticed that the ITB, the homebuilding, home construction ETF, peaked in early April. Yesterday, even though we've had strong housing data yesterday, housing stocks lagged. There was some analysts rumbling about Home Depot and Lowe's, some softness there perhaps. So, there's some worries there.</p><p>In term of the supply-demand dynamic. I think that's exactly what it is. There's a scarcity of homes. What's going to happen? Are we going - are they going to build more homes. That comes down to a lot about confidence and consumer confidence from (INAUDIBLE) last week. For me, I think housing hitting a bit of a wall here. It's has a good run. It's no longer new news incrementally when housing data is good. I'm a little worried about what happened in the energy patch and what's happening with U.S. industrials in terms of manufacturing. Manufacturing has hit a wall in the United States. Is that going to affect wages? Wages are stopped out and you know, to me, housing I think the risk is to the downside here.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINES: We're going to have to go back to talking about housing, though, regionally and locally because the big issue - because this story about the bidding wars coming back is in just some specific hot markets. There's so many pockets of weakness throughout the country where there hasn't been wage growth. You go and hour half outside New York City, there is plenty of supply and the prices look extremely soft and you see that throughout the country. If you're not in a hot economic market like New York, or Silicon Valley, the San Francisco area, the houses are - the supply can be plentiful and the prices can be pretty cheap.</p><p>SMITH: But there are pockets doing very well. Case in point, the city of Chicago. Chicago home sales hit a new record high. The first half of the year. Sales activity really hot there.</p><p>BLOCK: What I'll argue is back during the peak, Chicago was good. It was never one of these explosive markets in there it came in. So now, it's kind of coming off the low base. You know, Dagen was talking about --</p><p>Dagen: Highest sells tax in the country in Chicago now. A lot of economic problems.</p><p>BLOCK: Well the governance is so good there. Anyway, --</p><p>SMITH: Drop mic.</p><p>BLOCK: You know, we're talking about markets that are good. One thing I'll say about the high-end market, you now Denver what was talked about in the press and that's an interesting place. But New York, on the high-end. One thing that we're not talking about here is how strong the Dollar is. How is that going to deter -</p><p>SMITH: Foreign investment?</p><p>BLOCK: -- you know, potential buyer from Brasilia and Russia, some of these countries - Europe, some of these countries that have really spurred a lot of buying.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Chinese buyers.</p><p>BLOCK: That's something I think (INAUDIBLE) talking enough about. You know, Chinese buying maybe insulted to that (INAUDIBLE) stage relatively strong. But I'm talking about countries like the (INAUDIBLE) of Ruble, which we've seen weakness.</p><p>MCDOWELL: It's not just the currency, it's the commodities themselves being weak and Russia put the pressure on the buyers.</p><p>BLOCK: Yes, and that's the whole thing and that's the whole punch line here is that, you know, what happens to commodities is going to affect housing in this country -</p><p>SMITH: It's going to affect everything.</p><p>BLOCK: Because of the dollar.</p><p>BLOCK: All right, coming up guys, there is still no verdict in the Tom Brady deflate-gate case and now some analyst think the NFL may wait an entire year to hand down a ruling. Oh, joy. Our next guest wrote the book on Brady and he's going to weigh in on deflate-gate next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>SMITH: It's Hot outside. Temperatures rising across the country and we are facing a heat wave. Maria Molina is in the Fox Weather Center with the details. Maria, another hot day, another hot week?</p><p>MARIA MOLINA, FOX WEATHER CENTER: Yes, it looks like it's going to be another hot one across many areas in the country and for us in New York City for instance, we're going to be hot today, but we're going to start to feel relief already as we head into Tomorrow with a cold front that's going to be swing through dropping those temperatures and humidity levels. But if you live in the southeast or across parts of the plains, expect those hot temperatures to remain in place at least for several more days. Parts of Oklahoma, you're not expecting any relief pretty much for most of this workweek.</p><p>So, again, different areas expecting to see a relief or no relief and different time periods. So you can see a look at the high temperatures for today. 90s and triple digits across parts of the plains as we head eastward, high temperatures widespread into the 90s and the problem is that it's not just hot on thermometer, but you also have a lot of humidity in place out there and that's what makes it feel a lot hotter than what temperatures say.</p><p>So, this is what it's going to feel like as we head out the door. In Wilmington, by 5:00 p.m., it should feel like 108, 106 in Montgomery, Vicksburg 107 and triple-digit heat index values as well across parts of the plains. So again, it's really what it's going to feel like out there that's the issue and those heat advisories in place out here because of those high heat index values. Excesses heat warnings also in place portions of the Carolinas. And I do want to mention that there is a chance for some showers and storms different parts of the country today. A very low risk for severe weather, but it is in place out there across the plains, Mid- Atlantic and also in the northeast. Sandra?</p><p>SMITH: All right, Maria. Thank you. Well still, no verdict in the Tom Brady deflate-gate case and should there be one? There is talk of waiting on punishment for the New England Patriots quarterback until after the season. We bring in \"New York Dailey News\" NFL columnist and author of upcoming \"Brady versus Manning: The Untold Story of the Rivalry that Transformed the NFL\". Gary Myers. Gary, good morning to you.</p><p>GARY MEYERS, NFL COLUMNIST AND AUTHOR (via telephone): Good morning. How are you?</p><p>SMITH: Alright. So, a lot of people have made the case for waiting to finalize the punishment the Patriots after analyzing all this data over the 2015 season. Are you saying - do you make the same case for that?</p><p>MYERS: Well, I think what would make sense from the standpoint that it would give NFL an opportunity to -- to measure these footballs you know, during, you know, the course of the game, especially during the wintertime, when -- you know, the Patriots are claiming that the ball's naturally lose air, you know, due to the weather conditions. But I don't know how realistic it is that the NFL is going to want to -- you know, put this off for a full year and wait to hand out the punishment to -- to the Patriots, and, you know, put punishment on hold for the Patriots that they have already handed out.</p><p>SMITH: And by the way, Gary, you're talking about punishment for Patriots, but there's punishment -- Peter King over at the nnqb.com, he takes this a step further and says any punishment for Tom Brady should be put off as well.</p><p>MYERS: Right. That's what I was about to say is that even more importantly than punishment to the Patriots would be, you know, the punishment to Tom Brady, and, you know, from the standpoint of really getting an accurate indication of what, you know, the effect of the weather conditions are, on footballs, which the NFL has never done -- that would seem to be, you know, a fair solution before, you know, enacting all the punishment. But, again, I don't know how realistic it is if the NFL's going to want to defer this for a full year and go through the process of doing this you know, complete, you know work-up of what happens to the football during the course of the game, I'm not sure that's going to happen.</p><p>BLOCK: Hey Gary, you know, let me be blunt here. Is the NFL worried about derailing the gravy train here or what are?</p><p>MYERS: Derailing Brady train.</p><p>BLOCK: Yes, you know, taking Brady out of the game. Is that going to ruin money their maker here? Are they just a little reticent about that? Is there any thought about that?</p><p>MYERS: No, I don't think that has anything to do -- uh -- with this situation. NFL is basically an ATM machine and you know, whether Tom Brady plays the first game, second game or up to, you know, or missing the first four games, I don't think that's going to have any impact on the revenue.</p><p>SMITH: Alright Gary. Let me bring in money angle here because despite all these scandal that we're talking, that the NFL has been dealing with and facing, the teams are still making a lot of money. More than $225 million dollars each on revenue sharing for the NFL.</p><p>MYERS: Well, I mean, we know they can make an absolute incredible amount of money just from national TV contracts alone and they make a lot of money from their local revenue. I mean, it's no secret that the NFL is an extremely profitable business. Some of the numbers came out yesterday because the Green Bay Packers are publicly owned, and those numbers are -- are made public. But, again, as this relates to Brady, I don't know that one player has any kind of impact on -- on the kind of revenue that the NFL can generate. Now, it certainly could impact TV ratings the first couple of weeks in just in Patriot games, that Brady, you know, plays or doesn't play, depending on what happens, but I don't know overall that it makes one bit of difference, you know, term of how much NFL is making.</p><p>SMITH: Alright. Gary Myers thanks for joining us this morning and thank you to Michael Block for joining me for the hour.</p><p>MYERS: All right, take care.</p><p>SMITH: Alright. Thank you both. Next hour, a \"Breaking Bad\" actor is looking to take his role on TV to real life announcing plans to run for public office New Mexico. He'll join us next hour.

Meanwhile, Verizon among the companies reporting earning this morning ahead of the opening bell. Analyst looking for $1.01 a share. That's up from $0.91 cents a year ago.

I supported him. I raised a lot of money for his campaign against President Obama and certainly if there was a misunderstanding, I would totally take that back.</p><p>(END AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>SMITH: Trump has to say come under heavy fire for his comment questioning Senator McCain's heroism as a prisoner of war. But According to a new \"Washington Post/ABC News\" poll, he still holds 24 percent of Republicans support. The largest lead recorded by any GOP candidate this year. Although this number is strong, it must be noted that this poll was finalized before coverage of his comment about Senator McCain became widespread.</p><p>But the headlines did not stop there. The \"Des Moines Register\", Iowa's largest newspaper is now calling on Trump to drop out of the 2016 race saying quote \"Trump should pull the plug on his bloviating sideshow\". Alright Mercedes, some pretty strong words from the key primary state's newspaper. Look, I mean leading in the polls, I'll be it, that was before these most recent comments. Everybody's talking about him. I mean, what have - what is he currently doing for the race?</p><p>MERCEDES COLWIN, ATTORNEY: I mean, certainly he's the game changer because you don't know what he's going to say next. He plays by the rules, he says what's on his mind. There really isn't that much --</p><p>SMITH: The \"Des Moines Register\" calling for him to step out of the race.</p><p>COLWIN: It's true because it's his third rail. When you start criticizing veterans, especially the GOP candidate, that is the third rail. You should not touch it. And certainly will it have traction? Who knows. But now that the media's doing --</p><p>SMITH: Steve, how could he even let those words leave his mouth and not know that there was going to be a fire storm?</p><p>STEVE CORTES, VERACRUZ: Well look, why? Because he's not a serious candidate and this is serious business by the way. The Unites States has slow growth, we're in a very dangerous world. This is no time for the bloviating and demagoguery of a reality show. And that's what <person><nameText>Donald Trump's </nameText></person>about. This is about building his brand. This isn't really about making America better. I believe he is - I agree completely with \"The Des Moines Register\". He is a political dirty bomb for the Republican party, particularly in terms of the party's outreach to Hispanics. He has told the largest emerging demographic group in America we think you're rapist, we don't want your support and a group, by the way, which is dying to be Republican.</p><p>SMITH: To be fair, though, he found a sweet spot. He's polling well.</p><p>CORTES: He has for now. But you know, asking a poll right now about the 2016 race is like asking a 5-year old at July what do you want for Christmas. There is going to be so many changes between now and the race. Remember in the last cycle how many different people had the front runners status at one time or another, had a cup of coffee as the front runner.</p><p>SMITH: So Mercedes, the question had been is <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>going to help or hurt the GOP party. I mean, there's just this deep bench there. And do you think it's going to help the party to have that many contenders?</p><p>COLWIN: He is so polarized. Well, it's certainly not helpful that you have all these individuals that are on the platform. And you got, you need, especially the polls. It's at 24 percent now and I agree with you. I think it's going - we'll see what happens as it goes on. But frankly, he's got - Trump tremendous popularity and obviously he rates with the polls, but a lot of individuals are looking to him and saying you're not going to be like these other candidates. You're going to say what's on your mind. Maybe that's what this world needs.</p><p>CORTES: I do think - listen, I will give him this. He clearly is striking a nerve out there in this country, but I think that nerve is because of sluggish growth. I think middle America feel squeezed and they should. They're wages are not rising, they're cost are rising dramatically particularly in terms of healthcare and education. So, there's a lot of angst out there. And a guy like this who will forcefully say exactly what he believes and appear to be kind of angry, I think that resonates.</p><p>SMITH: What? That he'll be the greatest jobs President that ever lived? Alright. Well speaking of the deep bench by the way guys, we got to add this in here. Ohio<person><nameText>Governor John Kasich </nameText></person>set to jump into the 2016 White House race adding to the number of GOP candidates out there. Blake Burman has the latest in Washington for that. Blake?</p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FOX BUSINESS: Hi there Sandra. Good morning to you. John Kasich will indeed make it official in Ohio later today. Kasich is the current Governor of that swing state and the former Congressmen. In between those two stints, he also worked at Lehman Brothers. This would be Kasich's second attempt at a White House run and he'll start with a lot of ground to make up in a very crowded GOP field. Kasich currently polls in around one to two percent of support from Republicans. That puts him just outside the top 10 for now. The field for the moment appears to be set for the GOP. 16 candidates with either political or business name recognition. They'll be jockeying for separation as the debates begin in the upcoming weeks and the first votes are cast in Iowa, which is a little more than six months from now. Sandra?</p><p>SMITH: Getting interesting. Alright.</p><p>BURMAN: Certainly is.</p><p>SMITH: Blake, thank you. Alright, gold prices, they're getting interesting as well. Prices there searching for some direction after plunging to the lowest level in five years on rate hike dears. Phil Flynn from the CME Group, he's joining us by phone this morning, bright and early Phil. This move in gold, everybody's watching it. Where does it go from here?</p><p>PHIL FLYNN, PRICES FUTURES GROUP: You know, that's the big question Sandra and I agree with you. A lot of this is fears about the Fed raising interest rates, but this (INAUDIBLE) in gold may be the reason why the Fed can't. You know, a lot of people are asking questions whether this drop in the gold market could really, you know, be like a cancer to the rest of the commodities complex because it wasn't just gold they took a hit yesterday. We were seeing industrial metals across the board under pressure with the strong dollar. If we're getting into a situation where this drop in the gold market is signaling another round of deflation on the globe, it's going to make it very difficult for the Fed to start raising rates if these deflationary pressures are starting to rise.</p><p>SMITH: So Steve, let me -- Phil, you're going to stay with us for a second. Steve, I look at gold prices at where they are right now. $1106 a troy ounce. My feeling is that they test $1000 an ounce, but you're the expert. Tell me.</p><p>CORTES: Yes, well. I hope I'm an expert on something Sandra. But yes, listen. I completely agree. I think commodity deflation has been in a trench force for years and I think it's going to continue to be. I agree with Phil very much. I think that Fed is really put in a bind by this. Although they want to talk about raising rates this year, I'm not sure that they can. When you have commodities, broad commodities (INAUDIBLE) at decade lows. You have - and it's across the board. Sugar hit a six-year low yesterday. Gold - if it comes out of the ground basically, it's increasingly worth less. Whether it's agricultural metals, energy. So we're seeing broad-based deflation. I believe it's primarily because of China slowing and because of volatility in the Chinese market that is broadening throughout the globe. But that is not the backdrop under which the Fed probably gets aggressive raising rates.</p><p>SMITH: You know and Phil, I keep talking about the U.S. dollar because everything that Steve just mentioned is denominated in the greenback. So, you get that strengthening in the U.S. dollar as we anticipate that first rate hike. You get a sell-off in commodities. That's a natural sort of process that's we're seeing play out there. We had a Fed President in this show yesterday say that that rate hike is likely coming by the end of this year. Where do you - what camp are you in as far as that first interest rate hike at this point?</p><p>FLYNN: Well prior to yesterday's drop in gold, I thought the Fed was going to do it and it almost no matter what because they got through some of the biggest crisis's. You know, concerns about Greece, they were sidetracked. You know, the Chinese stock markets stabilized. So, I thought they had a chance to do it. But then, of course, that Sunday night, that drop in the commodities prices, that can change a complexion. You know, if we don't see stabilization in the commodities. This is going to really put a monkey wrench in the global economic recovery and if the Fed raises rates against the advice of the IMF and we start to really bad deflationary cycle that slows down the rest of the economy, (INAUDIBLE) make it very difficult for the market to move forward.</p><p>SMITH: Alright. Good stuff Phil Flynn as gold sinks to yet more five-year lows. Commodities struggling across the board. Thank you for joining us this morning.</p><p>Temperatures meanwhile rising across the country. We're facing a heat wave. Maria Molina is in the Fox weather center with the details and the latest on that. Maria?</p><p>MARIA MOLINA, FOX WEATHER CENTER: It's hot outside.</p><p>SMITH: Yes, I mean -</p><p>MOLINA: Good morning. We're going to be seeing those temperatures climbing yet again today and that's in place across parts of the South, the south east and also after you head up the east coast along the I95 corridor. Take a look at some of these numbers today. So, these are the actual forecast temperatures. Forecast to reach 99 in Dallas, 100 Del Rio, farther east into the 90s as well across parts of the south east up unto places like New York City.</p><p>But the problem is that when you factors in the humidity, it feels a lot hotter than what the thermometer reads. And this is what it's going to feel like coming up later on this afternoon. 106 degrees in Montgomery and also in Vicksberg and Atlanta's going to feel like 97. 108 degrees in Wilmington and farther north in Washington D.C., it's going to feel like 97 degrees out there as we head out the door. So, that's why we have heat advisories in effect out here across the south and also into the Carolinas and southeast Virginia. Excessive heat warnings in effect as well with those heat index value forecast to climb into the triple digits. Sandra?</p><p>SMITH: Alright. Maria, thank you. Quick reaction from you guys. Hot weather across the country. Steve, mean, I'm a Midwest girl. I start to think about our crops and the agricultural market in the United States when temperatures like that. But I mean, just in general, this is a game changer. Retail, everything affected by these temperatures.</p><p>CORTES: You know. It's interesting. After a couple of really harsh winters and by the way, companies got very used to blaming poor results during the winter on bad weather in the winter. It'll be interesting to see if they try to do that now in the summer.</p><p>SMITH: Exactly.</p><p>CORTES: I tend to think that blame it on the rain was a really bad song by Milli Vanilli. It was a bad excuse for economics. But well see, but yes, you know, obviously - maybe Al Gore was on to something. It's been pretty darn hot lately. Manhattan yesterday, I wondered if I was in Manhattan or if I was in Mecca, Saudi Arabia because it was near 100 degrees intense humidity. Clearly it's happening all over the country.</p><p>COLWIN: But intense weather drives individuals out of this weather in into the stores. I mean - represent federated stores and they love this weather because the consumers are going in. They're going into shop. They're doing this to getting out of the hot weather.</p><p>SMITH: I can already see the climate change conversations all over the general, the media, all over the different channels. I mean, this is the hottest summer they're saying on record. I mean, Mercedes, there are going to be big political talking points on that.</p><p>COLWIN: Oh no. undoubtedly.</p><p>SMITH: Accurate or not. Alright, well the NASDAQ notching it's third record close-in-a-row. Is this a sign that they could be approaching another tech bubble? We'll discuss that next and take a look at some of these other headlines that we're watching this morning in \"The Wall Street Journal\". Fed tells big banks to shrink, Toshiba's CEO felled by accounting scandal and shooting highlights online gun sales.</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING: \"IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT\" - BILLY JOEL)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>SMITH: A fresh record for the NASDAQ this morning. The tech-heavy index closing yesterday at a record for third session-in-a-row sparking debates about whether we're approaching bubble territory. I should note that NASDAQ futures are the lone winner this morning pointing to another record on the open on Wall Street this morning. Here's what the St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bowler exclusively told our own Peter Barnes yesterday.</p><p>(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>(INTERVIEW WITH ST. LOUIS FED RESERVE PRESIDENT PETER BARNES)</p><p>(END AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>SMITH: Hmnn. This is just as Apple, Microsoft, Yahoo! are gearing up to report results after the bell today. Steve, do you think that we have a tech bubble in our hand and should a Federal Reserve President be talking about the stock market like that?</p><p>CORTES: Well, let me answer the second first. No, they should not be. And by the way, the Fed's record on prognostication has been pretty terrible is go all the way back down greenspan irrational exuberance. That was a great time to buy. Janet Yellen a year ago said more or less the same thing about biotechs. She got sectors specific, which I though was pretty strange. Biotech has soared ever since then. So, their forecasting ability is poor generally, specially when it come to stocks. Are we in a tech bubble? No, I don't believe so. But is it frothy? Yes. I absolutely think so. It's been quite a run. My problem -</p><p>SMITH: What's the frothy based on?</p><p>CORTES: Because is too narrow. My problem with the market is it's relying far too much on just a few names. So, names like Facebook, Netflix, Google are absolutely soaring right now. But Apple, which is going to report and by the way, I like Apple. I think it's relatively cheap. Apple, and this is very unusual, is not keeping pace with technology overall. Normally, Apple is the driver of the bus, is leading the tech party whether it's up or down. The fact that the general is not leading the army here, Apple in front of tech worries me that things are getting frothy, but is it a bubble, no.</p><p>A bubble is the year 2000 when grandma owned the globe.com and pets.com and multi-billion-dollar valuations on companies that didn't make money. We're not there, we're not at that kind of leverage. But, is it a dangerous spot? Yes, I think so. Is it a spot to put new money to work? I do not believe that, no.</p><p>SMITH: Interesting. So, Mercedes, from a consumer standpoint, I don't know. You look around, you walk around New York City and you feel like the market is saturated with Apple products. You know, you wonder do they have any tools left in the tool chest there. I mean, can they continue on this sort of pace? I mean, are we going to rush out to buy the next Apple product?</p><p>COLWIN: It's amazing because certainly with the Iphone watch, people were just rushing to get - to purchase that and I think there's still that traction. People still looking for a technology. But, there are also a lot of individuals, especially the newer little tech companies. A lot of the start-up tech companies. They are inspired by these big, by the big tech companies. They're saying to themselves well, look at how much market share they have. We can take a slice of - even if we just take one percent of that market share. So, we see a lot of these little tech companies come a long and a lot of consumers look to them for the more interesting products out there.</p><p>SMITH: So Steve, Apple's at $132 a share. You would say don't require it at these levels, but also don't sell it.</p><p>CORTES: Yes, I would say. I would say this, I have no idea what they're going to do on earnings, but if it gets hit on earnings, I'd get very interested then because by most traditional metrics, even though this is a massively valued company in terms of its market value. By most market metrics, it's actually relatively cheap for a company that has this kind of growth. And so, and I think listen, their ability to innovate and I was a doubter once Steve Jobs had to step down. I was a doubter that necessarily new management take the baton and run and it sure seems they have. I know this is just anecdotal, but in my house, my wife and I have four kids. There were more apple products in our house than I think there are in an Apple store. So, I see it personally. I see it hands on how much kids gravitate to this stuff and user-friendly nature of it. And so, this is a pretty special company, but tech overall I think it's a time to be cautious.</p><p>SMITH: Alright. Well don't forget to tune in today at 4:00 p.m. Eastern on \"After the battle\".

Cheryl Casone is here that and other top stories. Good morning Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS: Hey, good morning Sandra. Good morning everybody. Well the stock rising nearly six percent on the day Monday. It had jumped some 11 percent at one point in mid day trading. Take a look at what it's doing this morning, pointing to a little bit of a higher open even today, PYPL is the ticker. Already more than half a dozen research shops has a buy rating on this stock. And again, this stock should likely open higher at 9:30 a.m. Eastern time.</p><p>Business booming for the NFL. Each team receiving $226.4 million dollars last year as part national revenue sharing. Most of the money comes from the league's television deals and the price tag was revealed when the Green Bay Packers released it's shares part of the team's earnings report. \\</p><p>And finally, this video of South Carolina's Director of Public Safety, Leroy Smith going viral after Smith helped a white man wearing a racist T- shirt to the shade at the top of the statehouse steps on Saturday. Tensions were high in Charleston as supporters of the Ku Klux Klan and the Black Panthers clashed outside of the South Carolina capital. Sandra, Director Smith hopes this video going to be a catalyst for people to work towards overcoming hate and violence. And social media has been called one of the most powerful acts of kindness that you could witness.</p><p>And it's interesting that the videos go viral because it really shows you the pulse of what's happening out in the nation and how people are really talking about race and very emotional about it right now.</p><p>SMITH: Mercedes, what do you make of this?</p><p>COLWIN: I mean. I think it's just absolutely beautiful, especially because racial tensions are so high. To that, there's no wonder that it's gone viral. There's people hoping. They want something. They want a change.</p><p>CASONE: Well this is over the Confederate flag, by the way, as well. They we're pulling down the Confederate flag at that statehouse. And that's where this whole event happened. You know, all these states now across the country are having to face the issue.</p><p>SMITH: Amazing story.</p><p>CORTES: You know I have to say, this kindness by a African-American police officer for someone who clearly hate in his heart for him and to respond to that hate with love and with the kindness of his heart is really an inspiring act. I think it is emblematic though of what is going on in broader society. We're not a racist society. We're society that elected a black President twice. If anything, race relations were getting much better. By the way,. I worry that our President is harming race relations. For instance, this race database that's been unveiled this week. That's identity politics. That divides people rather than unites. So I think that in fact, though the American people are far more like that African- American police officer rather than that racist with the terrible T-shirt on.</p><p>CASONE: That's a good point. Sandra and I yesterday were so surprised yesterday about Martin O'Malley, you know? I remember him (INAUDIBLE) Well why? What did he say that was so wrong? Why are people so upset about that. And that the question is have we gone too far?</p><p>SMITH: You said it best. Tensions and emotions are running high on this subject right now in this country. Has been for quite some time. Alright guys. Thank you much and thank you, Cheryl. We'll see you again in just a little bit. Meanwhile, dozens dead after a terror attack in Turkey near the Syrian border.

The bombing is believed to have been a suicide attack carried out by an ISIS militant. And my next guest says this ISIS attack on Turkey was only a matter of time. Joining me now is FOX NewsNational Security Analyst Katie McFarland. Good morning for you Katie.</p><p>KATIE MCFARLAND, FOX NEWSNATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST: Good morning.</p><p>SMITH: Thank you for being here bright and early. Unfortunately, some horrible news here, but now Turkey?</p><p>MCFARLAND: Yeah. And it's only a matter of time. Why? For a couple of reasons. One, ISIS to be considered the vanguard movement of radical Islam has to keep moving. It can't just consolidate its gains. It's got to keep growing. So you've seen it in Afghanistan, you've seen attacks in Northern Africa, now you're seeing Turkey. So it had to expand over the border.</p><p>When I've met with the president of Iraq last year, and he said, you know, they had feel the Islamic State, ISIS feels they have been chosen by Allah to rule the world. So in mere minds they've got to keep expanding. Number two, this is how they do it. They start with suicide bombers, they get into an area, they then recruit locally, they send in Jihadi fighters, then they start an insurgency with the idea that they're going to then eventually claim territory and join it up with the Islamic State.</p><p>But the reason I figure that it was going to be Turkey, rather than other places sooner or later, Turkey has a very poorest border. We have seen, you know, the stories of all the foreign fighters that were coming from...</p><p>SMITH: Yup.</p><p>MCFARLAND: ... you know, hundreds of countries. They were going to fight with ISIS. They were coming through that Turkish border, that same place where the attack was. Similarly, they have come out the ISIS fighters and refugees have come out of that region through Turkey then expand into Greece and to Europe. In the refugee pact, it's been faltered (ph) with Jihadists...</p><p>SMITH: So you said that this was sort of expected...</p><p>MCFARLAND: Yeah.</p><p>SMITH: ... but now that it happened, how much of a game changer is this?</p><p>MCFARLAND: Now, we have to see what Turkey does. Is Turkey going to put up the fight? They have famously last year in the Battle for Kobane, which is the big city near there on the other side of the Turkish border, the ISIS took Turkish tanks sat on the Turkish border and they watched as ISIS came in, took the town, slaughtered the Kurdish population there. So will Turkey join the battle? Will the Turkey join the battle in Syria and Iraq that, you know, the Islamic State? Or will Turkeys just say I'm going to defend our borders? Will Turkey tighten up its borders? And then the other question is what role does NATO play? You know, where are the NATO alliance? Turkey is a NATO ally. Will they take this as an attack against Turkey and call for help from the NATO ally?</p><p>SMITH: We're always talking about how ISIS is staying so powerful.</p><p>MCFARLAND: Yeah.</p><p>SMITH: I mean, what is the latest on the amount of money that they have been able to raise or make, I should say, on the black market with oil? And I mean, what kind of money are they dealing with today? Are they still able to pull in as much as they were before?</p><p>MCFARLAND: Yeah.</p><p>SMITH: Are they're still strengthening in such large numbers?</p><p>MCFARLAND: The interesting thing is to save money for ISIS came probably from some wealthy Gulf Arab families, not countries families, and that's what started them.</p><p>When my experience with Iraq has been what happened at the end of the Iraq war was the Saddam Hussein fighters, (inaudible) in the Iraqi army married up with these radical Islamic extremists and that's what form the core of ISIS. So they received money from the Gulf Arabs, but when they started taking territory they eluded a lot of the antiquities and they sold these on the open market. The next thing was they then got ahold of oil refineries and then they sold those.</p><p>SMITH: And there's always the money angle that you're watching on there.</p><p>STEVE CORTES, VERACRUZ LLC FOUNDER: No. And I do think there's a business angle of this, not to sound callous because it's a real human tragedy, but there is a business angle and I think it's United States defense firms. We live in an incredibly dangerous world. There is bipartisan agreement. The Democrats (inaudible) of defense spending just about as much as Republicans do, which isn't the norm. There's been a lot of M&amp;A and deals in the space. Lockheed Martin's stock that's really taken off in the last few weeks. So I think in a dangerous world as an investor, the defense sector remains very, very attractive.</p><p>SMITH: And then there's obviously, Mercedes, the questions about U.S. involvement and cooperation with Turkey on this.</p><p>MERCEDES COLWIN, FOX NEWSCONTRIBUTOR: Oh no, undoubtedly. So we'll have to see how it sort of plays out, but this is certainly something to watch and we'll see how (inaudible).</p><p>SMITH: All right. Katie McFarland...</p><p>MCFARLAND: Thank you San (ph). Thank you.</p><p>SMITH: ... thank you for joining us this morning on that.</p><p>And 3D piracy has become a big issue in Hollywood. Nicole Petallides is here with that story. Good morning Nicole.</p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX AM CO-HOST: Good morning Sandra. This is a business story, a text story, the rise of 3D printers is a problem for Hollywood. The printers allow anyone who owns them to build products such as the Stormtrooper gun (ph) from Star Wars, and their own without even buying a toy. They can make it on their own doing this would actually lose money from movie studios who make these products to get a profit of course. It could also force the studios to charge less for the items, so they can be more attractive to the consumers.</p><p>So, this is a problem that is very similar to music piracy that was around in the early 2000s which forced the music industry to change. And so what we're watching, we've seen piracy. We've seen it with the records, right, and music when the (inaudible) of the artist come out with new music. We've seen illegally copied movies. And now, you talk about the products and you know so well the products, that's how these they make so much money off of these, Hasbro for example, even yesterday talked about the Star Wars products, the X-Men products just to name a few. So your thoughts, I mean, 3D printing is all the way.</p><p>SMITH: So Mercedes, it sounds like a legal question to me.</p><p>COLWIN: Oh yeah.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SMITH: What can the movie studios do to stop this?</p><p>COLWIN: Well, this is great, because what they can do is first, they're going to start sending up these letters. They have to discover who is actually printing these letters, so if they're selling. Who knows if they're printing it and they're creating these products, if they're selling it, send out those letters, cease and desist letters. They lawyer up immediately. They bring in the court system, and they said, \"Of course, we are losing so much money.\"</p><p>And by the way, because it's immediate -- there's an immediate loss, you can go in for temporary restraining order, with the court say, \"You have(ph) to stop this immediately,\" and that's when the penalties step in. And then, of course, you got the D.A.'s office, again, that's how it's stopped with an answer. Get the prosecutors involved, tell them that they are doing this illegally, get prosecutors to start doing it and get one with those cases and that's how will do it.</p><p>CORTES: Right. And that's a great legal point and I don't doubt that all of the studios will be really effective but I will say on a business angle, a technology angle, 3D printing to me is just transformative technology. And I think long term because what people do in their home is going to be very hard to enforce, right, to interdict, they are printing something in their house. And I think the 3D printing all of the stocks have been miserably, and I'm not saying investing in necessarily right now.</p><p>COLWIN: Right.</p><p>SMITH: So you bring that up...</p><p>PETALLIDES: Right.</p><p>SMITH: That's an interesting point because everybody told us over the past couple of years that 3D printing was the wave of the future...</p><p>COLWIN: Right.</p><p>SMITH: ... everyone is going to be doing it, everyone is going to have these in their homes and they're going to be printing everything from...</p><p>PETALLIDES: I don't know. I don't know.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>COLWIN: I don't know.</p><p>SMITH: Now, literally, I mean, I remember on Varney's show we had 3D printers coming in and making shoes...</p><p>CORTES: Right.</p><p>COLWIN: Yeah.</p><p>SMITH: But I don't have one in my house. Do you guys have a 3D printer in your house?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: No.</p><p>CORTES: Right.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yeah.</p><p>SMITH: It just the story never really came to fruition.</p><p>CORTES: But we often get excited in a market. We often get excited about technology before it's a reality. If for instance, we talked really about the tech bubble. The tech bubble in the year 2000, we got far too excited...</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Right.</p><p>CORTES: ... too early about the internet. But that doesn't mean that the internet didn't become transformative...</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: That's true. That's true.</p><p>CORTES: ... and there are companies that made it like Google became absolute guerrillas.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PETALLIDES: In 3D, one last thing, I will tell you one last thing. Some of the movie studios are actually embracing those 3D printing enthusiasts and sending them codes so they can actually make something. And so hope -- maybe that -- maybe the other way to go with it instead of trying to prosecute and figure out who conceptualize this, who printed it, who, you know, wrote the code.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Right.</p><p>PETALLIDES: Maybe it's the other way around in trying actually to get it out there yourself and sell those code files and make some money. Yeah.</p><p>SMITH: I should say that to be sure here is that at a commercial level, the 3D printers are being used...</p><p>CORTES: Right.</p><p>SMITH: ... much more than I think that what we're seeing at the consumer level...</p><p>CORTES: Right.</p><p>SMITH: ... for now at least.</p><p>All right, Nicole, thank you.</p><p>PETALLIDES: All right.</p><p>SMITH: All right, don't forget to start your day with Nicole, Lauren Simonetti, and me on FBN:AM, every morning at 5:00 a.m. Catch us right here on the Fox Business Network. We're here bright and early get you ready for your day.</p><p>Meanwhile, coming up, startling new numbers about the class of 2015 and the major issue that could follow them for the rest of their lives.

By 2017, listen to this, the retailer will overtake Macy's Department Store, the top retailer in the U.S. That's according to our report released by Cowen and Company yesterday. Amazon is offering brands like Gucci, Kate Spade and Levis but doesn't have to pay overhead costs for retail stores.</p><p>All right, Cowen's upgraded Amazon to outperform and forecast the company's growth merchandize value in apparel and accessories to grow to over $27 billion in 2017 that would top Macy's.</p><p>Steve, we had another great report on Amazon's potential. Are you in agreement here? Is the environment's still good for Amazon?</p><p>CORTES: Well, yes and no. I'm in agreement, yes, because I think Amazon is an incredible company and I think they have created barriers to entry because of how much they have spent on technology, on infrastructure that it's very, very difficult to become a competitor to Amazon.</p><p>Now, I wish the company cared more about making money. That bothers me as an investor. But I will disagree with the thesis that it's going to become such an apparel powerhouse. Because I think, apparel is the one spot where online commerce is pretty challenged. I would tell you personally, I certainly don't want to buy at least expensive clothes, you know, to buy sort of the commodity, apparel item is fine. But to buy expensive clothes online, if you can't feel it, touched or tried on, I think there going to be challenge there. I love the company but I don't think this is the reasons to love this.</p><p>SMITH: You clearly are not shopping online then, because...</p><p>COLWIN: Yes</p><p>SMITH: ... everybody is buying clothes online now.</p><p>COLWIN: Exactly.</p><p>SMITH: I mean, people don't want to go into the stores. They don't want to try clothes on. And when Amazon or Zappos and all these, you know, delivery sites, when they make it so easy to return...</p><p>COLWIN: That's it.</p><p>SMITH: ... that's really key.</p><p>COLWIN: That's a key to it. It's just the return policy. If you give me a box where I can ship it back or give me a label I can ship it back, great, I'm going to purchase from you. So gone are the days since you're going to go in into those fitting rooms, into the stores where there's crowds and there's all sorts of issues that when you actually step into mall, they don't want that. They don't want the hassle. It's so much easier to do it online.</p><p>SMITH: Steve, your wife must do all the shopping?</p><p>COLWIN: Yeah.</p><p>CORTES: Yeah, that's true. Right.</p><p>COLWIN: People don't need the Brooks Brothers.</p><p>SMITH: Oh men, Amazon's shares, by the way, of 57 percent this year alone. So that climb continues.</p><p>New details emerging about the dark past of the Tennessee gunman who killed five American servicemen. Cheryl Casone is here with the latest headlines on that story for us this morning, Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, NEWS ANCHOR: Hey, good morning Sandra. You have a gunman behind that Chattanooga terror attack reportedly wrote about becoming a martyr. Reports said that Mohammad Abdulazeez also wrote about committing suicide after he lost a job two years ago because of drug abuse. The 24- year-old opened fire at two military facilities on Thursday killing four marines and a sailor before he was killed by police.</p><p>A massive corporate scandal in Japan, Toshiba's CEO has resigned after investigators linked him to an accounting scandal. The probe (ph) found the electronics giant overstated profits by more than $1.2 billion over seven years.</p><p>And finally, new outrage over the staggering amount of student loan debt in America. The New York feds says American students are in debt to the tune of $1.2 trillion. That equals $35,000 for every student who graduated this year of to $2,000 from last year.</p><p>OK, Sandra, we know the Class 2015 are going to be the most indebted class at American history. And it's not just them that are getting kind of the screws frankly, it's their parents because these kids are getting out of school, they're so saddled with debt, they're not making any money, the wages are down and they can't move out of the house. And then that parent is now dealing with trying to get the kid out of the house and their elderly parents are coming in. It's a crisis.</p><p>SMITH: And it's affecting, Cheryl, every aspects of the economy, Steve. I mean, if they're coming out of a school with this much debt, then they're not buying homes...</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Right.</p><p>SMITH: ... they're choosing to get...</p><p>CORTES: Right.</p><p>SMITH: ... married much later, they're not buying cars. That whole economic cycle that has been over the past many decades is no longer...</p><p>CORTES: Right. This is -- listen, this is the sad unintended consequences of government policy, right? This is central planning, I think, at its absolute worst. When the government gets involved in any business or service, prices go up and the quality of that service goes down. That is certainly happened in terms of college.</p><p>So the price has skyrocketed, people borrow more and more but the degree they earn is generally worth less and less. So this is really a problem. I mean, this is -- when I graduated college, I did not have any money, I had to go live at home for a couple of months, I could not wait to get...</p><p>SMITH: Right.</p><p>CORTES: I was sleeping in the bunk bed that I grew up in as a 22-year-old male.</p><p>CASONE: So, I guess, your stand is we should not forgive student loan debt in anyway. She had (ph) perform...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SMITH: I mean, Mercedes, that's what they're talking about, is the government talks about just wiping out the student loan debt.</p><p>COLWIN: Right.</p><p>SMITH: Are they probably making the situation even worst than worst?</p><p>COLWIN: Oh, undoubtedly, because who's going to pay the -- ultimately, all of us is taxpayers. I mean, what are you doing? It's such a...</p><p>CORTES: And the point is...</p><p>COLWIN: And it is a tragedy to these kids. You're talking about $60,000 a year tuition. You're talking about the highest...</p><p>SMITH: Yeah.</p><p>COLWIN: ... number of individuals that are unemployed. These kids coming out of graduates out of schools are 40 to 50 percent unemployed. You don't hear about that but this is the truth. They can't get job.</p><p>SMITH: All right. Well, thank you for that enlightening story this morning, Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE: Of course.</p><p>SMITH: Thank you for brightening our 6:00 a.m. hour.</p><p>CASONE: Yeah.</p><p>SMITH: A new pullout, morning diet programs like Weight Watchers and Jenny Craig won't work for the majority of their obese clients trying to reach normal weight. We've got the details, the latest study on that next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>SMITH: A new study published in the American Journal of Public Health suggests that most obese Americans who do not get some kind of surgery will never -- (inaudible) for us for Dagen.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS: This is a national health crisis and it's also a financial crisis...</p><p>SMITH: Yeah.</p><p>CDOWELL: ... we should point out. This is a study again and published according to -- we're talking about the body mass index in American Journal of Public Health, that the probability of obese people reaching normal weight is less than 1 percent. And here, the numbers 1 in 210 obese men have a probability of reaching a normal weight, this is without any kind of surgery, 1 in 124 obese women.</p><p>You get a morbid obesity which is an even larger body mass index. Those odds go down to 1 in 1,290 men and 1 in 677 women. So it becomes nearly impossible to get down to a normal weight once you become obese or morbidly obese. And you want to talk about the cost, more than 305 billion in direct and indirect cost of obesities annually in terms of lost productivity, the increased health care cost.</p><p>And people complain about the government cracking down trying to change what we eat and how we eat, calorie contents on menus, and the like, but there is going to be a whole lot more of that. You have more government in your health care and then you have a population that is increasingly overweight and will probably stay that way. You will have a government that essentially tells you what to eat.</p><p>SMITH: I mean, it's crazy...</p><p>MCDOWELL: Because if the government is funding your health care and your health care costs are related to obesity, it becomes the government's problem. We are asking for it as a country unless we get the...</p><p>CORTES: They -- yeah. We...</p><p>COLWIN: It is a bigger issue too because all these individuals that are morbidly obese actually have protections under discrimination law. So you're binding employers even greater saying, \"Oh no, you can't fire an individual plan (ph) that's been out and extend the period of time.\" You can't accommodate that individual.</p><p>MCDOWELL: On disability too, where...</p><p>COLWIN: Exactly right.</p><p>MCDOWELL: . excessively overweight.</p><p>CORTES: Do you think that as being the government intervention that we're going to see syntaxes, the kinds of things we now see on alcohol and tobacco? Is that coming to butter and sugar or are we going to see that in the future?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well, certainly, the -- some types of crackdowns, it's hard to do that though, but I think that with Mayor Bloomberg here trying to limit the size of soda (ph) you can buy, that was shut down, that didn't happen. But, as the government funds more of your health care, and I'm talking specifically about Medicare but you have...</p><p>SMITH: Come on. Do you think the impacts have really changed behavior?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CORTES: ... won't do it but the...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL: ... on cigarettes. So, cigarettes have -- are so expensive in so many areas that it reduces the amount that people do smoke if not the number of smokers.</p><p>SMITH: Well, that has gotten enough. So, I mean, I haven't looked into lately but a pack of cigarettes in Manhattan...</p><p>MCDOWELL: It's about 10 bucks.</p><p>COLWIN: $10.</p><p>SMITH: Oh, I think it's probably even more than that.</p><p>COLWIN: Yes.</p><p>(Inaudible)</p><p>SMITH: Anyway -- all right. Well, thank you Dagen for bringing...</p><p>MCDOWELL: Thank you.</p><p>SMITH: ... at least (ph) on that study.</p><p>All right. We'll see you in a little bit. And thank you to Steve Cortes and Mercedes for joining us for the 6:00 a.m. hour full of energy.</p><p>COLWIN: Thank you.</p><p>SMITH: So really, good morning. Great to have you guys.</p><p>COLWIN: Thanks for having us.</p><p>SMITH: And we are going to have next hour on Mornings. We're going to be breaking down <person><nameText>Donald Trump's </nameText></person>latest poll numbers, and comments with Former New York Governor George Pataki. That poll is going to be coming up at 7:00 a.m. Eastern Time.</p><p>Please stay right here on Fox Business Network.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2015 Fox NewsNetwork, LLC.

I'm Sandra Smith in for Maria Bartiromo, this  morning. It is Tuesday, July 21st. With me for the hour, Mike Murphy from  Rosecliff Capital and our very own Dagen McDowell.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Here are your top stories at 8:00 a.m. on the East Coast, gold again  trading near its lowest level in five years as more investors prepare for  the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates.</p><p>Futures showing the markets in addition to gold being down, Dow and S&amp;P  Futures also down, Dow Futures off 30 points, Nasdaq Futures are higher,  pointing to another record trade for the Nasdaq today.</p><p>Soaring temperatures across the nation.  Again, the National Oceanic and  Atmospheric Administration saying records were broken for the month of June  and that 2015 is lining up to be the hottest year on record.</p><p>Ohio Governor John Kasich will add his name to the very crowded field of  candidates running for the White House on the Republican side.</p><p>Kasich has plenty of experience in Washington, serving in the house of  Representatives from 1983 to 2001, Donald Trump topping the latest \"Abc- Washington Post\" poll, taking in 24 percent of the support in the  Republican field.</p><p>But that poll came down before Trump's comments about Senator John McCain,  when he said McCain was not a war hero.  Trump told Bill O'Reilly last  night that the senator hasn't done anything for war veterans.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, CHAIRMAN &amp; PRESIDENT, THE TRUMP ORGANIZATIONS &amp; FOUNDER,  TRUMP ENTERTAINMENT RESORTS:  He's supposed to be doing it, and I see him  on television all the time and he is always talking, but nothing gets done.</p><p>These veterans are living in hell, Bill, they're hurting and they're  crying. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>SMITH:  Verizon reporting second quarter earnings last hour, earnings per  share, a $1.04, that topped Wall Street estimate.  </p><p>Apple reporting after the close today, the \"Wall Street Journal\" says the  iPhone accounts for nearly 70 percent of Apple's sales and remains the  company's most profitable product.</p><p>Qualcomm which supplies many of the chips for the iPhone, looking at the  possibility of a breakup.  </p><p>The journal says the company will review its options after an activist  investor pushed for change at the chip maker. </p><p>Zach Johnson, and he is your 2015 British Open champ.

But according  to a new \"Washington Post-Abc News\" poll, he still holds 24 percent of  Republican support. </p><p>The largest lead recorded by any GOP candidate this year, although this  number is strong, it must be noted that the poll was finalized before  coverage of his comments about Senator McCain went widespread.</p><p>But the headlines don't stop there, \"The Des Moines Register\", Iowa's  largest newspaper is now calling on Trump to drop out of the 2016 race,  saying \"Trump should pull the plug on his bloviating sideshow.\"  </p><p>Mike, some pretty strong words from the key primary state newspaper -- </p><p>MIKE MURPHY, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, ROSECLIFF CAPITAL:  Absolutely -- </p><p>SMITH:  This morning -- </p><p>MURPHY:  Yes, and you know, we talked about a month ago, saying that I  didn't believe that Trump would really be a true  contender in this race.</p><p>But now fast forward roughly 30 days, he is leading by far in the polls,  and I think the longer he stays there -- he released his financials.</p><p>And one thing about him, he is way better than anyone else in the race in  getting publicity and getting himself on Bill O'Reilly's show and getting a  big following on Twitter.</p><p>So, I think the longer Trump stays in this race, the worse it is for the  Governor Walkers and the Governor Bushs in the race.  </p><p>SMITH:  But I mean, all the other Republican candidates are having to  answer, Dagen, as we just -- we did it to Governor Pataki, you know,  they're having to respond to all the things that Donald Trump is saying  right now including his criticism of Senator McCain.  </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS:  Right, the new \"New Yorker\" cover portrays  him as -- this is even before him attacking John McCain as doing a giant  belly-flop in the swimming pool and all other Republican candidates have  been as you've been sent to the sides of the poll.   </p><p>But he's gotten down the nasty name-calling that's completely unnecessary.   And if you think that, that's not -- it will be shocking and breath-taking  if that does not hurt him in the polls.</p><p>And now -- but now, he's given -- he is given -- maybe the GOP contenders  are worried about him, but now he's given them a reason to turn on him.</p><p>And he's got to cut -- but he's got to get down to the issues and cut back  on -- I mean, he's going after John McCain and all prisoners of war and  then refuses to apologize.</p><p>I mean people are at the point of getting sick of him, I mean, you look at  what did \"The Des Moines Register\" called him? A feckless blowhard, a  distraction with traction.</p><p>And he has problems in terms of their Christian base as well, when he talks  about his faith, it doesn't resonate with some GOP primary voters. </p><p>MURPHY:  Agreed, but I mean, who would have thought that he would be in  this position today.  You know, he's really in a position to disrupt and if  he is pushed aside by the Republican Party -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  He will run as a third party candidate -- </p><p>SMITH:  Yes, but -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>Still Donald Trump has taken -- and then I go back to -- these have to be  calculated statements.  He has been planning on running for president for  quite some time, he is pouring money into this machine, OK?</p><p>Donald Trump does not plan from the -- so, you, when you look at the  comments he makes about John McCain, those words don't leave your mouth  without knowing the repercussion -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  So, he -- </p><p>SMITH:  OK? -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Always make it a joke probably, like I like people who weren't  captured, he thinks he's funny.  And -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>SMITH:  And you know what they did draw -- if it was truly a mistake, you  don't think he's willing --  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  No -- </p><p>SMITH:  To look back and say -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Absolutely not -- </p><p>SMITH:  Across -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  He --</p><p>SMITH:  Poorly -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Does not -- he does -- well, he's doing it in his own way --   </p><p>SMITH:  Because he's turned it -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Because he -- </p><p>SMITH:  Into a fight for the veterans and for the VA and the -- </p><p>MURPHY:  Right -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The \"Ap\" did a fact check on that by the way, and a lot of what  he was saying and accusing McCain of doing -- saying not -- he hasn't been  an advocate for veterans is absolutely untrue.  </p><p>In terms of trying to reform the VA, Senator John McCain was -- worked  tirelessly to try and turn the VA around, given the horrible state of  healthcare for our veterans --  </p><p>SMITH:  But Donald Trump is -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>Turning this into a message that he can do more and saying, \"that he's done  nothing to help the vets, referring to Senator McCain, he said I will tell  you they are living in hell.</p><p>He says he's going to do more for veterans --   </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But he didn't serve! -- </p><p>SMITH:  And everybody else -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  He got military deferments, he didn't serve in Vietnam and then  attacks prisoners of war. </p><p>SMITH:  I'm just -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Attacking John McCain --  </p><p>SMITH:  Saying there got to be a calculated purpose for these kind of  statements, I don't think that they're just --  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Or -- </p><p>SMITH:  Flew out of his mouth -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Or he didn't -- </p><p>SMITH:  He got -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Have control over his own mouth? </p><p>MURPHY:  I think it's more of that, I think his calculations are to just  mix there up as much controversy as possible, and then if you saw last  night with Bill O'Reilly, if he had just simply -- we've all made mistakes.</p><p>Simply apologize, I made a mistake and moved on -- </p><p>SMITH:  Yes -- </p><p>MURPHY:  It would have been much better for him.   </p><p>SMITH:  Right, and he said if there was a mistake, he would admit to it,  but he didn't do that last night.    </p><p>MCDOWELL:  What mistake has he admitted to? </p><p>SMITH:  Yes -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  What mistake?  </p><p>SMITH:  No, not really any.  All right, ISIS on the rise across the Turkish  region, a suicide bombing of the border -- on the border, I should say, of  Syria, claiming the lives of 31 people yesterday.</p><p>Joining us now is Gillian Turner, Fox News contributor and former White  House National Security Council member.  Gillian, good  morning -- </p><p>GILLIAN TURNER, FORMER MEMBER, WHITE HOUSE NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL:  Good  morning -- </p><p>SMITH:  Thank you for being here this morning.  What do you make of the  latest on this attack in Turkey?</p><p>TURNER:  Well, in order to understand the significance of this attack, you  really have to understand the strategic symbolism that the  town of Kobani  has in the broader fight against ISIS.</p><p>This attack was against a rally to rebuild the town of Kobani which was  really decimated over four-month long period of the battle  between Syrian  Kurds and ISIS fighters last year.</p><p>For a long time, this town was the last stronghold of the U.S.-led  coalition on the border region between Turkey and Syria.  So, it's a lot of  symbolism here.</p><p>SMITH:  And we were talking to K.T. McFarland last hour, sort of references  it as a game changer now that we've had this happen in Turkey.  </p><p>TURNER:  Absolutely, that's exactly right.  The border region between the  two countries eight months ago was entirely controlled by ISIS.</p><p>It's now -- its presence there has been gradually reduced in the last eight  months, which is one of the only good news stories to come out of the U.S.  fight against ISIS, because as we know, they're really on the rise in the  region.  </p><p>SMITH:  And as far as the fight with ISIS continues, it's -- you don't have  to look far to see a headline that ISIS continues to gain  strength and  power and money.</p><p>Where do you see the overall fight right now as far as combating ISIS as  they do continue to gain power and quite frankly continue to gain  territory?  </p><p>TURNER:  Well, they're on the rise across Iraq and Syria in spite of some  now five thousand airstrikes led by the United States against them.</p><p>They can currently control a majority of Syria as well as large sways of  Iraq, including Mosul which they've now held for over a year.</p><p>As you mentioned, they've got hundreds of millions of dollars in the bank,  tens of thousands of recruits and you know, just a couple of weeks ago,  celebrated their one-year anniversary.  </p><p>MURPHY:  So, Gillian, in that one year, you know, they've gone from really  something in after-thought, something that no one really knew about to  really taking all the headlines away from al Qaeda.</p><p>And they're really the main terrorist organization out there right now.  It  seems like you talk about five thousand airstrikes, but it's just not  enough. </p><p>What we're doing -- if it's not stopping them, it's not slowing them down,  it's not hurting them.</p><p>And the longer they exist, the more powerful they get just as a fact.  So,  what do we do? How do -- is it just putting more troops on the ground, is  that the simple answer? How do we stop them?  </p><p>TURNER:  There isn't a simply answer as much as we would all like there to  be one, I don't think it's as easier as saying boots on the ground, no  boots on the ground, diplomacy, no diplomacy.</p><p>What we really have to fight here in addition to the security situation is  the powerful hold that radical Islamic ideology has really had across the  region.</p><p>It's now expanding across the globe, ISIS recruits are increasing in  multiples at this point, you know, when they started a year ago, not very  many.</p><p>Now we have reports of up to thirty thousand actively fighting recruits,  plus up to a hundred thousand more in the kind of close-hold  pool.</p><p>So, this is an organization that's really increasing exponentially, so the  sooner we come up with a really good plan, the better.</p><p>SMITH:  All right, Gillian Turner on the latest deadly attack in Turkey,  thank you.</p><p>TURNER:  Thanks.  </p><p>SMITH:  All right, coming up, gold prices continue to fall after plunging  to their lowest level in five years on rate-hike fears.  </p><p>And take a look at some of the other big headlines that we're watching for  you on the \"Wall Street Journal\" this morning.</p><p>Fed tells big banks to shrink, Toshiba CEO fouled by accounting scandal,  Chattanooga shooting and the highlight online gun sales.  </p><p>And we're also watching for you this morning, a lot of other breaking news  and headlines, keep it right there on Fox Business. </p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>SMITH:  All right, gold prices edging lower this morning after plunging to  their lowest level in five years on rate hike fears.  Phil Flynn is  watching this selloff and following every move of the CME Group in Chicago.</p><p>Phil, it looks like it's holding a $1,100 an ounce right now, but broadly - - </p><p>PHIL FLYNN, CHICAGO MERCANTILE EXCHANGE GROUP:  Yes -- </p><p>SMITH:  Speaking, what is the selloff in gold or commodities in general,  what is it telling us?</p><p>FLYNN:  I think that's what the market is trying to decide right now.  You  know, we're starting to call at the midnight massacre of gold.</p><p>And we saw that huge $2.5 billion sell order come in the middle of the  night, driving down gold, raising bigger questions about the global  economy.</p><p>I think the sell-off in gold because it came along with a lot of the other  industrial metals with the oil, price of oil that they could be raising.</p><p>It could be like the canary in the coal mine raising larger concerns about  the global economy and economic growth.  And now the market is trying to  stabilize to see if those fears are justified or overplayed.  </p><p>FLYNN:  Yes, and when you look at the selloff happening and commodities  across the globe, you wonder what a big influence is U.S. dollar situation  is going to be.</p><p>We were just talking about real estate, Phil, I mean, you've got a stronger  U.S. dollar, all that foreign investment, where does it go?  </p><p>FLYNN:  Well, a lot of that is, of course, obviously has been coming to the  United States and we've seen that over the last couple of years.  </p><p>We've seen a lot of Chinese money, throwing money into the United States,  trying to get away from the Chinese stock market.</p><p>Obviously, as those interest rates start to go up and the stronger dollar  goes up, that could slow a little bit.  So obviously, that's a concern with  the marketplace right now.</p><p>But I think if you look at what we're seeing throughout a lot of the  commodity complex, you know actually, commodities last quarter were doing  pretty good.</p><p>I mean look at oil demand for example, you know, we saw oil demand in the  first half of the year rise by 1.6 million barrels.  That's like twice as  fast that we've seen over the last four years.</p><p>So, there are a lot of signs that the stimulus and other parts of the globe  was actually starting to stimulate demand for -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes -- </p><p>FLYNN:  Its commodities -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And -- </p><p>FLYNN:  But everything changed after Greece and China and after Sunday  night.  </p><p>SMITH:  And the bold calls, Mike, are already out there for gold did not  only sell off below a $1,000 an ounce, but saw 800, 600 bucks this morning.</p><p>I mean, where is it -- where is it going -- </p><p>MURPHY:  Yes -- </p><p>SMITH:  From here? </p><p>MURPHY:  A lot of people are piling on gold right now, but you talk about  support of 1,100, I think 1,000 is going to be the key level.</p><p>And if it will go down, I think in test 1,000 as it breaks through that, it  could go down to the 950, to the 900 level.  </p><p>But I think it's not just gold, it's the entire commodity space that's  getting hit because we're seeing a lot of the global fears of the Greece  and the China dissipating.</p><p>But the growth, the global growth isn't very strong, so a lot of -- </p><p>SMITH:  Yes -- </p><p>MURPHY:  People calling on less demand out there --  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Maybe if you don't bet on gold, if you're betting on growth, I  mean worry about down draft in copper or oil which has economic uses.  </p><p>MURPHY:  Great point.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But with gold, just remember if you're buying gold -- like  tradeable gold, you're betting against Goldman Sachs, you're not smarter  than Goldman Sachs, you're on the wrong side of a trade -- </p><p>MURPHY:  But I think -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  It is a zero-sum game.  </p><p>MURPHY:  I think people realize now that there's not too many -- why would  you buy gold? Right now what's -- </p><p>SMITH:  Right -- </p><p>MURPHY:  The point to go out -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And by the way -- </p><p>MURPHY:  And invest in gold? --    </p><p>MCDOWELL:  He did 2011, this down draft started in 2011 five years ago, it  just continues now. </p><p>SMITH:  Right, if you're a contrarian on the U.S. dollar, you might buy  gold.  </p><p>MURPHY:  You might -- </p><p>SMITH:  I'm just saying -- </p><p>MURPHY:  But I think there's a lot of other ways to play it rather than --   </p><p>MCDOWELL:  You're contrarian -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>On the U.S. dollar, you buy other currencies, you buy bonds, denominated in  other currencies, right?  </p><p>SMITH:  All right, so, Flynn, I'll let you answer that question, then we  have to go --  </p><p>FLYNN:  Yes, well, bottom line is, you know, if you started to buy gold in  1999 when we had this commodity crash, it returned better than the stock  market in nominal terms, up until a couple of years ago.</p><p>And yes, we've had a major correction in gold.  But I wouldn't throw, you  know, gold totally out of your investment portfolio.  You want to buy when  there's blood in the streets, there's blood in the streets in the gold  market. </p><p>Probably time to add some to your commodity portfolio.  </p><p>SMITH:  All right, so Flynn, thank you.  Coming up, well, conservative  anchor comments towards President Obama's efforts to fight terrorism going  viral.  We'll have the video next.   </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>SMITH:  Investigators are learning more about the Muslim man who killed  five American servicemen in Tennessee, Cheryl Casone is here with the  headlines there.  Cheryl.    </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS:  Hey, good morning, Sandra.  Well, the gunman  behind the Chattanooga terror attack reportedly wrote about becoming a  martyr.</p><p>Reports say that Muhammad Abdulazeez also wrote about committing suicide  after he lost a job two years ago because of drug abuse.</p><p>The 24-year-old opened fire at two military facilities on Thursday, killing  four Marines and a sailor before he was killed by police.  And one news  anchor's rant about President Obama's reaction to the tragedy has gone  viral. </p><p>Twenty two-year-old Tomi Lahren from \"One America News Network\" has become  an internet sensation, blasting what she called the President's half-baked  ISIS policy.  Take a listen.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TOMI LAHREN, ONE AMERICA NEWS NETWORK:  President Obama, if you won't say  it, I will.  Radical Islam, this is not workplace violence, this is not a  criminal act with motives unknown, this is terrorism? </p><p>I'm sorry but radical Islam is becoming the rule, not the exception.  Our  commander-in-chief is more concerned with Muslim sensitivity than the honor  and sacrifice made by these Marines.</p><p>Be a leader, someone.   </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE:  OK, let's be clear, she's 22 years old, guys, she's 22 years old,  she is from South Dakota, she's raised in a conservative family, a Marine  family we should be clear.</p><p>And as just was very fired up, she was very personal, she's now all over  the place including -- she was on \"FOX &amp; FRIENDS\" about an hour ago and she  sticks by everything that she said in those videos --  </p><p>SMITH:  But looks like a -- </p><p>CASONE:  She's very -- </p><p>SMITH:  Drop mic moment for Cheryl, I'm looking at the YouTube clip right  now, Dagen, Mike, 1.6 -- </p><p>MURPHY:  Yes -- </p><p>SMITH:  Million views and counting.  </p><p>MURPHY:  Rightfully so, I mean, she's -- </p><p>SMITH:  Striking a cord?  </p><p>MURPHY:  Yes, she is --</p><p>CASONE:  Yes -- </p><p>MURPHY:  She was spot-on, and you know, she doesn't look like the typical  person who would say that, she is young, she may be -- speaks to a  different -- sorry, I take that back.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  When you say -- </p><p>CASONE:  Yes -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  What? </p><p>MURPHY:  Big towards in a big -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And who will burn that saying -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MURPHY:  Speaks to a different generation possibly, but I think she was  spot-on with all of her points, so it does -- the more people who view this  clip, the better I think.  </p><p>CASONE:  She's got like 800,000 clips as of like midnight, I mean so by now  it's what? 8:25 Eastern, she's got more than that.  </p><p>So, and she -- you know the thing about her too is that, she's coming out  and saying, you know, she also could and defend, so that we talked about  yesterday where, you know, that these guard members should have protection.</p><p>They should be armed as well as talking about the issues with regards to  ISIS.  And that the president has -- as she -- well, she said it better  than I did.  Failed her and all of us.  </p><p>SMITH:  I should -- and you know -- and you can't speak that stuff, I mean,  she was actually very passionate, Dagen, you may disagree, I don't know,  but -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  No -- </p><p>SMITH:  She was very passionate about it and it came across and I think  that's why --  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  That would resonate with people -- </p><p>CASONE:  Yes -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  In general.  Whether you're talking about internet clips,  whether you're talking about television or any kind of video is -- if it's  comes from the heart and you mean it, and you speak your truth, and you're  authentic, then people connect with that.  </p><p>SMITH:  And Mike will be leaving now.  Yes, all right, thank you Cheryl  Casone --   </p><p>CASONE:  Thank you -- </p><p>SMITH:  All right, Chicago now home to the nation's highest sales tax, so  we'll tell you how much it costs to shop in the Windy City and what the  locals have to say about that, I may chime in my hometown, that's coming up  next. </p><p>CASONE:  No!</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>SMITH:  All right, don't let us catch you calling Chicago the second city  anymore especially when it comes to sales taxes.  And their all new you  make it, they take it report.</p><p>Jeff Flock is in the Windy City asking shoppers what they think about the  city's new number one ranking.  Jeff, I always tell New Yorkers they got it  wrong when it comes to Chicago.  </p><p>It's the second city because it burned down the first time in the great  Chicago fire and they had to rebuild it.  New Yorkers always think that  it's second to New York, false. </p><p>JEFF FLOCK, FOX BUSINESS:  I agree with you a 100 percent, this is the  rejuvenation of Chicago.  But as it's getting expensive to live here, maybe  you're lucky here in New York at this point.  </p><p>You know where I am, don't you? Looks familiar, if it does, Oak Street in  Chicago.  Take a look at the numbers now, the Cook County board having  passed an additional percentage of tax, sales tax, give Chicago the number  one or at least it will on January 1st to 2016. </p><p>Ten-point-two-five percent sales tax, worse than New York or maybe we  should say, higher than New York, better than New York, better than L.A.,  better than Milwaukee. </p><p>It's not the city itself that passed the increase, it was Cook County.  If  you take a look at the break down, there's a state sales tax, then there is  the county sales tax which went up an additional percent and then of course  the city itself has 2.25 percent sales tax as well.  </p><p>What does this mean for this city? Well, it means that actually some more  money is going to go into the pension coffers. That's the reason the county  passed the sales tax increase.  They're trying to get their credit rating  improved.  But I'll tell you, if you take a look at the credit ratings of  cities around the country, it is Chicago Detroit that are still in junk  status.  Other places like Seattle, Dallas, Denver, those guys are doing  fine, but not so much here Sandra. </p><p>SMITH: Unbelievable.  Well, that's what happens when you're cities  bankrupt, okay? Yes, Raise taxes.  Jeff Fox, thank you.  </p><p>FOX: Hard to believe.</p><p>SMITH: Alright. </p><p>FOX: Thanks Sandra.</p><p>SMITH: Dagen, this could have been a big impact on buyer behavior, but as  we're seeing actually Chicago housing sales are doing quite well at the  moment.  A pocket of strength from the country.</p><p>MCDOWELL: These taxes are regressive.  Your higher sales tax, you have the  cell phone tax went up not long ago.  Higher property taxes. They hit the  poor even harder than they do because it eats up more of a greater  percentage of their income and what they take home.  It's really shocking  that the city's not in better financial shape. The fact they they've put in  place all these revenue raisers.  But - leave it to Robert Manual. I mean  he got reelected didn't he?</p><p>SMITH: Not the situation.  When you look at the sales tax go to these lofty  numbers I also worry about restaurant chains or just restaurants in general  in the city.  I mean, you're talking about asking tourists to come into the  city and they're paying substantially more than they had expected over were  a year ago.  </p><p>MIKE MURPHY, ROSECLIFF FINANCIAL: Absolutely.  So you know, I understand  why this tax hike went through, but to say that there's strength in the  real estate market today is one thing.  But what's going to happen after  this is out there for six months or 12 months.  Are you going to see  restaurant chains, stores leaving. Are you going to see the values of homes  decreasing. So, I think it's kind of a risky bet they're taking.  I agree  they had to do something because you can't run a city bankrupt or no money  -</p><p>SMITH: That's the business. </p><p>MURPHY: I think it is.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And by the way, the second city in the minds of New York is Los  Angeles. </p><p>SMITH: Whatever.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And then San Fran and then Boston. </p><p>SMITH: Whatever.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Chicago's is like fifth, maybe six behind Atlanta.</p><p>SMITH: As a New Yorker you probably really didn't even understand -</p><p>MCDOWELL: I am not a New Yorker!</p><p>SMITH:  -- what second city meant.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I only say New Yorker after when, you know, you have to walk  through like garbage and the small of like a dumpster behind a fishmonger  on the way. I only consider myself a New Yorker when I have to brave  through that. </p><p>SMITH: Alright. Somewhere in -- She's from somewhere in Virginia.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>MCDOWELL: (INAUDIBLE) Sandra was about the insult the entire South. She was  this close.  (INAUDIBLE) Alright. Ohio Governor John Kasich set to jump  into the 2016 White House race. Bake Burman has the latest from Washington.  Help Blake? </p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FOX BUSINESS:  Here I am for you Sandra.  John Kasich will  make it 16 later today.  The current Governor of Ohio and Former  Congressman will launch his second White House run with about one to two  percent of support from Republicans.  Everyone in the GOP field is  currently staring up at Donald Trump.  A new \"Washington Post\" poll shows  24 percent of Republicans currently favored Trump. That is double his  nearest opponents and his highest mark yet.  However, much of that poll was  taken before his widely panned comments about John McCain.  </p><p>In Iowa, home to the first caucus, the main newspaper, \"The Des Moines  Register\", speaking about comments Sandra. Take a listen to this.  They  published a blistering op-ed of Trump this morning.  Here's what they  wrote, quote \"If he were merely a self absorbed B-list celebrity, his  unchecked ego could be tolerated as some source of mild amusement\".  That  op-ed went on to say as you might image that Trump is unqualified to be  President.  Sandra?  </p><p>SMITH: Wow. Alright, Blake, thank you.  I guess there's enough to talk  about there, but he is jumping to into a very contentious GOP race.  I  mean, we heard from Governor Pataki earlier.  He's all fired up.  Donald  Trump's so fired up, he's saying things maybe he shouldn't. I mean, there  is an intense heated battle going on right now. </p><p>MURPHY: There is an 16 candidates we all know is too much. But it's funny  how the start of that report was about Kasich joining the race, but it  ended with Trump.  You know, it seems like right now everything's coming  back to Trump.  He's gotten all the press that surrounded - a lot of the  press that's surrounded  it.  I think when we get to the first debate in  August, we're going to be done 10 candidates at that point. And from 10, we  need to get down to the top four or five. Right now, there's too many  people out there. We need to weed through that and find the most qualified  people who can actually win the election.  </p><p>SMITH: An I'm still trying to find somebody who will talk about the  economy.  You know, Governor Pataki had a lot of great things to say,  however, Dagen, you noticed when I started asking about the economy, it  went to national security, which is one of his strengths and what he wants  to focus on.  I just have not heard even on the left, Hillary Clinton,  she's trying really hard to talk about the economy right now.  But that's  No. 1, what's polling with the American voter. They want to know who's  going to fix the economy.  </p><p>MCDOWELL: The big broad stripes - and that will work initially.  It's not  going pay for any of these GOP candidates to get into the nitty-gritty of  how they would fix the economy at least in the short run. They're going to  paint, use broad stokes and - I mean, that's what's worked for Trump quite  frankly. </p><p>SMITH: By the way, you know, Joe Biden hasn't entered the race yet and  there's a lot of talk about will he or won't.  I should've asked Michael  Berlin. I'm sure he had an opinion on that. But - </p><p>MCDOWELL: It's after the first debate. That'll be critical where you get,  the first debate, the first tier, it  He gets it down a ten.  Governor  Pataki will not be in that first tier the way the polls numbers look like  right now and maybe not Kasich either.</p><p>SMITH: Alright. So exciting.  From presidential season to earnings season  in full swing, we'll hear from Apple after the bell today.  We'll have a  preview of that and \"Breaking Bad's\" Stephen Michael Quezada announcing  plans to run for public office in New Mexico.  He's going to be  joining us  next.  Keep it right here on the Fox Business Network.  </p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING: \" GET IN MY WAY\" - ROBIN THICKE)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>SMITH: News alert for you.  Capitol flags will fly at half staff to  remember the victims of the Chattanooga shooting.  Cheryl Casone has the  details on that.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS: Hi, good morning Sandra.  Well, yes. House  Speaker John Boehner has just ordered that flags on Capitol Hill fly at  half staff in honor of the four marines and one sailor killed in a  Tennessee terror attack.  The gunman Mohammed Abdulazeez opened fire at two  military facilities on Thursday before he was killed by police.

New York City - excuse me. In other  headlines this morning, New York City doctors are evaluating a patient who  was rushed to hospital last night with some symptoms of Ebola.

We're going to bring you, of course, the latest on that  story as it develops.  We're following that. </p><p>And then finally, we've talked about this earlier, appliance makers say  that President Obama's new dishwasher rules are going to take us back to  the days of handwashing.

And also, the Association saying that they did tests and  photographs, which they sent to the Department of Energy with food on the  dishes they sent to the Department of Energy with food on the dishes.

What is driving you to run for public office?</p><p>QUEZADA: Well, I already have -- I sit on the Albuquerque school board.   I've been involved in my community way before I was any kind of actor or  any kind of comedian.  I've always worked with kids, did gang intervention  programs.  So, this is something I've always been involved in.  This isn't  new for me. And so this is a gradual step for me to be able to help the  people in the community that I love. I love this community. I'm a New  Mexican. We're really proud of our culture and we're really proud of who we  are and one of the main reasons why I'm running for office is because I'm  an American and I can.  </p><p>SMITH: Stephen, immigration has been a hot topic mostly of late because of  Donald Trump's comment that have been interpreted many different ways, but  specifically, his comment on immigration.  How, what was your response to  that?  </p><p>QUEZADA: You know, immigration is a big topic for sure in the areas where  we live. Those are our - that's our workforce. I mean, nobody eats without  them working in America.  Nobody - you know, they do the jobs that most  Americans won't do.  I know Donald Trump wants to build a wall and I'm  asking who's going to build the wall for $8 an hour?  It's going to be the  workforce that he wants out.  </p><p>So, we need to figure out immigration reform.  Are we against criminals?   Of course, we are. But to say that all Mexican people are drug dealers and  rapist was something that should've never been said.  I was just performing  in front of 800 people and when I got into the elevator, I had man with his  7-year old son  told me to go back to Mexico because I was a rapist and a  drug dealer. And then, when I walked out of the elevator he spit at me. I  mean, is this what we're try to promote as Americans because, you know, my  family goes back here 300 years.  My father fought in World War II, Korea  and Vietnam.  And for me to have to travel the country and deal with stuff  like that, I think it's unfair and it's something that wasn't thought out.   When you make a comment like that - because some of us Americans have to  live with that.  </p><p>MURPHY: Hey Stephen, when you're in your campaign against the other two  candidates, how much does your acting background or really your celebrity -  I would like that put you at a huge advantage.  Is that how the race is  shaping up right now?  </p><p>QUEZADA: Well, you know, a lot of people use money as a huge advantage.  I  don't have that luxury.  I'm just a regular old actor and comedian.  But,  locally I think most people know me here as a community member, as  somebody, you know, as somebody who raises money for children, who does  programs through youth  development incorporated, who's been involved in  education. So, the rest of the country knows me as \"Breaking Bad\" actor  Steve Gomez.  But, here in New Mexico, they know me as Stephen Michael  Quezada, the community member.  </p><p>MCDOWELL: Stephen, it's Dagen McDowell. I work here at Fox Business. County  Commissioner now, do you - is that where you see your career?  Are you  going to be an actor 20 years for now or do you want to be a politician?</p><p>QUEZADA: I'm going to do both.  I don't understand why anybody who runs for  office can't do - you know, you never see anybody quit their job to run for  office if they're a lawyer or if they own - if they're wealthy and they own  a construction company or any kind of business.  You know, nobody quits  their job or -- </p><p>MCDOWELL: Well, Schwarzenegger did. I mean, Schwarzenegger did. There a  number of actors that when they were serving their terms in office, they  weren't doing film work or television work. </p><p>QUEZADA: Well, I do the work because I have three children.  I have two  daughters  in college.  I'm not wealthy.  Arnold Schwarzenegger and those  other actors are very wealthy. You're not talking to Brian Cranson here,  you're talking to a guy who played a - you know?</p><p>SMITH: So, Steve, we don't have much time left.  Who do you like right now  as the presidential race heats up?  There are lot of talk about the GOP  field. Who do you like on the left?  </p><p>QUEZADA: Well, I'm going to tell you, I'm waiting to see who the most  Democratic person is going to step up.  I don't believe what I read or  believe what I read all the time.  I want somebody to be honest, so I'm  looking at the person who's going to be the most honest and the person that  I think is really going to look at the economic position of this country  and who's going to look at immigration.  </p><p>SMITH: Do you like Hillary Clinton?  </p><p>QUEZADA: I like a couple of them.  Hillary is definitely one of my top  runners.  </p><p>SMITH: Alright. Stephen Michael Quezada, thank you for joining us this  morning and sharing your thoughts and your run at office.  Good luck to  you.  </p><p>QUEZADA: Thank you. Thanks, I appreciate it.  </p><p>SMITH: Alright. Tesla shares set to be a major mover in today's trade.  Why  the stock is selling off straight ahead.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>SMITH: Welcome back.  We're about 40 minutes away from the opening bell.   Let's get to Nicole Petallides at the New York Stock Exchange.  It's  already lunch time for you Nicole. An hour and a half to - sorry, less than  an hour to the opening bell.  </p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX BUSINESS: Good morning, Sandra.  That's right. So,  let's take a look at what we're watching. First of all, gold continues to  be a story, right?  Five-year lows, but we're keeping a keen eye on a big  mover today.  And that's Tesla. Tesla this morning is looking down about  more than $10 this morning.  And that is on a UBS downgrade. It turns out  for the third time recently, they're cutting Telsa again. For the third  time this month to a sell rating in this case and that is because they  actually believe that the energy business, the energy storage business is  unlikely to live up to the expectations.  In fact, they also have power  wall where they said some of the order that they're seeing are just  solicitations.  People don't actually have to put money down.  And so with  that, cutting into a sell (INAUDIBLE) on the stock is looking nowhere.   Back to you.  </p><p>SMITH: Alright. Nicole, thank you.  And don't forget to start your day off  with Nicole, Lauren and me on \"FBN:AM\" every morning at 5:00 a.m. right  here on the Fox Business Network.  We get you ready for your day.  </p><p>MCDOWELL: Get down.  </p><p>SMITH: Alright! Here we go. Is it Friday? One stock to watch today. Apple  reporting third-quarter earnings after the closing bell. Wall Street  expecting the tech giant to report $29.9 billion dollars in Iphone sales  versus $19.8 billion dollars last year.  Analyst expect strong sales to be  bowied by  bigger-than-expected demand in China and this quarter represents  the first for Apple watch sales.  Apple's been tightlipped on watch sells  specifically and many on Wall Street are keeping expectations muted.  I  don't know. As my read on that should be nobody really knows how well the  watch is doing for Apple. Like so far, Tim Cook hasn't really released any  details specifically about it. </p><p>MURPY: He hasn't got a lot of press, but remember, in the last three months  since Apple last reported. The stocks essentially flat.  It was around 132,  it's still around 132. So, I think going into this quarter, the bars set  pretty high for them as far as Iphone sales go.  But, if you look at the  sales projection or what they did this past quarter, sales for the Iphones  were great. The Iphone 6, iphone 6 Plus. China, U.S., I think the risk to  Apple right now is to the upside. I think it breaks above recent highs on a  very strong number today. </p><p>SMITH: Really? So we at $132 a share. You think it's going to continue to  run higher?  </p><p>MURPHY: Well, And I'd say, don't focus on the price of $132 because that's  essentially flat in the last three months as the NASDAQ has gone up to all- time highs.  But, really focus on is the company growing, is the company  increasing their sales --  </p><p>SMITH: Not worried about valuations, you're just worried about gross  period. And Dagen, as much as  I've always say, I  got Apple fatigue.  I  can't talk another day about Apple and this watch. And people love to buy  the stocks, the love to buy the watch, they love to buy the Apple products.  And it's like you can't ignore it.  It's a growth engine that hasn't  stopped.   </p><p>MCDOWELL: No, it's Google getting surprised at the upside Apple can't do.  And it's an juggernaut and it's in the world of technology are you going to  - it's relatively safe.  Well, I say safe, but it's a safer bet than a lot  of the questionable companies that are younger and newer with business  models that are great deal shakier than that one. </p><p>MURPHY: And we have the watch, but we also have Apple music that was just  launched. I mean, it'll be interesting to see if they speak at about that  because now, they're moving in a whole new space, but they still have that  Apple mote. </p><p>MCDOWELL: How many people they got to sign up for the free trial, which I  did and I was not a subscriber to Spotify either and I signed up for Apple.  </p><p>SMTIH: There you have it.  Alright. All this. Don't miss \"After the Bell's\"  complete coverage on earnings after the close of trade today, right here on  the Fox Business Network.  David and Melissa will have that for you, 4:00  p.m.  Eastern time.  We are just over 30 minutes away from the opening  bell.  Futures right now pointing to a mixed open. NASDAQ on pace for a  record day. Keep it right here on Fox Business. We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>SMITH: All right.  IBM is poised to shave off nearly 60 points from the Dow  when it begins trading just a about an a half hour from now.  Dagen, Mike,  final thoughts ahead of the opening bell this morning?  Mike, go first.  </p><p>MCDOWELL: You can go first.</p><p>SMITH: You're on the spot.  Think of something.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Because I'm going to talk about something - uncomfortable.</p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>MURPHY: Okay.  I think the focus right now is on earnings.  You know, we've  heard from a lot of big banks. They've come out with strong earnings.  So,  I think the market is sitting at all-time highs.  You talk about  valuations, but I think if you look at it, we're not trading at  historically high levels.  So, there's talk out there about bubbles.  We're  not in a bubble right now.  I think the market on strong earnings can take  out highs and go higher. That's what I'll be watching today. </p><p>MCDOWELL: And I'm watching any additional information on the Ashley Madison  hack, the site for people looking for-- </p><p>SMITH: Cheating.  </p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes, who want to cheat on their spouses.  So, what happened  yesterday, it was a group that said they hacked into the Ashley Madison  website and accessed 37 million users information because the full delete  option that Ashley Madison charges for, it wasn't real. They weren't  deleting these account.  Ashley Madison said yesterday yes, it does.  And  it's offering free delete of all your accounts on Ashley Madison. And there  was no new information that was posted on-line yesterday.  </p><p>SMITH: By the way, this is a  story in the 'Wall Street Journal\"  questioning whether or not the IPO that had been planned for Ashley Madison  will actually happen.  So, that's continued fallout from that story as  well.  Thank goodness they're going to let me delete my account.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>SMITH: Alright,  IBM, by the way, we're saying is going shave off 60 points  from the Dow out of the gate this morning. United Technologies, part of  that sell-off as well. Right now, combined  IBM and United Technologies  expected to shave off about 93 points from the Dow when it opens this  morning. United Technologies UTX right now off $5 bucks in the pre-market  ahead of the bell a half hour from now.  And there was IBM off about $10 as  well. </p><p>Alright, I want to say thank you to Dagen McDowell and Mike Murphy for  joining us this morning. </p><p>MCDOWELL: Thank you.</p><p>MURPHY: Thank you.</p><p>SMITH: Busy couple of hours guys. You don't want to miss MORNINGS WITH  MARIA tomorrow.  Maria will be back. Presidential Candidate and Former  Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee will be here to  talking about the latest  in the always exciting campaign.

Analysts looking for $1.01 a share up from 91 cents a share a  year ago. </p><p>Apple reporting after the close today.

Johnson birdied the  first two holes of a four-hole playoff to help secure the win.  Jordan  Spieth who was trying to become the first since Ben Hogan in 1953 to win  the first three majors of the year fell short by one stroke at the end of  his round yesterday.</p><p>All right.  Well, gold prices edging lower after plunging to the lowest  level in five years on rate hikes feared.  Phil Flynn is now at the CME  Group watching this sell-off nearing $1,100 a troy ounce in gold.  Phil,  will gold dip below $1,000 an ounce?  </p><p>PHIL FLYNN, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Well, it did earlier and I think it has a  chance to because it is so close.  But you know, a lot of people are  talking about this bear raid that happened on Sunday night.  That's what  they're calling it.  This massive sell orders that came in that broke the  gold market down.  And it's either -- it's a critical turning point.</p><p>This is either a sign of capitulation or a sign that the market is going  down.  Consider the fact that we saw over $2 billion wiped off --  commodity, ETFs -- in the matter of a couple of hours yesterday.  And  that's raising a lot of concerns whether this trade was real, if it's  really signaling a bigger problem with the global economy, or a bigger  meltdown in China.</p><p>Now what's kind of interesting here when we look at what's happened to gold  here the couple of days central banks around the globe have been buying  gold.  We just saw reports that Russia, Kazakhstan, Afghanistan -- all  these countries have been buying gold while the rest of the world is  selling them.  But it's raising a lot of concerns.</p><p>But look what's done.  You know, it's kind of interesting, people don't  realize Sandra last month commodities as an asset class in the last quarter  actually outperformed the stock market.  What a turn-around in just the  first couple of days of the quarter when we see this massive sell off in  commodities.  The index near a 13-year-low of all commodities, putting a  lot of downward pressure on prices and the sell-off in gold really has, you  know, trickled down to other markets, you know.</p><p>Gold is the first one to sell off but it even impacted things like crude  oil, gasoline prices, RBA (ph) prices.  So it's raising concerns that this  drop in gold could be signaling the bigger deflationary cycle which is  going to create bigger problems for the fed as we go forward.  </p><p>SMITH:  All right.  So the cover of the \"Financial Times\" this morning, by  the way, it's all about this commodity sell-off -- gold, lowest level in  five years amid broader commodity sell-off.  A lot of this, Michael, based  on the strength that we're seeing in the U.S. dollar.  To be clear in the  overnight session we saw gold dip below $1,100 a troy ounce but, of course,  the big round number we're now all watching is $1,000.  Could that happen?   Could we dip below there?</p><p>MICHAEL BLOCK, RHINO TRADING PARTNERS:  It could happen but I'm noticing  some very interesting things here -- Sandra.  I'm noticing, you know,  there's the cover of the FT saying the death of gold.  On the Twitter- sphere, you know, there's talk amongst traders and investors, no one wants  to touch.  The gold bugs are being burned at the stake here.  </p><p>SMITH:  Dagen said it yesterday, actually.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN HOST:  Yes, you finish your thought.  I'll get into it.   But when people point to gold and argue that gold, in and of itself, is  some sort of economic indicator I go \"pooh, really\".  Because copper is  used around the global economy, oil is a critical global economic  commodity. </p><p>SMITH:  People buy and sell gold versus copper for very different reasons.   That being said what is the trade in gold right now?  </p><p>BLOCK:  The trade, you know, I see right now is you know, sentiment getting  worse.  I think it could get worse, you know, when the screaming gets  really loud as I like to say.  People ask when is gold going to stop going  down, I always give them a sardonic reply \"when you stop asking me\", which  is my way of saying when there's total capitulation.  I think we're getting  close.  Maybe we are there.  For smart investors I have a lot of guys who  are saying five years out I want to own gold miners and say hell yes, own  an ETF here.  This is an interesting interest spot where you want to start  picking away at it.</p><p>You know, look, gold is like anything else.  Is it an inflation flight?  Is  it a flight to safety?  No and no.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  They can't answer that question.  If you want safety you  go into treasury bonds because the U.S. government will at least pay you  back.  If you want an inflation hedge, you go out and buy a house or you  buy stocks because they're going to raise the price.  I'm just saying that  people have this wonderment around gold.  </p><p>SMITH:  I hear Phil Flynn chomping at the bit down there -- Phil.  </p><p>FLYNN:  Well, you know, it's kind of interesting here.  I just mentioned  Russia improve their gold reserves, a lot of that was because of the  weakness in the ruble.  We talk about China.  A lot of talk that they  didn't increase their gold reserves as much as a lot of people thought as  they're trying to bring their currency back to a global market.</p><p>And I agree with Dagen.  On a day to day basis gold can, you know, react  with no really strong economic purpose.  But at the end of the day, central  banks still use gold as the backdrop of their foreign currency whether they  acknowledge it or not. So it's a very, very important commodity from that  standpoint.  </p><p>SMITH:  All right.  That being said, we just checked the last time we did  see gold below $1,000 an ounce, we'll have to go back to 2009 to see that - - so certainly a big round number to watch.  Phil Flynn -- thank you for  joining us from the CME Group there in Chicago. </p><p>Donald Trump taking a step back on \"THE O'REILLY FACTOR\" last night over  his comments about Senator John McCain when he called the former POW,  quote, \"not a war hero\".  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  I have respect for senator McCain.  I used to like him a lot, I  supported him, raise money for his campaign against President Obama and  certainly if there was a misunderstanding I would totally take that back.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SMITH:  Get ready because my next guest says the latest flip is far worse  than those about Mexican immigrants and will cost Trump dearly.  The latest  polling data does suggest otherwise.  A new poll ABC News and the  \"Washington Post\" show he is the favorite at 24 percent.  Mind you, that  poll did happen before those comments occurred.</p><p>Mike Berland is a former strategic adviser to Hillary Clinton and CEO of  Edelman Berland and joins us now.  And Mike, we very much look forward to  having you on the show this morning to react to not only to what Donald  Trump said but then how he has responded now to our very own Bill O'Reilly  last night.  </p><p>MIKE BERLAND, EDELMAN BERLAND:  Well, if you like \"Celebrity Apprentice\"  waiting for the August 6th Republican debate because Donald Trump is  building his viewership, he's building his base and he will be ready to go.  </p><p>What we're seeing is that Donald Trump is a master brand builder.  I've  been studying brands for 25 years, he knows what he is about, he's very  clear he's a straight shooter and he's now setting the dialogue.</p><p>Sandra we've been talking about Donald Trump for two weeks.  We are  watching what's happening on social media.  In his first issue with Mexican  illegal immigrants, it was a corporate play and we saw the issues that he  had.  Now we're seeing that this was much broader.</p><p>You know who broke this?  Mitt Romney.  He tweeted out and 60,000 shared  it.  And over the next three days we saw this go from Politico and Mitt  Romney to Democrats, Republicans, Independents -- everybody is talking  about Donald Trump.  </p><p>SMITH:  Well first of all we've been talking a lot about Donald Trump for a  lot longer than two weeks.  </p><p>BERLAND:  Well, he's a -- viable presidential candidates.  </p><p>SMITH:  Ok.  But the branding aspect Dagen is one that every time --  because if anything he continues to establish his brand and get his name  out there.  Polling shows that -- the last poll that I saw showed that only  two percent of American voter respondents didn't know who he was.  I mean  more people know Donald Trump than any other presidential candidate out  there.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Real-estate billionaire used to be his brand.  Now it's  \"feckless blowhard\" according to the \"Des Moines Register\" which called for  him to step out of a race but you know who he is like?  And to Michael's  credit we were talking about this before he walked out here.  He's Ross  Perot -- right.</p><p>That's the best comparison to Trump is Ross Perot getting into the race.  </p><p>BERLAND:  But what does Trump have that Ross Perot didn't have?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Money.</p><p>BERLAND:  No, he had.  Ross Perot had billion dollars, Donald Trump has  social media and when we look at how this story is spreading we see that  Donald Trump is now becoming political provocateur.  He is talking about  issues that people are scared about and I think what is really interesting  is that this is not just a Republican Party issue.  This is about  presidential politics in America and we see that everybody is responding. </p><p>Look at this analysis that I've done.  The story started with Politico on  one side, Mitt Romney on the other and watch how the story spread over  Twitter.  It started to connect and this became ubiquitous issue over three  days.  </p><p>Sandra most stories died down after three days.  This one actually built.   And by the time we get to August 6th we're going to see Trump continue to  build support and I think if you are Jeb Bush, if you're Marco Rubio, if  you're Rick Perry and you are in that debate with him you got to watch out.</p><p>SMITH:  Ok.  But we have not had your reactions yet on O'Malley and  apologizing for saying \"all lives matter\"?  I am dying to know your take on  that.  </p><p>BERLAND:  I think that what we are seeing is a debate now is spreading  bigger -- that we are seeing a lot of issues on the Republican and on  Democratic side and we're talking about straight shooting.  </p><p>SMITH:  Ok.  That's it?</p><p>BLOCK:  Does straight shooting from O'Malley's sell though?  That's the  question. </p><p>BERLAND:  Right.  He doesn't have the brand that Donald Trump does to get  it out.  I think that we're seeing really -- on the Democratic side, here  we have Donald Trump who is talking very candidly about the issues.  We  have Hillary Clinton who is being very careful and scripted and what's  going to happen with the American voter it's he's raising the bar.  And  we're going to see on both sides, we're going to see Sanders, we're going  to see O'Malley, we're going to see Clinton.  They're all going to have to  take their game up.</p><p>But Trump is drowning everybody out right now.  </p><p>SMITH:  I think you let O'Malley of the hook a little easy compared to what  you're doing to Donald Trump.  </p><p>BERLAND:  No, hold on.  I'm saying Donald Trump is absolutely very much in  control of the dialogue.  I think I'm actually -- </p><p>SMITH:  Is it that he is or you want him to be because that is better for  the left?  </p><p>BERLAND:  For the left I think they want Donald Trump to go away.  I think  that the Republicans would as well.  </p><p>SMITH:  Really.</p><p>BERLAND:  Of course.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  A better comparison is Bernie Sanders because they're really  appealing to the same anti-establishment feeling on the right as Trump and  on the left as Sanders.  </p><p>BERLAND:  I'll give you an example.  John Kasich today is going to announce  that he is running for president.  And nobody's going to hear it and no one  is going to care because they're going to keep talking about Donald Trump.   So you are drowning out both sides.</p><p>If you're Hillary Clinton you can't get your economic message out there.   If you're Bernie Sanders you're getting drowned out.</p><p>SMITH:  What's her economic message?</p><p>BERLAND:  Her economic message, she's talking about increasing wages -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Her economic message is more Obama and she doesn't go as far  left as Bernie Sanders.  That's in essence what her economy -- </p><p>SMITH:  But that is my defense of Hillary Clinton, is that she is the one  who is trying to get her economic message out there.  More so than I say to  a lot of other candidates aside from maybe Jeb Bush who's a real fan on the  table for growth in the United States.</p><p>All right.  We unfortunately have to leave it there.  Mike Berland -- great  conversation.</p><p>BERLAND:  Thanks for having me.</p><p>SMITH:  Thanks for joining us early this morning. </p><p>All right.  Well, the Nasdaq notching its third record close in a row and  major members of the index scheduled to report earnings today.  Are we  approaching another technology bubble?  Is that happening right now?  We  will discuss that next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>SMITH:  President Obama's new dishwasher rules are under fire by appliance  makers.  Cheryl, you get down. </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT:   We had it. </p><p>SMITH:  What's your story?  Take it away.  </p><p>CASONE:  You've got it Sandra.  Yes, dishwasher rules, not kidding about  this one -- Sandra.  Are you ready to start hand washing your dishes again  folks?  I'm serious.  This is a real story.  The Association of Home  Appliance Manufacturers says that is exactly what is going to happen if the  White House's new dishwasher regulations go into law.</p><p>The new rules cut the amount of water that dishwashers can use.  But the  industry group says that's going to only lead to dirtier dishes and we're  all going to be unhappy and we're going to blame the President for dirty  dishes.  True story.</p><p>Intelligent life anywhere in the universe if it exists, Stephen Hawking  wants to find it.  The famed scientist has announced the new $100 million  project to find evidence of life beyond earth.  Hawking and other  researchers plan to spend the next ten years studying one million stars in  the Milky Way and 100 other galaxies for any signs of life.  ET if you're  out there, you can call us.</p><p>And finally Microsoft reporting quarterly results after the close today,  the software giant expected to pose a drop in revenue, as buyers wait for  the next version of Windows.  That's due out later this month.  Investors  also hoping to hear more details about the company's latest job cuts.   Unfortunately that is the problem. </p><p>The Nasdaq, we didn't get the record close yesterday intra-day Sandra but,  you know, everybody keeps saying are we in a bubble?  Is this a bubble?  Is  technology a bubble?  But when Apple comes in after the close I think all  of those questions are going to be deleted because Apple is probably going  to have another really strong quarter.  </p><p>SMITH:  I mean is it reasonable that we're having fears of the year 2000  and these lofty valuations on these stocks?  I mean I'm looking at the  triple cues (ph), the power share's triple cues, trusts tracks Nasdaq -- a  ten-year high there as well.  Everybody is worried, you know.  Is this  sustainable?  </p><p>BLOCK:  Look, we're breaking 200 highs, I'm not going to use the word  \"bubble\" here.  What I'm seeing here is -- the key word here is \"scarcity\".   Google came out last week.  They had great earnings with the Ruth Porat as  the CFO now.  They have a great cost cutting story; over the weekend that  hey they can use some of their cash to buy back stock, hitting on all  cylinders.</p><p>Here's the problem, what goes for Google does not necessarily go for  Microsoft or Qualcomm or Sandisk or Texan or some of these other companies  coming out.  I don't think the valuations are too lofty.  You see some of  these venture capital valuations and then there are certain companies out  there with no earnings that are going on.  Amazon -- </p><p>CASONE:  Well, Jet.com is what came up yesterday.  That is where this whole  discussion started out.  It was like really?  That is not making any money  and come on.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Some of the valuations on the private companies even Uber are  where you get nosebleeds in there.  A lot of companies getting funding,  that are actually companies -- they're the exact same model of a company  that went out of business during the first dot.com crash and then it came  back.  Whether the (INAUDIBLE) sticks with the originally company, it  basically got shut down and then they refunded at a higher price which  makes no sense.</p><p>SMITH:  And look, there's no fun in looking at financials these days with  the lack of growth potential that most analysts point out in the financial  sector.  It's like where is that money that's chasing growth in the stock  market, where are they going to look?  </p><p>BLOCK:  It's going to tech and to biotech, and you have Chipotle reporting  as well and it's going to these rogue companies because there's scarcity of  growth.  Organic growth isn't coming from many places, even Google's coming  down but there still is some growth.  The question is, is Microsoft there.   Apple -- I think everyone thinks is going to be there -- </p><p>CASONE:  You know what I don't want to see though, you guys.  I don't want  to see another year where you have what we saw back in 2000 which was  Goldman Sachs and the investment bankers that extend these IPOs.  They're  the ones that made all the money and the retail investors, the (INAUDIBLE)  got the shaft once again.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  The retail investor except in a few instances is very shy of a  lot of these companies.  This is an indicator of nothing but I bought my  first Mac.  I've never owned a Mac.  I've always been Windows-based my  entire life.  Yesterday -- it arrived yesterday.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BLOCK:  -- growth exposure.</p><p>SMITH:  Everybody wants to talk about tech bubbles. We're going to be right  back.  Stay with us</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KT MCFARLAND, FOX NEWS NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST:  It's truly (INAUDIBLE).   They have famously last year in the battle for Kobani which is a big city  near there on the other side of the Turkish border that ISIS took Turkish  tanks out on the Turkish border and they watched as ISIS came in, took the  town, slaughtered the Kurdish population there. </p><p>So will Turkey join the battle?  Will Turkey join the battle in Syria and  Iraq, you know, the Islamic state?  Or will Turkey just say I'm going to  defend our borders?  Will Turkey tighten up its borders?  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SMITH:  That was K.T. McFarland weighing in on one of the top stories in  the Journal this morning.  Reading \"Suicide bomber killed at least 31 in  Turkish border towns\".</p><p>For more on this let's bring in Fox News correspondent and former navy  fighter pilot Lea Gabriel.  Good morning.  Thanks for joining us on this  story this morning.  What do you make of the latest developments out of  Turkey?  </p><p>LEA GABRIEL, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Well, you know, actually what we just  heard K.T. saying, in Turkey we watched as Kobani was under siege for  months and months.  Turkey sat there, did very little.  Turkey has been  very difficult to influence to get engaged in this fight against ISIS even  though ISIS is essentially -- this alligator called ISIS has been chomping  at their canoe for a long time.</p><p>Now Turkey is saying, ok, well this is probably retaliation because now we  are joined with, you know, the other fight against ISIS and now we're  helping to train some Syrian rebels.  So this is probably retaliation.</p><p>I see that as a bit of a cop out from Turkey because they really have not  wanted to be engaged in this fight.  And what they really want I think is  for the U.S. and for other countries to step in and fight this so they can  sit back and watch.  </p><p>SMITH:  So you don't think Turkey is going to join the battle here?  </p><p>GABRIEL:  I think Turkey will but I think they're going to continue to do  as little as possible.  And there's a lot of reasons for this.  For one,  it's that Turkey does not want to see the rise of the Kurds. Turkey does  not want to see an independent Kurdistan.  They have seen the Kurdish power  rising.  The Kurds have been our biggest ally in this fight against ISIS.   And that's a big problem for Turkey so I think that is one of the main  reasons that they're wanting to kind of sit back. </p><p>You know, they wanted the U.S. to do a lot.  They wanted us to establish a  no-fly zone.  They wanted a humanitarian zone. They wanted others to come  in and take care of this threat and I think we'll continue to see them do  as little as possible.  </p><p>SMITH:  Cover of the \"Wall Street Journal\" this morning -- Dagen.  ISIS's  leader takes steps to ensure group's survival.  Not just ensuring survival,  it seems that they're gaining territory and they're gaining power.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Lea, Turkey has one of the largest armies in the world. </p><p>GABRIEL:  Second largest in NATO.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  And one of I think the fourth largest overall.  Would we  be willing to step in and help Turkey knowing that they have basically the  power to take care of themselves if they so choose?  </p><p>GABRIEL:  This is a little diplomatic game that I think we have been  playing for months.  Since Kobani was going on a lot of people said why  aren't we doing more in Kobani?  Why just an air campaign?  I think a lot  of this was to basically say look, this is a regional problem. </p><p>As I said this alligator is chomping at your canoe.  We may be in the same  river but it's not right here on our borders, it's on yours Turkey.  And I  think that's a quiet little diplomatic game that is being played, that's  the soft power.  </p><p>BLOCK:  I mean look, there's a new power here, what is El Baghdadi and ISIS  really worried about here?  They're worried about the fact that the United  States is making this groundbreaking deal with Iran.  Why are we making the  deal with Iran?  You know, the thing that no one wants to talk about is  this sort of takes the shackles off the revolutionary guard, our sworn  enemies.  Maybe now and certainly in the past that says hey they're going  to join the fight more overtly now.  And you know, for someone looking at  Erdogan in Turkey, looking at the U.S., looking at all the players in the  region suddenly there's this new big player there and you know, I think is  really what ISIS is responding to here.  </p><p>GABRIEL:  But definitely a positive spin on the nuclear deal and not to say  a spin -- </p><p>BLOCK:  No, it's my view on it.  I get asked about it constantly.</p><p>GABRIEL:  There's good and there's bad.  There's definitely a good side of  it but at the same time what Iran really wants in the region is influence. </p><p>BLOCK:  Here it is.</p><p>GABRIEL:  So Iran may be battling ISIS, but Iran wants to grow its  influence and in no way would I consider Iran any sort of an ally with us  in the region at any point.  </p><p>SMITH:  All right.  Thank you to Lea Gabriel.  And by the way, check out  Lea's new web segment called the \"Fox Patriot Report\".  Log onto  foxnews.com for more -- right?</p><p>GABRIEL:  Yes.  Thank you.</p><p>SMITH:  All right.  Thank you very much to Lea.</p><p>A new poll this morning showing Donald Trump taking the lead in the  Republican race but could his comments on Senator McCain the damper on his  White House run?  Some think so, some think not.  Former New York governor  and current Republican candidate for president George Pataki is here to  weigh in.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>SANDRA SMITH, FOX BUSINESS: Ohio Governor, John Kasich set to jump into the  2016 White House race. Blake Burman has the latest from Washington. Blake?</p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FOX BUSINESS: Sandra, John Kasich will make it 16 later  today. He is expected to be the final in a long list of candidates in the  Republican primary. Kasich is the Governor of the swing state of Ohio and a  former Congressman. In between those two stints, he also worked at Lehman  Brothers.  This will be Kasich's second attempt at a White House run and  he'll start with a lot of ground to make up.  Kasich currently sits just  outside the top 10 pulling in around one to two percent of support from  Republicans and  for the moment, is among the packs staring up at Donald  Trump. A poll released by \"The Washington Post\" shows the billionaire  businessman has widened his lead. Trump's 24 percent is double his nearest  competitors. However Sandra,  some of that poll was taken before his  controversial comments on John McCain. So, the full effect of that for  Trump is still unknown and the Post points out that on the final day of  that poll, they saw a drop for Trump. So it's something we'll have to look  forward - look to going forward. Sandra?</p><p>SMITH: Alright. Thank you for that Blake. And following his comments on  Senator McCain, \"The Des Moines Register\" is now calling for Trump to end  his run for the White House. My next guest has taken Donald Trump to task  for his recent comments on Senator McCain, and demeaning Mexicans.</p><p>Joining me now is former New York governor and current Republican candidate  for president, George Pataki. Governor, thank you for being here this  morning.  </p><p>GEORGE PATAKI (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  Good morning.  Nice being on  with you.  </p><p>SMITH:  All right, so where do you stand on Trump's most recent comments on  Senator John McCain?  </p><p>PATAKI:  Can I tell I something?  Donald Trump is not going to be President  of the United States.  Period.  Whether it's his McCain comments, his  comments earlier demeaning Mexicans.</p><p>SMITH:  Why do you rule him out?  </p><p>PATAKI:  First of all, he's never held public office and we've had two  people in 150 years -- Dwight Eisenhower and U.S. Grant -- who hadn't held  public office.  And then he makes comments that are simply outrageous.  The  media loves this.  I mean, look what we're talking about. The day after the  U.N. Security Council --</p><p>SMITH:  The media loves it.</p><p>PATAKI:  -- approves the Iran agreement, we're talking about Donald Trump.</p><p>SMITH:  This is true.</p><p>PATAKI:  Donald Trump is not going to be president. The Iran Security  Council vote is meaningful; that's what we should be talking about.   Forgive me.  </p><p>SMITH:  Well, the media loves it, but the polling shows the American voters  like it as well.  Now you're in this race, and we've got another GOP  contender jumping in today as well.  The field, the bench, is deep,  Governor.  </p><p>PATAKI:  I think that's a great thing.  </p><p>SMITH:  It is?  .  </p><p>PATAKI:  I think it's a great thing for the country, a great thing for the  party.  It's July of 2015.  The election is November of 2016.  And I've had  people come up to me and say what's going on?  Normally this is -- three or  four months before the election, not year and three or four months before  the election.</p><p>People will have a chance to make their case.  People will rise up, drop  out, and Donald Trump I think has disqualified himself.  He's a celebrity.   The media loves him.  But ultimately he is not going to be President of the  United States.  </p><p>PATAKI:  So do you think he has been a bad thing for the Republican Party,  considering that most GOP candidates are having to respond to his comments?</p><p>PATAKI:  I do.  I do.  In particular, I think the Republicans --  </p><p>SMITH:  Because you're sitting there talking about it right now.  </p><p>PATAKI:  Yes, and I think the Republicans who did not stand up to his  comments about Mexicans are going to regret it next year.  I mean it's one  thing to stand up for an icon, a war hero, John McCain.  Everybody did  that, but you have to stand up --  </p><p>SMITH:  Or all POWs, quite frankly.  He took a shot at anybody -- </p><p>PATAKI:  All POWs, absolutely.</p><p>SMITH:  -- who had ever been a prisoner of war.</p><p>PATAKI:  And all those who have served our country.  But you have to stand  up for those who aren't famous, who aren't rich and powerful or hold  important position.  And they didn't -- so many of my running mates didn't  do that when it came to Mexicans, and they're going to regret that.  </p><p>SMITH:  And there's been criticism of the Republican Party for not focusing  on most important issue for the American voter, and that is the economy.   Where is the GOP on that?</p><p>PATAKI:  Yes.  Well, first of all, we have to talk about the economy, but I  honestly think what happened yesterday in the U.N. Security Council is  critical. And when you think back to September 11, the economic  consequence.  Obviously it had horrible human personal consequences that we  still feel, but the economic consequences of an insecure America are  enormous.  </p><p>And after that deal -- and I am outraged that this president bypassed  Congress, basically gutted the law that he signed giving Congress 60 days  to reject that deal and seven different U.N. sanctions -- decades of work  by presidents since Bill Clinton are out the window regardless what  Congress has done.  That's an outrage.  And ultimately when our security's  at risk, it affects our economy.  </p><p>MICHAEL BLOCK, RHINO TRADING PARTNERS CHIEF STRATEGIST:  Governor.  You  know, everyone's still focused on Trump.  In a perfect world, it would be  about issues.  How do you intend to get public back on issues.  </p><p>PATAKI:  You know, when you're out on the hustings, when you don't have the  cameras there -- and sadly I don't get that many cameras when I'm out on  the hustings because they're all with Trump or Hillary or someone else.   People care about the issues, they care about jobs, they care about the  fact that we've had one of the weakest recoveries ever since a terrible  recession.  They care about, you know, the fact that we are now having  great relations with Cuba but we have hard relations with our ally Israel.  And it's like a bad \"Saturday Night Live\" skit when the president -- when  four Marines who are putting their -- put their lives on the line for our  country are murdered in the United States, are told -- the Marines are  told, well, you can't wear your uniform in the United States.  That's a  disgrace.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS:  But I think that -- but I think that you --  that Trump does touch on the issues, to defend why he is popular among  Americans.  He takes a very hard line on immigration.  He uses language  that is objectionable, but he takes a hard line on immigration, he takes a  hard line on China, he takes a hard line on the lack of economic growth and  wage growth in this country.  And that is what's connecting him.  </p><p>PATAKI:  He's great at pointing out problems.  But what America needs are  solutions.  And when it comes to immigration, I don't think there's a  Republican candidate who doesn't stand up there and say we have got to  secure our borders.  We have got to make sure everybody comes here legally.   They just don't demean millions of people in the process.  </p><p>And that is, to me, a part of the politics that I don't like.  We have to  talk about solutions, talk about bringing people together, and not  inflammatory rhetoric that seems, you know, wonderful for a headline at the  moment but ultimately divides us and doesn't solve problems.  </p><p>SMITH:  You talked about the four Marines and now the sailor that has also  died in those shootings last week.  Do you -- should military men and women  in this country be armed?  </p><p>PATAKI:  Absolutely.  It is a despicable surrender, tyrannical Islam here,  when this president goes to our Marine recruiters in response to this and  says don't wear a uniform and keep your blinds drawn.  This is absurd.   They should have arms; every military person in uniform in this country  should be allowed to carry an arm. I'll tell you, I'll feel a lot better if  I see a Marine in a uniform with a gun on his side than if I do seeing that  this strong solid guy, knowing he could be a target and can't defend  himself.  By the way, my son was a Marine, in Iraq, so I'm -- </p><p>SMITH:  Well, we thank you for his service and your family's service.</p><p>PATAKI:  Thank you.</p><p>SMITH:  All right, Governor Pataki, full of energy.  Love your passion.   Thanks for being here this morning.  </p><p>PATAKI:  Thank you. Alright. Well coming up, bidding wars are back for  homes. Are they a good thing or a bad thing. We're going to discus that  next, stay tuned.  </p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING: UNIDENTIFIED SONG)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>SMITH: Alright. Let's take a look futures ahead of the opening bell on Wall  Street this morning. Dow and S&amp;P futures, the broader market averages or  the futures on them at least, are down, pointing to lower open. Look at the  NASDAQ futures though following up on yesterday's record close. NASDAQ  futures looking like a higher open. That would be a record on Wall Street  when things get going at 9:30 a.m.  Eastern this morning. And look at gold  prices. That sell-off continues. Dropped below $1100 dollars an ounce in  the overnight session. We've come off those lows but still down at $1106 an  ounce.</p><p>Call it a flashback to the housing boom. Bidding wars are back in housing  market, but unlike the 2000 characterized by easy money mortgages, bidding  wars are now sparked by too few homes offered for sale. Michael, what's  your take on this. Is this a red flag or sign of a robust housing market?</p><p>BLOCK: Housing has already come a long way and we've seen it do well. It's  well-off lows the lows and if you look at chart on new home sales and  housing starts, they've come well off the lows and they still have a ways  to run that's in 2007, 2006, the era like that. A couple things that I'm  looking at.  I look at stocks for a living and I noticed that the ITB, the  homebuilding, home construction ETF, peaked in early April. Yesterday, even  though we've had strong housing data yesterday, housing stocks lagged.  There was some analysts rumbling about Home Depot and Lowe's, some softness  there perhaps. So, there's some worries there.  </p><p>In term of the supply-demand dynamic. I think that's exactly what it is.  There's a scarcity of homes. What's going to happen? Are we going - are  they going to build more homes. That comes down to a lot about confidence  and consumer confidence from (INAUDIBLE) last week. For me, I think housing  hitting a bit of a wall here. It's has a good run. It's no longer new news  incrementally when housing data is good. I'm a little worried about what  happened in the energy patch and what's happening with U.S. industrials in  terms of manufacturing. Manufacturing has hit a wall in the United States.  Is that going to affect wages?  Wages are stopped out and you know, to me,  housing I think the risk is to the downside here.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINES: We're going to have to go back to talking  about housing, though, regionally and locally because the big issue -  because this story about the bidding wars coming back is in just some  specific hot markets. There's so many pockets of weakness throughout the  country where there hasn't been wage growth. You go and hour half outside  New York City, there is plenty of supply and the prices look extremely soft  and you see that throughout the country. If you're not in a hot economic  market like New York, or Silicon Valley, the San Francisco area, the houses  are - the supply can be plentiful and the prices can be pretty cheap.  </p><p>SMITH: But there are pockets doing very well. Case in point, the city of  Chicago. Chicago home sales hit a new record high. The first half of the  year. Sales activity really hot there.  </p><p>BLOCK: What I'll argue is back during the peak, Chicago was good.  It was  never one of these explosive markets in there it came in. So now, it's kind  of coming off the low base. You know, Dagen was talking about -- </p><p>Dagen: Highest sells tax in the country in Chicago now. A lot of economic  problems.  </p><p>BLOCK: Well the governance is so good there. Anyway, --</p><p>SMITH: Drop mic.</p><p>BLOCK: You know, we're talking about markets that are good. One thing I'll  say about the high-end market, you now Denver what was talked about in the  press and that's an interesting place. But New York, on the high-end. One  thing that we're not talking about here is how strong the Dollar is. How is  that going to deter -</p><p>SMITH: Foreign investment?</p><p>BLOCK: -- you know, potential buyer from Brasilia and Russia, some of these  countries - Europe, some of these countries that have really spurred a lot  of buying.  </p><p>MCDOWELL: Chinese buyers.</p><p>BLOCK: That's something I think (INAUDIBLE) talking enough about. You know,  Chinese buying maybe insulted to that (INAUDIBLE) stage relatively strong.  But I'm talking about countries like the (INAUDIBLE) of Ruble, which we've  seen weakness.  </p><p>MCDOWELL: It's not just the currency, it's the commodities themselves being  weak and Russia put the  pressure on the buyers.  </p><p>BLOCK: Yes, and that's the whole thing and that's the whole punch line here  is that, you know, what happens to commodities is going to affect housing  in this country - </p><p>SMITH: It's going to affect everything. </p><p>BLOCK: Because of the dollar.</p><p>BLOCK: All right, coming up guys, there is still no verdict in the Tom  Brady deflate-gate case and now some analyst think the NFL may wait an  entire year to hand down a ruling.  Oh, joy. Our next guest wrote the book  on Brady and he's going to weigh in on deflate-gate next.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>SMITH: It's Hot outside. Temperatures rising across the country and we are  facing a heat wave. Maria Molina is in the Fox Weather Center with the  details. Maria, another hot day, another hot week?  </p><p>MARIA MOLINA, FOX WEATHER CENTER: Yes, it looks like it's going to be  another hot one across many areas in the country and for us in New York  City for instance, we're going to be hot today, but we're going to start to  feel relief already as we head into Tomorrow with a cold front that's going  to be swing through dropping  those temperatures and humidity levels. But  if you live in the southeast or across parts of the plains, expect those  hot temperatures to remain in place at least for several more days. Parts  of Oklahoma, you're not expecting any relief pretty much for most of this  workweek.</p><p>So, again, different areas expecting to see a relief or no relief and  different time periods. So you can see a look at the high temperatures for  today. 90s and triple digits across parts of the plains as we head  eastward, high temperatures widespread into the 90s and the problem is that  it's not just hot on thermometer, but you also have a lot of humidity  in  place out there and that's what makes it feel a lot hotter than what  temperatures say. </p><p>So, this is what it's going to feel like as we head out the door. In  Wilmington, by 5:00 p.m., it should feel like 108, 106 in Montgomery,  Vicksburg 107 and triple-digit heat index values as well across parts of  the plains. So again, it's really what it's going to feel like out there  that's the issue and those heat advisories in place out here because of  those high heat index values. Excesses heat warnings also in place portions  of the Carolinas. And I do want to mention that there is a chance for some  showers and storms different parts of the country today. A very low risk  for severe weather, but it is in place out there across the plains, Mid- Atlantic and also in the northeast. Sandra?  </p><p>SMITH: All right, Maria. Thank you.  Well still, no verdict in the Tom  Brady deflate-gate case and should there be one?  There is talk of waiting  on punishment for the New England Patriots quarterback until after the  season. We bring in \"New York Dailey News\" NFL columnist and author of  upcoming \"Brady versus Manning: The Untold Story of the Rivalry that  Transformed the NFL\". Gary Myers. Gary, good morning to you. </p><p>GARY MEYERS, NFL COLUMNIST AND AUTHOR (via telephone):  Good morning. How  are you?</p><p>SMITH: Alright. So, a lot of people have made the case for waiting to  finalize the punishment the Patriots after analyzing all this data over the  2015 season.  Are you saying - do you make the same case for that?</p><p>MYERS: Well, I think what would make sense from the standpoint that it  would give NFL an opportunity to -- to measure these footballs you know,  during, you know, the course of the game, especially during the wintertime,  when -- you know, the Patriots are claiming that the ball's naturally lose  air, you know, due to the weather conditions. But I don't know how  realistic it is that the NFL is going to want to --  you know, put this off  for a full year and wait to hand out the punishment to -- to the Patriots,  and, you know, put punishment on hold for the Patriots that they have  already handed out.</p><p>SMITH: And by the way, Gary, you're talking about punishment for Patriots,  but there's punishment --  Peter King over at the nnqb.com, he takes this a  step further and says any punishment for Tom Brady should be put off as  well.  </p><p>MYERS: Right. That's what I was about to say is that even more importantly  than punishment to the Patriots would be, you know, the punishment to Tom  Brady, and, you know, from the standpoint of really getting an accurate  indication of what, you know, the effect of the weather conditions are, on  footballs, which the NFL has never done -- that would seem to be, you know,  a fair solution before, you know, enacting all the punishment. But, again,  I don't know how realistic it is if the NFL's going to want to defer this  for a full year and go through the process of doing this you know,  complete, you know work-up of  what happens to the football during the  course of the game, I'm not sure that's going to happen.  </p><p>BLOCK: Hey Gary, you know, let me be blunt here. Is the NFL worried about  derailing the gravy train here or what are?  </p><p>MYERS: Derailing Brady train.  </p><p>BLOCK: Yes, you know, taking Brady out of the game. Is that going to ruin  money their maker here? Are they just a little reticent about that? Is  there any thought about that?  </p><p>MYERS: No, I  don't think that has anything to do -- uh -- with this  situation. NFL is basically an ATM machine and you know, whether Tom Brady  plays the first game, second game or up to, you know, or missing the first  four games, I don't think that's going to have any impact on the revenue.  </p><p>SMITH: Alright Gary. Let me bring in money angle here because despite all  these scandal that we're talking, that the NFL has been dealing with and  facing, the teams are still making a lot of money. More than $225 million  dollars each on revenue sharing for the NFL.  </p><p>MYERS: Well, I mean, we know they can make an absolute incredible amount of  money just from national TV contracts alone and they make a lot of money  from their local revenue. I mean, it's no secret that the NFL is an  extremely profitable business. Some of the numbers came out yesterday  because the Green Bay Packers are publicly owned, and those numbers are --  are made public.  But, again, as this relates to Brady, I don't know that  one player has any kind of impact on -- on the kind of revenue that the NFL  can generate. Now, it certainly could impact TV ratings the first couple of  weeks in just in Patriot games, that Brady, you know, plays or doesn't  play, depending on what happens, but I don't know overall that it makes one  bit of difference, you know, term of how much NFL is making.  </p><p>SMITH: Alright. Gary Myers thanks for joining us this morning and thank you  to Michael Block for joining me for the hour.  </p><p>MYERS: All right, take care.  </p><p>SMITH: Alright. Thank you both. Next hour, a \"Breaking Bad\" actor is  looking  to take his role on TV to real life announcing plans to run for  public office New Mexico. He'll join us next hour. Keep it right here on  Fox Business.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2015 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

Dagen, see you in just a bit. Thank  you. Good morning. I am Sandra Smith in for Maria Bartiromo.  It is Tuesday  morning , July 21st and with me this hour, Steve Cortes of Veracruz and  Attorney Mercedes Colwin.  </p><p>Here are your top stories at 6:00 a.m. on the east coast.  Gold once again  trading at its lowest level in five years as more investors prepare for the  Federal Reserve to raise interest rates.  Futures showing the markets right  now are trending to the downside, pointed to a lower open a couple hours  from now.  NASDAQ futures holding onto a slight gain.  </p><p>Soaring temperatures across the country again today.  The National Oceanic  and Atmospheric Administration saying records were broken for the month of  June and that 2015 is lining up to be the hottest year ever.  </p><p>Ohio governor John Kasich will add his name to the very crowded field of  candidates running for the White House on the Republican side today/   Kasich has plenty of experience in Washington serving in the House of  Representatives from 1983 through 2001.  </p><p>Donald Trump topping the latest ABC Washington Post poll taking in 24  percent of the support in the Republican field.  But, that came down before  Trump's comments about Senator John McCain who he doesn't regard as a war  hero.  Trump told Bill O'Reilly last night that the Senator has not done  anything for war veterans.  </p><p>(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, 2016 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: He's supposed to be doing it and  I see him on television all the time and he's always talking, talking, but  nothing gets done.  These veterans are living in hell Bill.  They're  hurting and they're crying and -</p><p>SMITH: More on that in a bit.  Meanwhile, Verizon among the companies  reporting earning this morning ahead of the opening bell. Analyst looking  for $1.01 a share. That's up from $0.91 cents a year ago.  Apple reporting  after the close today.  The \"Wall Street Journal\" saying the Iphone  accounts for nearly 70 percent of Apple's revenue and remains the company's  most profitable hardware products.  </p><p>Qualcomm, which supplies many of the chips for the Iphone it's looking at  the possibility of a breakup.  The Journal says the company will review its  options after an activist investor pushed for change at the chipmaker.   Seth Blatter, the now notorious president of the world soccer organization  FIFA were showered with fake money by comedian Lee Nelson. Nelson, a known  prankster in Europe tweeted about the incident later saying in jest that he  was excited to be at the meeting with Blatter to secure the North Korea  2026 World Cup.  </p><p>And Zach Johnson is you 2015 British Open champion.  How many saw this  playing out? Johnson birdied the first two holes of a four hole playoff to  help secure the win.  Jordan Speith who was trying to become the first in  since Ben Hogan in 1953 to win the first three majors of the year, fell one  stroke short at the end of his round yesterday.  </p><p>Alright well turning back to the latest on Donald Trump's run for the White  House.  Backtracking a little on those comments was Senator John McCain.  </p><p>(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: I have respect for Senator John McCain.  I used to like him a lot.   I supported him. I raised a lot of money for his campaign against President  Obama and certainly if there was a misunderstanding, I would totally take  that back.  </p><p>(END AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>SMITH: Trump has to say come under heavy fire for his comment questioning  Senator McCain's heroism as a prisoner of war.  But According to a new  \"Washington Post/ABC News\" poll, he still holds 24 percent of Republicans  support.  The largest lead recorded by any GOP candidate this year.   Although this number is strong, it must be noted that this poll was  finalized before coverage of his comment about Senator McCain became  widespread.  </p><p>But the headlines did not stop there.  The \"Des Moines Register\", Iowa's  largest newspaper is now calling on Trump to drop out of the 2016 race  saying quote \"Trump should pull the plug on his bloviating sideshow\".   Alright Mercedes, some pretty strong words from the key primary state's  newspaper.  Look, I mean leading in the polls, I'll be it, that was before  these most recent comments. Everybody's talking about him.  I mean, what  have - what is he currently doing for the race?  </p><p>MERCEDES COLWIN, ATTORNEY: I mean, certainly he's the game changer because  you don't know what he's going to say next.  He plays by the rules, he says  what's on his mind.  There really isn't that much --</p><p>SMITH: The \"Des Moines Register\" calling for him to step out of the race.  </p><p>COLWIN: It's true because it's his third rail. When you start criticizing  veterans, especially the GOP candidate, that is the third rail. You should  not touch it. And certainly will it have traction? Who knows.  But now that  the media's doing --</p><p>SMITH: Steve, how could he even let those words leave his mouth and not  know that there was going to be a fire storm? </p><p>STEVE CORTES, VERACRUZ: Well look, why? Because he's not a serious  candidate and this is serious business by the way. The Unites States has  slow growth, we're in a very dangerous world. This is no time for the  bloviating and demagoguery of a reality show.  And that's what Donald  Trump's about. This is about building his brand.  This isn't really about  making America better.  I believe he is - I agree completely with \"The Des  Moines Register\". He is a political dirty bomb for the Republican party,  particularly in terms of the party's outreach to Hispanics.  He has told  the largest emerging demographic group in America we think you're rapist,  we don't want your support and a group, by the way, which is dying to be  Republican. </p><p>SMITH: To be fair, though, he found a sweet spot. He's polling well. </p><p>CORTES: He has for now. But you know, asking a poll right now about the  2016 race is like asking a 5-year old at July what do you want for  Christmas.  There is going to be so many changes between now and the race.  Remember in the last cycle how many different people had the front runners  status at one time or another, had a cup of coffee as the front runner.  </p><p>SMITH: So Mercedes, the question had been is Donald Trump going to help or  hurt the GOP party.  I mean, there's just this deep bench there. And do you  think it's going to help the party to have that many contenders?  </p><p>COLWIN: He is so polarized. Well, it's certainly not helpful that  you have  all these individuals that are on the platform.  And you got, you need,  especially the polls. It's at 24 percent now and I agree with you.  I think  it's going - we'll see what happens as it goes on. But frankly, he's got - Trump tremendous popularity and obviously he rates with the polls, but a  lot of individuals are looking to him and  saying you're not going to be  like these other candidates.  You're going to say what's on your mind.  Maybe that's what this world needs. </p><p>CORTES: I do think - listen, I will give him this. He clearly is striking a  nerve out there in this country, but I think that nerve is because of  sluggish growth. I think middle America feel squeezed and they should.  They're wages are not rising, they're cost are rising dramatically  particularly in terms of healthcare and education. So, there's a lot of  angst out there. And a guy like this who will forcefully say exactly what  he believes and appear to be kind of angry, I think that resonates. </p><p>SMITH: What? That he'll be the greatest jobs President that ever lived?  Alright. Well speaking of the deep bench by the way guys, we got to add  this in here. Ohio Governor John Kasich set to jump into the 2016 White  House race adding to the number of GOP candidates out there.  Blake Burman  has the latest in Washington for that. Blake?  </p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FOX BUSINESS:  Hi there Sandra. Good morning to you. John  Kasich will indeed make it official in Ohio later today.  Kasich is the  current Governor of that swing state and the former Congressmen.  In  between those two stints, he also worked at Lehman Brothers.  This would be  Kasich's second attempt at a White House run and he'll start with a lot of  ground to make up in a very crowded GOP field.  Kasich currently polls in  around one to two percent of support from Republicans. That puts him just  outside the top 10 for now.  The field for the moment appears to be set for  the GOP.  16 candidates with either political or business name recognition.  They'll be jockeying for separation as the debates begin in the upcoming  weeks and the first votes are cast in Iowa, which is a little more than six  months from now.  Sandra?</p><p>SMITH: Getting interesting. Alright.</p><p>BURMAN: Certainly is.</p><p>SMITH: Blake, thank you.  Alright, gold prices, they're getting interesting  as well.  Prices there searching for some direction after plunging to the  lowest level in five years on rate hike dears. Phil Flynn from the CME  Group, he's joining us by phone this morning, bright and early Phil. This  move in gold, everybody's watching it.  Where does it go from here?  </p><p>PHIL FLYNN, PRICES FUTURES GROUP: You know, that's the big question Sandra  and I agree with you.  A lot of this is fears about the Fed raising  interest rates, but this (INAUDIBLE) in gold may be the reason why the Fed  can't.  You know, a lot of people are asking questions whether this drop in  the gold market could really, you know, be like a cancer to the rest of the  commodities complex because it wasn't just gold they took a hit yesterday.   We were seeing industrial metals across the board under pressure with the  strong dollar.  If we're getting into a situation where this drop in the  gold market is signaling another round of deflation on the globe, it's  going to make it very difficult for the Fed to start raising rates if these  deflationary pressures are starting to rise.</p><p>SMITH: So Steve, let me -- Phil, you're going to stay with us for a second.   Steve, I look at gold prices at where they are right now. $1106 a troy  ounce. My feeling is that they test $1000 an ounce, but you're the expert.   Tell me.  </p><p>CORTES: Yes, well. I hope I'm an expert on something Sandra. But yes,  listen. I completely agree.  I think commodity deflation has been in a  trench force for years and I think it's going to continue to be. I agree  with Phil very much. I think that Fed is really put in a bind by this.  Although they want to talk about raising rates this year, I'm not sure that  they can. When you have commodities, broad commodities (INAUDIBLE) at  decade lows. You have - and it's across the board.  Sugar hit a six-year  low yesterday.  Gold - if it comes out of the ground basically, it's  increasingly worth less. Whether it's agricultural metals, energy.  So  we're seeing broad-based deflation. I believe it's primarily because of  China slowing and because of volatility in the Chinese market that is  broadening throughout the globe. But that is not the backdrop under which  the Fed probably gets aggressive raising rates.  </p><p>SMITH: You know and Phil, I keep talking about the U.S. dollar because  everything that Steve just mentioned is denominated in the greenback.  So,  you get that strengthening in the U.S. dollar as we anticipate that first  rate hike. You get a sell-off in commodities. That's a natural sort of  process that's we're seeing play out there. We had a Fed President in this  show yesterday say that that rate hike is likely coming by the end of this  year.  Where do you - what camp are you in as far as that first interest  rate hike at this point?  </p><p>FLYNN: Well prior to yesterday's drop in gold, I thought the Fed was going  to do it and it almost no matter what because they got through some of the  biggest crisis's. You know, concerns about Greece, they were sidetracked.   You know, the Chinese stock markets stabilized.  So, I thought they had a  chance to do it.  But then, of course, that Sunday night, that drop in the  commodities prices, that can change a complexion.  You know, if we don't  see stabilization in the commodities.  This is going to really put a monkey  wrench in the global economic recovery and if the Fed raises rates against  the advice of the IMF and we start to really bad deflationary cycle that  slows down the rest of the economy, (INAUDIBLE) make it very difficult for  the market to move forward. </p><p>SMITH: Alright. Good stuff Phil Flynn as gold sinks to yet more five-year  lows. Commodities struggling across the board.  Thank you for joining us  this morning. </p><p>Temperatures meanwhile rising across the country.  We're facing a heat  wave.  Maria Molina is in the Fox weather center with the details and the  latest on that. Maria?  </p><p>MARIA MOLINA, FOX WEATHER CENTER: It's hot outside.  </p><p>SMITH: Yes, I mean -</p><p>MOLINA: Good morning.  We're going to be seeing those temperatures climbing  yet again today and that's in place across parts of the South, the south  east and also after you  head up the east coast along the I95 corridor.  Take a look at some of these numbers today.  So, these are the actual  forecast temperatures. Forecast  to reach 99 in Dallas,  100 Del Rio,  farther east into the 90s as well across parts of the south east up unto  places like New York City. </p><p>But the problem is that when you factors in the humidity, it feels a lot  hotter than what the thermometer reads.  And this is what it's going to  feel like coming up later on this afternoon.  106 degrees in Montgomery and  also in Vicksberg and Atlanta's going to feel like 97.  108 degrees in  Wilmington and farther north in Washington D.C., it's going to feel like 97  degrees out there as we head out the door.  So, that's why we have heat  advisories in effect out here across the south and also into the Carolinas  and southeast Virginia. Excessive heat warnings in effect as well with  those heat index value forecast to climb into the triple digits.  Sandra?  </p><p>SMITH: Alright. Maria, thank you. Quick reaction from you guys. Hot weather  across the country. Steve, mean, I'm a Midwest girl.  I start to think  about our crops and the agricultural market in the United States when  temperatures like that.  But I mean, just in general, this is a game  changer.  Retail, everything affected by these temperatures.  </p><p>CORTES: You know. It's interesting. After a couple of really harsh winters  and by the way, companies got very used to blaming poor results during the  winter on bad weather in the winter. It'll be interesting to see if they  try to do that now in the summer.</p><p>SMITH: Exactly.  </p><p>CORTES:  I tend to think that blame it on the rain was a really bad song by  Milli Vanilli. It was a bad excuse for economics.  But well see, but yes,  you know, obviously - maybe Al Gore was on to something.  It's been pretty  darn hot lately. Manhattan yesterday, I wondered if I was in Manhattan or  if I was in Mecca, Saudi Arabia because it was near 100 degrees intense  humidity.  Clearly it's happening all over the country.</p><p>COLWIN: But intense weather drives individuals out of this weather in into  the stores.  I mean - represent federated stores and they love this weather  because the consumers are going in. They're going into shop. They're doing  this to getting out of the hot weather.  </p><p>SMITH: I can already see the climate change conversations all over the  general, the media, all over the different channels.  I mean, this is the  hottest summer they're saying on record.   I mean, Mercedes, there are  going to be big political talking points on that. </p><p>COLWIN: Oh no. undoubtedly.</p><p>SMITH: Accurate or not. Alright, well the NASDAQ notching it's third record  close-in-a-row.  Is this a sign that they could be approaching another tech  bubble?  We'll discuss that next and take a look at some of these other  headlines that we're watching this morning in \"The Wall Street Journal\".  Fed tells big banks to shrink, Toshiba's CEO felled by accounting scandal  and shooting highlights online gun sales.</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING: \"IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT\" - BILLY JOEL)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>SMITH: A fresh record for the NASDAQ this morning.  The tech-heavy index  closing yesterday at a record for third session-in-a-row sparking debates  about whether we're approaching bubble territory.  I should note that  NASDAQ futures are the lone winner this morning pointing to another record  on the open on Wall Street this morning.  Here's what the St.  Louis  Federal Reserve President James Bowler exclusively told our own Peter  Barnes yesterday.  </p><p>(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>(INTERVIEW WITH ST. LOUIS FED RESERVE PRESIDENT PETER BARNES) </p><p>(END AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>SMITH: Hmnn. This is just as Apple, Microsoft, Yahoo! are gearing up to  report results after the bell today.  Steve, do you think that we have a  tech bubble in our hand and should a Federal Reserve President be talking  about the stock market like that?  </p><p>CORTES: Well, let me answer the second first. No, they should not be. And  by the way, the Fed's record on prognostication has been pretty terrible is  go all the way back down greenspan irrational exuberance. That was a great  time to buy. Janet Yellen a year ago said more or less the same thing about  biotechs. She got sectors specific, which I though was pretty strange.  Biotech has soared ever since then. So, their forecasting ability is poor  generally, specially when it come to stocks. Are we in a tech bubble? No, I  don't believe so. But is it frothy? Yes. I absolutely think so. It's been  quite a run.  My problem -</p><p>SMITH: What's the frothy based on? </p><p>CORTES: Because is too narrow.  My problem with the market is it's relying  far too much on just a few names. So, names like Facebook, Netflix, Google  are absolutely soaring right now.  But Apple, which is going to report and  by the way, I like Apple.  I think it's relatively cheap. Apple, and this  is very unusual, is not keeping pace with technology overall.  Normally,  Apple is the driver of the bus, is leading the tech party whether it's up  or down. The fact that the general is not leading the army here, Apple in  front of tech worries me that things are getting frothy, but is it a  bubble, no.</p><p>A bubble is the year 2000 when grandma owned the globe.com and pets.com and  multi-billion-dollar valuations on companies that didn't make money. We're  not there, we're not at that kind of leverage. But, is it a dangerous spot?  Yes, I think so. Is it a spot to put new money to work? I do not believe  that, no. </p><p>SMITH: Interesting. So, Mercedes, from a consumer standpoint, I don't know.  You look around, you  walk around New York City and you feel like the  market is saturated with Apple products.  You know, you wonder do they have  any tools left in the tool chest there.   I mean, can they continue on this  sort of pace?  I mean, are we going to rush out to buy the next Apple  product?  </p><p>COLWIN: It's amazing because certainly with the Iphone watch, people were  just rushing to get - to purchase that and I think there's still that  traction. People still looking for a technology.  But, there are also a lot  of individuals, especially the newer little tech companies.  A lot of the  start-up tech companies. They are inspired by these big, by the big tech  companies. They're saying to themselves well, look at how much market share  they have. We can take a slice of - even if we just take one percent of  that market share.  So, we see a lot of these little tech companies come a  long and a lot of consumers look to them for the more interesting products  out there.</p><p>SMITH: So Steve, Apple's at $132 a share.  You would say don't require it  at these levels, but also don't sell it.  </p><p>CORTES: Yes, I would say. I would say this, I have no idea what they're  going to do on earnings, but if it gets hit on earnings, I'd get very  interested then because by most traditional metrics, even though this is a  massively valued company in terms of its market value. By most market  metrics, it's actually relatively cheap for a company that has this kind of  growth.  And so, and I think listen, their ability to innovate and I was a  doubter once Steve Jobs had to step down.  I was a doubter that necessarily  new management take the baton and run and it sure seems they have.  I know  this is just anecdotal, but in my house, my wife and I have four kids.   There were more apple products in our house than I think there are in an  Apple store.  So, I see it personally. I see it hands on how much kids  gravitate to this stuff and user-friendly nature of it.  And so, this is a  pretty special company, but tech overall I think it's a time to be  cautious.  </p><p>SMITH: Alright. Well don't forget to tune in today at 4:00 p.m.  Eastern on  \"After the battle\".  Apple Chiptole, Microsoft, Yahoo!, all will be  reporting results. After the market close, we will be breaking down every  headline for you only here right on Fox Business.  And new piracy concerns  for Hollywood. It's got nothing to do, by the way, with illegal movie  downloads.  Find out the new battle studios are facing.  Keep right here on  Fox Business.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)  </p><p>SMITH: Alright. While stocks are watched this morning, Paypal coming off  it's first trading day after the Ebay spin-off.  Cheryl Casone is here that  and other top stories.  Good morning Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS: Hey, good morning Sandra. Good morning  everybody. Well the stock rising nearly six percent on the day Monday. It  had jumped some 11 percent at one point in mid day trading. Take a look at  what it's doing this morning, pointing to a little bit of a higher open  even today, PYPL is the ticker.  Already more than half a dozen research  shops has a buy rating on this stock. And again, this stock should likely  open higher at 9:30 a.m. Eastern time.  </p><p>Business booming for the NFL. Each team receiving $226.4 million dollars  last year as part national revenue sharing.  Most of the money comes from  the league's television deals and the price tag was revealed when the Green  Bay Packers released it's shares part of the team's earnings report.  \\</p><p>And finally, this video of South Carolina's Director of Public Safety,  Leroy Smith going viral after Smith helped a white man wearing a racist T- shirt to the shade at the top of the statehouse steps on Saturday.   Tensions were high in Charleston as supporters of the Ku Klux Klan and the  Black Panthers clashed outside of the South Carolina capital.  Sandra,  Director Smith hopes this video going to be a catalyst for people to work  towards overcoming hate and violence. And social media has been called one  of the most powerful acts of kindness that you could witness.  </p><p>And it's interesting that the videos go viral because it really shows you  the pulse of what's happening out in the nation and how people are really  talking about race and very emotional about it right now.  </p><p>SMITH: Mercedes, what do you make of this?</p><p>COLWIN: I mean. I think it's just absolutely beautiful, especially because  racial tensions are so high.  To that, there's no wonder that it's gone  viral.  There's people hoping. They want something.  They want a change.  </p><p>CASONE: Well this is over the Confederate flag, by the way, as well. They  we're pulling down the Confederate flag at that statehouse.  And that's  where this whole event happened.  You know, all these states now across the  country are having to face the issue.  </p><p>SMITH: Amazing story.  </p><p>CORTES: You know I have to say, this kindness by a African-American police  officer for someone who clearly hate in his heart for him and to respond to  that hate with love and with the kindness of his heart is really an  inspiring act. I think it is emblematic though of what is going on in  broader society.  We're not a racist society.  We're society that elected a  black President twice. If anything, race relations were getting much  better. By the way,.  I worry that our President is harming race relations.   For instance, this race database that's been unveiled this week. That's  identity politics.  That divides people rather than unites.  So I think  that in fact, though the American people are far more like that African- American police officer rather than that racist with the terrible T-shirt  on.  </p><p>CASONE: That's a good point.

The study done  by the American Journal of Public Health says that even when the programs  like Weight Watchers and Jenny Craig shows some success, behavioral pattern  show those consumers putting weight back on.  The National Center for  Weight and Wellness as the total cost of obesity is about $305 billion  annually.</p><p>Well, breaking this morning, a Turkish town on the border of Syria was the  scene of a bloody attack that claims the lives of 31 people and left at  least 100 more wounded yesterday.  The bombing is believed to have been a  suicide attack carried out by an ISIS militant.  And my next guest says  this ISIS attack on Turkey was only a matter of time.  Joining me now is  FOX News National Security Analyst Katie McFarland.  Good morning for you  Katie.</p><p>KATIE MCFARLAND, FOX NEWS NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST:  Good morning.</p><p>SMITH:  Thank you for being here bright and early.  Unfortunately, some  horrible news here, but now Turkey?</p><p>MCFARLAND:  Yeah.  And it's only a matter of time.  Why?  For a couple of  reasons.  One, ISIS to be considered the vanguard movement of radical Islam  has to keep moving.  It can't just consolidate its gains.  It's got to keep  growing.  So you've seen it in Afghanistan, you've seen attacks in Northern  Africa, now you're seeing Turkey.  So it had to expand over the border.</p><p>When I've met with the president of Iraq last year, and he said, you know,  they had feel the Islamic State, ISIS feels they have been chosen by Allah  to rule the world.  So in mere minds they've got to keep expanding.  Number  two, this is how they do it.  They start with suicide bombers, they get  into an area, they then recruit locally, they send in Jihadi fighters, then  they start an insurgency with the idea that they're going to then  eventually claim territory and join it up with the Islamic State.</p><p>But the reason I figure that it was going to be Turkey, rather than other  places sooner or later, Turkey has a very poorest border.  We have seen,  you know, the stories of all the foreign fighters that were coming from...</p><p>SMITH:  Yup.</p><p>MCFARLAND:  ... you know, hundreds of countries.  They were going to fight  with ISIS.  They were coming through that Turkish border, that same place  where the attack was.  Similarly, they have come out the ISIS fighters and  refugees have come out of that region through Turkey then expand into  Greece and to Europe.  In the refugee pact, it's been faltered (ph) with  Jihadists...</p><p>SMITH:  So you said that this was sort of expected...</p><p>MCFARLAND:  Yeah.</p><p>SMITH:  ... but now that it happened, how much of a game changer is this?</p><p>MCFARLAND:  Now, we have to see what Turkey does.  Is Turkey going to put  up the fight?  They have famously last year in the Battle for Kobane, which  is the big city near there on the other side of the Turkish border, the  ISIS took Turkish tanks sat on the Turkish border and they watched as ISIS  came in, took the town, slaughtered the Kurdish population there.  So will  Turkey join the battle?  Will the Turkey join the battle in Syria and Iraq  that, you know, the Islamic State?  Or will Turkeys just say I'm going to  defend our borders?  Will Turkey tighten up its borders?  And then the  other question is what role does NATO play?  You know, where are the NATO  alliance?  Turkey is a NATO ally. Will they take this as an attack against  Turkey and call for help from the NATO ally?</p><p>SMITH:  We're always talking about how ISIS is staying so powerful.</p><p>MCFARLAND:  Yeah.</p><p>SMITH:  I mean, what is the latest on the amount of money that they have  been able to raise or make, I should say, on the black market with oil?   And I mean, what kind of money are they dealing with today?  Are they still  able to pull in as much as they were before?</p><p>MCFARLAND:  Yeah.</p><p>SMITH:  Are they're still strengthening in such large numbers?</p><p>MCFARLAND:  The interesting thing is to save money for ISIS came probably  from some wealthy Gulf Arab families, not countries families, and that's  what started them.</p><p>When my experience with Iraq has been what happened at the end of the Iraq  war was the Saddam Hussein fighters, (inaudible) in the Iraqi army married  up with these radical Islamic extremists and that's what form the core of  ISIS.  So they received money from the Gulf Arabs, but when they started  taking territory they eluded a lot of the antiquities and they sold these  on the open market.  The next thing was they then got ahold of oil  refineries and then they sold those.</p><p>SMITH:  And there's always the money angle that you're watching on there.</p><p>STEVE CORTES, VERACRUZ LLC FOUNDER:  No.  And I do think there's a business  angle of this, not to sound callous because it's a real human tragedy, but  there is a business angle and I think it's United States defense firms.  We  live in an incredibly dangerous world.  There is bipartisan agreement.  The  Democrats (inaudible) of defense spending just about as much as Republicans  do, which isn't the norm.  There's been a lot of M&amp;A and deals in the  space.  Lockheed Martin's stock that's really taken off in the last few  weeks.  So I think in a dangerous world as an investor, the defense sector  remains very, very attractive.</p><p>SMITH:  And then there's obviously, Mercedes, the questions about U.S.  involvement and cooperation with Turkey on this.</p><p>MERCEDES COLWIN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Oh no, undoubtedly.  So we'll have  to see how it sort of plays out, but this is certainly something to watch  and we'll see how (inaudible).</p><p>SMITH:  All right.  Katie McFarland...</p><p>MCFARLAND:  Thank you San (ph).  Thank you.</p><p>SMITH:  ... thank you for joining us this morning on that.</p><p>And 3D piracy has become a big issue in Hollywood.  Nicole Petallides is  here with that story.  Good morning Nicole.</p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX AM CO-HOST:  Good morning Sandra.  This is a  business story, a text story, the rise of 3D printers is a problem for  Hollywood.  The printers allow anyone who owns them to build products such  as the Stormtrooper gun (ph) from Star Wars, and their own without even  buying a toy.  They can make it on their own doing this would actually lose  money from movie studios who make these products to get a profit of course.   It could also force the studios to charge less for the items, so they can  be more attractive to the consumers.</p><p>So, this is a problem that is very similar to music piracy that was around  in the early 2000s which forced the music industry to change.  And so what  we're watching, we've seen piracy.  We've seen it with the records, right,  and music when the (inaudible) of the artist come out with new music.   We've seen illegally copied movies.  And now, you talk about the products  and you know so well the products, that's how these they make so much money  off of these, Hasbro for example, even yesterday talked about the Star Wars  products, the X-Men products just to name a few.  So your thoughts, I mean,  3D printing is all the way.</p><p>SMITH:  So Mercedes, it sounds like a legal question to me.</p><p>COLWIN:  Oh yeah.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SMITH:  What can the movie studios do to stop this?</p><p>COLWIN:  Well, this is great, because what they can do is first, they're  going to start sending up these letters.  They have to discover who is  actually printing these letters, so if they're selling.  Who knows if  they're printing it and they're creating these products, if they're selling  it, send out those letters, cease and desist letters.  They lawyer up  immediately.  They bring in the court system, and they said, \"Of course, we  are losing so much money.\"</p><p>And by the way, because it's immediate -- there's an immediate loss, you  can go in for temporary restraining order, with the court say, \"You  have(ph) to stop this immediately,\" and that's when the penalties step in.   And then, of course, you got the D.A.'s office, again, that's how it's  stopped with an answer.  Get the prosecutors involved, tell them that they  are doing this illegally, get prosecutors to start doing it and get one  with those cases and that's how will do it.</p><p>CORTES:  Right.  And that's a great legal point and I don't doubt that all  of the studios will be really effective but I will say on a business angle,  a technology angle, 3D printing to me is just transformative technology.   And I think long term because what people do in their home is going to be  very hard to enforce, right, to interdict, they are printing something in  their house.  And I think the 3D printing all of the stocks have been  miserably, and I'm not saying investing in necessarily right now.</p><p>COLWIN:  Right.</p><p>SMITH:  So you bring that up...</p><p>PETALLIDES:  Right.</p><p>SMITH:  That's an interesting point because everybody told us over the past  couple of years that 3D printing was the wave of the future...</p><p>COLWIN:  Right.</p><p>SMITH:  ... everyone is going to be doing it, everyone is going to have  these in their homes and they're going to be printing everything from...</p><p>PETALLIDES:  I don't know.  I don't know.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>COLWIN:  I don't know.</p><p>SMITH:  Now, literally, I mean, I remember on Varney's show we had 3D  printers coming in and making shoes...</p><p>CORTES:  Right.</p><p>COLWIN:  Yeah.</p><p>SMITH:  But I don't have one in my house.  Do you guys have a 3D printer in  your house?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  No.</p><p>CORTES:  Right.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Yeah.</p><p>SMITH:  It just the story never really came to fruition.</p><p>CORTES:  But we often get excited in a market.  We often get excited about  technology before it's a reality.  If for instance, we talked really about  the tech bubble.  The tech bubble in the year 2000, we got far too  excited...</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Right.</p><p>CORTES:  ... too early about the internet.  But that doesn't mean that the  internet didn't become transformative...</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  That's true.  That's true.</p><p>CORTES:  ... and there are companies that made it like Google became  absolute guerrillas.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PETALLIDES:  In 3D, one last thing, I will tell you one last thing.  Some  of the movie studios are actually embracing those 3D printing enthusiasts  and sending them codes so they can actually make something.  And so hope --  maybe that -- maybe the other way to go with it instead of trying to  prosecute and figure out who conceptualize this, who printed it, who, you  know, wrote the code.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Right.</p><p>PETALLIDES:  Maybe it's the other way around in trying actually to get it  out there yourself and sell those code files and make some money.  Yeah.</p><p>SMITH:  I should say that to be sure here is that at a commercial level,  the 3D printers are being used...</p><p>CORTES:  Right.</p><p>SMITH:  ... much more than I think that what we're seeing at the consumer  level...</p><p>CORTES:  Right.</p><p>SMITH:  ... for now at least.</p><p>All right, Nicole, thank you.</p><p>PETALLIDES:  All right.</p><p>SMITH:  All right, don't forget to start your day with Nicole, Lauren  Simonetti, and me on FBN:AM, every morning at 5:00 a.m.  Catch us right  here on the Fox Business Network.  We're here bright and early get you  ready for your day.</p><p>Meanwhile, coming up, startling new numbers about the class of 2015 and the  major issue that could follow them for the rest of their lives.  We have  the details next.  And continue this conversation on Facebook.  Go to our  page facebook.com/mornings/maria and tell us what you think of what you  want to see.  Do you disagree with Steve?

By 2017, listen to this,  the retailer will overtake Macy's Department Store, the top retailer in the  U.S.  That's according to our report released by Cowen and Company  yesterday.  Amazon is offering brands like Gucci, Kate Spade and Levis but  doesn't have to pay overhead costs for retail stores.</p><p>All right, Cowen's upgraded Amazon to outperform and forecast the company's  growth merchandize value in apparel and accessories to grow to over $27  billion in 2017 that would top Macy's.</p><p>Steve, we had another great report on Amazon's potential.  Are you in  agreement here?  Is the environment's still good for Amazon?</p><p>CORTES:  Well, yes and no.  I'm in agreement, yes, because I think Amazon  is an incredible company and I think they have created barriers to entry  because of how much they have spent on technology, on infrastructure that  it's very, very difficult to become a competitor to Amazon.</p><p>Now, I wish the company cared more about making money.  That bothers me as  an investor.  But I will disagree with the thesis that it's going to become  such an apparel powerhouse.  Because I think, apparel is the one spot where  online commerce is pretty challenged.  I would tell you personally, I  certainly don't want to buy at least expensive clothes, you know, to buy  sort of the commodity, apparel item is fine.  But to buy expensive clothes  online, if you can't feel it, touched or tried on, I think there going to  be challenge there.  I love the company but I don't think this is the  reasons to love this.</p><p>SMITH:  You clearly are not shopping online then, because...</p><p>COLWIN:  Yes</p><p>SMITH:  ... everybody is buying clothes online now.</p><p>COLWIN:  Exactly.</p><p>SMITH:  I mean, people don't want to go into the stores.  They don't want  to try clothes on.  And when Amazon or Zappos and all these, you know,  delivery sites, when they make it so easy to return...</p><p>COLWIN:  That's it.</p><p>SMITH:  ... that's really key.</p><p>COLWIN:  That's a key to it.  It's just the return policy.  If you give me  a box where I can ship it back or give me a label I can ship it back,  great, I'm going to purchase from you.  So gone are the days since you're  going to go in into those fitting rooms, into the stores where there's  crowds and there's all sorts of issues that when you actually step into  mall, they don't want that.  They don't want the hassle.  It's so much  easier to do it online.</p><p>SMITH:  Steve, your wife must do all the shopping?</p><p>COLWIN:  Yeah.</p><p>CORTES:  Yeah, that's true.  Right.</p><p>COLWIN:  People don't need the Brooks Brothers.</p><p>SMITH:  Oh men, Amazon's shares, by the way, of 57 percent this year alone.   So that climb continues.</p><p>New details emerging about the dark past of the Tennessee gunman who killed  five American servicemen.  Cheryl Casone is here with the latest headlines  on that story for us this morning, Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, NEWS ANCHOR:  Hey, good morning Sandra.  You have a gunman  behind that Chattanooga terror attack reportedly wrote about becoming a  martyr.  Reports said that Mohammad Abdulazeez also wrote about committing  suicide after he lost a job two years ago because of drug abuse.  The 24- year-old opened fire at two military facilities on Thursday killing four  marines and a sailor before he was killed by police.</p><p>A massive corporate scandal in Japan, Toshiba's CEO has resigned after  investigators linked him to an accounting scandal.  The probe (ph) found  the electronics giant overstated profits by more than $1.2 billion over  seven years.</p><p>And finally, new outrage over the staggering amount of student loan debt in  America.  The New York feds says American students are in debt to the tune  of $1.2 trillion.  That equals $35,000 for every student who graduated this  year of to $2,000 from last year.</p><p>OK, Sandra, we know the Class 2015 are going to be the most indebted class  at American history.  And it's not just them that are getting kind of the  screws frankly, it's their parents because these kids are getting out of  school, they're so saddled with debt, they're not making any money, the  wages are down and they can't move out of the house.  And then that parent  is now dealing with trying to get the kid out of the house and their  elderly parents are coming in.  It's a crisis.</p><p>SMITH:  And it's affecting, Cheryl, every aspects of the economy, Steve.  I  mean, if they're coming out of a school with this much debt, then they're  not buying homes...</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Right.</p><p>SMITH:  ... they're choosing to get...</p><p>CORTES:  Right.</p><p>SMITH:  ... married much later, they're not buying cars.  That whole  economic cycle that has been over the past many decades is no longer...</p><p>CORTES:  Right.  This is -- listen, this is the sad unintended consequences  of government policy, right?  This is central planning, I think, at its  absolute worst.  When the government gets involved in any business or  service, prices go up and the quality of that service goes down.  That is  certainly happened in terms of college.</p><p>So the price has skyrocketed, people borrow more and more but the degree  they earn is generally worth less and less.  So this is really a problem.   I mean, this is -- when I graduated college, I did not have any money, I  had to go live at home for a couple of months, I could not wait to get...</p><p>SMITH:  Right.</p><p>CORTES:  I was sleeping in the bunk bed that I grew up in as a 22-year-old  male.</p><p>CASONE:  So, I guess, your stand is we should not forgive student loan debt  in anyway.  She had (ph) perform...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SMITH:  I mean, Mercedes, that's what they're talking about, is the  government talks about just wiping out the student loan debt.</p><p>COLWIN:  Right.</p><p>SMITH:  Are they probably making the situation even worst than worst?</p><p>COLWIN:  Oh, undoubtedly, because who's going to pay the -- ultimately, all  of us is taxpayers.  I mean, what are you doing?  It's such a...</p><p>CORTES:  And the point is...</p><p>COLWIN:  And it is a tragedy to these kids.  You're talking about $60,000 a  year tuition.  You're talking about the highest...</p><p>SMITH:  Yeah.</p><p>COLWIN:  ... number of individuals that are unemployed.  These kids coming  out of graduates out of schools are 40 to 50 percent unemployed.  You don't  hear about that but this is the truth.  They can't get job.</p><p>SMITH:  All right.  Well, thank you for that enlightening story this  morning, Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE:  Of course.</p><p>SMITH:  Thank you for brightening our 6:00 a.m. hour.</p><p>CASONE:  Yeah.</p><p>SMITH:  A new pullout, morning diet programs like Weight Watchers and Jenny  Craig won't work for the majority of their obese clients trying to reach  normal weight.  We've got the details, the latest study on that next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>SMITH:  A new study published in the American Journal of Public Health  suggests that most obese Americans who do not get some kind of surgery will  never -- (inaudible) for us for Dagen.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS:  This is a national health crisis and it's  also a financial crisis...</p><p>SMITH:  Yeah.</p><p>CDOWELL:  ... we should point out.  This is a study again and published  according to -- we're talking about the body mass index in American Journal  of Public Health, that the probability of obese people reaching normal  weight is less than 1 percent.  And here, the numbers 1 in 210 obese men  have a probability of reaching a normal weight, this is without any kind of  surgery, 1 in 124 obese women.</p><p>You get a morbid obesity which is an even larger body mass index.  Those  odds go down to 1 in 1,290 men and 1 in 677 women.  So it becomes nearly  impossible to get down to a normal weight once you become obese or morbidly  obese.  And you want to talk about the cost, more than 305 billion in  direct and indirect cost of obesities annually in terms of lost  productivity, the increased health care cost.</p><p>And people complain about the government cracking down trying to change  what we eat and how we eat, calorie contents on menus, and the like, but  there is going to be a whole lot more of that.  You have more government in  your health care and then you have a population that is increasingly  overweight and will probably stay that way.  You will have a government  that essentially tells you what to eat.</p><p>SMITH:  I mean, it's crazy...</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Because if the government is funding your health care and your  health care costs are related to obesity, it becomes the government's  problem.  We are asking for it as a country unless we get the...</p><p>CORTES:  They -- yeah.  We...</p><p>COLWIN:  It is a bigger issue too because all these individuals that are  morbidly obese actually have protections under discrimination law.  So  you're binding employers even greater saying, \"Oh no, you can't fire an  individual plan (ph) that's been out and extend the period of time.\"  You  can't accommodate that individual.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  On disability too, where...</p><p>COLWIN:  Exactly right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  . excessively overweight.</p><p>CORTES:  Do you think that as being the government intervention that we're  going to see syntaxes, the kinds of things we now see on alcohol and  tobacco?  Is that coming to butter and sugar or are we going to see that in  the future?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, certainly, the -- some types of crackdowns, it's hard to  do that though, but I think that with Mayor Bloomberg here trying to limit  the size of soda (ph) you can buy, that was shut down, that didn't happen.   But, as the government funds more of your health care, and I'm talking  specifically about Medicare but you have...</p><p>SMITH:  Come on.  Do you think the impacts have really changed behavior?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CORTES:  ... won't do it but the...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  ... on cigarettes.  So, cigarettes have -- are so expensive in  so many areas that it reduces the amount that people do smoke if not the  number of smokers.</p><p>SMITH:  Well, that has gotten enough.  So, I mean, I haven't looked into  lately but a pack of cigarettes in Manhattan...</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's about 10 bucks.</p><p>COLWIN:  $10.</p><p>SMITH:  Oh, I think it's probably even more than that.</p><p>COLWIN:  Yes.</p><p>(Inaudible)</p><p>SMITH:  Anyway -- all right.  Well, thank you Dagen for bringing...</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you.</p><p>SMITH:  ... at least (ph) on that study.</p><p>All right.  We'll see you in a little bit.  And thank you to Steve Cortes  and Mercedes for joining us for the 6:00 a.m. hour full of energy.</p><p>COLWIN:  Thank you.</p><p>SMITH:  So really, good morning.  Great to have you guys.</p><p>COLWIN:  Thanks for having us.</p><p>SMITH:  And we are going to have next hour on Mornings.  We're going to be  breaking down Donald Trump's latest poll numbers, and comments with Former  New York Governor George Pataki.

I'm Sandra Smith in for Maria Bartiromo, this  morning. It is Tuesday, July 21st. With me for the hour, Mike Murphy from  Rosecliff Capital and our very own Dagen McDowell.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Here are your top stories at 8:00 a.m. on the East Coast, gold again  trading near its lowest level in five years as more investors prepare for  the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates.</p><p>Futures showing the markets in addition to gold being down, Dow and S&amp;P  Futures also down, Dow Futures off 30 points, Nasdaq Futures are higher,  pointing to another record trade for the Nasdaq today.</p><p>Soaring temperatures across the nation.  Again, the National Oceanic and  Atmospheric Administration saying records were broken for the month of June  and that 2015 is lining up to be the hottest year on record.</p><p>Ohio Governor John Kasich will add his name to the very crowded field of  candidates running for the White House on the Republican side.</p><p>Kasich has plenty of experience in Washington, serving in the house of  Representatives from 1983 to 2001, Donald Trump topping the latest \"Abc- Washington Post\" poll, taking in 24 percent of the support in the  Republican field.</p><p>But that poll came down before Trump's comments about Senator John McCain,  when he said McCain was not a war hero.

But according  to a new \"Washington Post-Abc News\" poll, he still holds 24 percent of  Republican support. </p><p>The largest lead recorded by any GOP candidate this year, although this  number is strong, it must be noted that the poll was finalized before  coverage of his comments about Senator McCain went widespread.</p><p>But the headlines don't stop there, \"The Des Moines Register\", Iowa's  largest newspaper is now calling on Trump to drop out of the 2016 race,  saying \"Trump should pull the plug on his bloviating sideshow.\"  </p><p>Mike, some pretty strong words from the key primary state newspaper -- </p><p>MIKE MURPHY, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, ROSECLIFF CAPITAL:  Absolutely -- </p><p>SMITH:  This morning -- </p><p>MURPHY:  Yes, and you know, we talked about a month ago, saying that I  didn't believe that Trump would really be a true  contender in this race.</p><p>But now fast forward roughly 30 days, he is leading by far in the polls,  and I think the longer he stays there -- he released his financials.</p><p>And one thing about him, he is way better than anyone else in the race in  getting publicity and getting himself on Bill O'Reilly's show and getting a  big following on Twitter.</p><p>So, I think the longer Trump stays in this race, the worse it is for the  Governor Walkers and the Governor Bushs in the race.  </p><p>SMITH:  But I mean, all the other Republican candidates are having to  answer, Dagen, as we just -- we did it to Governor Pataki, you know,  they're having to respond to all the things that Donald Trump is saying  right now including his criticism of Senator McCain.  </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS:  Right, the new \"New Yorker\" cover portrays  him as -- this is even before him attacking John McCain as doing a giant  belly-flop in the swimming pool and all other Republican candidates have  been as you've been sent to the sides of the poll.   </p><p>But he's gotten down the nasty name-calling that's completely unnecessary.   And if you think that, that's not -- it will be shocking and breath-taking  if that does not hurt him in the polls.</p><p>And now -- but now, he's given -- he is given -- maybe the GOP contenders  are worried about him, but now he's given them a reason to turn on him.</p><p>And he's got to cut -- but he's got to get down to the issues and cut back  on -- I mean, he's going after John McCain and all prisoners of war and  then refuses to apologize.</p><p>I mean people are at the point of getting sick of him, I mean, you look at  what did \"The Des Moines Register\" called him? A feckless blowhard, a  distraction with traction.</p><p>And he has problems in terms of their Christian base as well, when he talks  about his faith, it doesn't resonate with some GOP primary voters. </p><p>MURPHY:  Agreed, but I mean, who would have thought that he would be in  this position today.  You know, he's really in a position to disrupt and if  he is pushed aside by the Republican Party -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  He will run as a third party candidate -- </p><p>SMITH:  Yes, but -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>Still Donald Trump has taken -- and then I go back to -- these have to be  calculated statements.  He has been planning on running for president for  quite some time, he is pouring money into this machine, OK?</p><p>Donald Trump does not plan from the -- so, you, when you look at the  comments he makes about John McCain, those words don't leave your mouth  without knowing the repercussion -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  So, he -- </p><p>SMITH:  OK? -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Always make it a joke probably, like I like people who weren't  captured, he thinks he's funny.  And -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>SMITH:  And you know what they did draw -- if it was truly a mistake, you  don't think he's willing --  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  No -- </p><p>SMITH:  To look back and say -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Absolutely not -- </p><p>SMITH:  Across -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  He --</p><p>SMITH:  Poorly -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Does not -- he does -- well, he's doing it in his own way --   </p><p>SMITH:  Because he's turned it -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Because he -- </p><p>SMITH:  Into a fight for the veterans and for the VA and the -- </p><p>MURPHY:  Right -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The \"Ap\" did a fact check on that by the way, and a lot of what  he was saying and accusing McCain of doing -- saying not -- he hasn't been  an advocate for veterans is absolutely untrue.  </p><p>In terms of trying to reform the VA, Senator John McCain was -- worked  tirelessly to try and turn the VA around, given the horrible state of  healthcare for our veterans --  </p><p>SMITH:  But Donald Trump is -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>Turning this into a message that he can do more and saying, \"that he's done  nothing to help the vets, referring to Senator McCain, he said I will tell  you they are living in hell.</p><p>He says he's going to do more for veterans --   </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But he didn't serve! -- </p><p>SMITH:  And everybody else -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  He got military deferments, he didn't serve in Vietnam and then  attacks prisoners of war. </p><p>SMITH:  I'm just -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Attacking John McCain --  </p><p>SMITH:  Saying there got to be a calculated purpose for these kind of  statements, I don't think that they're just --  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Or -- </p><p>SMITH:  Flew out of his mouth -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Or he didn't -- </p><p>SMITH:  He got -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Have control over his own mouth? </p><p>MURPHY:  I think it's more of that, I think his calculations are to just  mix there up as much controversy as possible, and then if you saw last  night with Bill O'Reilly, if he had just simply -- we've all made mistakes.</p><p>Simply apologize, I made a mistake and moved on -- </p><p>SMITH:  Yes -- </p><p>MURPHY:  It would have been much better for him.   </p><p>SMITH:  Right, and he said if there was a mistake, he would admit to it,  but he didn't do that last night.    </p><p>MCDOWELL:  What mistake has he admitted to? </p><p>SMITH:  Yes -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  What mistake?  </p><p>SMITH:  No, not really any.  All right, ISIS on the rise across the Turkish  region, a suicide bombing of the border -- on the border, I should say, of  Syria, claiming the lives of 31 people yesterday.</p><p>Joining us now is Gillian Turner, Fox News contributor and former White  House National Security Council member.  Gillian, good  morning -- </p><p>GILLIAN TURNER, FORMER MEMBER, WHITE HOUSE NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL:  Good  morning -- </p><p>SMITH:  Thank you for being here this morning.  What do you make of the  latest on this attack in Turkey?</p><p>TURNER:  Well, in order to understand the significance of this attack, you  really have to understand the strategic symbolism that the  town of Kobani  has in the broader fight against ISIS.</p><p>This attack was against a rally to rebuild the town of Kobani which was  really decimated over four-month long period of the battle  between Syrian  Kurds and ISIS fighters last year.</p><p>For a long time, this town was the last stronghold of the U.S.-led  coalition on the border region between Turkey and Syria.  So, it's a lot of  symbolism here.</p><p>SMITH:  And we were talking to K.T. McFarland last hour, sort of references  it as a game changer now that we've had this happen in Turkey.  </p><p>TURNER:  Absolutely, that's exactly right.  The border region between the  two countries eight months ago was entirely controlled by ISIS.</p><p>It's now -- its presence there has been gradually reduced in the last eight  months, which is one of the only good news stories to come out of the U.S.  fight against ISIS, because as we know, they're really on the rise in the  region.  </p><p>SMITH:  And as far as the fight with ISIS continues, it's -- you don't have  to look far to see a headline that ISIS continues to gain  strength and  power and money.</p><p>Where do you see the overall fight right now as far as combating ISIS as  they do continue to gain power and quite frankly continue to gain  territory?  </p><p>TURNER:  Well, they're on the rise across Iraq and Syria in spite of some  now five thousand airstrikes led by the United States against them.</p><p>They can currently control a majority of Syria as well as large sways of  Iraq, including Mosul which they've now held for over a year.</p><p>As you mentioned, they've got hundreds of millions of dollars in the bank,  tens of thousands of recruits and you know, just a couple of weeks ago,  celebrated their one-year anniversary.  </p><p>MURPHY:  So, Gillian, in that one year, you know, they've gone from really  something in after-thought, something that no one really knew about to  really taking all the headlines away from al Qaeda.</p><p>And they're really the main terrorist organization out there right now.  It  seems like you talk about five thousand airstrikes, but it's just not  enough. </p><p>What we're doing -- if it's not stopping them, it's not slowing them down,  it's not hurting them.</p><p>And the longer they exist, the more powerful they get just as a fact.  So,  what do we do? How do -- is it just putting more troops on the ground, is  that the simple answer? How do we stop them?  </p><p>TURNER:  There isn't a simply answer as much as we would all like there to  be one, I don't think it's as easier as saying boots on the ground, no  boots on the ground, diplomacy, no diplomacy.</p><p>What we really have to fight here in addition to the security situation is  the powerful hold that radical Islamic ideology has really had across the  region.</p><p>It's now expanding across the globe, ISIS recruits are increasing in  multiples at this point, you know, when they started a year ago, not very  many.</p><p>Now we have reports of up to thirty thousand actively fighting recruits,  plus up to a hundred thousand more in the kind of close-hold  pool.</p><p>So, this is an organization that's really increasing exponentially, so the  sooner we come up with a really good plan, the better.</p><p>SMITH:  All right, Gillian Turner on the latest deadly attack in Turkey,  thank you.</p><p>TURNER:  Thanks.  </p><p>SMITH:  All right, coming up, gold prices continue to fall after plunging  to their lowest level in five years on rate-hike fears.  </p><p>And take a look at some of the other big headlines that we're watching for  you on the \"Wall Street Journal\" this morning.</p><p>Fed tells big banks to shrink, Toshiba CEO fouled by accounting scandal,  Chattanooga shooting and the highlight online gun sales.  </p><p>And we're also watching for you this morning, a lot of other breaking news  and headlines, keep it right there on Fox Business. </p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>SMITH:  All right, gold prices edging lower this morning after plunging to  their lowest level in five years on rate hike fears.  Phil Flynn is  watching this selloff and following every move of the CME Group in Chicago.</p><p>Phil, it looks like it's holding a $1,100 an ounce right now, but broadly - - </p><p>PHIL FLYNN, CHICAGO MERCANTILE EXCHANGE GROUP:  Yes -- </p><p>SMITH:  Speaking, what is the selloff in gold or commodities in general,  what is it telling us?</p><p>FLYNN:  I think that's what the market is trying to decide right now.  You  know, we're starting to call at the midnight massacre of gold.</p><p>And we saw that huge $2.5 billion sell order come in the middle of the  night, driving down gold, raising bigger questions about the global  economy.</p><p>I think the sell-off in gold because it came along with a lot of the other  industrial metals with the oil, price of oil that they could be raising.</p><p>It could be like the canary in the coal mine raising larger concerns about  the global economy and economic growth.  And now the market is trying to  stabilize to see if those fears are justified or overplayed.  </p><p>FLYNN:  Yes, and when you look at the selloff happening and commodities  across the globe, you wonder what a big influence is U.S. dollar situation  is going to be.</p><p>We were just talking about real estate, Phil, I mean, you've got a stronger  U.S. dollar, all that foreign investment, where does it go?  </p><p>FLYNN:  Well, a lot of that is, of course, obviously has been coming to the  United States and we've seen that over the last couple of years.  </p><p>We've seen a lot of Chinese money, throwing money into the United States,  trying to get away from the Chinese stock market.</p><p>Obviously, as those interest rates start to go up and the stronger dollar  goes up, that could slow a little bit.  So obviously, that's a concern with  the marketplace right now.</p><p>But I think if you look at what we're seeing throughout a lot of the  commodity complex, you know actually, commodities last quarter were doing  pretty good.</p><p>I mean look at oil demand for example, you know, we saw oil demand in the  first half of the year rise by 1.6 million barrels.  That's like twice as  fast that we've seen over the last four years.</p><p>So, there are a lot of signs that the stimulus and other parts of the globe  was actually starting to stimulate demand for -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes -- </p><p>FLYNN:  Its commodities -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And -- </p><p>FLYNN:  But everything changed after Greece and China and after Sunday  night.  </p><p>SMITH:  And the bold calls, Mike, are already out there for gold did not  only sell off below a $1,000 an ounce, but saw 800, 600 bucks this morning.</p><p>I mean, where is it -- where is it going -- </p><p>MURPHY:  Yes -- </p><p>SMITH:  From here? </p><p>MURPHY:  A lot of people are piling on gold right now, but you talk about  support of 1,100, I think 1,000 is going to be the key level.</p><p>And if it will go down, I think in test 1,000 as it breaks through that, it  could go down to the 950, to the 900 level.  </p><p>But I think it's not just gold, it's the entire commodity space that's  getting hit because we're seeing a lot of the global fears of the Greece  and the China dissipating.</p><p>But the growth, the global growth isn't very strong, so a lot of -- </p><p>SMITH:  Yes -- </p><p>MURPHY:  People calling on less demand out there --  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Maybe if you don't bet on gold, if you're betting on growth, I  mean worry about down draft in copper or oil which has economic uses.  </p><p>MURPHY:  Great point.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But with gold, just remember if you're buying gold -- like  tradeable gold, you're betting against Goldman Sachs, you're not smarter  than Goldman Sachs, you're on the wrong side of a trade -- </p><p>MURPHY:  But I think -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  It is a zero-sum game.  </p><p>MURPHY:  I think people realize now that there's not too many -- why would  you buy gold? Right now what's -- </p><p>SMITH:  Right -- </p><p>MURPHY:  The point to go out -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And by the way -- </p><p>MURPHY:  And invest in gold? --    </p><p>MCDOWELL:  He did 2011, this down draft started in 2011 five years ago, it  just continues now. </p><p>SMITH:  Right, if you're a contrarian on the U.S. dollar, you might buy  gold.  </p><p>MURPHY:  You might -- </p><p>SMITH:  I'm just saying -- </p><p>MURPHY:  But I think there's a lot of other ways to play it rather than --   </p><p>MCDOWELL:  You're contrarian -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>On the U.S. dollar, you buy other currencies, you buy bonds, denominated in  other currencies, right?  </p><p>SMITH:  All right, so, Flynn, I'll let you answer that question, then we  have to go --  </p><p>FLYNN:  Yes, well, bottom line is, you know, if you started to buy gold in  1999 when we had this commodity crash, it returned better than the stock  market in nominal terms, up until a couple of years ago.</p><p>And yes, we've had a major correction in gold.  But I wouldn't throw, you  know, gold totally out of your investment portfolio.  You want to buy when  there's blood in the streets, there's blood in the streets in the gold  market. </p><p>Probably time to add some to your commodity portfolio.  </p><p>SMITH:  All right, so Flynn, thank you.  Coming up, well, conservative  anchor comments towards President Obama's efforts to fight terrorism going  viral.  We'll have the video next.   </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>SMITH:  Investigators are learning more about the Muslim man who killed  five American servicemen in Tennessee, Cheryl Casone is here with the  headlines there.  Cheryl.    </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS:  Hey, good morning, Sandra.  Well, the gunman  behind the Chattanooga terror attack reportedly wrote about becoming a  martyr.</p><p>Reports say that Muhammad Abdulazeez also wrote about committing suicide  after he lost a job two years ago because of drug abuse.</p><p>The 24-year-old opened fire at two military facilities on Thursday, killing  four Marines and a sailor before he was killed by police.  And one news  anchor's rant about President Obama's reaction to the tragedy has gone  viral. </p><p>Twenty two-year-old Tomi Lahren from \"One America News Network\" has become  an internet sensation, blasting what she called the President's half-baked  ISIS policy.  Take a listen.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TOMI LAHREN, ONE AMERICA NEWS NETWORK:  President Obama, if you won't say  it, I will.  Radical Islam, this is not workplace violence, this is not a  criminal act with motives unknown, this is terrorism? </p><p>I'm sorry but radical Islam is becoming the rule, not the exception.  Our  commander-in-chief is more concerned with Muslim sensitivity than the honor  and sacrifice made by these Marines.</p><p>Be a leader, someone.   </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE:  OK, let's be clear, she's 22 years old, guys, she's 22 years old,  she is from South Dakota, she's raised in a conservative family, a Marine  family we should be clear.</p><p>And as just was very fired up, she was very personal, she's now all over  the place including -- she was on \"FOX &amp; FRIENDS\" about an hour ago and she  sticks by everything that she said in those videos --  </p><p>SMITH:  But looks like a -- </p><p>CASONE:  She's very -- </p><p>SMITH:  Drop mic moment for Cheryl, I'm looking at the YouTube clip right  now, Dagen, Mike, 1.6 -- </p><p>MURPHY:  Yes -- </p><p>SMITH:  Million views and counting.  </p><p>MURPHY:  Rightfully so, I mean, she's -- </p><p>SMITH:  Striking a cord?  </p><p>MURPHY:  Yes, she is --</p><p>CASONE:  Yes -- </p><p>MURPHY:  She was spot-on, and you know, she doesn't look like the typical  person who would say that, she is young, she may be -- speaks to a  different -- sorry, I take that back.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  When you say -- </p><p>CASONE:  Yes -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  What? </p><p>MURPHY:  Big towards in a big -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And who will burn that saying -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MURPHY:  Speaks to a different generation possibly, but I think she was  spot-on with all of her points, so it does -- the more people who view this  clip, the better I think.  </p><p>CASONE:  She's got like 800,000 clips as of like midnight, I mean so by now  it's what? 8:25 Eastern, she's got more than that.  </p><p>So, and she -- you know the thing about her too is that, she's coming out  and saying, you know, she also could and defend, so that we talked about  yesterday where, you know, that these guard members should have protection.</p><p>They should be armed as well as talking about the issues with regards to  ISIS.  And that the president has -- as she -- well, she said it better  than I did.  Failed her and all of us.  </p><p>SMITH:  I should -- and you know -- and you can't speak that stuff, I mean,  she was actually very passionate, Dagen, you may disagree, I don't know,  but -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  No -- </p><p>SMITH:  She was very passionate about it and it came across and I think  that's why --  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  That would resonate with people -- </p><p>CASONE:  Yes -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  In general.  Whether you're talking about internet clips,  whether you're talking about television or any kind of video is -- if it's  comes from the heart and you mean it, and you speak your truth, and you're  authentic, then people connect with that.  </p><p>SMITH:  And Mike will be leaving now.  Yes, all right, thank you Cheryl  Casone --   </p><p>CASONE:  Thank you -- </p><p>SMITH:  All right, Chicago now home to the nation's highest sales tax, so  we'll tell you how much it costs to shop in the Windy City and what the  locals have to say about that, I may chime in my hometown, that's coming up  next. </p><p>CASONE:  No!</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>SMITH:  All right, don't let us catch you calling Chicago the second city  anymore especially when it comes to sales taxes.  And their all new you  make it, they take it report.</p><p>Jeff Flock is in the Windy City asking shoppers what they think about the  city's new number one ranking.  Jeff, I always tell New Yorkers they got it  wrong when it comes to Chicago.  </p><p>It's the second city because it burned down the first time in the great  Chicago fire and they had to rebuild it.  New Yorkers always think that  it's second to New York, false. </p><p>JEFF FLOCK, FOX BUSINESS:  I agree with you a 100 percent, this is the  rejuvenation of Chicago.  But as it's getting expensive to live here, maybe  you're lucky here in New York at this point.  </p><p>You know where I am, don't you? Looks familiar, if it does, Oak Street in  Chicago.  Take a look at the numbers now, the Cook County board having  passed an additional percentage of tax, sales tax, give Chicago the number  one or at least it will on January 1st to 2016. </p><p>Ten-point-two-five percent sales tax, worse than New York or maybe we  should say, higher than New York, better than New York, better than L.A.,  better than Milwaukee. </p><p>It's not the city itself that passed the increase, it was Cook County.  If  you take a look at the break down, there's a state sales tax, then there is  the county sales tax which went up an additional percent and then of course  the city itself has 2.25 percent sales tax as well.  </p><p>What does this mean for this city? Well, it means that actually some more  money is going to go into the pension coffers. That's the reason the county  passed the sales tax increase.  They're trying to get their credit rating  improved.  But I'll tell you, if you take a look at the credit ratings of  cities around the country, it is Chicago Detroit that are still in junk  status.  Other places like Seattle, Dallas, Denver, those guys are doing  fine, but not so much here Sandra. </p><p>SMITH: Unbelievable.  Well, that's what happens when you're cities  bankrupt, okay? Yes, Raise taxes.  Jeff Fox, thank you.  </p><p>FOX: Hard to believe.</p><p>SMITH: Alright. </p><p>FOX: Thanks Sandra.</p><p>SMITH: Dagen, this could have been a big impact on buyer behavior, but as  we're seeing actually Chicago housing sales are doing quite well at the  moment.  A pocket of strength from the country.</p><p>MCDOWELL: These taxes are regressive.  Your higher sales tax, you have the  cell phone tax went up not long ago.  Higher property taxes. They hit the  poor even harder than they do because it eats up more of a greater  percentage of their income and what they take home.  It's really shocking  that the city's not in better financial shape. The fact they they've put in  place all these revenue raisers.  But - leave it to Robert Manual. I mean  he got reelected didn't he?</p><p>SMITH: Not the situation.  When you look at the sales tax go to these lofty  numbers I also worry about restaurant chains or just restaurants in general  in the city.  I mean, you're talking about asking tourists to come into the  city and they're paying substantially more than they had expected over were  a year ago.  </p><p>MIKE MURPHY, ROSECLIFF FINANCIAL: Absolutely.  So you know, I understand  why this tax hike went through, but to say that there's strength in the  real estate market today is one thing.  But what's going to happen after  this is out there for six months or 12 months.  Are you going to see  restaurant chains, stores leaving. Are you going to see the values of homes  decreasing. So, I think it's kind of a risky bet they're taking.  I agree  they had to do something because you can't run a city bankrupt or no money  -</p><p>SMITH: That's the business. </p><p>MURPHY: I think it is.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And by the way, the second city in the minds of New York is Los  Angeles. </p><p>SMITH: Whatever.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And then San Fran and then Boston. </p><p>SMITH: Whatever.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Chicago's is like fifth, maybe six behind Atlanta.</p><p>SMITH: As a New Yorker you probably really didn't even understand -</p><p>MCDOWELL: I am not a New Yorker!</p><p>SMITH:  -- what second city meant.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I only say New Yorker after when, you know, you have to walk  through like garbage and the small of like a dumpster behind a fishmonger  on the way. I only consider myself a New Yorker when I have to brave  through that. </p><p>SMITH: Alright. Somewhere in -- She's from somewhere in Virginia.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>MCDOWELL: (INAUDIBLE) Sandra was about the insult the entire South. She was  this close.  (INAUDIBLE) Alright. Ohio Governor John Kasich set to jump  into the 2016 White House race. Bake Burman has the latest from Washington.  Help Blake? </p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FOX BUSINESS:  Here I am for you Sandra.  John Kasich will  make it 16 later today.  The current Governor of Ohio and Former  Congressman will launch his second White House run with about one to two  percent of support from Republicans.  Everyone in the GOP field is  currently staring up at Donald Trump.  A new \"Washington Post\" poll shows  24 percent of Republicans currently favored Trump. That is double his  nearest opponents and his highest mark yet.  However, much of that poll was  taken before his widely panned comments about John McCain.  </p><p>In Iowa, home to the first caucus, the main newspaper, \"The Des Moines  Register\", speaking about comments Sandra. Take a listen to this.  They  published a blistering op-ed of Trump this morning.  Here's what they  wrote, quote \"If he were merely a self absorbed B-list celebrity, his  unchecked ego could be tolerated as some source of mild amusement\".  That  op-ed went on to say as you might image that Trump is unqualified to be  President.  Sandra?  </p><p>SMITH: Wow. Alright, Blake, thank you.  I guess there's enough to talk  about there, but he is jumping to into a very contentious GOP race.  I  mean, we heard from Governor Pataki earlier.  He's all fired up.  Donald  Trump's so fired up, he's saying things maybe he shouldn't. I mean, there  is an intense heated battle going on right now. </p><p>MURPHY: There is an 16 candidates we all know is too much. But it's funny  how the start of that report was about Kasich joining the race, but it  ended with Trump.  You know, it seems like right now everything's coming  back to Trump.  He's gotten all the press that surrounded - a lot of the  press that's surrounded  it.  I think when we get to the first debate in  August, we're going to be done 10 candidates at that point. And from 10, we  need to get down to the top four or five. Right now, there's too many  people out there. We need to weed through that and find the most qualified  people who can actually win the election.  </p><p>SMITH: An I'm still trying to find somebody who will talk about the  economy.  You know, Governor Pataki had a lot of great things to say,  however, Dagen, you noticed when I started asking about the economy, it  went to national security, which is one of his strengths and what he wants  to focus on.  I just have not heard even on the left, Hillary Clinton,  she's trying really hard to talk about the economy right now.  But that's  No. 1, what's polling with the American voter. They want to know who's  going to fix the economy.  </p><p>MCDOWELL: The big broad stripes - and that will work initially.  It's not  going pay for any of these GOP candidates to get into the nitty-gritty of  how they would fix the economy at least in the short run. They're going to  paint, use broad stokes and - I mean, that's what's worked for Trump quite  frankly. </p><p>SMITH: By the way, you know, Joe Biden hasn't entered the race yet and  there's a lot of talk about will he or won't.  I should've asked Michael  Berlin. I'm sure he had an opinion on that. But - </p><p>MCDOWELL: It's after the first debate. That'll be critical where you get,  the first debate, the first tier, it  He gets it down a ten.  Governor  Pataki will not be in that first tier the way the polls numbers look like  right now and maybe not Kasich either.</p><p>SMITH: Alright. So exciting.  From presidential season to earnings season  in full swing, we'll hear from Apple after the bell today.  We'll have a  preview of that and \"Breaking Bad's\" Stephen Michael Quezada announcing  plans to run for public office in New Mexico.  He's going to be  joining us  next.  Keep it right here on the Fox Business Network.  </p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING: \" GET IN MY WAY\" - ROBIN THICKE)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>SMITH: News alert for you.  Capitol flags will fly at half staff to  remember the victims of the Chattanooga shooting.  Cheryl Casone has the  details on that.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS: Hi, good morning Sandra.  Well, yes. House  Speaker John Boehner has just ordered that flags on Capitol Hill fly at  half staff in honor of the four marines and one sailor killed in a  Tennessee terror attack.  The gunman Mohammed Abdulazeez opened fire at two  military facilities on Thursday before he was killed by police.  We were  just looking at that tweet coming out from Speaker Boehner's office,  Speaker Boehner's Twitter account, saying, of course, that  we're going to  be honoring those victims.  </p><p>Killed by police in other headlines. New York City - excuse me. In other  headlines this morning, New York City doctors are evaluating a patient who  was rushed to hospital last night with some symptoms of Ebola. We're just  getting this story in as well folks.  The city's Health Department says the  patient recently returned from Guinea and had no known exposure to the  deadly disease.  We're going to bring you, of course, the latest on that  story as it develops.  We're following that. </p><p>And then finally, we've talked about this earlier, appliance makers say  that President Obama's new dishwasher rules are going to take us back to  the days of handwashing.  This is serious news. The White House wants to  cut the amount of water that dishwashers use, but the Association of Home  Appliance Manufacturers says that won't get your dishes clean enough  Sandra.  And also, the Association saying that they did tests and  photographs, which they sent to the Department of Energy with food on the  dishes they sent to the Department of Energy with food on the dishes.  So,  it's a big story. I'll continue to follow it for you. </p><p>SMITH: Thank you very much Cheryl. Alright. Well, immigration reform  becoming a key topic of debate for the 2016 presidential race and my next  guest played a  New Mexico law enforcement officer in the hit series,  \"Breaking Bad\". Now he wants to make a difference in real life by running  for public office in Albuquerque.  Joining me now in a first on Fox  Business interview with actor Stephen Michael Quezada.  Steven, welcome.  Good morning to you.  </p><p>STEPHEN MICHAEL QUEZADA, ACTOR:  Good morning.  How are you?  </p><p>SMITH: Alright. What is driving you to run for public office?</p><p>QUEZADA: Well, I already have -- I sit on the Albuquerque school board.   I've been involved in my community way before I was any kind of actor or  any kind of comedian.  I've always worked with kids, did gang intervention  programs.  So, this is something I've always been involved in.  This isn't  new for me. And so this is a gradual step for me to be able to help the  people in the community that I love. I love this community. I'm a New  Mexican. We're really proud of our culture and we're really proud of who we  are and one of the main reasons why I'm running for office is because I'm  an American and I can.  </p><p>SMITH: Stephen, immigration has been a hot topic mostly of late because of  Donald Trump's comment that have been interpreted many different ways, but  specifically, his comment on immigration.  How, what was your response to  that?  </p><p>QUEZADA: You know, immigration is a big topic for sure in the areas where  we live. Those are our - that's our workforce. I mean, nobody eats without  them working in America.  Nobody - you know, they do the jobs that most  Americans won't do.  I know Donald Trump wants to build a wall and I'm  asking who's going to build the wall for $8 an hour?  It's going to be the  workforce that he wants out.  </p><p>So, we need to figure out immigration reform.  Are we against criminals?   Of course, we are. But to say that all Mexican people are drug dealers and  rapist was something that should've never been said.  I was just performing  in front of 800 people and when I got into the elevator, I had man with his  7-year old son  told me to go back to Mexico because I was a rapist and a  drug dealer. And then, when I walked out of the elevator he spit at me. I  mean, is this what we're try to promote as Americans because, you know, my  family goes back here 300 years.  My father fought in World War II, Korea  and Vietnam.  And for me to have to travel the country and deal with stuff  like that, I think it's unfair and it's something that wasn't thought out.   When you make a comment like that - because some of us Americans have to  live with that.  </p><p>MURPHY: Hey Stephen, when you're in your campaign against the other two  candidates, how much does your acting background or really your celebrity -  I would like that put you at a huge advantage.  Is that how the race is  shaping up right now?  </p><p>QUEZADA: Well, you know, a lot of people use money as a huge advantage.  I  don't have that luxury.  I'm just a regular old actor and comedian.  But,  locally I think most people know me here as a community member, as  somebody, you know, as somebody who raises money for children, who does  programs through youth  development incorporated, who's been involved in  education. So, the rest of the country knows me as \"Breaking Bad\" actor  Steve Gomez.  But, here in New Mexico, they know me as Stephen Michael  Quezada, the community member.  </p><p>MCDOWELL: Stephen, it's Dagen McDowell. I work here at Fox Business. County  Commissioner now, do you - is that where you see your career?  Are you  going to be an actor 20 years for now or do you want to be a politician?</p><p>QUEZADA: I'm going to do both.  I don't understand why anybody who runs for  office can't do - you know, you never see anybody quit their job to run for  office if they're a lawyer or if they own - if they're wealthy and they own  a construction company or any kind of business.  You know, nobody quits  their job or -- </p><p>MCDOWELL: Well, Schwarzenegger did. I mean, Schwarzenegger did. There a  number of actors that when they were serving their terms in office, they  weren't doing film work or television work. </p><p>QUEZADA: Well, I do the work because I have three children.  I have two  daughters  in college.  I'm not wealthy.  Arnold Schwarzenegger and those  other actors are very wealthy. You're not talking to Brian Cranson here,  you're talking to a guy who played a - you know?</p><p>SMITH: So, Steve, we don't have much time left.  Who do you like right now  as the presidential race heats up?  There are lot of talk about the GOP  field. Who do you like on the left?  </p><p>QUEZADA: Well, I'm going to tell you, I'm waiting to see who the most  Democratic person is going to step up.  I don't believe what I read or  believe what I read all the time.  I want somebody to be honest, so I'm  looking at the person who's going to be the most honest and the person that  I think is really going to look at the economic position of this country  and who's going to look at immigration.  </p><p>SMITH: Do you like Hillary Clinton?  </p><p>QUEZADA: I like a couple of them.  Hillary is definitely one of my top  runners.  </p><p>SMITH: Alright. Stephen Michael Quezada, thank you for joining us this  morning and sharing your thoughts and your run at office.  Good luck to  you.  </p><p>QUEZADA: Thank you. Thanks, I appreciate it.  </p><p>SMITH: Alright. Tesla shares set to be a major mover in today's trade.  Why  the stock is selling off straight ahead.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>SMITH: Welcome back.  We're about 40 minutes away from the opening bell.   Let's get to Nicole Petallides at the New York Stock Exchange.  It's  already lunch time for you Nicole. An hour and a half to - sorry, less than  an hour to the opening bell.  </p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX BUSINESS: Good morning, Sandra.  That's right. So,  let's take a look at what we're watching. First of all, gold continues to  be a story, right?  Five-year lows, but we're keeping a keen eye on a big  mover today.  And that's Tesla. Tesla this morning is looking down about  more than $10 this morning.  And that is on a UBS downgrade. It turns out  for the third time recently, they're cutting Telsa again. For the third  time this month to a sell rating in this case and that is because they  actually believe that the energy business, the energy storage business is  unlikely to live up to the expectations.  In fact, they also have power  wall where they said some of the order that they're seeing are just  solicitations.  People don't actually have to put money down.  And so with  that, cutting into a sell (INAUDIBLE) on the stock is looking nowhere.   Back to you.  </p><p>SMITH: Alright. Nicole, thank you.  And don't forget to start your day off  with Nicole, Lauren and me on \"FBN:AM\" every morning at 5:00 a.m. right  here on the Fox Business Network.  We get you ready for your day.  </p><p>MCDOWELL: Get down.  </p><p>SMITH: Alright! Here we go. Is it Friday? One stock to watch today. Apple  reporting third-quarter earnings after the closing bell. Wall Street  expecting the tech giant to report $29.9 billion dollars in Iphone sales  versus $19.8 billion dollars last year.  Analyst expect strong sales to be  bowied by  bigger-than-expected demand in China and this quarter represents  the first for Apple watch sales.  Apple's been tightlipped on watch sells  specifically and many on Wall Street are keeping expectations muted.  I  don't know. As my read on that should be nobody really knows how well the  watch is doing for Apple. Like so far, Tim Cook hasn't really released any  details specifically about it. </p><p>MURPY: He hasn't got a lot of press, but remember, in the last three months  since Apple last reported. The stocks essentially flat.  It was around 132,  it's still around 132. So, I think going into this quarter, the bars set  pretty high for them as far as Iphone sales go.  But, if you look at the  sales projection or what they did this past quarter, sales for the Iphones  were great. The Iphone 6, iphone 6 Plus. China, U.S., I think the risk to  Apple right now is to the upside. I think it breaks above recent highs on a  very strong number today. </p><p>SMITH: Really? So we at $132 a share. You think it's going to continue to  run higher?  </p><p>MURPHY: Well, And I'd say, don't focus on the price of $132 because that's  essentially flat in the last three months as the NASDAQ has gone up to all- time highs.  But, really focus on is the company growing, is the company  increasing their sales --  </p><p>SMITH: Not worried about valuations, you're just worried about gross  period. And Dagen, as much as  I've always say, I  got Apple fatigue.  I  can't talk another day about Apple and this watch. And people love to buy  the stocks, the love to buy the watch, they love to buy the Apple products.  And it's like you can't ignore it.  It's a growth engine that hasn't  stopped.   </p><p>MCDOWELL: No, it's Google getting surprised at the upside Apple can't do.  And it's an juggernaut and it's in the world of technology are you going to  - it's relatively safe.  Well, I say safe, but it's a safer bet than a lot  of the questionable companies that are younger and newer with business  models that are great deal shakier than that one. </p><p>MURPHY: And we have the watch, but we also have Apple music that was just  launched. I mean, it'll be interesting to see if they speak at about that  because now, they're moving in a whole new space, but they still have that  Apple mote. </p><p>MCDOWELL: How many people they got to sign up for the free trial, which I  did and I was not a subscriber to Spotify either and I signed up for Apple.  </p><p>SMTIH: There you have it.  Alright. All this. Don't miss \"After the Bell's\"  complete coverage on earnings after the close of trade today, right here on  the Fox Business Network.  David and Melissa will have that for you, 4:00  p.m.  Eastern time.  We are just over 30 minutes away from the opening  bell.  Futures right now pointing to a mixed open. NASDAQ on pace for a  record day. Keep it right here on Fox Business. We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>SMITH: All right.  IBM is poised to shave off nearly 60 points from the Dow  when it begins trading just a about an a half hour from now.  Dagen, Mike,  final thoughts ahead of the opening bell this morning?  Mike, go first.  </p><p>MCDOWELL: You can go first.</p><p>SMITH: You're on the spot.  Think of something.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Because I'm going to talk about something - uncomfortable.</p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>MURPHY: Okay.  I think the focus right now is on earnings.  You know, we've  heard from a lot of big banks. They've come out with strong earnings.  So,  I think the market is sitting at all-time highs.  You talk about  valuations, but I think if you look at it, we're not trading at  historically high levels.  So, there's talk out there about bubbles.  We're  not in a bubble right now.  I think the market on strong earnings can take  out highs and go higher. That's what I'll be watching today. </p><p>MCDOWELL: And I'm watching any additional information on the Ashley Madison  hack, the site for people looking for-- </p><p>SMITH: Cheating.  </p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes, who want to cheat on their spouses.  So, what happened  yesterday, it was a group that said they hacked into the Ashley Madison  website and accessed 37 million users information because the full delete  option that Ashley Madison charges for, it wasn't real. They weren't  deleting these account.  Ashley Madison said yesterday yes, it does.  And  it's offering free delete of all your accounts on Ashley Madison. And there  was no new information that was posted on-line yesterday.  </p><p>SMITH: By the way, this is a  story in the 'Wall Street Journal\"  questioning whether or not the IPO that had been planned for Ashley Madison  will actually happen.  So, that's continued fallout from that story as  well.  Thank goodness they're going to let me delete my account.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>SMITH: Alright,  IBM, by the way, we're saying is going shave off 60 points  from the Dow out of the gate this morning. United Technologies, part of  that sell-off as well. Right now, combined  IBM and United Technologies  expected to shave off about 93 points from the Dow when it opens this  morning. United Technologies UTX right now off $5 bucks in the pre-market  ahead of the bell a half hour from now.  And there was IBM off about $10 as  well. </p><p>Alright, I want to say thank you to Dagen McDowell and Mike Murphy for  joining us this morning. </p><p>MCDOWELL: Thank you.</p><p>MURPHY: Thank you.</p><p>SMITH: Busy couple of hours guys. You don't want to miss MORNINGS WITH  MARIA tomorrow.  Maria will be back. Presidential Candidate and Former  Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee will be here to  talking about the latest  in the always exciting campaign.

Analysts looking for $1.01 a share up from 91 cents a share a  year ago. </p><p>Apple reporting after the close today.

Jordan  Spieth who was trying to become the first since Ben Hogan in 1953 to win  the first three majors of the year fell short by one stroke at the end of  his round yesterday.</p><p>All right.  Well, gold prices edging lower after plunging to the lowest  level in five years on rate hikes feared.  Phil Flynn is now at the CME  Group watching this sell-off nearing $1,100 a troy ounce in gold.  Phil,  will gold dip below $1,000 an ounce?  </p><p>PHIL FLYNN, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Well, it did earlier and I think it has a  chance to because it is so close.  But you know, a lot of people are  talking about this bear raid that happened on Sunday night.  That's what  they're calling it.  This massive sell orders that came in that broke the  gold market down.  And it's either -- it's a critical turning point.</p><p>This is either a sign of capitulation or a sign that the market is going  down.  Consider the fact that we saw over $2 billion wiped off --  commodity, ETFs -- in the matter of a couple of hours yesterday.  And  that's raising a lot of concerns whether this trade was real, if it's  really signaling a bigger problem with the global economy, or a bigger  meltdown in China.</p><p>Now what's kind of interesting here when we look at what's happened to gold  here the couple of days central banks around the globe have been buying  gold.  We just saw reports that Russia, Kazakhstan, Afghanistan -- all  these countries have been buying gold while the rest of the world is  selling them.  But it's raising a lot of concerns.</p><p>But look what's done.  You know, it's kind of interesting, people don't  realize Sandra last month commodities as an asset class in the last quarter  actually outperformed the stock market.  What a turn-around in just the  first couple of days of the quarter when we see this massive sell off in  commodities.  The index near a 13-year-low of all commodities, putting a  lot of downward pressure on prices and the sell-off in gold really has, you  know, trickled down to other markets, you know.</p><p>Gold is the first one to sell off but it even impacted things like crude  oil, gasoline prices, RBA (ph) prices.  So it's raising concerns that this  drop in gold could be signaling the bigger deflationary cycle which is  going to create bigger problems for the fed as we go forward.  </p><p>SMITH:  All right.  So the cover of the \"Financial Times\" this morning, by  the way, it's all about this commodity sell-off -- gold, lowest level in  five years amid broader commodity sell-off.  A lot of this, Michael, based  on the strength that we're seeing in the U.S. dollar.  To be clear in the  overnight session we saw gold dip below $1,100 a troy ounce but, of course,  the big round number we're now all watching is $1,000.  Could that happen?   Could we dip below there?</p><p>MICHAEL BLOCK, RHINO TRADING PARTNERS:  It could happen but I'm noticing  some very interesting things here -- Sandra.  I'm noticing, you know,  there's the cover of the FT saying the death of gold.  On the Twitter- sphere, you know, there's talk amongst traders and investors, no one wants  to touch.  The gold bugs are being burned at the stake here.  </p><p>SMITH:  Dagen said it yesterday, actually.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN HOST:  Yes, you finish your thought.  I'll get into it.   But when people point to gold and argue that gold, in and of itself, is  some sort of economic indicator I go \"pooh, really\".  Because copper is  used around the global economy, oil is a critical global economic  commodity. </p><p>SMITH:  People buy and sell gold versus copper for very different reasons.   That being said what is the trade in gold right now?  </p><p>BLOCK:  The trade, you know, I see right now is you know, sentiment getting  worse.  I think it could get worse, you know, when the screaming gets  really loud as I like to say.  People ask when is gold going to stop going  down, I always give them a sardonic reply \"when you stop asking me\", which  is my way of saying when there's total capitulation.  I think we're getting  close.  Maybe we are there.  For smart investors I have a lot of guys who  are saying five years out I want to own gold miners and say hell yes, own  an ETF here.  This is an interesting interest spot where you want to start  picking away at it.</p><p>You know, look, gold is like anything else.  Is it an inflation flight?  Is  it a flight to safety?  No and no.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  They can't answer that question.  If you want safety you  go into treasury bonds because the U.S. government will at least pay you  back.  If you want an inflation hedge, you go out and buy a house or you  buy stocks because they're going to raise the price.  I'm just saying that  people have this wonderment around gold.  </p><p>SMITH:  I hear Phil Flynn chomping at the bit down there -- Phil.  </p><p>FLYNN:  Well, you know, it's kind of interesting here.  I just mentioned  Russia improve their gold reserves, a lot of that was because of the  weakness in the ruble.  We talk about China.  A lot of talk that they  didn't increase their gold reserves as much as a lot of people thought as  they're trying to bring their currency back to a global market.</p><p>And I agree with Dagen.  On a day to day basis gold can, you know, react  with no really strong economic purpose.  But at the end of the day, central  banks still use gold as the backdrop of their foreign currency whether they  acknowledge it or not. So it's a very, very important commodity from that  standpoint.  </p><p>SMITH:  All right.  That being said, we just checked the last time we did  see gold below $1,000 an ounce, we'll have to go back to 2009 to see that - - so certainly a big round number to watch.  Phil Flynn -- thank you for  joining us from the CME Group there in Chicago. </p><p>Donald Trump taking a step back on \"THE O'REILLY FACTOR\" last night over  his comments about Senator John McCain when he called the former POW,  quote, \"not a war hero\".  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  I have respect for senator McCain.  I used to like him a lot, I  supported him, raise money for his campaign against President Obama and  certainly if there was a misunderstanding I would totally take that back.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SMITH:  Get ready because my next guest says the latest flip is far worse  than those about Mexican immigrants and will cost Trump dearly.  The latest  polling data does suggest otherwise.  A new poll ABC News and the  \"Washington Post\" show he is the favorite at 24 percent.  Mind you, that  poll did happen before those comments occurred.</p><p>Mike Berland is a former strategic adviser to Hillary Clinton and CEO of  Edelman Berland and joins us now.  And Mike, we very much look forward to  having you on the show this morning to react to not only to what Donald  Trump said but then how he has responded now to our very own Bill O'Reilly  last night.  </p><p>MIKE BERLAND, EDELMAN BERLAND:  Well, if you like \"Celebrity Apprentice\"  waiting for the August 6th Republican debate because Donald Trump is  building his viewership, he's building his base and he will be ready to go.  </p><p>What we're seeing is that Donald Trump is a master brand builder.  I've  been studying brands for 25 years, he knows what he is about, he's very  clear he's a straight shooter and he's now setting the dialogue.</p><p>Sandra we've been talking about Donald Trump for two weeks.  We are  watching what's happening on social media.  In his first issue with Mexican  illegal immigrants, it was a corporate play and we saw the issues that he  had.  Now we're seeing that this was much broader.</p><p>You know who broke this?  Mitt Romney.  He tweeted out and 60,000 shared  it.  And over the next three days we saw this go from Politico and Mitt  Romney to Democrats, Republicans, Independents -- everybody is talking  about Donald Trump.  </p><p>SMITH:  Well first of all we've been talking a lot about Donald Trump for a  lot longer than two weeks.  </p><p>BERLAND:  Well, he's a -- viable presidential candidates.  </p><p>SMITH:  Ok.  But the branding aspect Dagen is one that every time --  because if anything he continues to establish his brand and get his name  out there.  Polling shows that -- the last poll that I saw showed that only  two percent of American voter respondents didn't know who he was.  I mean  more people know Donald Trump than any other presidential candidate out  there.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Real-estate billionaire used to be his brand.  Now it's  \"feckless blowhard\" according to the \"Des Moines Register\" which called for  him to step out of a race but you know who he is like?  And to Michael's  credit we were talking about this before he walked out here.  He's Ross  Perot -- right.</p><p>That's the best comparison to Trump is Ross Perot getting into the race.  </p><p>BERLAND:  But what does Trump have that Ross Perot didn't have?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Money.</p><p>BERLAND:  No, he had.  Ross Perot had billion dollars, Donald Trump has  social media and when we look at how this story is spreading we see that  Donald Trump is now becoming political provocateur.  He is talking about  issues that people are scared about and I think what is really interesting  is that this is not just a Republican Party issue.  This is about  presidential politics in America and we see that everybody is responding. </p><p>Look at this analysis that I've done.  The story started with Politico on  one side, Mitt Romney on the other and watch how the story spread over  Twitter.  It started to connect and this became ubiquitous issue over three  days.  </p><p>Sandra most stories died down after three days.  This one actually built.   And by the time we get to August 6th we're going to see Trump continue to  build support and I think if you are Jeb Bush, if you're Marco Rubio, if  you're Rick Perry and you are in that debate with him you got to watch out.</p><p>SMITH:  Ok.  But we have not had your reactions yet on O'Malley and  apologizing for saying \"all lives matter\"?  I am dying to know your take on  that.  </p><p>BERLAND:  I think that what we are seeing is a debate now is spreading  bigger -- that we are seeing a lot of issues on the Republican and on  Democratic side and we're talking about straight shooting.  </p><p>SMITH:  Ok.  That's it?</p><p>BLOCK:  Does straight shooting from O'Malley's sell though?  That's the  question. </p><p>BERLAND:  Right.  He doesn't have the brand that Donald Trump does to get  it out.  I think that we're seeing really -- on the Democratic side, here  we have Donald Trump who is talking very candidly about the issues.  We  have Hillary Clinton who is being very careful and scripted and what's  going to happen with the American voter it's he's raising the bar.  And  we're going to see on both sides, we're going to see Sanders, we're going  to see O'Malley, we're going to see Clinton.  They're all going to have to  take their game up.</p><p>But Trump is drowning everybody out right now.  </p><p>SMITH:  I think you let O'Malley of the hook a little easy compared to what  you're doing to Donald Trump.  </p><p>BERLAND:  No, hold on.  I'm saying Donald Trump is absolutely very much in  control of the dialogue.  I think I'm actually -- </p><p>SMITH:  Is it that he is or you want him to be because that is better for  the left?  </p><p>BERLAND:  For the left I think they want Donald Trump to go away.  I think  that the Republicans would as well.  </p><p>SMITH:  Really.</p><p>BERLAND:  Of course.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  A better comparison is Bernie Sanders because they're really  appealing to the same anti-establishment feeling on the right as Trump and  on the left as Sanders.  </p><p>BERLAND:  I'll give you an example.  John Kasich today is going to announce  that he is running for president.  And nobody's going to hear it and no one  is going to care because they're going to keep talking about Donald Trump.   So you are drowning out both sides.</p><p>If you're Hillary Clinton you can't get your economic message out there.   If you're Bernie Sanders you're getting drowned out.</p><p>SMITH:  What's her economic message?</p><p>BERLAND:  Her economic message, she's talking about increasing wages -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Her economic message is more Obama and she doesn't go as far  left as Bernie Sanders.  That's in essence what her economy -- </p><p>SMITH:  But that is my defense of Hillary Clinton, is that she is the one  who is trying to get her economic message out there.  More so than I say to  a lot of other candidates aside from maybe Jeb Bush who's a real fan on the  table for growth in the United States.</p><p>All right.  We unfortunately have to leave it there.  Mike Berland -- great  conversation.</p><p>BERLAND:  Thanks for having me.</p><p>SMITH:  Thanks for joining us early this morning. </p><p>All right.  Well, the Nasdaq notching its third record close in a row and  major members of the index scheduled to report earnings today.  Are we  approaching another technology bubble?  Is that happening right now?  We  will discuss that next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>SMITH:  President Obama's new dishwasher rules are under fire by appliance  makers.  Cheryl, you get down. </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT:   We had it. </p><p>SMITH:  What's your story?  Take it away.  </p><p>CASONE:  You've got it Sandra.  Yes, dishwasher rules, not kidding about  this one -- Sandra.  Are you ready to start hand washing your dishes again  folks?  I'm serious.  This is a real story.  The Association of Home  Appliance Manufacturers says that is exactly what is going to happen if the  White House's new dishwasher regulations go into law.</p><p>The new rules cut the amount of water that dishwashers can use.  But the  industry group says that's going to only lead to dirtier dishes and we're  all going to be unhappy and we're going to blame the President for dirty  dishes.  True story.</p><p>Intelligent life anywhere in the universe if it exists, Stephen Hawking  wants to find it.  The famed scientist has announced the new $100 million  project to find evidence of life beyond earth.  Hawking and other  researchers plan to spend the next ten years studying one million stars in  the Milky Way and 100 other galaxies for any signs of life.  ET if you're  out there, you can call us.</p><p>And finally Microsoft reporting quarterly results after the close today,  the software giant expected to pose a drop in revenue, as buyers wait for  the next version of Windows.  That's due out later this month.  Investors  also hoping to hear more details about the company's latest job cuts.   Unfortunately that is the problem. </p><p>The Nasdaq, we didn't get the record close yesterday intra-day Sandra but,  you know, everybody keeps saying are we in a bubble?  Is this a bubble?  Is  technology a bubble?  But when Apple comes in after the close I think all  of those questions are going to be deleted because Apple is probably going  to have another really strong quarter.  </p><p>SMITH:  I mean is it reasonable that we're having fears of the year 2000  and these lofty valuations on these stocks?  I mean I'm looking at the  triple cues (ph), the power share's triple cues, trusts tracks Nasdaq -- a  ten-year high there as well.  Everybody is worried, you know.  Is this  sustainable?  </p><p>BLOCK:  Look, we're breaking 200 highs, I'm not going to use the word  \"bubble\" here.  What I'm seeing here is -- the key word here is \"scarcity\".   Google came out last week.  They had great earnings with the Ruth Porat as  the CFO now.  They have a great cost cutting story; over the weekend that  hey they can use some of their cash to buy back stock, hitting on all  cylinders.</p><p>Here's the problem, what goes for Google does not necessarily go for  Microsoft or Qualcomm or Sandisk or Texan or some of these other companies  coming out.  I don't think the valuations are too lofty.  You see some of  these venture capital valuations and then there are certain companies out  there with no earnings that are going on.  Amazon -- </p><p>CASONE:  Well, Jet.com is what came up yesterday.  That is where this whole  discussion started out.  It was like really?  That is not making any money  and come on.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Some of the valuations on the private companies even Uber are  where you get nosebleeds in there.  A lot of companies getting funding,  that are actually companies -- they're the exact same model of a company  that went out of business during the first dot.com crash and then it came  back.  Whether the (INAUDIBLE) sticks with the originally company, it  basically got shut down and then they refunded at a higher price which  makes no sense.</p><p>SMITH:  And look, there's no fun in looking at financials these days with  the lack of growth potential that most analysts point out in the financial  sector.  It's like where is that money that's chasing growth in the stock  market, where are they going to look?  </p><p>BLOCK:  It's going to tech and to biotech, and you have Chipotle reporting  as well and it's going to these rogue companies because there's scarcity of  growth.  Organic growth isn't coming from many places, even Google's coming  down but there still is some growth.  The question is, is Microsoft there.   Apple -- I think everyone thinks is going to be there -- </p><p>CASONE:  You know what I don't want to see though, you guys.  I don't want  to see another year where you have what we saw back in 2000 which was  Goldman Sachs and the investment bankers that extend these IPOs.  They're  the ones that made all the money and the retail investors, the (INAUDIBLE)  got the shaft once again.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  The retail investor except in a few instances is very shy of a  lot of these companies.  This is an indicator of nothing but I bought my  first Mac.  I've never owned a Mac.  I've always been Windows-based my  entire life.  Yesterday -- it arrived yesterday.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BLOCK:  -- growth exposure.</p><p>SMITH:  Everybody wants to talk about tech bubbles. We're going to be right  back.  Stay with us</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KT MCFARLAND, FOX NEWS NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST:  It's truly (INAUDIBLE).   They have famously last year in the battle for Kobani which is a big city  near there on the other side of the Turkish border that ISIS took Turkish  tanks out on the Turkish border and they watched as ISIS came in, took the  town, slaughtered the Kurdish population there. </p><p>So will Turkey join the battle?  Will Turkey join the battle in Syria and  Iraq, you know, the Islamic state?  Or will Turkey just say I'm going to  defend our borders?  Will Turkey tighten up its borders?  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SMITH:  That was K.T. McFarland weighing in on one of the top stories in  the Journal this morning.  Reading \"Suicide bomber killed at least 31 in  Turkish border towns\".</p><p>For more on this let's bring in Fox News correspondent and former navy  fighter pilot Lea Gabriel.  Good morning.  Thanks for joining us on this  story this morning.  What do you make of the latest developments out of  Turkey?  </p><p>LEA GABRIEL, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Well, you know, actually what we just  heard K.T. saying, in Turkey we watched as Kobani was under siege for  months and months.  Turkey sat there, did very little.  Turkey has been  very difficult to influence to get engaged in this fight against ISIS even  though ISIS is essentially -- this alligator called ISIS has been chomping  at their canoe for a long time.</p><p>Now Turkey is saying, ok, well this is probably retaliation because now we  are joined with, you know, the other fight against ISIS and now we're  helping to train some Syrian rebels.  So this is probably retaliation.</p><p>I see that as a bit of a cop out from Turkey because they really have not  wanted to be engaged in this fight.  And what they really want I think is  for the U.S. and for other countries to step in and fight this so they can  sit back and watch.  </p><p>SMITH:  So you don't think Turkey is going to join the battle here?  </p><p>GABRIEL:  I think Turkey will but I think they're going to continue to do  as little as possible.  And there's a lot of reasons for this.  For one,  it's that Turkey does not want to see the rise of the Kurds. Turkey does  not want to see an independent Kurdistan.  They have seen the Kurdish power  rising.  The Kurds have been our biggest ally in this fight against ISIS.   And that's a big problem for Turkey so I think that is one of the main  reasons that they're wanting to kind of sit back. </p><p>You know, they wanted the U.S. to do a lot.  They wanted us to establish a  no-fly zone.  They wanted a humanitarian zone. They wanted others to come  in and take care of this threat and I think we'll continue to see them do  as little as possible.  </p><p>SMITH:  Cover of the \"Wall Street Journal\" this morning -- Dagen.  ISIS's  leader takes steps to ensure group's survival.  Not just ensuring survival,  it seems that they're gaining territory and they're gaining power.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Lea, Turkey has one of the largest armies in the world. </p><p>GABRIEL:  Second largest in NATO.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  And one of I think the fourth largest overall.  Would we  be willing to step in and help Turkey knowing that they have basically the  power to take care of themselves if they so choose?  </p><p>GABRIEL:  This is a little diplomatic game that I think we have been  playing for months.  Since Kobani was going on a lot of people said why  aren't we doing more in Kobani?  Why just an air campaign?  I think a lot  of this was to basically say look, this is a regional problem. </p><p>As I said this alligator is chomping at your canoe.  We may be in the same  river but it's not right here on our borders, it's on yours Turkey.  And I  think that's a quiet little diplomatic game that is being played, that's  the soft power.  </p><p>BLOCK:  I mean look, there's a new power here, what is El Baghdadi and ISIS  really worried about here?  They're worried about the fact that the United  States is making this groundbreaking deal with Iran.  Why are we making the  deal with Iran?  You know, the thing that no one wants to talk about is  this sort of takes the shackles off the revolutionary guard, our sworn  enemies.  Maybe now and certainly in the past that says hey they're going  to join the fight more overtly now.  And you know, for someone looking at  Erdogan in Turkey, looking at the U.S., looking at all the players in the  region suddenly there's this new big player there and you know, I think is  really what ISIS is responding to here.  </p><p>GABRIEL:  But definitely a positive spin on the nuclear deal and not to say  a spin -- </p><p>BLOCK:  No, it's my view on it.  I get asked about it constantly.</p><p>GABRIEL:  There's good and there's bad.  There's definitely a good side of  it but at the same time what Iran really wants in the region is influence. </p><p>BLOCK:  Here it is.</p><p>GABRIEL:  So Iran may be battling ISIS, but Iran wants to grow its  influence and in no way would I consider Iran any sort of an ally with us  in the region at any point.  </p><p>SMITH:  All right.  Thank you to Lea Gabriel.  And by the way, check out  Lea's new web segment called the \"Fox Patriot Report\".  Log onto  foxnews.com for more -- right?</p><p>GABRIEL:  Yes.  Thank you.</p><p>SMITH:  All right.  Thank you very much to Lea.</p><p>A new poll this morning showing Donald Trump taking the lead in the  Republican race but could his comments on Senator McCain the damper on his  White House run?  Some think so, some think not.  Former New York governor  and current Republican candidate for president George Pataki is here to  weigh in.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>SANDRA SMITH, FOX BUSINESS: Ohio Governor, John Kasich set to jump into the  2016 White House race. Blake Burman has the latest from Washington. Blake?</p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FOX BUSINESS: Sandra, John Kasich will make it 16 later  today. He is expected to be the final in a long list of candidates in the  Republican primary. Kasich is the Governor of the swing state of Ohio and a  former Congressman. In between those two stints, he also worked at Lehman  Brothers.  This will be Kasich's second attempt at a White House run and  he'll start with a lot of ground to make up.  Kasich currently sits just  outside the top 10 pulling in around one to two percent of support from  Republicans and  for the moment, is among the packs staring up at Donald  Trump. A poll released by \"The Washington Post\" shows the billionaire  businessman has widened his lead. Trump's 24 percent is double his nearest  competitors. However Sandra,  some of that poll was taken before his  controversial comments on John McCain. So, the full effect of that for  Trump is still unknown and the Post points out that on the final day of  that poll, they saw a drop for Trump. So it's something we'll have to look  forward - look to going forward. Sandra?</p><p>SMITH: Alright. Thank you for that Blake. And following his comments on  Senator McCain, \"The Des Moines Register\" is now calling for Trump to end  his run for the White House. My next guest has taken Donald Trump to task  for his recent comments on Senator McCain, and demeaning Mexicans.</p><p>Joining me now is former New York governor and current Republican candidate  for president, George Pataki. Governor, thank you for being here this  morning.  </p><p>GEORGE PATAKI (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  Good morning.  Nice being on  with you.  </p><p>SMITH:  All right, so where do you stand on Trump's most recent comments on  Senator John McCain?  </p><p>PATAKI:  Can I tell I something?  Donald Trump is not going to be President  of the United States.  Period.  Whether it's his McCain comments, his  comments earlier demeaning Mexicans.</p><p>SMITH:  Why do you rule him out?  </p><p>PATAKI:  First of all, he's never held public office and we've had two  people in 150 years -- Dwight Eisenhower and U.S. Grant -- who hadn't held  public office.  And then he makes comments that are simply outrageous.  The  media loves this.  I mean, look what we're talking about. The day after the  U.N. Security Council --</p><p>SMITH:  The media loves it.</p><p>PATAKI:  -- approves the Iran agreement, we're talking about Donald Trump.</p><p>SMITH:  This is true.</p><p>PATAKI:  Donald Trump is not going to be president. The Iran Security  Council vote is meaningful; that's what we should be talking about.   Forgive me.  </p><p>SMITH:  Well, the media loves it, but the polling shows the American voters  like it as well.  Now you're in this race, and we've got another GOP  contender jumping in today as well.  The field, the bench, is deep,  Governor.  </p><p>PATAKI:  I think that's a great thing.  </p><p>SMITH:  It is?  .  </p><p>PATAKI:  I think it's a great thing for the country, a great thing for the  party.  It's July of 2015.  The election is November of 2016.  And I've had  people come up to me and say what's going on?  Normally this is -- three or  four months before the election, not year and three or four months before  the election.</p><p>People will have a chance to make their case.  People will rise up, drop  out, and Donald Trump I think has disqualified himself.  He's a celebrity.   The media loves him.  But ultimately he is not going to be President of the  United States.  </p><p>PATAKI:  So do you think he has been a bad thing for the Republican Party,  considering that most GOP candidates are having to respond to his comments?</p><p>PATAKI:  I do.  I do.  In particular, I think the Republicans --  </p><p>SMITH:  Because you're sitting there talking about it right now.  </p><p>PATAKI:  Yes, and I think the Republicans who did not stand up to his  comments about Mexicans are going to regret it next year.  I mean it's one  thing to stand up for an icon, a war hero, John McCain.  Everybody did  that, but you have to stand up --  </p><p>SMITH:  Or all POWs, quite frankly.  He took a shot at anybody -- </p><p>PATAKI:  All POWs, absolutely.</p><p>SMITH:  -- who had ever been a prisoner of war.</p><p>PATAKI:  And all those who have served our country.  But you have to stand  up for those who aren't famous, who aren't rich and powerful or hold  important position.  And they didn't -- so many of my running mates didn't  do that when it came to Mexicans, and they're going to regret that.  </p><p>SMITH:  And there's been criticism of the Republican Party for not focusing  on most important issue for the American voter, and that is the economy.   Where is the GOP on that?</p><p>PATAKI:  Yes.  Well, first of all, we have to talk about the economy, but I  honestly think what happened yesterday in the U.N. Security Council is  critical. And when you think back to September 11, the economic  consequence.  Obviously it had horrible human personal consequences that we  still feel, but the economic consequences of an insecure America are  enormous.  </p><p>And after that deal -- and I am outraged that this president bypassed  Congress, basically gutted the law that he signed giving Congress 60 days  to reject that deal and seven different U.N. sanctions -- decades of work  by presidents since Bill Clinton are out the window regardless what  Congress has done.  That's an outrage.  And ultimately when our security's  at risk, it affects our economy.  </p><p>MICHAEL BLOCK, RHINO TRADING PARTNERS CHIEF STRATEGIST:  Governor.  You  know, everyone's still focused on Trump.  In a perfect world, it would be  about issues.  How do you intend to get public back on issues.  </p><p>PATAKI:  You know, when you're out on the hustings, when you don't have the  cameras there -- and sadly I don't get that many cameras when I'm out on  the hustings because they're all with Trump or Hillary or someone else.   People care about the issues, they care about jobs, they care about the  fact that we've had one of the weakest recoveries ever since a terrible  recession.  They care about, you know, the fact that we are now having  great relations with Cuba but we have hard relations with our ally Israel.  And it's like a bad \"Saturday Night Live\" skit when the president -- when  four Marines who are putting their -- put their lives on the line for our  country are murdered in the United States, are told -- the Marines are  told, well, you can't wear your uniform in the United States.  That's a  disgrace.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS:  But I think that -- but I think that you --  that Trump does touch on the issues, to defend why he is popular among  Americans.  He takes a very hard line on immigration.  He uses language  that is objectionable, but he takes a hard line on immigration, he takes a  hard line on China, he takes a hard line on the lack of economic growth and  wage growth in this country.  And that is what's connecting him.  </p><p>PATAKI:  He's great at pointing out problems.  But what America needs are  solutions.  And when it comes to immigration, I don't think there's a  Republican candidate who doesn't stand up there and say we have got to  secure our borders.  We have got to make sure everybody comes here legally.   They just don't demean millions of people in the process.  </p><p>And that is, to me, a part of the politics that I don't like.  We have to  talk about solutions, talk about bringing people together, and not  inflammatory rhetoric that seems, you know, wonderful for a headline at the  moment but ultimately divides us and doesn't solve problems.  </p><p>SMITH:  You talked about the four Marines and now the sailor that has also  died in those shootings last week.  Do you -- should military men and women  in this country be armed?  </p><p>PATAKI:  Absolutely.  It is a despicable surrender, tyrannical Islam here,  when this president goes to our Marine recruiters in response to this and  says don't wear a uniform and keep your blinds drawn.  This is absurd.   They should have arms; every military person in uniform in this country  should be allowed to carry an arm. I'll tell you, I'll feel a lot better if  I see a Marine in a uniform with a gun on his side than if I do seeing that  this strong solid guy, knowing he could be a target and can't defend  himself.  By the way, my son was a Marine, in Iraq, so I'm -- </p><p>SMITH:  Well, we thank you for his service and your family's service.</p><p>PATAKI:  Thank you.</p><p>SMITH:  All right, Governor Pataki, full of energy.  Love your passion.   Thanks for being here this morning.  </p><p>PATAKI:  Thank you. Alright. Well coming up, bidding wars are back for  homes. Are they a good thing or a bad thing. We're going to discus that  next, stay tuned.  </p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING: UNIDENTIFIED SONG)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>SMITH: Alright. Let's take a look futures ahead of the opening bell on Wall  Street this morning. Dow and S&amp;P futures, the broader market averages or  the futures on them at least, are down, pointing to lower open. Look at the  NASDAQ futures though following up on yesterday's record close. NASDAQ  futures looking like a higher open. That would be a record on Wall Street  when things get going at 9:30 a.m.  Eastern this morning. And look at gold  prices. That sell-off continues. Dropped below $1100 dollars an ounce in  the overnight session. We've come off those lows but still down at $1106 an  ounce.</p><p>Call it a flashback to the housing boom. Bidding wars are back in housing  market, but unlike the 2000 characterized by easy money mortgages, bidding  wars are now sparked by too few homes offered for sale. Michael, what's  your take on this. Is this a red flag or sign of a robust housing market?</p><p>BLOCK: Housing has already come a long way and we've seen it do well. It's  well-off lows the lows and if you look at chart on new home sales and  housing starts, they've come well off the lows and they still have a ways  to run that's in 2007, 2006, the era like that. A couple things that I'm  looking at.  I look at stocks for a living and I noticed that the ITB, the  homebuilding, home construction ETF, peaked in early April. Yesterday, even  though we've had strong housing data yesterday, housing stocks lagged.  There was some analysts rumbling about Home Depot and Lowe's, some softness  there perhaps. So, there's some worries there.  </p><p>In term of the supply-demand dynamic. I think that's exactly what it is.  There's a scarcity of homes. What's going to happen? Are we going - are  they going to build more homes. That comes down to a lot about confidence  and consumer confidence from (INAUDIBLE) last week. For me, I think housing  hitting a bit of a wall here. It's has a good run. It's no longer new news  incrementally when housing data is good. I'm a little worried about what  happened in the energy patch and what's happening with U.S. industrials in  terms of manufacturing. Manufacturing has hit a wall in the United States.  Is that going to affect wages?  Wages are stopped out and you know, to me,  housing I think the risk is to the downside here.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINES: We're going to have to go back to talking  about housing, though, regionally and locally because the big issue -  because this story about the bidding wars coming back is in just some  specific hot markets. There's so many pockets of weakness throughout the  country where there hasn't been wage growth. You go and hour half outside  New York City, there is plenty of supply and the prices look extremely soft  and you see that throughout the country. If you're not in a hot economic  market like New York, or Silicon Valley, the San Francisco area, the houses  are - the supply can be plentiful and the prices can be pretty cheap.  </p><p>SMITH: But there are pockets doing very well. Case in point, the city of  Chicago. Chicago home sales hit a new record high. The first half of the  year. Sales activity really hot there.  </p><p>BLOCK: What I'll argue is back during the peak, Chicago was good.  It was  never one of these explosive markets in there it came in. So now, it's kind  of coming off the low base. You know, Dagen was talking about -- </p><p>Dagen: Highest sells tax in the country in Chicago now. A lot of economic  problems.  </p><p>BLOCK: Well the governance is so good there. Anyway, --</p><p>SMITH: Drop mic.</p><p>BLOCK: You know, we're talking about markets that are good. One thing I'll  say about the high-end market, you now Denver what was talked about in the  press and that's an interesting place. But New York, on the high-end. One  thing that we're not talking about here is how strong the Dollar is. How is  that going to deter -</p><p>SMITH: Foreign investment?</p><p>BLOCK: -- you know, potential buyer from Brasilia and Russia, some of these  countries - Europe, some of these countries that have really spurred a lot  of buying.  </p><p>MCDOWELL: Chinese buyers.</p><p>BLOCK: That's something I think (INAUDIBLE) talking enough about. You know,  Chinese buying maybe insulted to that (INAUDIBLE) stage relatively strong.  But I'm talking about countries like the (INAUDIBLE) of Ruble, which we've  seen weakness.  </p><p>MCDOWELL: It's not just the currency, it's the commodities themselves being  weak and Russia put the  pressure on the buyers.  </p><p>BLOCK: Yes, and that's the whole thing and that's the whole punch line here  is that, you know, what happens to commodities is going to affect housing  in this country - </p><p>SMITH: It's going to affect everything. </p><p>BLOCK: Because of the dollar.</p><p>BLOCK: All right, coming up guys, there is still no verdict in the Tom  Brady deflate-gate case and now some analyst think the NFL may wait an  entire year to hand down a ruling.  Oh, joy. Our next guest wrote the book  on Brady and he's going to weigh in on deflate-gate next.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>SMITH: It's Hot outside. Temperatures rising across the country and we are  facing a heat wave. Maria Molina is in the Fox Weather Center with the  details. Maria, another hot day, another hot week?  </p><p>MARIA MOLINA, FOX WEATHER CENTER: Yes, it looks like it's going to be  another hot one across many areas in the country and for us in New York  City for instance, we're going to be hot today, but we're going to start to  feel relief already as we head into Tomorrow with a cold front that's going  to be swing through dropping  those temperatures and humidity levels. But  if you live in the southeast or across parts of the plains, expect those  hot temperatures to remain in place at least for several more days. Parts  of Oklahoma, you're not expecting any relief pretty much for most of this  workweek.</p><p>So, again, different areas expecting to see a relief or no relief and  different time periods. So you can see a look at the high temperatures for  today. 90s and triple digits across parts of the plains as we head  eastward, high temperatures widespread into the 90s and the problem is that  it's not just hot on thermometer, but you also have a lot of humidity  in  place out there and that's what makes it feel a lot hotter than what  temperatures say. </p><p>So, this is what it's going to feel like as we head out the door. In  Wilmington, by 5:00 p.m., it should feel like 108, 106 in Montgomery,  Vicksburg 107 and triple-digit heat index values as well across parts of  the plains. So again, it's really what it's going to feel like out there  that's the issue and those heat advisories in place out here because of  those high heat index values. Excesses heat warnings also in place portions  of the Carolinas. And I do want to mention that there is a chance for some  showers and storms different parts of the country today. A very low risk  for severe weather, but it is in place out there across the plains, Mid- Atlantic and also in the northeast. Sandra?  </p><p>SMITH: All right, Maria. Thank you.  Well still, no verdict in the Tom  Brady deflate-gate case and should there be one?  There is talk of waiting  on punishment for the New England Patriots quarterback until after the  season. We bring in \"New York Dailey News\" NFL columnist and author of  upcoming \"Brady versus Manning: The Untold Story of the Rivalry that  Transformed the NFL\". Gary Myers. Gary, good morning to you. </p><p>GARY MEYERS, NFL COLUMNIST AND AUTHOR (via telephone):  Good morning. How  are you?</p><p>SMITH: Alright. So, a lot of people have made the case for waiting to  finalize the punishment the Patriots after analyzing all this data over the  2015 season.  Are you saying - do you make the same case for that?</p><p>MYERS: Well, I think what would make sense from the standpoint that it  would give NFL an opportunity to -- to measure these footballs you know,  during, you know, the course of the game, especially during the wintertime,  when -- you know, the Patriots are claiming that the ball's naturally lose  air, you know, due to the weather conditions. But I don't know how  realistic it is that the NFL is going to want to --  you know, put this off  for a full year and wait to hand out the punishment to -- to the Patriots,  and, you know, put punishment on hold for the Patriots that they have  already handed out.</p><p>SMITH: And by the way, Gary, you're talking about punishment for Patriots,  but there's punishment --  Peter King over at the nnqb.com, he takes this a  step further and says any punishment for Tom Brady should be put off as  well.  </p><p>MYERS: Right. That's what I was about to say is that even more importantly  than punishment to the Patriots would be, you know, the punishment to Tom  Brady, and, you know, from the standpoint of really getting an accurate  indication of what, you know, the effect of the weather conditions are, on  footballs, which the NFL has never done -- that would seem to be, you know,  a fair solution before, you know, enacting all the punishment. But, again,  I don't know how realistic it is if the NFL's going to want to defer this  for a full year and go through the process of doing this you know,  complete, you know work-up of  what happens to the football during the  course of the game, I'm not sure that's going to happen.  </p><p>BLOCK: Hey Gary, you know, let me be blunt here. Is the NFL worried about  derailing the gravy train here or what are?  </p><p>MYERS: Derailing Brady train.  </p><p>BLOCK: Yes, you know, taking Brady out of the game. Is that going to ruin  money their maker here? Are they just a little reticent about that? Is  there any thought about that?  </p><p>MYERS: No, I  don't think that has anything to do -- uh -- with this  situation. NFL is basically an ATM machine and you know, whether Tom Brady  plays the first game, second game or up to, you know, or missing the first  four games, I don't think that's going to have any impact on the revenue.  </p><p>SMITH: Alright Gary. Let me bring in money angle here because despite all  these scandal that we're talking, that the NFL has been dealing with and  facing, the teams are still making a lot of money. More than $225 million  dollars each on revenue sharing for the NFL.  </p><p>MYERS: Well, I mean, we know they can make an absolute incredible amount of  money just from national TV contracts alone and they make a lot of money  from their local revenue. I mean, it's no secret that the NFL is an  extremely profitable business. Some of the numbers came out yesterday  because the Green Bay Packers are publicly owned, and those numbers are --  are made public.  But, again, as this relates to Brady, I don't know that  one player has any kind of impact on -- on the kind of revenue that the NFL  can generate. Now, it certainly could impact TV ratings the first couple of  weeks in just in Patriot games, that Brady, you know, plays or doesn't  play, depending on what happens, but I don't know overall that it makes one  bit of difference, you know, term of how much NFL is making.  </p><p>SMITH: Alright. Gary Myers thanks for joining us this morning and thank you  to Michael Block for joining me for the hour.  </p><p>MYERS: All right, take care.  </p><p>SMITH: Alright. Thank you both. Next hour, a \"Breaking Bad\" actor is  looking  to take his role on TV to real life announcing plans to run for  public office New Mexico. He'll join us next hour. Keep it right here on  Fox Business.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2015 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

Dagen, see you in just a bit. Thank  you. Good morning. I am Sandra Smith in for Maria Bartiromo.  It is Tuesday  morning , July 21st and with me this hour, Steve Cortes of Veracruz and  Attorney Mercedes Colwin.  </p><p>Here are your top stories at 6:00 a.m. on the east coast.  Gold once again  trading at its lowest level in five years as more investors prepare for the  Federal Reserve to raise interest rates.  Futures showing the markets right  now are trending to the downside, pointed to a lower open a couple hours  from now.  NASDAQ futures holding onto a slight gain.  </p><p>Soaring temperatures across the country again today.  The National Oceanic  and Atmospheric Administration saying records were broken for the month of  June and that 2015 is lining up to be the hottest year ever.  </p><p>Ohio governor John Kasich will add his name to the very crowded field of  candidates running for the White House on the Republican side today/   Kasich has plenty of experience in Washington serving in the House of  Representatives from 1983 through 2001.  </p><p>Donald Trump topping the latest ABC Washington Post poll taking in 24  percent of the support in the Republican field.  But, that came down before  Trump's comments about Senator John McCain who he doesn't regard as a war  hero.  Trump told Bill O'Reilly last night that the Senator has not done  anything for war veterans.  </p><p>(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, 2016 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: He's supposed to be doing it and  I see him on television all the time and he's always talking, talking, but  nothing gets done.  These veterans are living in hell Bill.  They're  hurting and they're crying and -</p><p>SMITH: More on that in a bit.  Meanwhile, Verizon among the companies  reporting earning this morning ahead of the opening bell. Analyst looking  for $1.01 a share. That's up from $0.91 cents a year ago.  Apple reporting  after the close today.  The \"Wall Street Journal\" saying the Iphone  accounts for nearly 70 percent of Apple's revenue and remains the company's  most profitable hardware products.  </p><p>Qualcomm, which supplies many of the chips for the Iphone it's looking at  the possibility of a breakup.  The Journal says the company will review its  options after an activist investor pushed for change at the chipmaker.   Seth Blatter, the now notorious president of the world soccer organization  FIFA were showered with fake money by comedian Lee Nelson. Nelson, a known  prankster in Europe tweeted about the incident later saying in jest that he  was excited to be at the meeting with Blatter to secure the North Korea  2026 World Cup.  </p><p>And Zach Johnson is you 2015 British Open champion.  How many saw this  playing out? Johnson birdied the first two holes of a four hole playoff to  help secure the win.  Jordan Speith who was trying to become the first in  since Ben Hogan in 1953 to win the first three majors of the year, fell one  stroke short at the end of his round yesterday.  </p><p>Alright well turning back to the latest on Donald Trump's run for the White  House.  Backtracking a little on those comments was Senator John McCain.  </p><p>(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: I have respect for Senator John McCain.  I used to like him a lot.   I supported him. I raised a lot of money for his campaign against President  Obama and certainly if there was a misunderstanding, I would totally take  that back.  </p><p>(END AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>SMITH: Trump has to say come under heavy fire for his comment questioning  Senator McCain's heroism as a prisoner of war.  But According to a new  \"Washington Post/ABC News\" poll, he still holds 24 percent of Republicans  support.  The largest lead recorded by any GOP candidate this year.   Although this number is strong, it must be noted that this poll was  finalized before coverage of his comment about Senator McCain became  widespread.  </p><p>But the headlines did not stop there.  The \"Des Moines Register\", Iowa's  largest newspaper is now calling on Trump to drop out of the 2016 race  saying quote \"Trump should pull the plug on his bloviating sideshow\".   Alright Mercedes, some pretty strong words from the key primary state's  newspaper.  Look, I mean leading in the polls, I'll be it, that was before  these most recent comments. Everybody's talking about him.  I mean, what  have - what is he currently doing for the race?  </p><p>MERCEDES COLWIN, ATTORNEY: I mean, certainly he's the game changer because  you don't know what he's going to say next.  He plays by the rules, he says  what's on his mind.  There really isn't that much --</p><p>SMITH: The \"Des Moines Register\" calling for him to step out of the race.  </p><p>COLWIN: It's true because it's his third rail. When you start criticizing  veterans, especially the GOP candidate, that is the third rail. You should  not touch it. And certainly will it have traction? Who knows.  But now that  the media's doing --</p><p>SMITH: Steve, how could he even let those words leave his mouth and not  know that there was going to be a fire storm? </p><p>STEVE CORTES, VERACRUZ: Well look, why? Because he's not a serious  candidate and this is serious business by the way. The Unites States has  slow growth, we're in a very dangerous world. This is no time for the  bloviating and demagoguery of a reality show.  And that's what Donald  Trump's about. This is about building his brand.  This isn't really about  making America better.  I believe he is - I agree completely with \"The Des  Moines Register\". He is a political dirty bomb for the Republican party,  particularly in terms of the party's outreach to Hispanics.  He has told  the largest emerging demographic group in America we think you're rapist,  we don't want your support and a group, by the way, which is dying to be  Republican. </p><p>SMITH: To be fair, though, he found a sweet spot. He's polling well. </p><p>CORTES: He has for now. But you know, asking a poll right now about the  2016 race is like asking a 5-year old at July what do you want for  Christmas.  There is going to be so many changes between now and the race.  Remember in the last cycle how many different people had the front runners  status at one time or another, had a cup of coffee as the front runner.  </p><p>SMITH: So Mercedes, the question had been is Donald Trump going to help or  hurt the GOP party.  I mean, there's just this deep bench there. And do you  think it's going to help the party to have that many contenders?  </p><p>COLWIN: He is so polarized. Well, it's certainly not helpful that  you have  all these individuals that are on the platform.  And you got, you need,  especially the polls. It's at 24 percent now and I agree with you.  I think  it's going - we'll see what happens as it goes on. But frankly, he's got - Trump tremendous popularity and obviously he rates with the polls, but a  lot of individuals are looking to him and  saying you're not going to be  like these other candidates.  You're going to say what's on your mind.  Maybe that's what this world needs. </p><p>CORTES: I do think - listen, I will give him this. He clearly is striking a  nerve out there in this country, but I think that nerve is because of  sluggish growth. I think middle America feel squeezed and they should.  They're wages are not rising, they're cost are rising dramatically  particularly in terms of healthcare and education. So, there's a lot of  angst out there. And a guy like this who will forcefully say exactly what  he believes and appear to be kind of angry, I think that resonates. </p><p>SMITH: What? That he'll be the greatest jobs President that ever lived?  Alright. Well speaking of the deep bench by the way guys, we got to add  this in here. Ohio Governor John Kasich set to jump into the 2016 White  House race adding to the number of GOP candidates out there.  Blake Burman  has the latest in Washington for that. Blake?  </p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FOX BUSINESS:  Hi there Sandra. Good morning to you. John  Kasich will indeed make it official in Ohio later today.  Kasich is the  current Governor of that swing state and the former Congressmen.  In  between those two stints, he also worked at Lehman Brothers.  This would be  Kasich's second attempt at a White House run and he'll start with a lot of  ground to make up in a very crowded GOP field.  Kasich currently polls in  around one to two percent of support from Republicans. That puts him just  outside the top 10 for now.  The field for the moment appears to be set for  the GOP.  16 candidates with either political or business name recognition.  They'll be jockeying for separation as the debates begin in the upcoming  weeks and the first votes are cast in Iowa, which is a little more than six  months from now.  Sandra?</p><p>SMITH: Getting interesting. Alright.</p><p>BURMAN: Certainly is.</p><p>SMITH: Blake, thank you.  Alright, gold prices, they're getting interesting  as well.  Prices there searching for some direction after plunging to the  lowest level in five years on rate hike dears. Phil Flynn from the CME  Group, he's joining us by phone this morning, bright and early Phil. This  move in gold, everybody's watching it.  Where does it go from here?  </p><p>PHIL FLYNN, PRICES FUTURES GROUP: You know, that's the big question Sandra  and I agree with you.  A lot of this is fears about the Fed raising  interest rates, but this (INAUDIBLE) in gold may be the reason why the Fed  can't.  You know, a lot of people are asking questions whether this drop in  the gold market could really, you know, be like a cancer to the rest of the  commodities complex because it wasn't just gold they took a hit yesterday.   We were seeing industrial metals across the board under pressure with the  strong dollar.  If we're getting into a situation where this drop in the  gold market is signaling another round of deflation on the globe, it's  going to make it very difficult for the Fed to start raising rates if these  deflationary pressures are starting to rise.</p><p>SMITH: So Steve, let me -- Phil, you're going to stay with us for a second.   Steve, I look at gold prices at where they are right now. $1106 a troy  ounce. My feeling is that they test $1000 an ounce, but you're the expert.   Tell me.  </p><p>CORTES: Yes, well. I hope I'm an expert on something Sandra. But yes,  listen. I completely agree.  I think commodity deflation has been in a  trench force for years and I think it's going to continue to be. I agree  with Phil very much. I think that Fed is really put in a bind by this.  Although they want to talk about raising rates this year, I'm not sure that  they can. When you have commodities, broad commodities (INAUDIBLE) at  decade lows. You have - and it's across the board.  Sugar hit a six-year  low yesterday.  Gold - if it comes out of the ground basically, it's  increasingly worth less. Whether it's agricultural metals, energy.  So  we're seeing broad-based deflation. I believe it's primarily because of  China slowing and because of volatility in the Chinese market that is  broadening throughout the globe. But that is not the backdrop under which  the Fed probably gets aggressive raising rates.  </p><p>SMITH: You know and Phil, I keep talking about the U.S. dollar because  everything that Steve just mentioned is denominated in the greenback.  So,  you get that strengthening in the U.S. dollar as we anticipate that first  rate hike. You get a sell-off in commodities. That's a natural sort of  process that's we're seeing play out there. We had a Fed President in this  show yesterday say that that rate hike is likely coming by the end of this  year.  Where do you - what camp are you in as far as that first interest  rate hike at this point?  </p><p>FLYNN: Well prior to yesterday's drop in gold, I thought the Fed was going  to do it and it almost no matter what because they got through some of the  biggest crisis's. You know, concerns about Greece, they were sidetracked.   You know, the Chinese stock markets stabilized.  So, I thought they had a  chance to do it.  But then, of course, that Sunday night, that drop in the  commodities prices, that can change a complexion.  You know, if we don't  see stabilization in the commodities.  This is going to really put a monkey  wrench in the global economic recovery and if the Fed raises rates against  the advice of the IMF and we start to really bad deflationary cycle that  slows down the rest of the economy, (INAUDIBLE) make it very difficult for  the market to move forward. </p><p>SMITH: Alright. Good stuff Phil Flynn as gold sinks to yet more five-year  lows. Commodities struggling across the board.  Thank you for joining us  this morning. </p><p>Temperatures meanwhile rising across the country.  We're facing a heat  wave.  Maria Molina is in the Fox weather center with the details and the  latest on that. Maria?  </p><p>MARIA MOLINA, FOX WEATHER CENTER: It's hot outside.  </p><p>SMITH: Yes, I mean -</p><p>MOLINA: Good morning.  We're going to be seeing those temperatures climbing  yet again today and that's in place across parts of the South, the south  east and also after you  head up the east coast along the I95 corridor.  Take a look at some of these numbers today.  So, these are the actual  forecast temperatures. Forecast  to reach 99 in Dallas,  100 Del Rio,  farther east into the 90s as well across parts of the south east up unto  places like New York City. </p><p>But the problem is that when you factors in the humidity, it feels a lot  hotter than what the thermometer reads.  And this is what it's going to  feel like coming up later on this afternoon.  106 degrees in Montgomery and  also in Vicksberg and Atlanta's going to feel like 97.  108 degrees in  Wilmington and farther north in Washington D.C., it's going to feel like 97  degrees out there as we head out the door.  So, that's why we have heat  advisories in effect out here across the south and also into the Carolinas  and southeast Virginia. Excessive heat warnings in effect as well with  those heat index value forecast to climb into the triple digits.  Sandra?  </p><p>SMITH: Alright. Maria, thank you. Quick reaction from you guys. Hot weather  across the country. Steve, mean, I'm a Midwest girl.  I start to think  about our crops and the agricultural market in the United States when  temperatures like that.  But I mean, just in general, this is a game  changer.  Retail, everything affected by these temperatures.  </p><p>CORTES: You know. It's interesting. After a couple of really harsh winters  and by the way, companies got very used to blaming poor results during the  winter on bad weather in the winter. It'll be interesting to see if they  try to do that now in the summer.</p><p>SMITH: Exactly.  </p><p>CORTES:  I tend to think that blame it on the rain was a really bad song by  Milli Vanilli. It was a bad excuse for economics.  But well see, but yes,  you know, obviously - maybe Al Gore was on to something.  It's been pretty  darn hot lately. Manhattan yesterday, I wondered if I was in Manhattan or  if I was in Mecca, Saudi Arabia because it was near 100 degrees intense  humidity.  Clearly it's happening all over the country.</p><p>COLWIN: But intense weather drives individuals out of this weather in into  the stores.  I mean - represent federated stores and they love this weather  because the consumers are going in. They're going into shop. They're doing  this to getting out of the hot weather.  </p><p>SMITH: I can already see the climate change conversations all over the  general, the media, all over the different channels.  I mean, this is the  hottest summer they're saying on record.   I mean, Mercedes, there are  going to be big political talking points on that. </p><p>COLWIN: Oh no. undoubtedly.</p><p>SMITH: Accurate or not. Alright, well the NASDAQ notching it's third record  close-in-a-row.  Is this a sign that they could be approaching another tech  bubble?  We'll discuss that next and take a look at some of these other  headlines that we're watching this morning in \"The Wall Street Journal\".  Fed tells big banks to shrink, Toshiba's CEO felled by accounting scandal  and shooting highlights online gun sales.</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING: \"IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT\" - BILLY JOEL)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>SMITH: A fresh record for the NASDAQ this morning.  The tech-heavy index  closing yesterday at a record for third session-in-a-row sparking debates  about whether we're approaching bubble territory.  I should note that  NASDAQ futures are the lone winner this morning pointing to another record  on the open on Wall Street this morning.  Here's what the St.  Louis  Federal Reserve President James Bowler exclusively told our own Peter  Barnes yesterday.  </p><p>(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>(INTERVIEW WITH ST. LOUIS FED RESERVE PRESIDENT PETER BARNES) </p><p>(END AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>SMITH: Hmnn. This is just as Apple, Microsoft, Yahoo! are gearing up to  report results after the bell today.  Steve, do you think that we have a  tech bubble in our hand and should a Federal Reserve President be talking  about the stock market like that?  </p><p>CORTES: Well, let me answer the second first. No, they should not be. And  by the way, the Fed's record on prognostication has been pretty terrible is  go all the way back down greenspan irrational exuberance. That was a great  time to buy. Janet Yellen a year ago said more or less the same thing about  biotechs. She got sectors specific, which I though was pretty strange.  Biotech has soared ever since then. So, their forecasting ability is poor  generally, specially when it come to stocks. Are we in a tech bubble? No, I  don't believe so. But is it frothy? Yes. I absolutely think so. It's been  quite a run.  My problem -</p><p>SMITH: What's the frothy based on? </p><p>CORTES: Because is too narrow.  My problem with the market is it's relying  far too much on just a few names. So, names like Facebook, Netflix, Google  are absolutely soaring right now.  But Apple, which is going to report and  by the way, I like Apple.  I think it's relatively cheap. Apple, and this  is very unusual, is not keeping pace with technology overall.  Normally,  Apple is the driver of the bus, is leading the tech party whether it's up  or down. The fact that the general is not leading the army here, Apple in  front of tech worries me that things are getting frothy, but is it a  bubble, no.</p><p>A bubble is the year 2000 when grandma owned the globe.com and pets.com and  multi-billion-dollar valuations on companies that didn't make money. We're  not there, we're not at that kind of leverage. But, is it a dangerous spot?  Yes, I think so. Is it a spot to put new money to work? I do not believe  that, no. </p><p>SMITH: Interesting. So, Mercedes, from a consumer standpoint, I don't know.  You look around, you  walk around New York City and you feel like the  market is saturated with Apple products.  You know, you wonder do they have  any tools left in the tool chest there.   I mean, can they continue on this  sort of pace?  I mean, are we going to rush out to buy the next Apple  product?  </p><p>COLWIN: It's amazing because certainly with the Iphone watch, people were  just rushing to get - to purchase that and I think there's still that  traction. People still looking for a technology.  But, there are also a lot  of individuals, especially the newer little tech companies.  A lot of the  start-up tech companies. They are inspired by these big, by the big tech  companies. They're saying to themselves well, look at how much market share  they have. We can take a slice of - even if we just take one percent of  that market share.  So, we see a lot of these little tech companies come a  long and a lot of consumers look to them for the more interesting products  out there.</p><p>SMITH: So Steve, Apple's at $132 a share.  You would say don't require it  at these levels, but also don't sell it.  </p><p>CORTES: Yes, I would say. I would say this, I have no idea what they're  going to do on earnings, but if it gets hit on earnings, I'd get very  interested then because by most traditional metrics, even though this is a  massively valued company in terms of its market value. By most market  metrics, it's actually relatively cheap for a company that has this kind of  growth.  And so, and I think listen, their ability to innovate and I was a  doubter once Steve Jobs had to step down.  I was a doubter that necessarily  new management take the baton and run and it sure seems they have.  I know  this is just anecdotal, but in my house, my wife and I have four kids.   There were more apple products in our house than I think there are in an  Apple store.  So, I see it personally. I see it hands on how much kids  gravitate to this stuff and user-friendly nature of it.  And so, this is a  pretty special company, but tech overall I think it's a time to be  cautious.  </p><p>SMITH: Alright. Well don't forget to tune in today at 4:00 p.m.  Eastern on  \"After the battle\".  Apple Chiptole, Microsoft, Yahoo!, all will be  reporting results.

While stocks are watched this morning, Paypal coming off  it's first trading day after the Ebay spin-off.  Cheryl Casone is here that  and other top stories.  Good morning Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS: Hey, good morning Sandra. Good morning  everybody. Well the stock rising nearly six percent on the day Monday. It  had jumped some 11 percent at one point in mid day trading. Take a look at  what it's doing this morning, pointing to a little bit of a higher open  even today, PYPL is the ticker.  Already more than half a dozen research  shops has a buy rating on this stock. And again, this stock should likely  open higher at 9:30 a.m. Eastern time.  </p><p>Business booming for the NFL. Each team receiving $226.4 million dollars  last year as part national revenue sharing.  Most of the money comes from  the league's television deals and the price tag was revealed when the Green  Bay Packers released it's shares part of the team's earnings report.  \\</p><p>And finally, this video of South Carolina's Director of Public Safety,  Leroy Smith going viral after Smith helped a white man wearing a racist T- shirt to the shade at the top of the statehouse steps on Saturday.   Tensions were high in Charleston as supporters of the Ku Klux Klan and the  Black Panthers clashed outside of the South Carolina capital.  Sandra,  Director Smith hopes this video going to be a catalyst for people to work  towards overcoming hate and violence. And social media has been called one  of the most powerful acts of kindness that you could witness.  </p><p>And it's interesting that the videos go viral because it really shows you  the pulse of what's happening out in the nation and how people are really  talking about race and very emotional about it right now.  </p><p>SMITH: Mercedes, what do you make of this?</p><p>COLWIN: I mean. I think it's just absolutely beautiful, especially because  racial tensions are so high.  To that, there's no wonder that it's gone  viral.  There's people hoping. They want something.  They want a change.  </p><p>CASONE: Well this is over the Confederate flag, by the way, as well. They  we're pulling down the Confederate flag at that statehouse.  And that's  where this whole event happened.  You know, all these states now across the  country are having to face the issue.  </p><p>SMITH: Amazing story.  </p><p>CORTES: You know I have to say, this kindness by a African-American police  officer for someone who clearly hate in his heart for him and to respond to  that hate with love and with the kindness of his heart is really an  inspiring act. I think it is emblematic though of what is going on in  broader society.  We're not a racist society.  We're society that elected a  black President twice. If anything, race relations were getting much  better. By the way,.  I worry that our President is harming race relations.   For instance, this race database that's been unveiled this week. That's  identity politics.  That divides people rather than unites.  So I think  that in fact, though the American people are far more like that African- American police officer rather than that racist with the terrible T-shirt  on.  </p><p>CASONE: That's a good point. Sandra and I yesterday  were so surprised  yesterday about Martin O'Malley, you know? I remember him (INAUDIBLE) Well  why? What did he say that was so wrong?  Why are people so upset about  that. And that the question is have we gone too far?  </p><p>SMITH: You said it best. Tensions and emotions are running high on this  subject right now in this country. Has been for quite some time. Alright  guys. Thank you much and thank you, Cheryl. We'll see you again in just a  little bit. Meanwhile, dozens dead after a terror attack in Turkey near the  Syrian border.

The National Center for  Weight and Wellness as the total cost of obesity is about $305 billion  annually.</p><p>Well, breaking this morning, a Turkish town on the border of Syria was the  scene of a bloody attack that claims the lives of 31 people and left at  least 100 more wounded yesterday.  The bombing is believed to have been a  suicide attack carried out by an ISIS militant.  And my next guest says  this ISIS attack on Turkey was only a matter of time.  Joining me now is  FOX News National Security Analyst Katie McFarland.  Good morning for you  Katie.</p><p>KATIE MCFARLAND, FOX NEWS NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST:  Good morning.</p><p>SMITH:  Thank you for being here bright and early.  Unfortunately, some  horrible news here, but now Turkey?</p><p>MCFARLAND:  Yeah.  And it's only a matter of time.  Why?  For a couple of  reasons.  One, ISIS to be considered the vanguard movement of radical Islam  has to keep moving.  It can't just consolidate its gains.  It's got to keep  growing.  So you've seen it in Afghanistan, you've seen attacks in Northern  Africa, now you're seeing Turkey.  So it had to expand over the border.</p><p>When I've met with the president of Iraq last year, and he said, you know,  they had feel the Islamic State, ISIS feels they have been chosen by Allah  to rule the world.  So in mere minds they've got to keep expanding.  Number  two, this is how they do it.  They start with suicide bombers, they get  into an area, they then recruit locally, they send in Jihadi fighters, then  they start an insurgency with the idea that they're going to then  eventually claim territory and join it up with the Islamic State.</p><p>But the reason I figure that it was going to be Turkey, rather than other  places sooner or later, Turkey has a very poorest border.  We have seen,  you know, the stories of all the foreign fighters that were coming from...</p><p>SMITH:  Yup.</p><p>MCFARLAND:  ... you know, hundreds of countries.  They were going to fight  with ISIS.  They were coming through that Turkish border, that same place  where the attack was.  Similarly, they have come out the ISIS fighters and  refugees have come out of that region through Turkey then expand into  Greece and to Europe.  In the refugee pact, it's been faltered (ph) with  Jihadists...</p><p>SMITH:  So you said that this was sort of expected...</p><p>MCFARLAND:  Yeah.</p><p>SMITH:  ... but now that it happened, how much of a game changer is this?</p><p>MCFARLAND:  Now, we have to see what Turkey does.  Is Turkey going to put  up the fight?  They have famously last year in the Battle for Kobane, which  is the big city near there on the other side of the Turkish border, the  ISIS took Turkish tanks sat on the Turkish border and they watched as ISIS  came in, took the town, slaughtered the Kurdish population there.  So will  Turkey join the battle?  Will the Turkey join the battle in Syria and Iraq  that, you know, the Islamic State?  Or will Turkeys just say I'm going to  defend our borders?  Will Turkey tighten up its borders?  And then the  other question is what role does NATO play?  You know, where are the NATO  alliance?  Turkey is a NATO ally. Will they take this as an attack against  Turkey and call for help from the NATO ally?</p><p>SMITH:  We're always talking about how ISIS is staying so powerful.</p><p>MCFARLAND:  Yeah.</p><p>SMITH:  I mean, what is the latest on the amount of money that they have  been able to raise or make, I should say, on the black market with oil?   And I mean, what kind of money are they dealing with today?  Are they still  able to pull in as much as they were before?</p><p>MCFARLAND:  Yeah.</p><p>SMITH:  Are they're still strengthening in such large numbers?</p><p>MCFARLAND:  The interesting thing is to save money for ISIS came probably  from some wealthy Gulf Arab families, not countries families, and that's  what started them.</p><p>When my experience with Iraq has been what happened at the end of the Iraq  war was the Saddam Hussein fighters, (inaudible) in the Iraqi army married  up with these radical Islamic extremists and that's what form the core of  ISIS.  So they received money from the Gulf Arabs, but when they started  taking territory they eluded a lot of the antiquities and they sold these  on the open market.  The next thing was they then got ahold of oil  refineries and then they sold those.</p><p>SMITH:  And there's always the money angle that you're watching on there.</p><p>STEVE CORTES, VERACRUZ LLC FOUNDER:  No.  And I do think there's a business  angle of this, not to sound callous because it's a real human tragedy, but  there is a business angle and I think it's United States defense firms.  We  live in an incredibly dangerous world.  There is bipartisan agreement.  The  Democrats (inaudible) of defense spending just about as much as Republicans  do, which isn't the norm.  There's been a lot of M&amp;A and deals in the  space.  Lockheed Martin's stock that's really taken off in the last few  weeks.  So I think in a dangerous world as an investor, the defense sector  remains very, very attractive.</p><p>SMITH:  And then there's obviously, Mercedes, the questions about U.S.  involvement and cooperation with Turkey on this.</p><p>MERCEDES COLWIN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Oh no, undoubtedly.  So we'll have  to see how it sort of plays out, but this is certainly something to watch  and we'll see how (inaudible).</p><p>SMITH:  All right.  Katie McFarland...</p><p>MCFARLAND:  Thank you San (ph).  Thank you.</p><p>SMITH:  ... thank you for joining us this morning on that.</p><p>And 3D piracy has become a big issue in Hollywood.  Nicole Petallides is  here with that story.  Good morning Nicole.</p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX AM CO-HOST:  Good morning Sandra.  This is a  business story, a text story, the rise of 3D printers is a problem for  Hollywood.  The printers allow anyone who owns them to build products such  as the Stormtrooper gun (ph) from Star Wars, and their own without even  buying a toy.  They can make it on their own doing this would actually lose  money from movie studios who make these products to get a profit of course.   It could also force the studios to charge less for the items, so they can  be more attractive to the consumers.</p><p>So, this is a problem that is very similar to music piracy that was around  in the early 2000s which forced the music industry to change.  And so what  we're watching, we've seen piracy.  We've seen it with the records, right,  and music when the (inaudible) of the artist come out with new music.   We've seen illegally copied movies.  And now, you talk about the products  and you know so well the products, that's how these they make so much money  off of these, Hasbro for example, even yesterday talked about the Star Wars  products, the X-Men products just to name a few.  So your thoughts, I mean,  3D printing is all the way.</p><p>SMITH:  So Mercedes, it sounds like a legal question to me.</p><p>COLWIN:  Oh yeah.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SMITH:  What can the movie studios do to stop this?</p><p>COLWIN:  Well, this is great, because what they can do is first, they're  going to start sending up these letters.  They have to discover who is  actually printing these letters, so if they're selling.  Who knows if  they're printing it and they're creating these products, if they're selling  it, send out those letters, cease and desist letters.  They lawyer up  immediately.  They bring in the court system, and they said, \"Of course, we  are losing so much money.\"</p><p>And by the way, because it's immediate -- there's an immediate loss, you  can go in for temporary restraining order, with the court say, \"You  have(ph) to stop this immediately,\" and that's when the penalties step in.   And then, of course, you got the D.A.'s office, again, that's how it's  stopped with an answer.  Get the prosecutors involved, tell them that they  are doing this illegally, get prosecutors to start doing it and get one  with those cases and that's how will do it.</p><p>CORTES:  Right.  And that's a great legal point and I don't doubt that all  of the studios will be really effective but I will say on a business angle,  a technology angle, 3D printing to me is just transformative technology.   And I think long term because what people do in their home is going to be  very hard to enforce, right, to interdict, they are printing something in  their house.  And I think the 3D printing all of the stocks have been  miserably, and I'm not saying investing in necessarily right now.</p><p>COLWIN:  Right.</p><p>SMITH:  So you bring that up...</p><p>PETALLIDES:  Right.</p><p>SMITH:  That's an interesting point because everybody told us over the past  couple of years that 3D printing was the wave of the future...</p><p>COLWIN:  Right.</p><p>SMITH:  ... everyone is going to be doing it, everyone is going to have  these in their homes and they're going to be printing everything from...</p><p>PETALLIDES:  I don't know.  I don't know.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>COLWIN:  I don't know.</p><p>SMITH:  Now, literally, I mean, I remember on Varney's show we had 3D  printers coming in and making shoes...</p><p>CORTES:  Right.</p><p>COLWIN:  Yeah.</p><p>SMITH:  But I don't have one in my house.  Do you guys have a 3D printer in  your house?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  No.</p><p>CORTES:  Right.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Yeah.</p><p>SMITH:  It just the story never really came to fruition.</p><p>CORTES:  But we often get excited in a market.  We often get excited about  technology before it's a reality.  If for instance, we talked really about  the tech bubble.  The tech bubble in the year 2000, we got far too  excited...</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Right.</p><p>CORTES:  ... too early about the internet.  But that doesn't mean that the  internet didn't become transformative...</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  That's true.  That's true.</p><p>CORTES:  ... and there are companies that made it like Google became  absolute guerrillas.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PETALLIDES:  In 3D, one last thing, I will tell you one last thing.  Some  of the movie studios are actually embracing those 3D printing enthusiasts  and sending them codes so they can actually make something.  And so hope --  maybe that -- maybe the other way to go with it instead of trying to  prosecute and figure out who conceptualize this, who printed it, who, you  know, wrote the code.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Right.</p><p>PETALLIDES:  Maybe it's the other way around in trying actually to get it  out there yourself and sell those code files and make some money.  Yeah.</p><p>SMITH:  I should say that to be sure here is that at a commercial level,  the 3D printers are being used...</p><p>CORTES:  Right.</p><p>SMITH:  ... much more than I think that what we're seeing at the consumer  level...</p><p>CORTES:  Right.</p><p>SMITH:  ... for now at least.</p><p>All right, Nicole, thank you.</p><p>PETALLIDES:  All right.</p><p>SMITH:  All right, don't forget to start your day with Nicole, Lauren  Simonetti, and me on FBN:AM, every morning at 5:00 a.m.  Catch us right  here on the Fox Business Network.  We're here bright and early get you  ready for your day.</p><p>Meanwhile, coming up, startling new numbers about the class of 2015 and the  major issue that could follow them for the rest of their lives.

By 2017, listen to this,  the retailer will overtake Macy's Department Store, the top retailer in the  U.S.  That's according to our report released by Cowen and Company  yesterday.  Amazon is offering brands like Gucci, Kate Spade and Levis but  doesn't have to pay overhead costs for retail stores.</p><p>All right, Cowen's upgraded Amazon to outperform and forecast the company's  growth merchandize value in apparel and accessories to grow to over $27  billion in 2017 that would top Macy's.</p><p>Steve, we had another great report on Amazon's potential.  Are you in  agreement here?  Is the environment's still good for Amazon?</p><p>CORTES:  Well, yes and no.  I'm in agreement, yes, because I think Amazon  is an incredible company and I think they have created barriers to entry  because of how much they have spent on technology, on infrastructure that  it's very, very difficult to become a competitor to Amazon.</p><p>Now, I wish the company cared more about making money.  That bothers me as  an investor.  But I will disagree with the thesis that it's going to become  such an apparel powerhouse.  Because I think, apparel is the one spot where  online commerce is pretty challenged.  I would tell you personally, I  certainly don't want to buy at least expensive clothes, you know, to buy  sort of the commodity, apparel item is fine.  But to buy expensive clothes  online, if you can't feel it, touched or tried on, I think there going to  be challenge there.  I love the company but I don't think this is the  reasons to love this.</p><p>SMITH:  You clearly are not shopping online then, because...</p><p>COLWIN:  Yes</p><p>SMITH:  ... everybody is buying clothes online now.</p><p>COLWIN:  Exactly.</p><p>SMITH:  I mean, people don't want to go into the stores.  They don't want  to try clothes on.  And when Amazon or Zappos and all these, you know,  delivery sites, when they make it so easy to return...</p><p>COLWIN:  That's it.</p><p>SMITH:  ... that's really key.</p><p>COLWIN:  That's a key to it.  It's just the return policy.  If you give me  a box where I can ship it back or give me a label I can ship it back,  great, I'm going to purchase from you.  So gone are the days since you're  going to go in into those fitting rooms, into the stores where there's  crowds and there's all sorts of issues that when you actually step into  mall, they don't want that.  They don't want the hassle.  It's so much  easier to do it online.</p><p>SMITH:  Steve, your wife must do all the shopping?</p><p>COLWIN:  Yeah.</p><p>CORTES:  Yeah, that's true.  Right.</p><p>COLWIN:  People don't need the Brooks Brothers.</p><p>SMITH:  Oh men, Amazon's shares, by the way, of 57 percent this year alone.   So that climb continues.</p><p>New details emerging about the dark past of the Tennessee gunman who killed  five American servicemen.  Cheryl Casone is here with the latest headlines  on that story for us this morning, Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, NEWS ANCHOR:  Hey, good morning Sandra.  You have a gunman  behind that Chattanooga terror attack reportedly wrote about becoming a  martyr.  Reports said that Mohammad Abdulazeez also wrote about committing  suicide after he lost a job two years ago because of drug abuse.  The 24- year-old opened fire at two military facilities on Thursday killing four  marines and a sailor before he was killed by police.</p><p>A massive corporate scandal in Japan, Toshiba's CEO has resigned after  investigators linked him to an accounting scandal.  The probe (ph) found  the electronics giant overstated profits by more than $1.2 billion over  seven years.</p><p>And finally, new outrage over the staggering amount of student loan debt in  America.  The New York feds says American students are in debt to the tune  of $1.2 trillion.  That equals $35,000 for every student who graduated this  year of to $2,000 from last year.</p><p>OK, Sandra, we know the Class 2015 are going to be the most indebted class  at American history.  And it's not just them that are getting kind of the  screws frankly, it's their parents because these kids are getting out of  school, they're so saddled with debt, they're not making any money, the  wages are down and they can't move out of the house.  And then that parent  is now dealing with trying to get the kid out of the house and their  elderly parents are coming in.  It's a crisis.</p><p>SMITH:  And it's affecting, Cheryl, every aspects of the economy, Steve.  I  mean, if they're coming out of a school with this much debt, then they're  not buying homes...</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Right.</p><p>SMITH:  ... they're choosing to get...</p><p>CORTES:  Right.</p><p>SMITH:  ... married much later, they're not buying cars.  That whole  economic cycle that has been over the past many decades is no longer...</p><p>CORTES:  Right.  This is -- listen, this is the sad unintended consequences  of government policy, right?  This is central planning, I think, at its  absolute worst.  When the government gets involved in any business or  service, prices go up and the quality of that service goes down.  That is  certainly happened in terms of college.</p><p>So the price has skyrocketed, people borrow more and more but the degree  they earn is generally worth less and less.  So this is really a problem.   I mean, this is -- when I graduated college, I did not have any money, I  had to go live at home for a couple of months, I could not wait to get...</p><p>SMITH:  Right.</p><p>CORTES:  I was sleeping in the bunk bed that I grew up in as a 22-year-old  male.</p><p>CASONE:  So, I guess, your stand is we should not forgive student loan debt  in anyway.  She had (ph) perform...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SMITH:  I mean, Mercedes, that's what they're talking about, is the  government talks about just wiping out the student loan debt.</p><p>COLWIN:  Right.</p><p>SMITH:  Are they probably making the situation even worst than worst?</p><p>COLWIN:  Oh, undoubtedly, because who's going to pay the -- ultimately, all  of us is taxpayers.  I mean, what are you doing?  It's such a...</p><p>CORTES:  And the point is...</p><p>COLWIN:  And it is a tragedy to these kids.  You're talking about $60,000 a  year tuition.  You're talking about the highest...</p><p>SMITH:  Yeah.</p><p>COLWIN:  ... number of individuals that are unemployed.  These kids coming  out of graduates out of schools are 40 to 50 percent unemployed.  You don't  hear about that but this is the truth.  They can't get job.</p><p>SMITH:  All right.  Well, thank you for that enlightening story this  morning, Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE:  Of course.</p><p>SMITH:  Thank you for brightening our 6:00 a.m. hour.</p><p>CASONE:  Yeah.</p><p>SMITH:  A new pullout, morning diet programs like Weight Watchers and Jenny  Craig won't work for the majority of their obese clients trying to reach  normal weight.  We've got the details, the latest study on that next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>SMITH:  A new study published in the American Journal of Public Health  suggests that most obese Americans who do not get some kind of surgery will  never -- (inaudible) for us for Dagen.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS:  This is a national health crisis and it's  also a financial crisis...</p><p>SMITH:  Yeah.</p><p>CDOWELL:  ... we should point out.  This is a study again and published  according to -- we're talking about the body mass index in American Journal  of Public Health, that the probability of obese people reaching normal  weight is less than 1 percent.  And here, the numbers 1 in 210 obese men  have a probability of reaching a normal weight, this is without any kind of  surgery, 1 in 124 obese women.</p><p>You get a morbid obesity which is an even larger body mass index.  Those  odds go down to 1 in 1,290 men and 1 in 677 women.  So it becomes nearly  impossible to get down to a normal weight once you become obese or morbidly  obese.  And you want to talk about the cost, more than 305 billion in  direct and indirect cost of obesities annually in terms of lost  productivity, the increased health care cost.</p><p>And people complain about the government cracking down trying to change  what we eat and how we eat, calorie contents on menus, and the like, but  there is going to be a whole lot more of that.  You have more government in  your health care and then you have a population that is increasingly  overweight and will probably stay that way.  You will have a government  that essentially tells you what to eat.</p><p>SMITH:  I mean, it's crazy...</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Because if the government is funding your health care and your  health care costs are related to obesity, it becomes the government's  problem.  We are asking for it as a country unless we get the...</p><p>CORTES:  They -- yeah.

But according to a new \"Washington Post-Abc News\" poll, he still holds 24 percent of Republican support.</p><p/><p>The largest lead recorded by any GOP candidate this year, although this number is strong, it must be noted that the poll was finalized before coverage of his comments about Senator McCain went widespread.</p><p/><p>But the headlines don't stop there, \"The Des Moines Register\", Iowa's largest newspaper is now calling on Trump to drop out of the 2016 race, saying \"Trump should pull the plug on his bloviating sideshow.\"</p><p/><p>Mike, some pretty strong words from the key primary state newspaper --</p><p/><p>MIKE MURPHY, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, ROSECLIFF CAPITAL: Absolutely --</p><p/><p>SMITH: This morning --</p><p/><p>MURPHY: Yes, and you know, we talked about a month ago, saying that I didn't believe that Trump would really be a true contender in this race.</p><p/><p>But now fast forward roughly 30 days, he is leading by far in the polls, and I think the longer he stays there -- he released his financials.</p><p/><p>And one thing about him, he is way better than anyone else in the race in getting publicity and getting himself on Bill O'Reilly's show and getting a big following on Twitter.</p><p/><p>So, I think the longer Trump stays in this race, the worse it is for the Governor Walkers and the Governor Bushs in the race.</p><p/><p>SMITH: But I mean, all the other Republican candidates are having to answer, Dagen, as we just -- we did it to Governor Pataki, you know, they're having to respond to all the things that <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>is saying right now including his criticism of Senator McCain.</p><p/><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS: Right, the new \"New Yorker\" cover portrays him as -- this is even before him attacking John McCain as doing a giant belly-flop in the swimming pool and all other Republican candidates have been as you've been sent to the sides of the poll.</p><p/><p>But he's gotten down the nasty name-calling that's completely unnecessary.

All right, ISIS on the rise across the Turkish region, a suicide bombing of the border -- on the border, I should say, of Syria, claiming the lives of 31 people yesterday.</p><p/><p>Joining us now is Gillian Turner, <person><nameText>Fox News </nameText></person>contributor and former White House National Security Council member. Gillian, good morning --</p><p/><p>GILLIAN TURNER, FORMER MEMBER, WHITE HOUSE NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL: Good morning --</p><p/><p>SMITH: Thank you for being here this morning. What do you make of the latest on this attack in Turkey?</p><p/><p>TURNER: Well, in order to understand the significance of this attack, you really have to understand the strategic symbolism that the town of Kobani has in the broader fight against ISIS.</p><p/><p>This attack was against a rally to rebuild the town of Kobani which was really decimated over four-month long period of the battle between Syrian Kurds and ISIS fighters last year.</p><p/><p>For a long time, this town was the last stronghold of the U.S.-led coalition on the border region between Turkey and Syria. So, it's a lot of symbolism here.</p><p/><p>SMITH: And we were talking to K.T. McFarland last hour, sort of references it as a game changer now that we've had this happen in Turkey.</p><p/><p>TURNER: Absolutely, that's exactly right. The border region between the two countries eight months ago was entirely controlled by ISIS.</p><p/><p>It's now -- its presence there has been gradually reduced in the last eight months, which is one of the only good news stories to come out of the U.S. fight against ISIS, because as we know, they're really on the rise in the region.</p><p/><p>SMITH: And as far as the fight with ISIS continues, it's -- you don't have to look far to see a headline that ISIS continues to gain strength and power and money.</p><p/><p>Where do you see the overall fight right now as far as combating ISIS as they do continue to gain power and quite frankly continue to gain territory?</p><p/><p>TURNER: Well, they're on the rise across Iraq and Syria in spite of some now five thousand airstrikes led by the United States against them.</p><p/><p>They can currently control a majority of Syria as well as large sways of Iraq, including Mosul which they've now held for over a year.</p><p/><p>As you mentioned, they've got hundreds of millions of dollars in the bank, tens of thousands of recruits and you know, just a couple of weeks ago, celebrated their one-year anniversary.</p><p/><p>MURPHY: So, Gillian, in that one year, you know, they've gone from really something in after-thought, something that no one really knew about to really taking all the headlines away from al Qaeda.</p><p/><p>And they're really the main terrorist organization out there right now. It seems like you talk about five thousand airstrikes, but it's just not enough.</p><p/><p>What we're doing -- if it's not stopping them, it's not slowing them down, it's not hurting them.</p><p/><p>And the longer they exist, the more powerful they get just as a fact. So, what do we do? How do -- is it just putting more troops on the ground, is that the simple answer? How do we stop them?</p><p/><p>TURNER: There isn't a simply answer as much as we would all like there to be one, I don't think it's as easier as saying boots on the ground, no boots on the ground, diplomacy, no diplomacy.</p><p/><p>What we really have to fight here in addition to the security situation is the powerful hold that radical Islamic ideology has really had across the region.</p><p/><p>It's now expanding across the globe, ISIS recruits are increasing in multiples at this point, you know, when they started a year ago, not very many.</p><p/><p>Now we have reports of up to thirty thousand actively fighting recruits, plus up to a hundred thousand more in the kind of close-hold pool.</p><p/><p>So, this is an organization that's really increasing exponentially, so the sooner we come up with a really good plan, the better.</p><p/><p>SMITH: All right, Gillian Turner on the latest deadly attack in Turkey, thank you.</p><p/><p>TURNER: Thanks.</p><p/><p>SMITH: All right, coming up, gold prices continue to fall after plunging to their lowest level in five years on rate-hike fears.</p><p/><p>And take a look at some of the other big headlines that we're watching for you on the \"Wall Street Journal\" this morning.</p><p/><p>Fed tells big banks to shrink, Toshiba CEO fouled by accounting scandal, Chattanooga shooting and the highlight online gun sales.</p><p/><p>And we're also watching for you this morning, a lot of other breaking news and headlines, keep it right there on Fox Business.</p><p/><p>(MUSIC)</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>SMITH: All right, gold prices edging lower this morning after plunging to their lowest level in five years on rate hike fears. Phil Flynn is watching this selloff and following every move of the CME Group in Chicago.</p><p/><p>Phil, it looks like it's holding a $1,100 an ounce right now, but broadly - -</p><p/><p>PHIL FLYNN, CHICAGO MERCANTILE EXCHANGE GROUP: Yes --</p><p/><p>SMITH: Speaking, what is the selloff in gold or commodities in general, what is it telling us?</p><p/><p>FLYNN: I think that's what the market is trying to decide right now. You know, we're starting to call at the midnight massacre of gold.</p><p/><p>And we saw that huge $2.5 billion sell order come in the middle of the night, driving down gold, raising bigger questions about the global economy.</p><p/><p>I think the sell-off in gold because it came along with a lot of the other industrial metals with the oil, price of oil that they could be raising.</p><p/><p>It could be like the canary in the coal mine raising larger concerns about the global economy and economic growth. And now the market is trying to stabilize to see if those fears are justified or overplayed.</p><p/><p>FLYNN: Yes, and when you look at the selloff happening and commodities across the globe, you wonder what a big influence is U.S. dollar situation is going to be.</p><p/><p>We were just talking about real estate, Phil, I mean, you've got a stronger U.S. dollar, all that foreign investment, where does it go?</p><p/><p>FLYNN: Well, a lot of that is, of course, obviously has been coming to the United States and we've seen that over the last couple of years.</p><p/><p>We've seen a lot of Chinese money, throwing money into the United States, trying to get away from the Chinese stock market.</p><p/><p>Obviously, as those interest rates start to go up and the stronger dollar goes up, that could slow a little bit. So obviously, that's a concern with the marketplace right now.</p><p/><p>But I think if you look at what we're seeing throughout a lot of the commodity complex, you know actually, commodities last quarter were doing pretty good.</p><p/><p>I mean look at oil demand for example, you know, we saw oil demand in the first half of the year rise by 1.6 million barrels. That's like twice as fast that we've seen over the last four years.</p><p/><p>So, there are a lot of signs that the stimulus and other parts of the globe was actually starting to stimulate demand for --</p><p/><p>MCDOWELL: Yes --</p><p/><p>FLYNN: Its commodities --</p><p/><p>MCDOWELL: And --</p><p/><p>FLYNN: But everything changed after Greece and China and after Sunday night.</p><p/><p>SMITH: And the bold calls, Mike, are already out there for gold did not only sell off below a $1,000 an ounce, but saw 800, 600 bucks this morning.</p><p/><p>I mean, where is it -- where is it going --</p><p/><p>MURPHY: Yes --</p><p/><p>SMITH: From here?</p><p/><p>MURPHY: A lot of people are piling on gold right now, but you talk about support of 1,100, I think 1,000 is going to be the key level.</p><p/><p>And if it will go down, I think in test 1,000 as it breaks through that, it could go down to the 950, to the 900 level.</p><p/><p>But I think it's not just gold, it's the entire commodity space that's getting hit because we're seeing a lot of the global fears of the Greece and the China dissipating.</p><p/><p>But the growth, the global growth isn't very strong, so a lot of --</p><p/><p>SMITH: Yes --</p><p/><p>MURPHY: People calling on less demand out there --</p><p/><p>MCDOWELL: Maybe if you don't bet on gold, if you're betting on growth, I mean worry about down draft in copper or oil which has economic uses.</p><p/><p>MURPHY: Great point.</p><p/><p>MCDOWELL: But with gold, just remember if you're buying gold -- like tradeable gold, you're betting against Goldman Sachs, you're not smarter than Goldman Sachs, you're on the wrong side of a trade --</p><p/><p>MURPHY: But I think --</p><p/><p>MCDOWELL: It is a zero-sum game.</p><p/><p>MURPHY: I think people realize now that there's not too many -- why would you buy gold? Right now what's --</p><p/><p>SMITH: Right --</p><p/><p>MURPHY: The point to go out --</p><p/><p>MCDOWELL: And by the way --</p><p/><p>MURPHY: And invest in gold? --</p><p/><p>MCDOWELL: He did 2011, this down draft started in 2011 five years ago, it just continues now.</p><p/><p>SMITH: Right, if you're a contrarian on the U.S. dollar, you might buy gold.</p><p/><p>MURPHY: You might --</p><p/><p>SMITH: I'm just saying --</p><p/><p>MURPHY: But I think there's a lot of other ways to play it rather than --</p><p/><p>MCDOWELL: You're contrarian --</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>On the U.S. dollar, you buy other currencies, you buy bonds, denominated in other currencies, right?</p><p/><p>SMITH: All right, so, Flynn, I'll let you answer that question, then we have to go --</p><p/><p>FLYNN: Yes, well, bottom line is, you know, if you started to buy gold in 1999 when we had this commodity crash, it returned better than the stock market in nominal terms, up until a couple of years ago.</p><p/><p>And yes, we've had a major correction in gold. But I wouldn't throw, you know, gold totally out of your investment portfolio. You want to buy when there's blood in the streets, there's blood in the streets in the gold market.</p><p/><p>Probably time to add some to your commodity portfolio.</p><p/><p>SMITH: All right, so Flynn, thank you.

And that the president has -- as she -- well, she said it better than I did. Failed her and all of us.</p><p/><p>SMITH: I should -- and you know -- and you can't speak that stuff, I mean, she was actually very passionate, Dagen, you may disagree, I don't know, but --</p><p/><p>MCDOWELL: No --</p><p/><p>SMITH: She was very passionate about it and it came across and I think that's why --</p><p/><p>MCDOWELL: That would resonate with people --</p><p/><p>CASONE: Yes --</p><p/><p>MCDOWELL: In general. Whether you're talking about internet clips, whether you're talking about television or any kind of video is -- if it's comes from the heart and you mean it, and you speak your truth, and you're authentic, then people connect with that.</p><p/><p>SMITH: And Mike will be leaving now. Yes, all right, thank you Cheryl Casone --</p><p/><p>CASONE: Thank you --</p><p/><p>SMITH: All right, Chicago now home to the nation's highest sales tax, so we'll tell you how much it costs to shop in the Windy City and what the locals have to say about that, I may chime in my hometown, that's coming up next.</p><p/><p>CASONE: No!</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>SMITH: All right, don't let us catch you calling Chicago the second city anymore especially when it comes to sales taxes. And their all new you make it, they take it report.</p><p/><p>Jeff Flock is in the Windy City asking shoppers what they think about the city's new number one ranking. Jeff, I always tell New Yorkers they got it wrong when it comes to Chicago.</p><p/><p>It's the second city because it burned down the first time in the great Chicago fire and they had to rebuild it. New Yorkers always think that it's second to New York, false.</p><p/><p>JEFF FLOCK, FOX BUSINESS: I agree with you a 100 percent, this is the rejuvenation of Chicago. But as it's getting expensive to live here, maybe you're lucky here in New York at this point.</p><p/><p>You know where I am, don't you? Looks familiar, if it does, Oak Street in Chicago. Take a look at the numbers now, the Cook County board having passed an additional percentage of tax, sales tax, give Chicago the number one or at least it will on January 1st to 2016.</p><p/><p>Ten-point-two-five percent sales tax, worse than New York or maybe we should say, higher than New York, better than New York, better than L.A., better than Milwaukee.</p><p/><p>It's not the city itself that passed the increase, it was Cook County. If you take a look at the break down, there's a state sales tax, then there is the county sales tax which went up an additional percent and then of course the city itself has 2.25 percent sales tax as well.</p><p/><p>What does this mean for this city? Well, it means that actually some more money is going to go into the pension coffers. That's the reason the county passed the sales tax increase. They're trying to get their credit rating improved. But I'll tell you, if you take a look at the credit ratings of cities around the country, it is Chicago Detroit that are still in junk status. Other places like Seattle, Dallas, Denver, those guys are doing fine, but not so much here Sandra.</p><p/><p>SMITH: Unbelievable. Well, that's what happens when you're cities bankrupt, okay? Yes, Raise taxes. Jeff Fox, thank you.</p><p/><p>FOX: Hard to believe.</p><p/><p>SMITH: Alright.</p><p/><p>FOX: Thanks Sandra.</p><p/><p>SMITH: Dagen, this could have been a big impact on buyer behavior, but as we're seeing actually Chicago housing sales are doing quite well at the moment. A pocket of strength from the country.</p><p/><p>MCDOWELL: These taxes are regressive. Your higher sales tax, you have the cell phone tax went up not long ago. Higher property taxes. They hit the poor even harder than they do because it eats up more of a greater percentage of their income and what they take home. It's really shocking that the city's not in better financial shape. The fact they they've put in place all these revenue raisers. But - leave it to Robert Manual. I mean he got reelected didn't he?</p><p/><p>SMITH: Not the situation. When you look at the sales tax go to these lofty numbers I also worry about restaurant chains or just restaurants in general in the city. I mean, you're talking about asking tourists to come into the city and they're paying substantially more than they had expected over were a year ago.</p><p/><p>MIKE MURPHY, ROSECLIFF FINANCIAL: Absolutely. So you know, I understand why this tax hike went through, but to say that there's strength in the real estate market today is one thing. But what's going to happen after this is out there for six months or 12 months. Are you going to see restaurant chains, stores leaving. Are you going to see the values of homes decreasing. So, I think it's kind of a risky bet they're taking. I agree they had to do something because you can't run a city bankrupt or no money -</p><p/><p>SMITH: That's the business.</p><p/><p>MURPHY: I think it is.</p><p/><p>MCDOWELL: And by the way, the second city in the minds of New York is Los Angeles.</p><p/><p>SMITH: Whatever.</p><p/><p>MCDOWELL: And then San Fran and then Boston.</p><p/><p>SMITH: Whatever.</p><p/><p>MCDOWELL: Chicago's is like fifth, maybe six behind Atlanta.</p><p/><p>SMITH: As a New Yorker you probably really didn't even understand -</p><p/><p>MCDOWELL: I am not a New Yorker!</p><p/><p>SMITH: -- what second city meant.</p><p/><p>MCDOWELL: I only say New Yorker after when, you know, you have to walk through like garbage and the small of like a dumpster behind a fishmonger on the way. I only consider myself a New Yorker when I have to brave through that.</p><p/><p>SMITH: Alright.

However, much of that poll was taken before his widely panned comments about John McCain.</p><p/><p>In Iowa, home to the first caucus, the main newspaper, \"The Des Moines Register\", speaking about comments Sandra. Take a listen to this. They published a blistering op-ed of Trump this morning. Here's what they wrote, quote \"If he were merely a self absorbed B-list celebrity, his unchecked ego could be tolerated as some source of mild amusement\". That op-ed went on to say as you might image that Trump is unqualified to be President. Sandra?</p><p/><p>SMITH: Wow. Alright, Blake, thank you. I guess there's enough to talk about there, but he is jumping to into a very contentious GOP race. I mean, we heard from Governor Pataki earlier. He's all fired up. <person><nameText>Donald Trump's </nameText></person>so fired up, he's saying things maybe he shouldn't. I mean, there is an intense heated battle going on right now.</p><p/><p>MURPHY: There is an 16 candidates we all know is too much. But it's funny how the start of that report was about Kasich joining the race, but it ended with Trump. You know, it seems like right now everything's coming back to Trump. He's gotten all the press that surrounded - a lot of the press that's surrounded it. I think when we get to the first debate in August, we're going to be done 10 candidates at that point. And from 10, we need to get down to the top four or five. Right now, there's too many people out there. We need to weed through that and find the most qualified people who can actually win the election.</p><p/><p>SMITH: An I'm still trying to find somebody who will talk about the economy. You know, Governor Pataki had a lot of great things to say, however, Dagen, you noticed when I started asking about the economy, it went to national security, which is one of his strengths and what he wants to focus on. I just have not heard even on the left, Hillary Clinton, she's trying really hard to talk about the economy right now. But that's No. 1, what's polling with the American voter. They want to know who's going to fix the economy.</p><p/><p>MCDOWELL: The big broad stripes - and that will work initially. It's not going pay for any of these GOP candidates to get into the nitty-gritty of how they would fix the economy at least in the short run. They're going to paint, use broad stokes and - I mean, that's what's worked for Trump quite frankly.</p><p/><p>SMITH: By the way, you know, Joe Biden hasn't entered the race yet and there's a lot of talk about will he or won't. I should've asked Michael Berlin. I'm sure he had an opinion on that. But -</p><p/><p>MCDOWELL: It's after the first debate. That'll be critical where you get, the first debate, the first tier, it He gets it down a ten. Governor Pataki will not be in that first tier the way the polls numbers look like right now and maybe not Kasich either.</p><p/><p>SMITH: Alright. So exciting. From presidential season to earnings season in full swing, we'll hear from Apple after the bell today. We'll have a preview of that and \"Breaking Bad's\" Stephen Michael Quezada announcing plans to run for public office in New Mexico. He's going to be joining us next. Keep it right here on the Fox Business Network.</p><p/><p>(MUSIC PLAYING: \" GET IN MY WAY\" - ROBIN THICKE)</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>SMITH: News alert for you. Capitol flags will fly at half staff to remember the victims of the Chattanooga shooting. Cheryl Casone has the details on that.</p><p/><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS: Hi, good morning Sandra. Well, yes. House Speaker John Boehner has just ordered that flags on Capitol Hill fly at half staff in honor of the four marines and one sailor killed in a Tennessee terror attack. The gunman Mohammed Abdulazeez opened fire at two military facilities on Thursday before he was killed by police. We were just looking at that tweet coming out from Speaker Boehner's office, Speaker Boehner's Twitter account, saying, of course, that we're going to be honoring those victims.</p><p/><p>Killed by police in other headlines. New York City - excuse me. In other headlines this morning, New York City doctors are evaluating a patient who was rushed to hospital last night with some symptoms of Ebola. We're just getting this story in as well folks. The city's Health Department says the patient recently returned from Guinea and had no known exposure to the deadly disease. We're going to bring you, of course, the latest on that story as it develops. We're following that.</p><p/><p>And then finally, we've talked about this earlier, appliance makers say that President Obama's new dishwasher rules are going to take us back to the days of handwashing. This is serious news. The White House wants to cut the amount of water that dishwashers use, but the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers says that won't get your dishes clean enough Sandra. And also, the Association saying that they did tests and photographs, which they sent to the Department of Energy with food on the dishes they sent to the Department of Energy with food on the dishes. So, it's a big story. I'll continue to follow it for you.</p><p/><p>SMITH: Thank you very much Cheryl. Alright. Well, immigration reform becoming a key topic of debate for the 2016 presidential race and my next guest played a New Mexico law enforcement officer in the hit series, \"Breaking Bad\". Now he wants to make a difference in real life by running for public office in Albuquerque. Joining me now in a first on Fox Business interview with actor Stephen Michael Quezada. Steven, welcome. Good morning to you.</p><p/><p>STEPHEN MICHAEL QUEZADA, ACTOR: Good morning. How are you?</p><p/><p>SMITH: Alright. What is driving you to run for public office?</p><p/><p>QUEZADA: Well, I already have -- I sit on the Albuquerque school board. I've been involved in my community way before I was any kind of actor or any kind of comedian. I've always worked with kids, did gang intervention programs. So, this is something I've always been involved in. This isn't new for me. And so this is a gradual step for me to be able to help the people in the community that I love. I love this community. I'm a New Mexican. We're really proud of our culture and we're really proud of who we are and one of the main reasons why I'm running for office is because I'm an American and I can.</p><p/><p>SMITH: Stephen, immigration has been a hot topic mostly of late because of <person><nameText>Donald Trump's </nameText></person>comment that have been interpreted many different ways, but specifically, his comment on immigration. How, what was your response to that?</p><p/><p>QUEZADA: You know, immigration is a big topic for sure in the areas where we live. Those are our - that's our workforce. I mean, nobody eats without them working in America. Nobody - you know, they do the jobs that most Americans won't do. I know <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>wants to build a wall and I'm asking who's going to build the wall for $8 an hour? It's going to be the workforce that he wants out.</p><p/><p>So, we need to figure out immigration reform. Are we against criminals? Of course, we are. But to say that all Mexican people are drug dealers and rapist was something that should've never been said. I was just performing in front of 800 people and when I got into the elevator, I had man with his 7-year old son told me to go back to Mexico because I was a rapist and a drug dealer. And then, when I walked out of the elevator he spit at me. I mean, is this what we're try to promote as Americans because, you know, my family goes back here 300 years. My father fought in World War II, Korea and Vietnam. And for me to have to travel the country and deal with stuff like that, I think it's unfair and it's something that wasn't thought out. When you make a comment like that - because some of us Americans have to live with that.</p><p/><p>MURPHY: Hey Stephen, when you're in your campaign against the other two candidates, how much does your acting background or really your celebrity - I would like that put you at a huge advantage. Is that how the race is shaping up right now?</p><p/><p>QUEZADA: Well, you know, a lot of people use money as a huge advantage. I don't have that luxury. I'm just a regular old actor and comedian. But, locally I think most people know me here as a community member, as somebody, you know, as somebody who raises money for children, who does programs through youth development incorporated, who's been involved in education. So, the rest of the country knows me as \"Breaking Bad\" actor Steve Gomez. But, here in New Mexico, they know me as Stephen Michael Quezada, the community member.</p><p/><p>MCDOWELL: Stephen, it's Dagen McDowell. I work here at Fox Business. County Commissioner now, do you - is that where you see your career? Are you going to be an actor 20 years for now or do you want to be a politician?</p><p/><p>QUEZADA: I'm going to do both. I don't understand why anybody who runs for office can't do - you know, you never see anybody quit their job to run for office if they're a lawyer or if they own - if they're wealthy and they own a construction company or any kind of business. You know, nobody quits their job or --</p><p/><p>MCDOWELL: Well, Schwarzenegger did. I mean, Schwarzenegger did. There a number of actors that when they were serving their terms in office, they weren't doing film work or television work.</p><p/><p>QUEZADA: Well, I do the work because I have three children. I have two daughters in college. I'm not wealthy. Arnold Schwarzenegger and those other actors are very wealthy. You're not talking to Brian Cranson here, you're talking to a guy who played a - you know?</p><p/><p>SMITH: So, Steve, we don't have much time left. Who do you like right now as the presidential race heats up? There are lot of talk about the GOP field. Who do you like on the left?</p><p/><p>QUEZADA: Well, I'm going to tell you, I'm waiting to see who the most Democratic person is going to step up. I don't believe what I read or believe what I read all the time. I want somebody to be honest, so I'm looking at the person who's going to be the most honest and the person that I think is really going to look at the economic position of this country and who's going to look at immigration.</p><p/><p>SMITH: Do you like Hillary Clinton?</p><p/><p>QUEZADA: I like a couple of them. Hillary is definitely one of my top runners.</p><p/><p>SMITH: Alright. Stephen Michael Quezada, thank you for joining us this morning and sharing your thoughts and your run at office. Good luck to you.</p><p/><p>QUEZADA: Thank you. Thanks, I appreciate it.</p><p/><p>SMITH: Alright. Tesla shares set to be a major mover in today's trade. Why the stock is selling off straight ahead.</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>SMITH: Welcome back. We're about 40 minutes away from the opening bell. Let's get to Nicole Petallides at the New York Stock Exchange. It's already lunch time for you Nicole. An hour and a half to - sorry, less than an hour to the opening bell.</p><p/><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX BUSINESS: Good morning, Sandra. That's right. So, let's take a look at what we're watching. First of all, gold continues to be a story, right? Five-year lows, but we're keeping a keen eye on a big mover today. And that's Tesla. Tesla this morning is looking down about more than $10 this morning. And that is on a UBS downgrade. It turns out for the third time recently, they're cutting Telsa again. For the third time this month to a sell rating in this case and that is because they actually believe that the energy business, the energy storage business is unlikely to live up to the expectations. In fact, they also have power wall where they said some of the order that they're seeing are just solicitations. People don't actually have to put money down. And so with that, cutting into a sell (INAUDIBLE) on the stock is looking nowhere. Back to you.</p><p/><p>SMITH: Alright. Nicole, thank you. And don't forget to start your day off with Nicole, Lauren and me on \"FBN:AM\" every morning at 5:00 a.m. right here on the Fox Business Network. We get you ready for your day.</p><p/><p>MCDOWELL: Get down.</p><p/><p>SMITH: Alright! Here we go. Is it Friday? One stock to watch today. Apple reporting third-quarter earnings after the closing bell. Wall Street expecting the tech giant to report $29.9 billion dollars in Iphone sales versus $19.8 billion dollars last year. Analyst expect strong sales to be bowied by bigger-than-expected demand in China and this quarter represents the first for Apple watch sales. Apple's been tightlipped on watch sells specifically and many on Wall Street are keeping expectations muted. I don't know. As my read on that should be nobody really knows how well the watch is doing for Apple. Like so far, Tim Cook hasn't really released any details specifically about it.</p><p/><p>MURPY: He hasn't got a lot of press, but remember, in the last three months since Apple last reported. The stocks essentially flat. It was around 132, it's still around 132. So, I think going into this quarter, the bars set pretty high for them as far as Iphone sales go. But, if you look at the sales projection or what they did this past quarter, sales for the Iphones were great. The Iphone 6, iphone 6 Plus. China, U.S., I think the risk to Apple right now is to the upside. I think it breaks above recent highs on a very strong number today.</p><p/><p>SMITH: Really? So we at $132 a share. You think it's going to continue to run higher?</p><p/><p>MURPHY: Well, And I'd say, don't focus on the price of $132 because that's essentially flat in the last three months as the NASDAQ has gone up to all- time highs. But, really focus on is the company growing, is the company increasing their sales --</p><p/><p>SMITH: Not worried about valuations, you're just worried about gross period. And Dagen, as much as I've always say, I got Apple fatigue. I can't talk another day about Apple and this watch. And people love to buy the stocks, the love to buy the watch, they love to buy the Apple products. And it's like you can't ignore it. It's a growth engine that hasn't stopped.</p><p/><p>MCDOWELL: No, it's Google getting surprised at the upside Apple can't do. And it's an juggernaut and it's in the world of technology are you going to - it's relatively safe. Well, I say safe, but it's a safer bet than a lot of the questionable companies that are younger and newer with business models that are great deal shakier than that one.</p><p/><p>MURPHY: And we have the watch, but we also have Apple music that was just launched. I mean, it'll be interesting to see if they speak at about that because now, they're moving in a whole new space, but they still have that Apple mote.</p><p/><p>MCDOWELL: How many people they got to sign up for the free trial, which I did and I was not a subscriber to Spotify either and I signed up for Apple.</p><p/><p>SMTIH: There you have it. Alright. All this. Don't miss \"After the Bell's\" complete coverage on earnings after the close of trade today, right here on the Fox Business Network. David and Melissa will have that for you, 4:00 p.m. Eastern time. We are just over 30 minutes away from the opening bell. Futures right now pointing to a mixed open. NASDAQ on pace for a record day. Keep it right here on Fox Business. We'll be right back.</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>SMITH: All right. IBM is poised to shave off nearly 60 points from the Dow when it begins trading just a about an a half hour from now. Dagen, Mike, final thoughts ahead of the opening bell this morning? Mike, go first.</p><p/><p>MCDOWELL: You can go first.</p><p/><p>SMITH: You're on the spot. Think of something.</p><p/><p>MCDOWELL: Because I'm going to talk about something - uncomfortable.</p><p/><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p>MURPHY: Okay. I think the focus right now is on earnings. You know, we've heard from a lot of big banks. They've come out with strong earnings. So, I think the market is sitting at all-time highs. You talk about valuations, but I think if you look at it, we're not trading at historically high levels. So, there's talk out there about bubbles. We're not in a bubble right now. I think the market on strong earnings can take out highs and go higher. That's what I'll be watching today.</p><p/><p>MCDOWELL: And I'm watching any additional information on the Ashley Madison hack, the site for people looking for--</p><p/><p>SMITH: Cheating.</p><p/><p>MCDOWELL: Yes, who want to cheat on their spouses. So, what happened yesterday, it was a group that said they hacked into the Ashley Madison website and accessed 37 million users information because the full delete option that Ashley Madison charges for, it wasn't real. They weren't deleting these account. Ashley Madison said yesterday yes, it does. And it's offering free delete of all your accounts on Ashley Madison. And there was no new information that was posted on-line yesterday.</p><p/><p>SMITH: By the way, this is a story in the 'Wall Street Journal\" questioning whether or not the IPO that had been planned for Ashley Madison will actually happen. So, that's continued fallout from that story as well. Thank goodness they're going to let me delete my account.</p><p/><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p>SMITH: Alright, IBM, by the way, we're saying is going shave off 60 points from the Dow out of the gate this morning. United Technologies, part of that sell-off as well. Right now, combined IBM and United Technologies expected to shave off about 93 points from the Dow when it opens this morning. United Technologies UTX right now off $5 bucks in the pre-market ahead of the bell a half hour from now. And there was IBM off about $10 as well.</p><p/><p>Alright, I want to say thank you to Dagen McDowell and Mike Murphy for joining us this morning.</p><p/><p>MCDOWELL: Thank you.</p><p/><p>MURPHY: Thank you.</p><p/><p>SMITH: Busy couple of hours guys. You don't want to miss MORNINGS WITH MARIA tomorrow. Maria will be back. Presidential Candidate and Former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee will be here to talking about the latest in the always exciting campaign. Plus, FBR Capital Markets, Daniel Ives weighs in on Apple's highly anticipated results.

Analysts looking for $1.01 a share up from 91 cents a share a year ago.</p><p/><p>Apple reporting after the close today. The \"Wall Street Journal\" saying the iPhone accounts for nearly 70 percent of Apple's revenues and remains the company's most profitable product.</p><p/><p>Qualcomm which supplies many of the chips for the iPhone looking at the possibility of a breakup.

Nelson a known prankster in Europe tweeted about the incident later saying in jest that he was excited to be at the meeting with Blatter to secure the North Korea 2026 World Cup.</p><p/><p>And Zach Johnson is your 2015 British Open champion. Johnson birdied the first two holes of a four-hole playoff to help secure the win. Jordan Spieth who was trying to become the first since Ben Hogan in 1953 to win the first three majors of the year fell short by one stroke at the end of his round yesterday.</p><p/><p>All right. Well, gold prices edging lower after plunging to the lowest level in five years on rate hikes feared. Phil Flynn is now at the CME Group watching this sell-off nearing $1,100 a troy ounce in gold. Phil, will gold dip below $1,000 an ounce?</p><p/><p>PHIL FLYNN, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Well, it did earlier and I think it has a chance to because it is so close. But you know, a lot of people are talking about this bear raid that happened on Sunday night. That's what they're calling it. This massive sell orders that came in that broke the gold market down. And it's either -- it's a critical turning point.</p><p/><p>This is either a sign of capitulation or a sign that the market is going down. Consider the fact that we saw over $2 billion wiped off -- commodity, ETFs -- in the matter of a couple of hours yesterday. And that's raising a lot of concerns whether this trade was real, if it's really signaling a bigger problem with the global economy, or a bigger meltdown in China.</p><p/><p>Now what's kind of interesting here when we look at what's happened to gold here the couple of days central banks around the globe have been buying gold. We just saw reports that Russia, Kazakhstan, Afghanistan -- all these countries have been buying gold while the rest of the world is selling them. But it's raising a lot of concerns.</p><p/><p>But look what's done. You know, it's kind of interesting, people don't realize Sandra last month commodities as an asset class in the last quarter actually outperformed the stock market. What a turn-around in just the first couple of days of the quarter when we see this massive sell off in commodities. The index near a 13-year-low of all commodities, putting a lot of downward pressure on prices and the sell-off in gold really has, you know, trickled down to other markets, you know.</p><p/><p>Gold is the first one to sell off but it even impacted things like crude oil, gasoline prices, RBA (ph) prices. So it's raising concerns that this drop in gold could be signaling the bigger deflationary cycle which is going to create bigger problems for the fed as we go forward.</p><p/><p>SMITH: All right. So the cover of the \"Financial Times\" this morning, by the way, it's all about this commodity sell-off -- gold, lowest level in five years amid broader commodity sell-off. A lot of this, Michael, based on the strength that we're seeing in the U.S. dollar. To be clear in the overnight session we saw gold dip below $1,100 a troy ounce but, of course, the big round number we're now all watching is $1,000. Could that happen? Could we dip below there?</p><p/><p>MICHAEL BLOCK, RHINO TRADING PARTNERS: It could happen but I'm noticing some very interesting things here -- Sandra. I'm noticing, you know, there's the cover of the FT saying the death of gold. On the Twitter- sphere, you know, there's talk amongst traders and investors, no one wants to touch. The gold bugs are being burned at the stake here.</p><p/><p>SMITH: Dagen said it yesterday, actually.</p><p/><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN HOST: Yes, you finish your thought. I'll get into it. But when people point to gold and argue that gold, in and of itself, is some sort of economic indicator I go \"pooh, really\". Because copper is used around the global economy, oil is a critical global economic commodity.</p><p/><p>SMITH: People buy and sell gold versus copper for very different reasons. That being said what is the trade in gold right now?</p><p/><p>BLOCK: The trade, you know, I see right now is you know, sentiment getting worse. I think it could get worse, you know, when the screaming gets really loud as I like to say. People ask when is gold going to stop going down, I always give them a sardonic reply \"when you stop asking me\", which is my way of saying when there's total capitulation. I think we're getting close. Maybe we are there. For smart investors I have a lot of guys who are saying five years out I want to own gold miners and say hell yes, own an ETF here. This is an interesting interest spot where you want to start picking away at it.</p><p/><p>You know, look, gold is like anything else. Is it an inflation flight? Is it a flight to safety? No and no.</p><p/><p>MCDOWELL: Right. They can't answer that question. If you want safety you go into treasury bonds because the U.S. government will at least pay you back. If you want an inflation hedge, you go out and buy a house or you buy stocks because they're going to raise the price. I'm just saying that people have this wonderment around gold.</p><p/><p>SMITH: I hear Phil Flynn chomping at the bit down there -- Phil.</p><p/><p>FLYNN: Well, you know, it's kind of interesting here. I just mentioned Russia improve their gold reserves, a lot of that was because of the weakness in the ruble. We talk about China. A lot of talk that they didn't increase their gold reserves as much as a lot of people thought as they're trying to bring their currency back to a global market.</p><p/><p>And I agree with Dagen. On a day to day basis gold can, you know, react with no really strong economic purpose. But at the end of the day, central banks still use gold as the backdrop of their foreign currency whether they acknowledge it or not. So it's a very, very important commodity from that standpoint.</p><p/><p>SMITH: All right. That being said, we just checked the last time we did see gold below $1,000 an ounce, we'll have to go back to 2009 to see that - - so certainly a big round number to watch. Phil Flynn -- thank you for joining us from the CME Group there in Chicago.</p><p/><p><person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>taking a step back on \"THE O'REILLY FACTOR\" last night over his comments about <person><nameText>Senator John McCain </nameText></person>when he called the former POW, quote, \"not a war hero\".</p><p/><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>TRUMP: I have respect for senator McCain. I used to like him a lot, I supported him, raise money for his campaign against President Obama and certainly if there was a misunderstanding I would totally take that back.</p><p/><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>SMITH: Get ready because my next guest says the latest flip is far worse than those about Mexican immigrants and will cost Trump dearly. The latest polling data does suggest otherwise. A new poll ABC News and the \"Washington Post\" show he is the favorite at 24 percent. Mind you, that poll did happen before those comments occurred.</p><p/><p>Mike Berland is a former strategic adviser to Hillary Clinton and CEO of Edelman Berland and joins us now. And Mike, we very much look forward to having you on the show this morning to react to not only to what <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>said but then how he has responded now to our very own Bill O'Reilly last night.</p><p/><p>MIKE BERLAND, EDELMAN BERLAND: Well, if you like \"Celebrity Apprentice\" waiting for the August 6th Republican debate because <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>is building his viewership, he's building his base and he will be ready to go.</p><p/><p>What we're seeing is that <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>is a master brand builder. I've been studying brands for 25 years, he knows what he is about, he's very clear he's a straight shooter and he's now setting the dialogue.</p><p/><p>Sandra we've been talking about <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>for two weeks. We are watching what's happening on social media. In his first issue with Mexican illegal immigrants, it was a corporate play and we saw the issues that he had. Now we're seeing that this was much broader.</p><p/><p>You know who broke this? Mitt Romney. He tweeted out and 60,000 shared it. And over the next three days we saw this go from Politico and Mitt Romney to Democrats, Republicans, Independents -- everybody is talking about <person><nameText>Donald Trump.</nameText></person></p><p/><p>SMITH: Well first of all we've been talking a lot about <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>for a lot longer than two weeks.</p><p/><p>BERLAND: Well, he's a -- viable presidential candidates.</p><p/><p>SMITH: Ok. But the branding aspect Dagen is one that every time -- because if anything he continues to establish his brand and get his name out there. Polling shows that -- the last poll that I saw showed that only two percent of American voter respondents didn't know who he was. I mean more people know <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>than any other presidential candidate out there.</p><p/><p>MCDOWELL: Real-estate billionaire used to be his brand. Now it's \"feckless blowhard\" according to the \"Des Moines Register\" which called for him to step out of a race but you know who he is like? And to Michael's credit we were talking about this before he walked out here. He's Ross Perot -- right.</p><p/><p>That's the best comparison to Trump is Ross Perot getting into the race.</p><p/><p>BERLAND: But what does Trump have that Ross Perot didn't have?</p><p/><p>MCDOWELL: Money.</p><p/><p>BERLAND: No, he had. Ross Perot had billion dollars, <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>has social media and when we look at how this story is spreading we see that <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>is now becoming political provocateur. He is talking about issues that people are scared about and I think what is really interesting is that this is not just a Republican Party issue. This is about presidential politics in America and we see that everybody is responding.</p><p/><p>Look at this analysis that I've done. The story started with Politico on one side, Mitt Romney on the other and watch how the story spread over Twitter. It started to connect and this became ubiquitous issue over three days.</p><p/><p>Sandra most stories died down after three days. This one actually built. And by the time we get to August 6th we're going to see Trump continue to build support and I think if you are Jeb Bush, if you're Marco Rubio, if you're Rick Perry and you are in that debate with him you got to watch out.</p><p/><p>SMITH: Ok. But we have not had your reactions yet on O'Malley and apologizing for saying \"all lives matter\"? I am dying to know your take on that.</p><p/><p>BERLAND: I think that what we are seeing is a debate now is spreading bigger -- that we are seeing a lot of issues on the Republican and on Democratic side and we're talking about straight shooting.</p><p/><p>SMITH: Ok. That's it?</p><p/><p>BLOCK: Does straight shooting from O'Malley's sell though? That's the question.</p><p/><p>BERLAND: Right. He doesn't have the brand that <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>does to get it out. I think that we're seeing really -- on the Democratic side, here we have <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>who is talking very candidly about the issues. We have Hillary Clinton who is being very careful and scripted and what's going to happen with the American voter it's he's raising the bar. And we're going to see on both sides, we're going to see Sanders, we're going to see O'Malley, we're going to see Clinton. They're all going to have to take their game up.</p><p/><p>But Trump is drowning everybody out right now.</p><p/><p>SMITH: I think you let O'Malley of the hook a little easy compared to what you're doing to <person><nameText>Donald Trump.</nameText></person></p><p/><p>BERLAND: No, hold on. I'm saying <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>is absolutely very much in control of the dialogue. I think I'm actually --</p><p/><p>SMITH: Is it that he is or you want him to be because that is better for the left?</p><p/><p>BERLAND: For the left I think they want <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>to go away. I think that the Republicans would as well.</p><p/><p>SMITH: Really.</p><p/><p>BERLAND: Of course.</p><p/><p>MCDOWELL: A better comparison is Bernie Sanders because they're really appealing to the same anti-establishment feeling on the right as Trump and on the left as Sanders.</p><p/><p>BERLAND: I'll give you an example. John Kasich today is going to announce that he is running for president. And nobody's going to hear it and no one is going to care because they're going to keep talking about <person><nameText>Donald Trump. </nameText></person>So you are drowning out both sides.</p><p/><p>If you're Hillary Clinton you can't get your economic message out there. If you're Bernie Sanders you're getting drowned out.</p><p/><p>SMITH: What's her economic message?</p><p/><p>BERLAND: Her economic message, she's talking about increasing wages --</p><p/><p>MCDOWELL: Her economic message is more Obama and she doesn't go as far left as Bernie Sanders. That's in essence what her economy --</p><p/><p>SMITH: But that is my defense of Hillary Clinton, is that she is the one who is trying to get her economic message out there. More so than I say to a lot of other candidates aside from maybe Jeb Bush who's a real fan on the table for growth in the United States.</p><p/><p>All right. We unfortunately have to leave it there. Mike Berland -- great conversation.</p><p/><p>BERLAND: Thanks for having me.</p><p/><p>SMITH: Thanks for joining us early this morning.</p><p/><p>All right. Well, the Nasdaq notching its third record close in a row and major members of the index scheduled to report earnings today. Are we approaching another technology bubble? Is that happening right now? We will discuss that next.</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>SMITH: President Obama's new dishwasher rules are under fire by appliance makers. Cheryl, you get down.</p><p/><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT: We had it.</p><p/><p>SMITH: What's your story? Take it away.</p><p/><p>CASONE: You've got it Sandra. Yes, dishwasher rules, not kidding about this one -- Sandra. Are you ready to start hand washing your dishes again folks? I'm serious. This is a real story. The Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers says that is exactly what is going to happen if the White House's new dishwasher regulations go into law.</p><p/><p>The new rules cut the amount of water that dishwashers can use. But the industry group says that's going to only lead to dirtier dishes and we're all going to be unhappy and we're going to blame the President for dirty dishes. True story.</p><p/><p>Intelligent life anywhere in the universe if it exists, Stephen Hawking wants to find it. The famed scientist has announced the new $100 million project to find evidence of life beyond earth. Hawking and other researchers plan to spend the next ten years studying one million stars in the Milky Way and 100 other galaxies for any signs of life. ET if you're out there, you can call us.</p><p/><p>And finally Microsoft reporting quarterly results after the close today, the software giant expected to pose a drop in revenue, as buyers wait for the next version of Windows. That's due out later this month. Investors also hoping to hear more details about the company's latest job cuts. Unfortunately that is the problem.</p><p/><p>The Nasdaq, we didn't get the record close yesterday intra-day Sandra but, you know, everybody keeps saying are we in a bubble? Is this a bubble? Is technology a bubble? But when Apple comes in after the close I think all of those questions are going to be deleted because Apple is probably going to have another really strong quarter.</p><p/><p>SMITH: I mean is it reasonable that we're having fears of the year 2000 and these lofty valuations on these stocks? I mean I'm looking at the triple cues (ph), the power share's triple cues, trusts tracks Nasdaq -- a ten-year high there as well. Everybody is worried, you know. Is this sustainable?</p><p/><p>BLOCK: Look, we're breaking 200 highs, I'm not going to use the word \"bubble\" here. What I'm seeing here is -- the key word here is \"scarcity\". Google came out last week. They had great earnings with the Ruth Porat as the CFO now. They have a great cost cutting story; over the weekend that hey they can use some of their cash to buy back stock, hitting on all cylinders.</p><p/><p>Here's the problem, what goes for Google does not necessarily go for Microsoft or Qualcomm or Sandisk or Texan or some of these other companies coming out. I don't think the valuations are too lofty. You see some of these venture capital valuations and then there are certain companies out there with no earnings that are going on. Amazon --</p><p/><p>CASONE: Well, Jet.com is what came up yesterday. That is where this whole discussion started out. It was like really? That is not making any money and come on.</p><p/><p>MCDOWELL: Some of the valuations on the private companies even Uber are where you get nosebleeds in there. A lot of companies getting funding, that are actually companies -- they're the exact same model of a company that went out of business during the first dot.com crash and then it came back. Whether the (INAUDIBLE) sticks with the originally company, it basically got shut down and then they refunded at a higher price which makes no sense.</p><p/><p>SMITH: And look, there's no fun in looking at financials these days with the lack of growth potential that most analysts point out in the financial sector. It's like where is that money that's chasing growth in the stock market, where are they going to look?</p><p/><p>BLOCK: It's going to tech and to biotech, and you have Chipotle reporting as well and it's going to these rogue companies because there's scarcity of growth. Organic growth isn't coming from many places, even Google's coming down but there still is some growth. The question is, is Microsoft there. Apple -- I think everyone thinks is going to be there --</p><p/><p>CASONE: You know what I don't want to see though, you guys. I don't want to see another year where you have what we saw back in 2000 which was Goldman Sachs and the investment bankers that extend these IPOs. They're the ones that made all the money and the retail investors, the (INAUDIBLE) got the shaft once again.</p><p/><p>MCDOWELL: The retail investor except in a few instances is very shy of a lot of these companies. This is an indicator of nothing but I bought my first Mac. I've never owned a Mac. I've always been Windows-based my entire life. Yesterday -- it arrived yesterday.</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>BLOCK: -- growth exposure.</p><p/><p>SMITH: Everybody wants to talk about tech bubbles. We're going to be right back. Stay with us</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>KT MCFARLAND, <person><nameText>FOX NEWS </nameText></person>NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST: It's truly (INAUDIBLE). They have famously last year in the battle for Kobani which is a big city near there on the other side of the Turkish border that ISIS took Turkish tanks out on the Turkish border and they watched as ISIS came in, took the town, slaughtered the Kurdish population there.</p><p/><p>So will Turkey join the battle? Will Turkey join the battle in Syria and Iraq, you know, the Islamic state? Or will Turkey just say I'm going to defend our borders? Will Turkey tighten up its borders?</p><p/><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>SMITH: That was K.T. McFarland weighing in on one of the top stories in the Journal this morning. Reading \"Suicide bomber killed at least 31 in Turkish border towns\".</p><p/><p>For more on this let's bring in <person><nameText>Fox News </nameText></person>correspondent and former navy fighter pilot Lea Gabriel. Good morning. Thanks for joining us on this story this morning. What do you make of the latest developments out of Turkey?</p><p/><p>LEA GABRIEL, <person><nameText>FOX NEWS </nameText></person>CORRESPONDENT: Well, you know, actually what we just heard K.T. saying, in Turkey we watched as Kobani was under siege for months and months. Turkey sat there, did very little. Turkey has been very difficult to influence to get engaged in this fight against ISIS even though ISIS is essentially -- this alligator called ISIS has been chomping at their canoe for a long time.</p><p/><p>Now Turkey is saying, ok, well this is probably retaliation because now we are joined with, you know, the other fight against ISIS and now we're helping to train some Syrian rebels. So this is probably retaliation.</p><p/><p>I see that as a bit of a cop out from Turkey because they really have not wanted to be engaged in this fight. And what they really want I think is for the U.S. and for other countries to step in and fight this so they can sit back and watch.</p><p/><p>SMITH: So you don't think Turkey is going to join the battle here?</p><p/><p>GABRIEL: I think Turkey will but I think they're going to continue to do as little as possible. And there's a lot of reasons for this. For one, it's that Turkey does not want to see the rise of the Kurds. Turkey does not want to see an independent Kurdistan. They have seen the Kurdish power rising. The Kurds have been our biggest ally in this fight against ISIS. And that's a big problem for Turkey so I think that is one of the main reasons that they're wanting to kind of sit back.</p><p/><p>You know, they wanted the U.S. to do a lot. They wanted us to establish a no-fly zone. They wanted a humanitarian zone. They wanted others to come in and take care of this threat and I think we'll continue to see them do as little as possible.</p><p/><p>SMITH: Cover of the \"Wall Street Journal\" this morning -- Dagen. ISIS's leader takes steps to ensure group's survival. Not just ensuring survival, it seems that they're gaining territory and they're gaining power.</p><p/><p>MCDOWELL: Lea, Turkey has one of the largest armies in the world.</p><p/><p>GABRIEL: Second largest in NATO.</p><p/><p>MCDOWELL: Right. And one of I think the fourth largest overall. Would we be willing to step in and help Turkey knowing that they have basically the power to take care of themselves if they so choose?</p><p/><p>GABRIEL: This is a little diplomatic game that I think we have been playing for months. Since Kobani was going on a lot of people said why aren't we doing more in Kobani? Why just an air campaign? I think a lot of this was to basically say look, this is a regional problem.</p><p/><p>As I said this alligator is chomping at your canoe. We may be in the same river but it's not right here on our borders, it's on yours Turkey. And I think that's a quiet little diplomatic game that is being played, that's the soft power.</p><p/><p>BLOCK: I mean look, there's a new power here, what is El Baghdadi and ISIS really worried about here? They're worried about the fact that the United States is making this groundbreaking deal with Iran. Why are we making the deal with Iran? You know, the thing that no one wants to talk about is this sort of takes the shackles off the revolutionary guard, our sworn enemies. Maybe now and certainly in the past that says hey they're going to join the fight more overtly now. And you know, for someone looking at Erdogan in Turkey, looking at the U.S., looking at all the players in the region suddenly there's this new big player there and you know, I think is really what ISIS is responding to here.</p><p/><p>GABRIEL: But definitely a positive spin on the nuclear deal and not to say a spin --</p><p/><p>BLOCK: No, it's my view on it. I get asked about it constantly.</p><p/><p>GABRIEL: There's good and there's bad. There's definitely a good side of it but at the same time what Iran really wants in the region is influence.</p><p/><p>BLOCK: Here it is.</p><p/><p>GABRIEL: So Iran may be battling ISIS, but Iran wants to grow its influence and in no way would I consider Iran any sort of an ally with us in the region at any point.</p><p/><p>SMITH: All right. Thank you to Lea Gabriel. And by the way, check out Lea's new web segment called the \"Fox Patriot Report\". Log onto foxnews.com for more -- right?</p><p/><p>GABRIEL: Yes. Thank you.</p><p/><p>SMITH: All right. Thank you very much to Lea.</p><p/><p>A new poll this morning showing <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>taking the lead in the Republican race but could his comments on Senator McCain the damper on his White House run? Some think so, some think not. Former New York governor and current Republican candidate for president George Pataki is here to weigh in.</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>SANDRA SMITH, FOX BUSINESS: Ohio<person><nameText>Governor, John Kasich </nameText></person>set to jump into the 2016 White House race. Blake Burman has the latest from Washington. Blake?</p><p/><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FOX BUSINESS: Sandra, John Kasich will make it 16 later today. He is expected to be the final in a long list of candidates in the Republican primary. Kasich is the Governor of the swing state of Ohio and a former Congressman. In between those two stints, he also worked at Lehman Brothers. This will be Kasich's second attempt at a White House run and he'll start with a lot of ground to make up. Kasich currently sits just outside the top 10 pulling in around one to two percent of support from Republicans and for the moment, is among the packs staring up at <person><nameText>Donald Trump. </nameText></person>A poll released by \"The Washington Post\" shows the billionaire businessman has widened his lead. Trump's 24 percent is double his nearest competitors. However Sandra, some of that poll was taken before his controversial comments on John McCain. So, the full effect of that for Trump is still unknown and the Post points out that on the final day of that poll, they saw a drop for Trump. So it's something we'll have to look forward - look to going forward. Sandra?</p><p/><p>SMITH: Alright. Thank you for that Blake. And following his comments on Senator McCain, \"The Des Moines Register\" is now calling for Trump to end his run for the White House. My next guest has taken <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>to task for his recent comments on Senator McCain, and demeaning Mexicans.</p><p/><p>Joining me now is former New York governor and current Republican candidate for president, George Pataki. Governor, thank you for being here this morning.</p><p/><p>GEORGE PATAKI (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Good morning. Nice being on with you.</p><p/><p>SMITH: All right, so where do you stand on Trump's most recent comments on <person><nameText>Senator John McCain?</nameText></person></p><p/><p>PATAKI: Can I tell I something? <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>is not going to be President of the United States. Period. Whether it's his McCain comments, his comments earlier demeaning Mexicans.</p><p/><p>SMITH: Why do you rule him out?</p><p/><p>PATAKI: First of all, he's never held public office and we've had two people in 150 years -- Dwight Eisenhower and U.S. Grant -- who hadn't held public office. And then he makes comments that are simply outrageous. The media loves this. I mean, look what we're talking about. The day after the U.N. Security Council --</p><p/><p>SMITH: The media loves it.</p><p/><p>PATAKI: -- approves the Iran agreement, we're talking about <person><nameText>Donald Trump.</nameText></person></p><p/><p>SMITH: This is true.</p><p/><p>PATAKI: <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>is not going to be president. The IranSecurity Council vote is meaningful; that's what we should be talking about. Forgive me.</p><p/><p>SMITH: Well, the media loves it, but the polling shows the American voters like it as well. Now you're in this race, and we've got another GOP contender jumping in today as well. The field, the bench, is deep, Governor.</p><p/><p>PATAKI: I think that's a great thing.</p><p/><p>SMITH: It is? .</p><p/><p>PATAKI: I think it's a great thing for the country, a great thing for the party. It's July of 2015. The election is November of 2016. And I've had people come up to me and say what's going on? Normally this is -- three or four months before the election, not year and three or four months before the election.</p><p/><p>People will have a chance to make their case. People will rise up, drop out, and <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>I think has disqualified himself. He's a celebrity. The media loves him. But ultimately he is not going to be President of the United States.</p><p/><p>PATAKI: So do you think he has been a bad thing for the Republican Party, considering that most GOP candidates are having to respond to his comments?</p><p/><p>PATAKI: I do. I do. In particular, I think the Republicans --</p><p/><p>SMITH: Because you're sitting there talking about it right now.</p><p/><p>PATAKI: Yes, and I think the Republicans who did not stand up to his comments about Mexicans are going to regret it next year. I mean it's one thing to stand up for an icon, a war hero, John McCain. Everybody did that, but you have to stand up --</p><p/><p>SMITH: Or all POWs, quite frankly. He took a shot at anybody --</p><p/><p>PATAKI: All POWs, absolutely.</p><p/><p>SMITH: -- who had ever been a prisoner of war.</p><p/><p>PATAKI: And all those who have served our country. But you have to stand up for those who aren't famous, who aren't rich and powerful or hold important position. And they didn't -- so many of my running mates didn't do that when it came to Mexicans, and they're going to regret that.</p><p/><p>SMITH: And there's been criticism of the Republican Party for not focusing on most important issue for the American voter, and that is the economy. Where is the GOP on that?</p><p/><p>PATAKI: Yes. Well, first of all, we have to talk about the economy, but I honestly think what happened yesterday in the U.N. Security Council is critical. And when you think back to September 11, the economic consequence. Obviously it had horrible human personal consequences that we still feel, but the economic consequences of an insecure America are enormous.</p><p/><p>And after that deal -- and I am outraged that this president bypassed Congress, basically gutted the law that he signed giving Congress 60 days to reject that deal and seven different U.N. sanctions -- decades of work by presidents since Bill Clinton are out the window regardless what Congress has done. That's an outrage. And ultimately when our security's at risk, it affects our economy.</p><p/><p>MICHAEL BLOCK, RHINO TRADING PARTNERS CHIEF STRATEGIST: Governor. You know, everyone's still focused on Trump. In a perfect world, it would be about issues. How do you intend to get public back on issues.</p><p/><p>PATAKI: You know, when you're out on the hustings, when you don't have the cameras there -- and sadly I don't get that many cameras when I'm out on the hustings because they're all with Trump or Hillary or someone else. People care about the issues, they care about jobs, they care about the fact that we've had one of the weakest recoveries ever since a terrible recession. They care about, you know, the fact that we are now having great relations with Cuba but we have hard relations with our ally Israel. And it's like a bad \"Saturday Night Live\" skit when the president -- when four Marines who are putting their -- put their lives on the line for our country are murdered in the United States, are told -- the Marines are told, well, you can't wear your uniform in the United States. That's a disgrace.</p><p/><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS: But I think that -- but I think that you -- that Trump does touch on the issues, to defend why he is popular among Americans. He takes a very hard line on immigration. He uses language that is objectionable, but he takes a hard line on immigration, he takes a hard line on China, he takes a hard line on the lack of economic growth and wage growth in this country. And that is what's connecting him.</p><p/><p>PATAKI: He's great at pointing out problems. But what America needs are solutions. And when it comes to immigration, I don't think there's a Republican candidate who doesn't stand up there and say we have got to secure our borders. We have got to make sure everybody comes here legally. They just don't demean millions of people in the process.</p><p/><p>And that is, to me, a part of the politics that I don't like. We have to talk about solutions, talk about bringing people together, and not inflammatory rhetoric that seems, you know, wonderful for a headline at the moment but ultimately divides us and doesn't solve problems.</p><p/><p>SMITH: You talked about the four Marines and now the sailor that has also died in those shootings last week. Do you -- should military men and women in this country be armed?</p><p/><p>PATAKI: Absolutely. It is a despicable surrender, tyrannical Islam here, when this president goes to our Marine recruiters in response to this and says don't wear a uniform and keep your blinds drawn. This is absurd. They should have arms; every military person in uniform in this country should be allowed to carry an arm. I'll tell you, I'll feel a lot better if I see a Marine in a uniform with a gun on his side than if I do seeing that this strong solid guy, knowing he could be a target and can't defend himself. By the way, my son was a Marine, in Iraq, so I'm --</p><p/><p>SMITH: Well, we thank you for his service and your family's service.</p><p/><p>PATAKI: Thank you.</p><p/><p>SMITH: All right, Governor Pataki, full of energy. Love your passion. Thanks for being here this morning.</p><p/><p>PATAKI: Thank you. Alright. Well coming up, bidding wars are back for homes. Are they a good thing or a bad thing. We're going to discus that next, stay tuned.</p><p/><p>(MUSIC PLAYING: UNIDENTIFIED SONG)</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>SMITH: Alright. Let's take a look futures ahead of the opening bell on Wall Street this morning. Dow and S&amp;P futures, the broader market averages or the futures on them at least, are down, pointing to lower open. Look at the NASDAQ futures though following up on yesterday's record close. NASDAQ futures looking like a higher open. That would be a record on Wall Street when things get going at 9:30 a.m. Eastern this morning. And look at gold prices. That sell-off continues. Dropped below $1100 dollars an ounce in the overnight session. We've come off those lows but still down at $1106 an ounce.</p><p/><p>Call it a flashback to the housing boom. Bidding wars are back in housing market, but unlike the 2000 characterized by easy money mortgages, bidding wars are now sparked by too few homes offered for sale. Michael, what's your take on this. Is this a red flag or sign of a robust housing market?</p><p/><p>BLOCK: Housing has already come a long way and we've seen it do well. It's well-off lows the lows and if you look at chart on new home sales and housing starts, they've come well off the lows and they still have a ways to run that's in 2007, 2006, the era like that. A couple things that I'm looking at. I look at stocks for a living and I noticed that the ITB, the homebuilding, home construction ETF, peaked in early April. Yesterday, even though we've had strong housing data yesterday, housing stocks lagged. There was some analysts rumbling about Home Depot and Lowe's, some softness there perhaps. So, there's some worries there.</p><p/><p>In term of the supply-demand dynamic. I think that's exactly what it is. There's a scarcity of homes. What's going to happen? Are we going - are they going to build more homes. That comes down to a lot about confidence and consumer confidence from (INAUDIBLE) last week. For me, I think housing hitting a bit of a wall here. It's has a good run. It's no longer new news incrementally when housing data is good. I'm a little worried about what happened in the energy patch and what's happening with U.S. industrials in terms of manufacturing. Manufacturing has hit a wall in the United States. Is that going to affect wages? Wages are stopped out and you know, to me, housing I think the risk is to the downside here.</p><p/><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINES: We're going to have to go back to talking about housing, though, regionally and locally because the big issue - because this story about the bidding wars coming back is in just some specific hot markets. There's so many pockets of weakness throughout the country where there hasn't been wage growth. You go and hour half outside New York City, there is plenty of supply and the prices look extremely soft and you see that throughout the country. If you're not in a hot economic market like New York, or Silicon Valley, the San Francisco area, the houses are - the supply can be plentiful and the prices can be pretty cheap.</p><p/><p>SMITH: But there are pockets doing very well. Case in point, the city of Chicago. Chicago home sales hit a new record high. The first half of the year. Sales activity really hot there.</p><p/><p>BLOCK: What I'll argue is back during the peak, Chicago was good. It was never one of these explosive markets in there it came in. So now, it's kind of coming off the low base. You know, Dagen was talking about --</p><p/><p>Dagen: Highest sells tax in the country in Chicago now. A lot of economic problems.</p><p/><p>BLOCK: Well the governance is so good there. Anyway, --</p><p/><p>SMITH: Drop mic.</p><p/><p>BLOCK: You know, we're talking about markets that are good. One thing I'll say about the high-end market, you now Denver what was talked about in the press and that's an interesting place. But New York, on the high-end. One thing that we're not talking about here is how strong the Dollar is. How is that going to deter -</p><p/><p>SMITH: Foreign investment?</p><p/><p>BLOCK: -- you know, potential buyer from Brasilia and Russia, some of these countries - Europe, some of these countries that have really spurred a lot of buying.</p><p/><p>MCDOWELL: Chinese buyers.</p><p/><p>BLOCK: That's something I think (INAUDIBLE) talking enough about. You know, Chinese buying maybe insulted to that (INAUDIBLE) stage relatively strong. But I'm talking about countries like the (INAUDIBLE) of Ruble, which we've seen weakness.</p><p/><p>MCDOWELL: It's not just the currency, it's the commodities themselves being weak and Russia put the pressure on the buyers.</p><p/><p>BLOCK: Yes, and that's the whole thing and that's the whole punch line here is that, you know, what happens to commodities is going to affect housing in this country -</p><p/><p>SMITH: It's going to affect everything.</p><p/><p>BLOCK: Because of the dollar.</p><p/><p>BLOCK: All right, coming up guys, there is still no verdict in the Tom Brady deflate-gate case and now some analyst think the NFL may wait an entire year to hand down a ruling. Oh, joy. Our next guest wrote the book on Brady and he's going to weigh in on deflate-gate next.</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>SMITH: It's Hot outside. Temperatures rising across the country and we are facing a heat wave. Maria Molina is in the Fox Weather Center with the details. Maria, another hot day, another hot week?</p><p/><p>MARIA MOLINA, FOX WEATHER CENTER: Yes, it looks like it's going to be another hot one across many areas in the country and for us in New York City for instance, we're going to be hot today, but we're going to start to feel relief already as we head into Tomorrow with a cold front that's going to be swing through dropping those temperatures and humidity levels. But if you live in the southeast or across parts of the plains, expect those hot temperatures to remain in place at least for several more days. Parts of Oklahoma, you're not expecting any relief pretty much for most of this workweek.</p><p/><p>So, again, different areas expecting to see a relief or no relief and different time periods. So you can see a look at the high temperatures for today. 90s and triple digits across parts of the plains as we head eastward, high temperatures widespread into the 90s and the problem is that it's not just hot on thermometer, but you also have a lot of humidity in place out there and that's what makes it feel a lot hotter than what temperatures say.</p><p/><p>So, this is what it's going to feel like as we head out the door. In Wilmington, by 5:00 p.m., it should feel like 108, 106 in Montgomery, Vicksburg 107 and triple-digit heat index values as well across parts of the plains. So again, it's really what it's going to feel like out there that's the issue and those heat advisories in place out here because of those high heat index values. Excesses heat warnings also in place portions of the Carolinas. And I do want to mention that there is a chance for some showers and storms different parts of the country today. A very low risk for severe weather, but it is in place out there across the plains, Mid- Atlantic and also in the northeast. Sandra?</p><p/><p>SMITH: All right, Maria. Thank you. Well still, no verdict in the Tom Brady deflate-gate case and should there be one? There is talk of waiting on punishment for the New England Patriots quarterback until after the season. We bring in \"New York Dailey News\" NFL columnist and author of upcoming \"Brady versus Manning: The Untold Story of the Rivalry that Transformed the NFL\". Gary Myers. Gary, good morning to you.</p><p/><p>GARY MEYERS, NFL COLUMNIST AND AUTHOR (via telephone): Good morning. How are you?</p><p/><p>SMITH: Alright. So, a lot of people have made the case for waiting to finalize the punishment the Patriots after analyzing all this data over the 2015 season. Are you saying - do you make the same case for that?</p><p/><p>MYERS: Well, I think what would make sense from the standpoint that it would give NFL an opportunity to -- to measure these footballs you know, during, you know, the course of the game, especially during the wintertime, when -- you know, the Patriots are claiming that the ball's naturally lose air, you know, due to the weather conditions. But I don't know how realistic it is that the NFL is going to want to -- you know, put this off for a full year and wait to hand out the punishment to -- to the Patriots, and, you know, put punishment on hold for the Patriots that they have already handed out.</p><p/><p>SMITH: And by the way, Gary, you're talking about punishment for Patriots, but there's punishment -- Peter King over at the nnqb.com, he takes this a step further and says any punishment for Tom Brady should be put off as well.</p><p/><p>MYERS: Right. That's what I was about to say is that even more importantly than punishment to the Patriots would be, you know, the punishment to Tom Brady, and, you know, from the standpoint of really getting an accurate indication of what, you know, the effect of the weather conditions are, on footballs, which the NFL has never done -- that would seem to be, you know, a fair solution before, you know, enacting all the punishment. But, again, I don't know how realistic it is if the NFL's going to want to defer this for a full year and go through the process of doing this you know, complete, you know work-up of what happens to the football during the course of the game, I'm not sure that's going to happen.</p><p/><p>BLOCK: Hey Gary, you know, let me be blunt here. Is the NFL worried about derailing the gravy train here or what are?</p><p/><p>MYERS: Derailing Brady train.</p><p/><p>BLOCK: Yes, you know, taking Brady out of the game. Is that going to ruin money their maker here? Are they just a little reticent about that? Is there any thought about that?</p><p/><p>MYERS: No, I don't think that has anything to do -- uh -- with this situation. NFL is basically an ATM machine and you know, whether Tom Brady plays the first game, second game or up to, you know, or missing the first four games, I don't think that's going to have any impact on the revenue.</p><p/><p>SMITH: Alright Gary. Let me bring in money angle here because despite all these scandal that we're talking, that the NFL has been dealing with and facing, the teams are still making a lot of money. More than $225 million dollars each on revenue sharing for the NFL.</p><p/><p>MYERS: Well, I mean, we know they can make an absolute incredible amount of money just from national TV contracts alone and they make a lot of money from their local revenue. I mean, it's no secret that the NFL is an extremely profitable business. Some of the numbers came out yesterday because the Green Bay Packers are publicly owned, and those numbers are -- are made public. But, again, as this relates to Brady, I don't know that one player has any kind of impact on -- on the kind of revenue that the NFL can generate. Now, it certainly could impact TV ratings the first couple of weeks in just in Patriot games, that Brady, you know, plays or doesn't play, depending on what happens, but I don't know overall that it makes one bit of difference, you know, term of how much NFL is making.</p><p/><p>SMITH: Alright. Gary Myers thanks for joining us this morning and thank you to Michael Block for joining me for the hour.</p><p/><p>MYERS: All right, take care.</p><p/><p>SMITH: Alright. Thank you both. Next hour, a \"Breaking Bad\" actor is looking to take his role on TV to real life announcing plans to run for public office New Mexico. He'll join us next hour.

I am Sandra Smith in for <person><nameText>Maria Bartiromo. </nameText></person>It is Tuesday morning , July 21st and with me this hour, Steve Cortes of Veracruz and Attorney Mercedes Colwin.</p><p/><p>Here are your top stories at 6:00 a.m. on the east coast. Gold once again trading at its lowest level in five years as more investors prepare for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates. Futures showing the markets right now are trending to the downside, pointed to a lower open a couple hours from now.

But, that came down before Trump's comments about <person><nameText>Senator John McCain </nameText></person>who he doesn't regard as a war hero. Trump told Bill O'Reilly last night that the Senator has not done anything for war veterans.</p><p/><p>(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)</p><p/><p><person><nameText>DONALD TRUMP, </nameText></person>2016 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: He's supposed to be doing it and I see him on television all the time and he's always talking, talking, but nothing gets done. These veterans are living in hell Bill. They're hurting and they're crying and -</p><p/><p>SMITH: More on that in a bit. Meanwhile, Verizon among the companies reporting earning this morning ahead of the opening bell. Analyst looking for $1.01 a share. That's up from $0.91 cents a year ago. Apple reporting after the close today. The \"Wall Street Journal\" saying the Iphone accounts for nearly 70 percent of Apple's revenue and remains the company's most profitable hardware products.</p><p/><p>Qualcomm, which supplies many of the chips for the Iphone it's looking at the possibility of a breakup. The Journal says the company will review its options after an activist investor pushed for change at the chipmaker. Seth Blatter, the now notorious president of the world soccer organization FIFA were showered with fake money by comedian Lee Nelson.

Jordan Speith who was trying to become the first in since Ben Hogan in 1953 to win the first three majors of the year, fell one stroke short at the end of his round yesterday.</p><p/><p>Alright well turning back to the latest on <person><nameText>Donald Trump's </nameText></person>run for the White House. Backtracking a little on those comments was <person><nameText>Senator John McCain.</nameText></person></p><p/><p>(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)</p><p/><p>TRUMP: I have respect for <person><nameText>Senator John McCain. </nameText></person>I used to like him a lot. I supported him. I raised a lot of money for his campaign against President Obama and certainly if there was a misunderstanding, I would totally take that back.</p><p/><p>(END AUDIO CLIP)</p><p/><p>SMITH: Trump has to say come under heavy fire for his comment questioning Senator McCain's heroism as a prisoner of war. But According to a new \"Washington Post/ABC News\" poll, he still holds 24 percent of Republicans support. The largest lead recorded by any GOP candidate this year. Although this number is strong, it must be noted that this poll was finalized before coverage of his comment about Senator McCain became widespread.</p><p/><p>But the headlines did not stop there. The \"Des Moines Register\", Iowa's largest newspaper is now calling on Trump to drop out of the 2016 race saying quote \"Trump should pull the plug on his bloviating sideshow\". Alright Mercedes, some pretty strong words from the key primary state's newspaper. Look, I mean leading in the polls, I'll be it, that was before these most recent comments. Everybody's talking about him. I mean, what have - what is he currently doing for the race?</p><p/><p>MERCEDES COLWIN, ATTORNEY: I mean, certainly he's the game changer because you don't know what he's going to say next. He plays by the rules, he says what's on his mind. There really isn't that much --</p><p/><p>SMITH: The \"Des Moines Register\" calling for him to step out of the race.</p><p/><p>COLWIN: It's true because it's his third rail. When you start criticizing veterans, especially the GOP candidate, that is the third rail. You should not touch it. And certainly will it have traction? Who knows. But now that the media's doing --</p><p/><p>SMITH: Steve, how could he even let those words leave his mouth and not know that there was going to be a fire storm?</p><p/><p>STEVE CORTES, VERACRUZ: Well look, why? Because he's not a serious candidate and this is serious business by the way. The Unites States has slow growth, we're in a very dangerous world. This is no time for the bloviating and demagoguery of a reality show. And that's what <person><nameText>Donald Trump's </nameText></person>about. This is about building his brand. This isn't really about making America better. I believe he is - I agree completely with \"The Des Moines Register\". He is a political dirty bomb for the Republican party, particularly in terms of the party's outreach to Hispanics. He has told the largest emerging demographic group in America we think you're rapist, we don't want your support and a group, by the way, which is dying to be Republican.</p><p/><p>SMITH: To be fair, though, he found a sweet spot. He's polling well.</p><p/><p>CORTES: He has for now. But you know, asking a poll right now about the 2016 race is like asking a 5-year old at July what do you want for Christmas. There is going to be so many changes between now and the race. Remember in the last cycle how many different people had the front runners status at one time or another, had a cup of coffee as the front runner.</p><p/><p>SMITH: So Mercedes, the question had been is <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>going to help or hurt the GOP party. I mean, there's just this deep bench there. And do you think it's going to help the party to have that many contenders?</p><p/><p>COLWIN: He is so polarized. Well, it's certainly not helpful that you have all these individuals that are on the platform. And you got, you need, especially the polls. It's at 24 percent now and I agree with you. I think it's going - we'll see what happens as it goes on. But frankly, he's got - Trump tremendous popularity and obviously he rates with the polls, but a lot of individuals are looking to him and saying you're not going to be like these other candidates. You're going to say what's on your mind. Maybe that's what this world needs.</p><p/><p>CORTES: I do think - listen, I will give him this. He clearly is striking a nerve out there in this country, but I think that nerve is because of sluggish growth. I think middle America feel squeezed and they should. They're wages are not rising, they're cost are rising dramatically particularly in terms of healthcare and education. So, there's a lot of angst out there. And a guy like this who will forcefully say exactly what he believes and appear to be kind of angry, I think that resonates.</p><p/><p>SMITH: What? That he'll be the greatest jobs President that ever lived? Alright. Well speaking of the deep bench by the way guys, we got to add this in here. Ohio<person><nameText>Governor John Kasich </nameText></person>set to jump into the 2016 White House race adding to the number of GOP candidates out there. Blake Burman has the latest in Washington for that. Blake?</p><p/><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FOX BUSINESS: Hi there Sandra. Good morning to you. John Kasich will indeed make it official in Ohio later today. Kasich is the current Governor of that swing state and the former Congressmen. In between those two stints, he also worked at Lehman Brothers. This would be Kasich's second attempt at a White House run and he'll start with a lot of ground to make up in a very crowded GOP field. Kasich currently polls in around one to two percent of support from Republicans. That puts him just outside the top 10 for now. The field for the moment appears to be set for the GOP. 16 candidates with either political or business name recognition. They'll be jockeying for separation as the debates begin in the upcoming weeks and the first votes are cast in Iowa, which is a little more than six months from now. Sandra?</p><p/><p>SMITH: Getting interesting. Alright.</p><p/><p>BURMAN: Certainly is.</p><p/><p>SMITH: Blake, thank you. Alright, gold prices, they're getting interesting as well. Prices there searching for some direction after plunging to the lowest level in five years on rate hike dears. Phil Flynn from the CME Group, he's joining us by phone this morning, bright and early Phil. This move in gold, everybody's watching it. Where does it go from here?</p><p/><p>PHIL FLYNN, PRICES FUTURES GROUP: You know, that's the big question Sandra and I agree with you. A lot of this is fears about the Fed raising interest rates, but this (INAUDIBLE) in gold may be the reason why the Fed can't. You know, a lot of people are asking questions whether this drop in the gold market could really, you know, be like a cancer to the rest of the commodities complex because it wasn't just gold they took a hit yesterday. We were seeing industrial metals across the board under pressure with the strong dollar. If we're getting into a situation where this drop in the gold market is signaling another round of deflation on the globe, it's going to make it very difficult for the Fed to start raising rates if these deflationary pressures are starting to rise.</p><p/><p>SMITH: So Steve, let me -- Phil, you're going to stay with us for a second. Steve, I look at gold prices at where they are right now. $1106 a troy ounce. My feeling is that they test $1000 an ounce, but you're the expert. Tell me.</p><p/><p>CORTES: Yes, well. I hope I'm an expert on something Sandra. But yes, listen. I completely agree. I think commodity deflation has been in a trench force for years and I think it's going to continue to be. I agree with Phil very much. I think that Fed is really put in a bind by this. Although they want to talk about raising rates this year, I'm not sure that they can. When you have commodities, broad commodities (INAUDIBLE) at decade lows. You have - and it's across the board. Sugar hit a six-year low yesterday. Gold - if it comes out of the ground basically, it's increasingly worth less. Whether it's agricultural metals, energy. So we're seeing broad-based deflation. I believe it's primarily because of China slowing and because of volatility in the Chinese market that is broadening throughout the globe. But that is not the backdrop under which the Fed probably gets aggressive raising rates.</p><p/><p>SMITH: You know and Phil, I keep talking about the U.S. dollar because everything that Steve just mentioned is denominated in the greenback. So, you get that strengthening in the U.S. dollar as we anticipate that first rate hike. You get a sell-off in commodities. That's a natural sort of process that's we're seeing play out there. We had a Fed President in this show yesterday say that that rate hike is likely coming by the end of this year. Where do you - what camp are you in as far as that first interest rate hike at this point?</p><p/><p>FLYNN: Well prior to yesterday's drop in gold, I thought the Fed was going to do it and it almost no matter what because they got through some of the biggest crisis's. You know, concerns about Greece, they were sidetracked. You know, the Chinese stock markets stabilized. So, I thought they had a chance to do it. But then, of course, that Sunday night, that drop in the commodities prices, that can change a complexion. You know, if we don't see stabilization in the commodities. This is going to really put a monkey wrench in the global economic recovery and if the Fed raises rates against the advice of the IMF and we start to really bad deflationary cycle that slows down the rest of the economy, (INAUDIBLE) make it very difficult for the market to move forward.</p><p/><p>SMITH: Alright. Good stuff Phil Flynn as gold sinks to yet more five-year lows. Commodities struggling across the board. Thank you for joining us this morning.</p><p/><p>Temperatures meanwhile rising across the country. We're facing a heat wave. Maria Molina is in the Fox weather center with the details and the latest on that. Maria?</p><p/><p>MARIA MOLINA, FOX WEATHER CENTER: It's hot outside.</p><p/><p>SMITH: Yes, I mean -</p><p/><p>MOLINA: Good morning. We're going to be seeing those temperatures climbing yet again today and that's in place across parts of the South, the south east and also after you head up the east coast along the I95 corridor. Take a look at some of these numbers today. So, these are the actual forecast temperatures. Forecast to reach 99 in Dallas, 100 Del Rio, farther east into the 90s as well across parts of the south east up unto places like New York City.</p><p/><p>But the problem is that when you factors in the humidity, it feels a lot hotter than what the thermometer reads. And this is what it's going to feel like coming up later on this afternoon. 106 degrees in Montgomery and also in Vicksberg and Atlanta's going to feel like 97. 108 degrees in Wilmington and farther north in Washington D.C., it's going to feel like 97 degrees out there as we head out the door. So, that's why we have heat advisories in effect out here across the south and also into the Carolinas and southeast Virginia. Excessive heat warnings in effect as well with those heat index value forecast to climb into the triple digits. Sandra?</p><p/><p>SMITH: Alright. Maria, thank you. Quick reaction from you guys. Hot weather across the country. Steve, mean, I'm a Midwest girl. I start to think about our crops and the agricultural market in the United States when temperatures like that. But I mean, just in general, this is a game changer. Retail, everything affected by these temperatures.</p><p/><p>CORTES: You know. It's interesting. After a couple of really harsh winters and by the way, companies got very used to blaming poor results during the winter on bad weather in the winter. It'll be interesting to see if they try to do that now in the summer.</p><p/><p>SMITH: Exactly.</p><p/><p>CORTES: I tend to think that blame it on the rain was a really bad song by Milli Vanilli. It was a bad excuse for economics. But well see, but yes, you know, obviously - maybe Al Gore was on to something. It's been pretty darn hot lately. Manhattan yesterday, I wondered if I was in Manhattan or if I was in Mecca, Saudi Arabia because it was near 100 degrees intense humidity. Clearly it's happening all over the country.</p><p/><p>COLWIN: But intense weather drives individuals out of this weather in into the stores. I mean - represent federated stores and they love this weather because the consumers are going in. They're going into shop. They're doing this to getting out of the hot weather.</p><p/><p>SMITH: I can already see the climate change conversations all over the general, the media, all over the different channels. I mean, this is the hottest summer they're saying on record. I mean, Mercedes, there are going to be big political talking points on that.</p><p/><p>COLWIN: Oh no. undoubtedly.</p><p/><p>SMITH: Accurate or not. Alright, well the NASDAQ notching it's third record close-in-a-row. Is this a sign that they could be approaching another tech bubble? We'll discuss that next and take a look at some of these other headlines that we're watching this morning in \"The Wall Street Journal\". Fed tells big banks to shrink, Toshiba's CEO felled by accounting scandal and shooting highlights online gun sales.</p><p/><p>(MUSIC PLAYING: \"IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT\" - BILLY JOEL)</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>SMITH: A fresh record for the NASDAQ this morning. The tech-heavy index closing yesterday at a record for third session-in-a-row sparking debates about whether we're approaching bubble territory. I should note that NASDAQ futures are the lone winner this morning pointing to another record on the open on Wall Street this morning. Here's what the St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bowler exclusively told our own Peter Barnes yesterday.</p><p/><p>(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)</p><p/><p>(INTERVIEW WITH ST. LOUIS FED RESERVE PRESIDENT PETER BARNES)</p><p/><p>(END AUDIO CLIP)</p><p/><p>SMITH: Hmnn. This is just as Apple, Microsoft, Yahoo! are gearing up to report results after the bell today. Steve, do you think that we have a tech bubble in our hand and should a Federal Reserve President be talking about the stock market like that?</p><p/><p>CORTES: Well, let me answer the second first. No, they should not be. And by the way, the Fed's record on prognostication has been pretty terrible is go all the way back down greenspan irrational exuberance. That was a great time to buy. Janet Yellen a year ago said more or less the same thing about biotechs. She got sectors specific, which I though was pretty strange. Biotech has soared ever since then. So, their forecasting ability is poor generally, specially when it come to stocks. Are we in a tech bubble? No, I don't believe so. But is it frothy? Yes. I absolutely think so. It's been quite a run. My problem -</p><p/><p>SMITH: What's the frothy based on?</p><p/><p>CORTES: Because is too narrow. My problem with the market is it's relying far too much on just a few names. So, names like Facebook, Netflix, Google are absolutely soaring right now. But Apple, which is going to report and by the way, I like Apple. I think it's relatively cheap. Apple, and this is very unusual, is not keeping pace with technology overall. Normally, Apple is the driver of the bus, is leading the tech party whether it's up or down. The fact that the general is not leading the army here, Apple in front of tech worries me that things are getting frothy, but is it a bubble, no.</p><p/><p>A bubble is the year 2000 when grandma owned the globe.com and pets.com and multi-billion-dollar valuations on companies that didn't make money. We're not there, we're not at that kind of leverage. But, is it a dangerous spot? Yes, I think so. Is it a spot to put new money to work? I do not believe that, no.</p><p/><p>SMITH: Interesting. So, Mercedes, from a consumer standpoint, I don't know. You look around, you walk around New York City and you feel like the market is saturated with Apple products. You know, you wonder do they have any tools left in the tool chest there. I mean, can they continue on this sort of pace? I mean, are we going to rush out to buy the next Apple product?</p><p/><p>COLWIN: It's amazing because certainly with the Iphone watch, people were just rushing to get - to purchase that and I think there's still that traction. People still looking for a technology. But, there are also a lot of individuals, especially the newer little tech companies. A lot of the start-up tech companies. They are inspired by these big, by the big tech companies. They're saying to themselves well, look at how much market share they have. We can take a slice of - even if we just take one percent of that market share. So, we see a lot of these little tech companies come a long and a lot of consumers look to them for the more interesting products out there.</p><p/><p>SMITH: So Steve, Apple's at $132 a share. You would say don't require it at these levels, but also don't sell it.</p><p/><p>CORTES: Yes, I would say. I would say this, I have no idea what they're going to do on earnings, but if it gets hit on earnings, I'd get very interested then because by most traditional metrics, even though this is a massively valued company in terms of its market value. By most market metrics, it's actually relatively cheap for a company that has this kind of growth. And so, and I think listen, their ability to innovate and I was a doubter once Steve Jobs had to step down. I was a doubter that necessarily new management take the baton and run and it sure seems they have. I know this is just anecdotal, but in my house, my wife and I have four kids. There were more apple products in our house than I think there are in an Apple store. So, I see it personally. I see it hands on how much kids gravitate to this stuff and user-friendly nature of it. And so, this is a pretty special company, but tech overall I think it's a time to be cautious.</p><p/><p>SMITH: Alright. Well don't forget to tune in today at 4:00 p.m. Eastern on \"After the battle\". Apple Chiptole, Microsoft, Yahoo!, all will be reporting results.

While stocks are watched this morning, Paypal coming off it's first trading day after the Ebay spin-off. Cheryl Casone is here that and other top stories. Good morning Cheryl.</p><p/><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS: Hey, good morning Sandra. Good morning everybody. Well the stock rising nearly six percent on the day Monday. It had jumped some 11 percent at one point in mid day trading. Take a look at what it's doing this morning, pointing to a little bit of a higher open even today, PYPL is the ticker. Already more than half a dozen research shops has a buy rating on this stock. And again, this stock should likely open higher at 9:30 a.m. Eastern time.</p><p/><p>Business booming for the NFL. Each team receiving $226.4 million dollars last year as part national revenue sharing. Most of the money comes from the league's television deals and the price tag was revealed when the Green Bay Packers released it's shares part of the team's earnings report. \\</p><p/><p>And finally, this video of South Carolina's Director of Public Safety, Leroy Smith going viral after Smith helped a white man wearing a racist T- shirt to the shade at the top of the statehouse steps on Saturday. Tensions were high in Charleston as supporters of the Ku Klux Klan and the Black Panthers clashed outside of the South Carolina capital. Sandra, Director Smith hopes this video going to be a catalyst for people to work towards overcoming hate and violence. And social media has been called one of the most powerful acts of kindness that you could witness.</p><p/><p>And it's interesting that the videos go viral because it really shows you the pulse of what's happening out in the nation and how people are really talking about race and very emotional about it right now.</p><p/><p>SMITH: Mercedes, what do you make of this?</p><p/><p>COLWIN: I mean. I think it's just absolutely beautiful, especially because racial tensions are so high. To that, there's no wonder that it's gone viral. There's people hoping. They want something. They want a change.</p><p/><p>CASONE: Well this is over the Confederate flag, by the way, as well. They we're pulling down the Confederate flag at that statehouse. And that's where this whole event happened. You know, all these states now across the country are having to face the issue.</p><p/><p>SMITH: Amazing story.</p><p/><p>CORTES: You know I have to say, this kindness by a African-American police officer for someone who clearly hate in his heart for him and to respond to that hate with love and with the kindness of his heart is really an inspiring act. I think it is emblematic though of what is going on in broader society. We're not a racist society. We're society that elected a black President twice. If anything, race relations were getting much better. By the way,. I worry that our President is harming race relations. For instance, this race database that's been unveiled this week. That's identity politics. That divides people rather than unites. So I think that in fact, though the American people are far more like that African- American police officer rather than that racist with the terrible T-shirt on.</p><p/><p>CASONE: That's a good point. Sandra and I yesterday were so surprised yesterday about Martin O'Malley, you know? I remember him (INAUDIBLE) Well why? What did he say that was so wrong? Why are people so upset about that. And that the question is have we gone too far?</p><p/><p>SMITH: You said it best. Tensions and emotions are running high on this subject right now in this country. Has been for quite some time. Alright guys. Thank you much and thank you, Cheryl. We'll see you again in just a little bit. Meanwhile, dozens dead after a terror attack in Turkey near the Syrian border.

The bombing is believed to have been a suicide attack carried out by an ISIS militant. And my next guest says this ISIS attack on Turkey was only a matter of time. Joining me now is <person><nameText>FOX News </nameText></person>National Security Analyst Katie McFarland. Good morning for you Katie.</p><p/><p>KATIE MCFARLAND, <person><nameText>FOX NEWS </nameText></person>NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST: Good morning.</p><p/><p>SMITH: Thank you for being here bright and early. Unfortunately, some horrible news here, but now Turkey?</p><p/><p>MCFARLAND: Yeah. And it's only a matter of time. Why? For a couple of reasons. One, ISIS to be considered the vanguard movement of radical Islam has to keep moving. It can't just consolidate its gains. It's got to keep growing. So you've seen it in Afghanistan, you've seen attacks in Northern Africa, now you're seeing Turkey. So it had to expand over the border.</p><p/><p>When I've met with the president of Iraq last year, and he said, you know, they had feel the Islamic State, ISIS feels they have been chosen by Allah to rule the world. So in mere minds they've got to keep expanding. Number two, this is how they do it. They start with suicide bombers, they get into an area, they then recruit locally, they send in Jihadi fighters, then they start an insurgency with the idea that they're going to then eventually claim territory and join it up with the Islamic State.</p><p/><p>But the reason I figure that it was going to be Turkey, rather than other places sooner or later, Turkey has a very poorest border. We have seen, you know, the stories of all the foreign fighters that were coming from...</p><p/><p>SMITH: Yup.</p><p/><p>MCFARLAND: ... you know, hundreds of countries. They were going to fight with ISIS. They were coming through that Turkish border, that same place where the attack was. Similarly, they have come out the ISIS fighters and refugees have come out of that region through Turkey then expand into Greece and to Europe. In the refugee pact, it's been faltered (ph) with Jihadists...</p><p/><p>SMITH: So you said that this was sort of expected...</p><p/><p>MCFARLAND: Yeah.</p><p/><p>SMITH: ... but now that it happened, how much of a game changer is this?</p><p/><p>MCFARLAND: Now, we have to see what Turkey does. Is Turkey going to put up the fight? They have famously last year in the Battle for Kobane, which is the big city near there on the other side of the Turkish border, the ISIS took Turkish tanks sat on the Turkish border and they watched as ISIS came in, took the town, slaughtered the Kurdish population there. So will Turkey join the battle? Will the Turkey join the battle in Syria and Iraq that, you know, the Islamic State? Or will Turkeys just say I'm going to defend our borders? Will Turkey tighten up its borders? And then the other question is what role does NATO play? You know, where are the NATO alliance? Turkey is a NATO ally. Will they take this as an attack against Turkey and call for help from the NATO ally?</p><p/><p>SMITH: We're always talking about how ISIS is staying so powerful.</p><p/><p>MCFARLAND: Yeah.</p><p/><p>SMITH: I mean, what is the latest on the amount of money that they have been able to raise or make, I should say, on the black market with oil? And I mean, what kind of money are they dealing with today? Are they still able to pull in as much as they were before?</p><p/><p>MCFARLAND: Yeah.</p><p/><p>SMITH: Are they're still strengthening in such large numbers?</p><p/><p>MCFARLAND: The interesting thing is to save money for ISIS came probably from some wealthy Gulf Arab families, not countries families, and that's what started them.</p><p/><p>When my experience with Iraq has been what happened at the end of the Iraq war was the Saddam Hussein fighters, (inaudible) in the Iraqi army married up with these radical Islamic extremists and that's what form the core of ISIS. So they received money from the Gulf Arabs, but when they started taking territory they eluded a lot of the antiquities and they sold these on the open market. The next thing was they then got ahold of oil refineries and then they sold those.</p><p/><p>SMITH: And there's always the money angle that you're watching on there.</p><p/><p>STEVE CORTES, VERACRUZ LLC FOUNDER: No. And I do think there's a business angle of this, not to sound callous because it's a real human tragedy, but there is a business angle and I think it's United States defense firms. We live in an incredibly dangerous world. There is bipartisan agreement. The Democrats (inaudible) of defense spending just about as much as Republicans do, which isn't the norm. There's been a lot of M&amp;A and deals in the space. Lockheed Martin's stock that's really taken off in the last few weeks. So I think in a dangerous world as an investor, the defense sector remains very, very attractive.</p><p/><p>SMITH: And then there's obviously, Mercedes, the questions about U.S. involvement and cooperation with Turkey on this.</p><p/><p>MERCEDES COLWIN, <person><nameText>FOX NEWS </nameText></person>CONTRIBUTOR: Oh no, undoubtedly. So we'll have to see how it sort of plays out, but this is certainly something to watch and we'll see how (inaudible).</p><p/><p>SMITH: All right. Katie McFarland...</p><p/><p>MCFARLAND: Thank you San (ph). Thank you.</p><p/><p>SMITH: ... thank you for joining us this morning on that.</p><p/><p>And 3D piracy has become a big issue in Hollywood. Nicole Petallides is here with that story. Good morning Nicole.</p><p/><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX AM CO-HOST: Good morning Sandra. This is a business story, a text story, the rise of 3D printers is a problem for Hollywood. The printers allow anyone who owns them to build products such as the Stormtrooper gun (ph) from Star Wars, and their own without even buying a toy. They can make it on their own doing this would actually lose money from movie studios who make these products to get a profit of course. It could also force the studios to charge less for the items, so they can be more attractive to the consumers.</p><p/><p>So, this is a problem that is very similar to music piracy that was around in the early 2000s which forced the music industry to change. And so what we're watching, we've seen piracy. We've seen it with the records, right, and music when the (inaudible) of the artist come out with new music. We've seen illegally copied movies. And now, you talk about the products and you know so well the products, that's how these they make so much money off of these, Hasbro for example, even yesterday talked about the Star Wars products, the X-Men products just to name a few. So your thoughts, I mean, 3D printing is all the way.</p><p/><p>SMITH: So Mercedes, it sounds like a legal question to me.</p><p/><p>COLWIN: Oh yeah.</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>SMITH: What can the movie studios do to stop this?</p><p/><p>COLWIN: Well, this is great, because what they can do is first, they're going to start sending up these letters. They have to discover who is actually printing these letters, so if they're selling. Who knows if they're printing it and they're creating these products, if they're selling it, send out those letters, cease and desist letters. They lawyer up immediately. They bring in the court system, and they said, \"Of course, we are losing so much money.\"</p><p/><p>And by the way, because it's immediate -- there's an immediate loss, you can go in for temporary restraining order, with the court say, \"You have(ph) to stop this immediately,\" and that's when the penalties step in. And then, of course, you got the D.A.'s office, again, that's how it's stopped with an answer. Get the prosecutors involved, tell them that they are doing this illegally, get prosecutors to start doing it and get one with those cases and that's how will do it.</p><p/><p>CORTES: Right. And that's a great legal point and I don't doubt that all of the studios will be really effective but I will say on a business angle, a technology angle, 3D printing to me is just transformative technology. And I think long term because what people do in their home is going to be very hard to enforce, right, to interdict, they are printing something in their house. And I think the 3D printing all of the stocks have been miserably, and I'm not saying investing in necessarily right now.</p><p/><p>COLWIN: Right.</p><p/><p>SMITH: So you bring that up...</p><p/><p>PETALLIDES: Right.</p><p/><p>SMITH: That's an interesting point because everybody told us over the past couple of years that 3D printing was the wave of the future...</p><p/><p>COLWIN: Right.</p><p/><p>SMITH: ... everyone is going to be doing it, everyone is going to have these in their homes and they're going to be printing everything from...</p><p/><p>PETALLIDES: I don't know. I don't know.</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>COLWIN: I don't know.</p><p/><p>SMITH: Now, literally, I mean, I remember on Varney's show we had 3D printers coming in and making shoes...</p><p/><p>CORTES: Right.</p><p/><p>COLWIN: Yeah.</p><p/><p>SMITH: But I don't have one in my house. Do you guys have a 3D printer in your house?</p><p/><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: No.</p><p/><p>CORTES: Right.</p><p/><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yeah.</p><p/><p>SMITH: It just the story never really came to fruition.</p><p/><p>CORTES: But we often get excited in a market. We often get excited about technology before it's a reality. If for instance, we talked really about the tech bubble. The tech bubble in the year 2000, we got far too excited...</p><p/><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Right.</p><p/><p>CORTES: ... too early about the internet. But that doesn't mean that the internet didn't become transformative...</p><p/><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: That's true. That's true.</p><p/><p>CORTES: ... and there are companies that made it like Google became absolute guerrillas.</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>PETALLIDES: In 3D, one last thing, I will tell you one last thing. Some of the movie studios are actually embracing those 3D printing enthusiasts and sending them codes so they can actually make something. And so hope -- maybe that -- maybe the other way to go with it instead of trying to prosecute and figure out who conceptualize this, who printed it, who, you know, wrote the code.</p><p/><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Right.</p><p/><p>PETALLIDES: Maybe it's the other way around in trying actually to get it out there yourself and sell those code files and make some money. Yeah.</p><p/><p>SMITH: I should say that to be sure here is that at a commercial level, the 3D printers are being used...</p><p/><p>CORTES: Right.</p><p/><p>SMITH: ... much more than I think that what we're seeing at the consumer level...</p><p/><p>CORTES: Right.</p><p/><p>SMITH: ... for now at least.</p><p/><p>All right, Nicole, thank you.</p><p/><p>PETALLIDES: All right.</p><p/><p>SMITH: All right, don't forget to start your day with Nicole, Lauren Simonetti, and me on FBN:AM, every morning at 5:00 a.m. Catch us right here on the Fox Business Network. We're here bright and early get you ready for your day.</p><p/><p>Meanwhile, coming up, startling new numbers about the class of 2015 and the major issue that could follow them for the rest of their lives.

By 2017, listen to this, the retailer will overtake Macy's Department Store, the top retailer in the U.S. That's according to our report released by Cowen and Company yesterday. Amazon is offering brands like Gucci, Kate Spade and Levis but doesn't have to pay overhead costs for retail stores.</p><p/><p>All right, Cowen's upgraded Amazon to outperform and forecast the company's growth merchandize value in apparel and accessories to grow to over $27 billion in 2017 that would top Macy's.</p><p/><p>Steve, we had another great report on Amazon's potential. Are you in agreement here? Is the environment's still good for Amazon?</p><p/><p>CORTES: Well, yes and no. I'm in agreement, yes, because I think Amazon is an incredible company and I think they have created barriers to entry because of how much they have spent on technology, on infrastructure that it's very, very difficult to become a competitor to Amazon.</p><p/><p>Now, I wish the company cared more about making money. That bothers me as an investor. But I will disagree with the thesis that it's going to become such an apparel powerhouse. Because I think, apparel is the one spot where online commerce is pretty challenged. I would tell you personally, I certainly don't want to buy at least expensive clothes, you know, to buy sort of the commodity, apparel item is fine. But to buy expensive clothes online, if you can't feel it, touched or tried on, I think there going to be challenge there. I love the company but I don't think this is the reasons to love this.</p><p/><p>SMITH: You clearly are not shopping online then, because...</p><p/><p>COLWIN: Yes</p><p/><p>SMITH: ... everybody is buying clothes online now.</p><p/><p>COLWIN: Exactly.</p><p/><p>SMITH: I mean, people don't want to go into the stores. They don't want to try clothes on. And when Amazon or Zappos and all these, you know, delivery sites, when they make it so easy to return...</p><p/><p>COLWIN: That's it.</p><p/><p>SMITH: ... that's really key.</p><p/><p>COLWIN: That's a key to it. It's just the return policy. If you give me a box where I can ship it back or give me a label I can ship it back, great, I'm going to purchase from you. So gone are the days since you're going to go in into those fitting rooms, into the stores where there's crowds and there's all sorts of issues that when you actually step into mall, they don't want that. They don't want the hassle. It's so much easier to do it online.</p><p/><p>SMITH: Steve, your wife must do all the shopping?</p><p/><p>COLWIN: Yeah.</p><p/><p>CORTES: Yeah, that's true. Right.</p><p/><p>COLWIN: People don't need the Brooks Brothers.</p><p/><p>SMITH: Oh men, Amazon's shares, by the way, of 57 percent this year alone. So that climb continues.</p><p/><p>New details emerging about the dark past of the Tennessee gunman who killed five American servicemen. Cheryl Casone is here with the latest headlines on that story for us this morning, Cheryl.</p><p/><p>CHERYL CASONE, NEWS ANCHOR: Hey, good morning Sandra. You have a gunman behind that Chattanooga terror attack reportedly wrote about becoming a martyr. Reports said that Mohammad Abdulazeez also wrote about committing suicide after he lost a job two years ago because of drug abuse. The 24- year-old opened fire at two military facilities on Thursday killing four marines and a sailor before he was killed by police.</p><p/><p>A massive corporate scandal in Japan, Toshiba's CEO has resigned after investigators linked him to an accounting scandal. The probe (ph) found the electronics giant overstated profits by more than $1.2 billion over seven years.</p><p/><p>And finally, new outrage over the staggering amount of student loan debt in America. The New York feds says American students are in debt to the tune of $1.2 trillion. That equals $35,000 for every student who graduated this year of to $2,000 from last year.</p><p/><p>OK, Sandra, we know the Class 2015 are going to be the most indebted class at American history. And it's not just them that are getting kind of the screws frankly, it's their parents because these kids are getting out of school, they're so saddled with debt, they're not making any money, the wages are down and they can't move out of the house. And then that parent is now dealing with trying to get the kid out of the house and their elderly parents are coming in. It's a crisis.</p><p/><p>SMITH: And it's affecting, Cheryl, every aspects of the economy, Steve. I mean, if they're coming out of a school with this much debt, then they're not buying homes...</p><p/><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Right.</p><p/><p>SMITH: ... they're choosing to get...</p><p/><p>CORTES: Right.</p><p/><p>SMITH: ... married much later, they're not buying cars. That whole economic cycle that has been over the past many decades is no longer...</p><p/><p>CORTES: Right. This is -- listen, this is the sad unintended consequences of government policy, right? This is central planning, I think, at its absolute worst. When the government gets involved in any business or service, prices go up and the quality of that service goes down. That is certainly happened in terms of college.</p><p/><p>So the price has skyrocketed, people borrow more and more but the degree they earn is generally worth less and less. So this is really a problem. I mean, this is -- when I graduated college, I did not have any money, I had to go live at home for a couple of months, I could not wait to get...</p><p/><p>SMITH: Right.</p><p/><p>CORTES: I was sleeping in the bunk bed that I grew up in as a 22-year-old male.</p><p/><p>CASONE: So, I guess, your stand is we should not forgive student loan debt in anyway. She had (ph) perform...</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>SMITH: I mean, Mercedes, that's what they're talking about, is the government talks about just wiping out the student loan debt.</p><p/><p>COLWIN: Right.</p><p/><p>SMITH: Are they probably making the situation even worst than worst?</p><p/><p>COLWIN: Oh, undoubtedly, because who's going to pay the -- ultimately, all of us is taxpayers. I mean, what are you doing? It's such a...</p><p/><p>CORTES: And the point is...</p><p/><p>COLWIN: And it is a tragedy to these kids. You're talking about $60,000 a year tuition. You're talking about the highest...</p><p/><p>SMITH: Yeah.</p><p/><p>COLWIN: ... number of individuals that are unemployed. These kids coming out of graduates out of schools are 40 to 50 percent unemployed. You don't hear about that but this is the truth. They can't get job.</p><p/><p>SMITH: All right. Well, thank you for that enlightening story this morning, Cheryl.</p><p/><p>CASONE: Of course.</p><p/><p>SMITH: Thank you for brightening our 6:00 a.m. hour.</p><p/><p>CASONE: Yeah.</p><p/><p>SMITH: A new pullout, morning diet programs like Weight Watchers and Jenny Craig won't work for the majority of their obese clients trying to reach normal weight. We've got the details, the latest study on that next.</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>SMITH: A new study published in the American Journal of Public Health suggests that most obese Americans who do not get some kind of surgery will never -- (inaudible) for us for Dagen.</p><p/><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS: This is a national health crisis and it's also a financial crisis...</p><p/><p>SMITH: Yeah.</p><p/><p>CDOWELL: ... we should point out. This is a study again and published according to -- we're talking about the body mass index in American Journal of Public Health, that the probability of obese people reaching normal weight is less than 1 percent. And here, the numbers 1 in 210 obese men have a probability of reaching a normal weight, this is without any kind of surgery, 1 in 124 obese women.</p><p/><p>You get a morbid obesity which is an even larger body mass index. Those odds go down to 1 in 1,290 men and 1 in 677 women. So it becomes nearly impossible to get down to a normal weight once you become obese or morbidly obese. And you want to talk about the cost, more than 305 billion in direct and indirect cost of obesities annually in terms of lost productivity, the increased health care cost.</p><p/><p>And people complain about the government cracking down trying to change what we eat and how we eat, calorie contents on menus, and the like, but there is going to be a whole lot more of that. You have more government in your health care and then you have a population that is increasingly overweight and will probably stay that way. You will have a government that essentially tells you what to eat.</p><p/><p>SMITH: I mean, it's crazy...</p><p/><p>MCDOWELL: Because if the government is funding your health care and your health care costs are related to obesity, it becomes the government's problem. We are asking for it as a country unless we get the...</p><p/><p>CORTES: They -- yeah. We...</p><p/><p>COLWIN: It is a bigger issue too because all these individuals that are morbidly obese actually have protections under discrimination law. So you're binding employers even greater saying, \"Oh no, you can't fire an individual plan (ph) that's been out and extend the period of time.\" You can't accommodate that individual.</p><p/><p>MCDOWELL: On disability too, where...</p><p/><p>COLWIN: Exactly right.</p><p/><p>MCDOWELL: . excessively overweight.</p><p/><p>CORTES: Do you think that as being the government intervention that we're going to see syntaxes, the kinds of things we now see on alcohol and tobacco? Is that coming to butter and sugar or are we going to see that in the future?</p><p/><p>MCDOWELL: Well, certainly, the -- some types of crackdowns, it's hard to do that though, but I think that with Mayor Bloomberg here trying to limit the size of soda (ph) you can buy, that was shut down, that didn't happen. But, as the government funds more of your health care, and I'm talking specifically about Medicare but you have...</p><p/><p>SMITH: Come on. Do you think the impacts have really changed behavior?</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>CORTES: ... won't do it but the...</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>MCDOWELL: ... on cigarettes. So, cigarettes have -- are so expensive in so many areas that it reduces the amount that people do smoke if not the number of smokers.</p><p/><p>SMITH: Well, that has gotten enough. So, I mean, I haven't looked into lately but a pack of cigarettes in Manhattan...</p><p/><p>MCDOWELL: It's about 10 bucks.</p><p/><p>COLWIN: $10.</p><p/><p>SMITH: Oh, I think it's probably even more than that.</p><p/><p>COLWIN: Yes.</p><p/><p>(Inaudible)</p><p/><p>SMITH: Anyway -- all right. Well, thank you Dagen for bringing...</p><p/><p>MCDOWELL: Thank you.</p><p/><p>SMITH: ... at least (ph) on that study.</p><p/><p>All right. We'll see you in a little bit. And thank you to Steve Cortes and Mercedes for joining us for the 6:00 a.m. hour full of energy.</p><p/><p>COLWIN: Thank you.</p><p/><p>SMITH: So really, good morning.

Committee members heard from parties that claimed that more regulation is necessary to prevent big tech from controlling content as well as those who argued that statewide regulations could actually harm the marketplace.Professor Felix Chang, the co-director of the Corporate Law Center at the University of Cincinnati College of Law, told the committee that a person in a rural area will not often have access to more than one or two potential internet service providers. Because of the lack of options, a company may be able to run a monopoly that determines the type of content a person can access. </p><p>As an example, Chang noted that the Comcast-Time Warner merger could slow access to Google because the company holds stock in Hulu. This, he said, would benefit their company by gutting access to an opponent's service.David Chaver, the president and CEO of News Media Alliance, warned that the growth of big tech is a threat to the news industry. Tech giants, he said, follow algorithms that can suppress brands, control data or refuse to recognize quality journalism.Print newspaper circulation is dropping significantly, and many small newspapers are going out of business, Chavern said. He said the unprecedented control coming from tech giants has made it difficult for any news outlet to build a sustainable business model.Others testified the opposite, arguing that the internet has led to innovation that has allowed smaller voices to be more easily heard.Carl Szabo, vice president and general counsel for NetChoice, said that the American model for looking into antitrust laws is whether consumers are being harmed; he said that generally, the government will step aside because the most hardworking and most successful will typically win out.Szabo pointed to the ice bucket challenge as an example, which helped raise money for cancer research. He also said that the internet has provided the means for many different social media platforms, citing the rise of TikTok, Discord and Snapchat.Older concerns about monopolistic power usually fade away with time as innovation pushes them aside, Szabo said. He pointed toward unfounded fears such as a social media monopoly from Myspace, a monopoly of video rentals from the Blockbuster-Hollywood Video merger, and a search engine monopoly from Yahoo. Chris Grimm, president of the Connected Commerce Council, argued that the tech giants have made life easier for many small businesses and warned that regulations could make life more difficult for them.'Small business tells a simple and straightforward story - that large, data-intensive digital platforms such as Google, Amazon, Etsy, eBay, Yelp, Pinterest, TripAdvisor, Walmart.com[1], Houzz, QuickBooks and many more - benefit their businesses, help them compete, and accelerate their success,' he testified. 'They help small businesses start, grow and succeed in previously unimaginable ways - not only locally but globally.'The attorney general in almost every state, including Ohio, has launched an investigation into alleged anti-competitive practices of Google. Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost has also joined a multistate investigation into alleged anti-competitive practices from Facebook. The U.S. Justice Department has launched investigations into Google, Facebook, Apple and other companies accused of violating antitrust laws.The European Union recently fined Google  1.5 billion (more than $1.6 billion) for antitrust violations. The EU is also investigating whether Facebook's Libra Currency violates antitrust laws.Google and Facebook have stated that they do not violate antitrust laws.

Committee members heard from parties that claimed that more regulation is necessary to prevent big tech from controlling content as well as those who argued that statewide regulations could actually harm the marketplace.Professor Felix Chang, the co-director of the Corporate Law Center at the University of Cincinnati College of Law, told the committee that a person in a rural area will not often have access to more than one or two potential internet service providers. Because of the lack of options, a company may be able to run a monopoly that determines the type of content a person can access. </p><p>As an example, Chang noted that the Comcast-Time Warner merger could slow access to Google because the company holds stock in Hulu. This, he said, would benefit their company by gutting access to an opponent's service.David Chaver, the president and CEO of News Media Alliance, warned that the growth of big tech is a threat to the news industry. Tech giants, he said, follow algorithms that can suppress brands, control data or refuse to recognize quality journalism.Print newspaper circulation is dropping significantly, and many small newspapers are going out of business, Chavern said. He said the unprecedented control coming from tech giants has made it difficult for any news outlet to build a sustainable business model.Others testified the opposite, arguing that the internet has led to innovation that has allowed smaller voices to be more easily heard.Carl Szabo, vice president and general counsel for NetChoice, said that the American model for looking into antitrust laws is whether consumers are being harmed; he said that generally, the government will step aside because the most hardworking and most successful will typically win out.Szabo pointed to the ice bucket challenge as an example, which helped raise money for cancer research. He also said that the internet has provided the means for many different social media platforms, citing the rise of TikTok, Discord and Snapchat.Older concerns about monopolistic power usually fade away with time as innovation pushes them aside, Szabo said. He pointed toward unfounded fears such as a social media monopoly from Myspace, a monopoly of video rentals from the Blockbuster-Hollywood Video merger, and a search engine monopoly from Yahoo. Chris Grimm, president of the Connected Commerce Council, argued that the tech giants have made life easier for many small businesses and warned that regulations could make life more difficult for them.'Small business tells a simple and straightforward story - that large, data-intensive digital platforms such as Google, Amazon, Etsy, eBay, Yelp, Pinterest, TripAdvisor, Walmart.com[1], Houzz, QuickBooks and many more - benefit their businesses, help them compete, and accelerate their success,' he testified. 'They help small businesses start, grow and succeed in previously unimaginable ways - not only locally but globally.'The attorney general in almost every state, including Ohio, has launched an investigation into alleged anti-competitive practices of Google. Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost has also joined a multistate investigation into alleged anti-competitive practices from Facebook. The U.S. Justice Department has launched investigations into Google, Facebook, Apple and other companies accused of violating antitrust laws.The European Union recently fined Google \u20ac1.5 billion (more than $1.6 billion) for antitrust violations. The EU is also investigating whether Facebook's Libra Currency violates antitrust laws.Google and Facebook have stated that they do not violate antitrust laws.

Such partnerships, the worker told Nadella, were accelerating the oil companies' greenhouse gas emissions.</p><p>Microsoft and other tech giants have been competing with one another to strike lucrative partnerships with ExxonMobil, Chevron, Shell, BP and other energy firms, in many cases supplying them not just with remote data storage but also artificial intelligence tools for pinpointing better drilling spots or speeding up refinery production.</p><p>The oil and gas industry is spending roughly $20 billion each year on cloud services, which accounts for about 10% of the total cloud market, according to Vivek Chidambaram, a managing director of Accenture's energy consultancy. It's not yet clear whether the extraction industry is getting its money's worth, although experts remain bullish about the application of advanced technology to oil and gas exploration.</p><p>Nadella sought to assuage employee concerns at the Sept. 12 meeting, first by reiterating Microsoft's internal efforts on environmental sustainability, according to the workers, who asked for anonymity because they feared retaliation for speaking about an internal meeting. The employees said Nadella also defended Microsoft's energy partners, pointing out their investments in researching and developing more sustainable energy production methods.</p><p>\"There's no fossil fuel CEO who sits there and says, 'You know, I'm just gonna deny climate change,'\" Nadella said, according to the employees' transcript of his remarks. \"If anything, they're all saying, 'Let us have, in fact, the regulation, the pricing mechanisms that get us to this future.'\"</p><p>Microsoft said in an emailed statement this week that it is \"focused on helping companies of all kinds become more efficient, including energy companies.\" It declined to comment on Nadella's remarks, which were part of a regularly scheduled \"all-hands\" gathering in which the CEO welcomes questions on a range of topics.</p><p>Less than a week after that exchange and days before a planned worldwide protest over climate change, Microsoft announced yet another major deal for its Azure cloud computing platform - this time with Chevron and oilfield services giant Schlumberger. The timing of the announcement ahead of the climate protest and United Nations climate action meetings angered some environmentally-minded Microsoft workers and caught the attention of outsiders.</p><p>\"It is unconscionable that amid global climate protests, tech giants like Microsoft are announcing major partnerships with Big Oil,\" said Democratic presidential candidate and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, in a tweet that coincided with the Sept. 20 global climate strike. \"We must hold them accountable, demand they break ties with the fossil fuel industry, and move rapidly to sustainable energy.\"</p><p>Echoing that message was a small group of Microsoft employees who carried cardboard signs to a lunchtime protest that day outside of Microsoft's headquarters in Redmond, Washington. \"No Azure For Oil,\" said one of the signs.</p><p>After months of employee activism, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos said he was pushing his company to the forefront on sustainability, committing it to have 100% of its energy use come from solar panels and other renewable energy by 2030. But he also defended Amazon's work with the oil and gas industry, arguing that \"we need to help them instead of vilify them.\"</p><p>Some experts say AI and cloud services could actually play a role in curbing emissions.</p><p>Denying cloud computing services to the oil and gas industry would do little to address the bigger problem of the world's ongoing dependence on fossil fuels, said Aseem Prakash, director of the Center for Environmental Politics at the University of Washington.</p><p>\"We would not want to collapse the fossil fuel industry,\" Prakash said. \"We would want a soft landing.\"</p><p>If anything, he said, an oil company's shift to another company's cloud platform may have some environmental benefits because it is more efficient than running its digital operations on its own servers. Driving down costs could also help open the door to investments in other, less polluting methods for generating energy.</p><p>It's less clear whether AI is mitigating pollution or worsening it. In their pitches to work with oil and gas companies, cloud providers such as Amazon and Microsoft have boasted of advanced machine-learning tools that can sift through huge troves of geologic and seismic data to help make decisions about where to extract resources. IDC oil analyst Gaurav Verma said AI is a critical technology for oil and gas companies that want to learn from that data to study oil reservoirs or predict when maintenance is needed on a pipeline.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BISTRB-9471828</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BISTRB2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X6J-K1M1-JCM7-R183-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">164263</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"868\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Bismarck Tribune, a division of Lee Enterprises All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Bismarck Tribune</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 5, 2019 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0002C1P</classCode><className>EXXON MOBIL CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0001ZX8</classCode><className>ACCENTURE PLC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Good  morning to you, and happy Tuesday.  Good morning, everyone.  Thank you for  joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Tuesday, December 18th.  Your  top stories right now just before 6:00 a.m. on the East Coast. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Investors finding their footing today, take a look.  A little stabilization  going on after another rough day yesterday.  Futures indicating a higher  opening this morning for the broader averages, Dow Industrials set to open  up better than 60 points, quarter of a percent.  S&amp;P is up quarter of a  percent, and the NASDAQ with 23-point move higher up a third of a percent.   This after a sharp selloff on Wall Street yesterday.  All the major indices  declined better than two percent on the session on global growth concerns  along with interest rates moving higher.  The Federal Reserve's two-day  meeting getting underway today.  We are expecting the Fed to raise rates on  Wednesday.  Industrial Average yesterday down 507 points, better than two  percent.  The NASDAQ down 157 points yesterday.  </p><p>In Europe this morning, mixed story, take a look at the indices.  The FT- 100 is down 29 points, CAC Quarante is down seven, but the DAX Index in  Germany is higher, it's up 24 points right now, quarter of a percent.  And  in Asia overnight, declines across the board, worst performer there, Japan,  Nikkei Average down almost two percent.  We're watching the price of oil  this morning, crude oil under pressure, down two and three-quarters  percent, falling below $50.00 a barrel yesterday for the first time in over  a year.</p><p>Then this, Les Moonves denied severance.  CBS announcing its former will  not reserve the $120 million package he was supposed to.  The details on  the board's decision here coming up.  New questions, meanwhile, surrounding  Elon Musk.  His Boring Company now under scrutiny over its financial ties  to SpaceX, another musk-led venture.  It comes as the company gears up to  unveil a test tunnel today. </p><p>And the Saints march on.  New Orleans beating the Panthers last night  crushing Carolina's playoff hopes.  We've got all the sports details for  you.  The tone getting political as well with one Panthers player featuring  Colin Kaepernick on his cleats.  All those stories coming up this Tuesday  morning.  And joining me to break to all down, FOX Business Network's Dagen  McDowell, Forbes Media Chairman and Former Republican Presidential  Candidate, Steve Forbes, and 32 Advisors CEO, Former Economic Adviser to  President Obama, Robert Wolf is here.  Great to see you this morning.  </p><p>ROBERT WOLF, 32 ADVISORS CEO &amp; FORMER ECONOMIC ADVISOR TO PRESIDENT OBAMA:   Great morning.  </p><p>STEVE FORBES, FORBES MEDIA CHAIRMAN AND FORMER REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL  CANDIDATE:  Good to be here.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Morning.  </p><p>FORBES:  And those futures -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p>FORBES:  -- after a thousand-point fall, yes, we like the green, but we'd  like to see more green. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  For sure.  What is going on, Steve?  This month has been one of  the worst months we've seen in terms of markets.  </p><p>FORBES:  Everyone suddenly has become pessimistic, the concern about trade,  very, very real, you know, it's nice vibrations coming out, but people now  want to see a real deal.  This is holding back capital expenditures, U.S.  economy starting to show signs of slowing down.  If we get this trade thing  out of the way, you'll see the U.S. pick up and you'll start to see finally  next year, Europe making serious structural changes -- </p><p>WOLF:  Yes.  </p><p>FORBES:  -- in their economies just as it happened in 1980s when Ronald  Reagan showed the way in the U.S.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p>FORBES:  Within a few years, Maria, 50 countries reduced sharply their  taxes. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow, OK.  </p><p>WOLF:  Yes, I -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So you want to see a deal with China?  That's the big sticking  point. </p><p>FORBES:  I want to see -- yes, that's the big one.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.  </p><p>WOLF:  And I think their incredible headwinds geopolitically, I mean Brexit  -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p>WOLF:  -- highly unlikely it's going to take place as is.  Germany slowing,  France we will talk about what's going on there.  China's slowing -- so the  -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Italy, budget issues. </p><p>WOLF:  So I think all around us, you know, we're doing so much better, but  it eventually impacts a little, too, but I think right now, there's also  incredible anxiety coming in with the Democratic house and the, you know,  and the President, you know.  Hopefully, we can get back to work as opposed  to just keep on attacking each other but -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p>WOLF:  -- it feels like that's not working too well right now either. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's true.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  A lot of uncertainty over that. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  The Wall Street Journal Editorial Page, we'll discuss this as  the morning move on, but time for a Fed pause -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And they lay out the case for pausing and I know Steve is going  to agree with -- maybe agree with that, I don't know.  But then also I  would argue that it's hard to quantify this, but the Mueller Probe -- </p><p>WOLF:  Yes.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- is weighing on markets as well.  We saw it during the Ken  Starr investigation into President Bill Clinton in the -- in the months  leading up.  There was a lot of other things going on, long-term capital  management collapsed, which I know that you know well.  But, again, it was  on the margin.  It was -- </p><p>WOLF:  Real lack of confidence in the system right now. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- adding through the -- yes.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I think you're right. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Absolutely.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I think, you know, this -- the president is being investigated  in all corners of his life -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- right now.  You've got the Democratic majority coming in in  the new congress.  People don't know where this is going. </p><p>FORBES:  Well, they want to -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So -- </p><p>FORBES:  -- do the political equivalent of killing him by a thousand cuts.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's right.  </p><p>FORBES:  Now a big thing, but just every part of his life.  </p><p>WOLF:  And then lastly -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, and markets know that.</p><p>WOLF: Yes.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And I think you're absolutely right about that. </p><p>WOLF:  And one topic we'll speak about, a government shutdown's never good. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p>WOLF:  So, they should also get a deal. </p><p>BARTIROMO: But that's the least of it.  I mean is it because it's a partial  shutdown?  </p><p>FORBES:  Yes.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's another uncertainty piece.  We got a big show this  morning, coming up.  Joining the conversation, Kansas Congressman and House  Committee on Small Business member, Roger Marshall, is here this morning,  along with Former White House Communications Director SkyBridge Capital  Founder, Anthony Scaramucci, with us this miss a moment.  The CEO of  Nielsen is here, David Kenny, going to walk us through what he's seeing out  there.  And the Commissioner of the MLB, Rob Manfred, making an appearance.   He's in studio this morning.  Don't miss a moment of it.  We got a big  three hours coming up.  </p><p>We kick it off with this top story, and that is markets, Futures indicating  we could see a higher opening this morning.  But of course nothing to the  tune of what we've been seeing on the downside.  The Dow fell more than 500  points yesterday on global growth concerns.  This morning, we're looking at  the market up 81 on the Dow, 29 higher on the NASDAQ.  This is the Federal  Reserve is being its two-day policy meeting today.  Officials are expected  to announce they will raise interest rates tomorrow.  </p><p>Joining us right now to talk more about all of that is Barry Bannister.  He  is Stifel, Head of Equity of Strategist.  And Barry, it's good to see you  today.  Thanks so much for joining us.  What's your take -- </p><p>BARRY BANNISTER, HEAD OF EQUITY STRATEGY, STIFEL:  Thanks, Maria,</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- on what's been going on with these markets down so much?  So  such nervousness.  </p><p>BANNISTER:  Look, I know that trade and politics grabs a lot of headlines,  but their background music, the lead singer in this band is the Fed.  We've  had three concerns this year, one is our earnings estimate around midyear  was a six percent below the average of sell side strategists.  Second, we  knew that interest rates, in a real sense, which is the interest rate after  inflation, as it began to rise off a real low level, the P/E ratio, the  price to earnings ratio, the market would come down. </p><p>And the third is I think the Fed's making the same mistake they made in the  second half of 2014 and all of 2015, which is that there are interest rate  policies diverging from the rest of the world.  So, that's been pressuring  the market. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I mean The Journal this morning, as Dagen noted earlier,  has an editorial commenting on the impending Fed decision.  The article is  titled \"Time for a Fed Pause,\" and the article writes this in part, \"The  right answer is to ignore the politics inside and outside the Fed and  follow the signals that suggest a prudent pause in raising interest rates,  get the monetary policy that best serves the economy and politics will work  itself out.\"  I assume you agree with that.  Do you expect the Fed raises  rates tomorrow and how many are you expecting in 2019? </p><p>BANNISTER:  I think the Fed will raise rates, but we see this deceleration  in the economy, and that's pretty normal, as the economy expands for a long  time.  Think of a car going from 65 miles an hour down to about 40 or 45  miles an hour, that's the order of magnitude of the slowdown.  I do think  the Fed will pause, but that would be after rate hike tomorrow.  </p><p>One thing to consider, though, is that I actually think by 2020, they  unwind the rate increase of September 26 and tomorrow, and have to cut  rates, but that would just be normal operations of policy as the cycle  matures. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Next year, you think they'll cut? </p><p>BANNISTER:  Well, that would take a while before they cut rates. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.  So maybe 2020? </p><p>BANNISTER:  But what we're seeing right now is that they're -- yes, well,  we're talking about weakness in 2020 when the fiscal policy stimulus really  wears off.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Understood.  </p><p>BANNISTER:  And the economy will be in a more advanced stage, yes.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Steve Forbes. </p><p>FORBES:  Barry, in terms of the Fed, the Fed has been signaling these  interest rate hikes, especially this one for months and months, why would  the markets suddenly react when this has been on the table and the Fed's  made it clear what's going to happen for months and months?  The market  always anticipates the future.  Don't you think it's other factors that are  weighing on the market not just the Fed, which told us they're going to --  months ago, they're going to raise the rate this month? </p><p>BANNISTER:  Yes, we've had the -- as I said, the lowest target for earnings  next year, of all the sell-side strategist and the second large -- lowest  price target at 2,800.  So, what we've been discounting is the earnings,  weakness, and the valuation compression.  But I do think earnings will grow  next year albeit low to mid-single digits, and I think the price to  earnings ratio will stabilize.  So, things should start to get better.  But  right now, the market's been weighed on by simple math.  Earnings, price to  earnings ratio, and interest rates. </p><p>WOLF:  Hey -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  No, one thing -- </p><p>WOLF:  Go ahead.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- I just wanted to point out that The Journal mentions in the  editorial, there -- there's this kind of knee-jerk fixation on short-term  interest rates and what the Fed is doing, because in history, that's what  we focus on.  But this is a historic expansion of the balance sheet, it was  unprecedented during the financial crisis and The Journal Editorial Page  writes the larger argument.  It's not just that inflation is contained,  that the global economy is slowing.  </p><p>But the larger argument for a pause is the Fed is unwinding, the largest  monetary experiment in modern history, Central Banks move -- around the  world, moving away from the multitrillion dollar bond purchases, which we  saw in Europe just last week and zero interest rates.  What is the normal  interest rate in this post-crisis world, we don't know, and we doubt the  Fed does either.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  So it's been focused on the balance sheet and that's what the  Fed should be doing in terms of pausing according to The Journal. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And that goes against the feeling the day after the Powell  speech, right?  Where people were surmising that he was basically saying,  \"We're at neutral.  We're close to neutral.\"</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  Which The Journal, some days later, wrote -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Exactly.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- \"Hey,\" because again they're kind of the bullhorn for the  Federal Reserve.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And they warn the market got it wrong. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  He said that he was close to the range of being neutral, which  is two and a half to three and a half percent. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  So, we're at two and a two to two and a quarter before the high  -- </p><p>WOLF:  Listen, can I just -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's not what Ray Dalio -- </p><p>WOLF:  Hey, Barry -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- near neutral, but -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- we will see.  That's the debate. </p><p>WOLF:  Barry, I was surprised by your comments of expecting a slowdown next  year.  Is that with GD -- with growth below three percent, is that with a  loosening of the labor market?  Where do you see the slower growth coming  in? </p><p>BANNISTER:  Yes.  I was talking about nominal growth.  I'm in the view that  the Fed is actually failing its price stability mandate and that gives them  an excuse to pause.  They'll probably do pauses on a quarterly basis with  renewals.  I doubt they're going to commit to any sort of full-year view,  but right now, I think inflation will pull back and that would push you  down towards around three, three and a half percent nominal GDP, and about  two and a half percent, maybe three percent industrial production growth  and S&amp;P earnings tend to be -- this S&amp;P 500, tend to be more cyclical than  the broader economy because larger capital intensive companies are publicly  held. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.  What about the China fight?  You're expecting the  ceasefire at the G20 meeting with China to fade? </p><p>WOLF:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p>BANNISTER:  Well, one of the problems with the market today is a vacuum.   We don't have a lot of information.  In other words, during Bush 41's  funeral, the Fed's testimony to Congress was canceled Wednesday two weeks  ago.  So, the Fed went into a quiet period and we have absolutely no idea  what they're thinking, and doing, and talking about.  The second thing is  these 90-day renew -- renewals on trade talks are not something into which  the public has much visibility. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's true.  </p><p>BANNISTER:  So in the absence of information, you've got a vacuum, and when  you have a vacuum, prices fall. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  All right, Barry.  You do like consumer staples, you say  health care utilizes and telecom because you think bond proxies are better  in this environment.  </p><p>BANNISTER:  Yes, Maria.  When I was on your show a couple of weeks ago, I  said the 10-year yield would fall, it's come in from about three and a  quarter to 2.88.  I think that thing could fall down to around 2.7, invert  the 10 to two.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  </p><p>BANNISTER:  And when you look at the 10-year minus the two-year yield,  what'll happen is the Fed will be forced to pause for longer.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p>BANNISTER:  And if the Fed tries to ignore the yield curve, I think they'll  be making a mistake.  They made excuses for why the yield curve didn't  matter in 2000 and 2007.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Hmm.  </p><p>BANNISTER:  The whole world is a carry trade.  The last thing you want to  do is invert the curve.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll leave it there.  We'll be watching, Barry.   Great insights from you.  Thanks so much.  </p><p>BANNISTER:  Thank you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Barry Bannister from Stifel there.  Coming up, severance has  been denied for outset CBS Head, Les Moonves.  He will not receive a $120  million package with he was expecting.  Details from the board meeting  coming up.  And then the tale of two companies, new questions for the Elon  Musk over the financial ties between his Boring Company and SpaceX, back in  a moment with that.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Two police officers were hit and killed by a  train.  Cheryl Casone with headlines now, Cheryl. </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  This is such a sad story,  Maria.  Good morning to you.  The Chicago Police Department says that  officers Eduardo Marmolejo and Conrad Gary were fatally struck by a train  while looking for a shooting suspect.  Of course this happened in Chicago.   They were investigating a shots fired called on the city's far south side,  both officers served less than three years on the force.  Chicago Police  say the suspect was later taken into custody.  </p><p>Well, CBS says it will not pay former Chairman and CEO Les Moonves any of  this $120 million severance package.  The decision coming after an  investigator and to allegations he sexually assaulted several women.   According to the Board of Directors, investigators found that he violated  company policy, he breached his employment contract, and he intentionally  failed to cooperate fully with the investigation.  Take a look at shares of  CBS, the stock itself actually down 18 percent so far this year.  </p><p>Well, Elon Musk's tunnel-digging project, the Boring Company set to open  its first tunnel today in Los Angeles.  This comes as Musk is, again,  coming under fire, this time for the relationship between two of his  companies.  Wall Street Journal reports that the Boring Company is being  pulled into Musk controversial practice of spreading overlapping assets  across this different companies.  Now The Journal writes this arraignment  has alarmed some long-time investors in SpaceX, including its largest  outside backer, Peter Thiel's Founders Fund pet.  The investors questioned  SpaceX about why their investment dollars were instead partly used to start  a separate company that benefited Musk. </p><p>OK.  Frustrated New York commuters are going to feel more the Christmas  spirit today.  The Christmas decorations over the Holland Tunnel that  caused a lot of angst and anger, because, you know, New Yorkers are just  never angry, right?  Well, you're going to recall, here's the story.  The  location of the tree over the letter \"N\" and a wreath over the \"U\" sparked  a lot of, well, controversy.  Stuff for the New York Post.  </p><p>Anyway, officials there in the tunnel shifted the position of the  decorations after conducting an online poll.  The holiday scene is now  bringing a lot more joy.  What we get upset about in New York, especially  with the holidays, Maria, would be things like this.  Back to you. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much, Cheryl. </p><p>CASONE:  People were freaking out in New York. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh my God.  </p><p>CASONE:  It's a big story.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I know.  Well, you know what, the stress that comes with the  holidays, I guess, is also a part of it, but that -- </p><p>FORBES:  The world can't be that bad if you're worried about wreaths on the  Holland Tunnel. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's right.  That's right.  All right.  Les Moonves, let's  talk about this, because the board had this meeting on Monday, apparently  this thing that he tried to delete evidence, he deleted texts, he tried to  hide evidence in terms of the sexual misconduct, and that's why he's not  getting the 120 million, Dagen.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  The statement -- the five-paragraph statement that CBS released  was, to quote the Wall Street Journal, \"Notably brief and vague.\"  But we  know the details about what was going on based on the investigators' notes  because The New York Times reviewed those notes from investigators, so not  fake news, incredible reporting on this -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- on the Me Too movement by the Times.  It detailed -- the  notes detailed efforts by Les Moonves to destroy evidence that showed he  had sought to silence a potential accuser by getting her a role on a T.V.  show.  There were -- there's other information.  Eliza Dushku, the actress,  got a $9 and a half million payment -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- because she was removed from the legal drama, Bull, not  related to Les Moonves, but she complained about sexually charged comments  by the show's start.  She got removed and was paid out $9 and a half  million.  So, again, it's not just Les Moonves.  There were problems.   Remember Charlie Rose?  They're still dealing with that on the \"CBS Morning  Show.\"</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  There were problems at CBS.  And the board did -- the board  yesterday did vote to deny a hundred and twenty million dollar severance to  Les Moonves.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  He seems to be getting ready to fight it based on his lawyer's  comments but we'll see. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But the ramifications are still falling out at CBS, right?   There are still people who are leaving, getting pushed out for any number  of reasons because they were tied to that situation.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  The stars, particularly male stars, were never held accountable  for their conduct, and if you said anything about it, you were punished.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And they retaliated against you.  And so we've experienced it  obviously in previous history here, but, again, it goes on and there's  still a focus on what's going on at these big companies. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, you're right.  All right.  We'll keep watching that.   We'll take a break.  When we come back, extreme weather to tell you about.   A late-week storm will cause holiday travel headaches apparently.  We got a  full report in the snow, rain, and wind right up next.  And then surf's up  here, Kelly Slater pulls off an incredible trick on the water and even he  can't believe it happened.  Back in a moment.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Millions of Americans will be traveling this  week ahead of the holidays, but delays are not the only thing to be  prepared for.  FOX News Senior Meteorologist, Janice Dean, with the details  on the late-week storm coming.  Janice, good morning to you. </p><p>JANICE DEAN, FOX NEWS CHANNEL METEOROLOGIST:  Hi, Maria.  We'll start off  with the good news.  So, for the next six, seven, eight days, the really  cold air stays up north in Canada and we're relatively mild for much of the  country heading into this weekend and even Christmas week.  But in January,  just a heads up, that's when we could see some of that arctic air make its  way southward.  </p><p>Let's take a look at the temperatures, 33 here in New York, 26 in  Cincinnati, so there are seasonal temperatures about average for this time  of year.  We did have a storm system across the northeast, we do have a  little bit of lake-effect snow, interior snow across the northeast, but not  a big deal.  This is our next big system that's going to cause the  potential travel delays Thursday and Friday, which you mentioned that is  moving cross the west, so the northwest is going to remain active with the  storm every other day, pushing in from the Pacific coastal rain event, and  some snow across the higher elevations of the Intermountain West and the  Northern Rockies.  </p><p>And then eventually, this is going to move across country and interact with  some gulf moisture Thursday and Friday, and that's going to give us  potential delays Thursday, Friday for the East Coast, mainly a rain event.   All right.  Will we have a White Christmas?  Everyone's is talking about  that.  Here is the historical White Christmas probability.  Certainly we're  going to see the potential for that across the west, across the mountainous  regions, but as we go through time, through Saturday, Sunday, Monday, and  Tuesday, this is where we're going to see the snow across the west, coastal  areas will see rain, Upper Midwest could see some snow, Great Lakes  certainly, the interior northeast, but I will tell you along the coast here  from the northeast down towards the southeast in Florida, it could be a wet  one.  </p><p>We will keep you posted.  Certainly, the delays will start Thursday,  Friday, but not a big winter storm, but just look ahead for New Year's Eve  and January, much colder air invades the country, back to you, Maria. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-oh.  Oh, all right.  Get ready for that. </p><p>DEAN:  Yes.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Janice, thank you.  </p><p>DEAN:  You got it.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Janice Dean.  Coming up, Twitter tanks, new disclosure from the  social media giant over exposing user data to China and to Saudi Arabia.   And the Saints go marching in.  New Orleans beat the Panthers last night,  crushing Carolina's NFL playoff hopes.  Plus Eric Reid honoring Colin  Kaepernick, the controversial cleats coming up.  Back in a minute.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Tuesday morning, everybody.  Thanks so much  for joining us, I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Tuesday, December 18th.   Your top stories right now, 6:30 a.m. on the button, on the East Coast.</p><p>Some morning green on Wall Street, this morning, not to the extent that  we've seen losses this week, but the Dow Industrials are expected to open  higher, by about 90 points.  This is the high of the morning, right here,  S&amp;P is up 10-1/2, and the NASDAQ is up 34 points right now.  That's a half  a percent higher.</p><p>This, of course, ahead of the Federal Reserve's two-day meeting, it begins  today.  We are expecting the Fed to announce it will raise rates for the  last time, this year, and we are expecting that announcement tomorrow at  about 2:15 p.m. Eastern.</p><p>Yesterday, another rough day at the office, the major indices down better  than two percent apiece, on global growth and interest rate worries, the  Dow Industrials down 507 points at the close, the NASDAQ down 156 points at  the close, yesterday, two and a quarter percent.</p><p>European indices this morning, taking a cue from Wall Street, mostly, well,  it's actually a mixed story.  Take a look.  The FT 100 is down 33 points  right now, one-half a percent, but the CAC Quarante in Paris has turned  positive, it's up 2 points, and the DAX Index in Germany is up 51 points,  so very much a mixed story in the Euro zone, this morning.  Asian markets  were lower, overnight, across the board, as you can see.</p><p>Crude oil is slipping, take a look at the price of oil, now below $50.00 a  barrel.  First time we are seeing this since October 2017.  Crude oil has  now been in a bear market since November 8th, and that of course, means 20  percent lower from the highs, oil down, two and three-quarters percent,  right now, $1.36 lower, at 48.52.</p><p>Technology is under fire, social media giants Facebook and Twitter and  Google, accused of providing incomplete data to the Senate Intelligence  Committee, this, as part of an investigation into Russian interference in  the 2016 election, details there, coming up.</p><p>And the saints go marching on, New Orleans beat the Panthers, crushing  Carolinas playoff hopes.  Meanwhile, Panthers' Safety, Eric Reid, paid  tribute to Colin Kaepernick, with his new cleats.  We'll bring it to you.</p><p>And it is a surfing miracle.  Check this out, legendary surfer, Kelly  Slater, pulling a move at the Pipe Masters in Hawaii that even impressed  himself.</p><p>We want to show you what the President is thinking this morning.</p><p>The President tweeted just a little while ago, and here's what he says,  biggest outrage yet in the long, winding and highly conflicted Mueller  witch hunt is the fact that 19,000 demanded text messages between Peter  Strzok and his FBI lover, Lisa Page, were purposely and illegally deleted,  would have explained the whole hoax, which is now under protest, from the  President, this morning.</p><p>And, of course, there were 19,000 texts that were deleted, apparently, by  the Special Counsel.</p><p>Our top story this half an hour, the growing China threat, Chinese  President Xi Jinping taking a hard stance amid privacy concerns and trade  tensions with the United States, saying in a speech earlier today, this, no  one is in a position to dictate to the Chinese people what should or should  not be done.</p><p>We must resolutely reform what should and can be changed.  We must  resolutely not reform what shouldn't and can't be changed.</p><p>This weekend on \"SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES,\" I spoke with House Intelligence  Committee Chairman, Devin Nunes, and he gave me some startling things above  his investigation into China.  Here's what he said is most concerning right  now.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We've spoken on a number of times on this program with you,  about how China is using its economic power and putting it on its military  complex.  Tell us what China is doing with regard to espionage in America?</p><p>REP. DEVIN NUNES (R-CA), CHAIRMAN, HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE:  They are  moving in with -- first, with leverage, like loaning money, building  infrastructure, I think most concerning is when they get a hold of the  electrical grid, they get a hold of the banking system.  And then, they go  in with companies like Huawei or ZTE, and they offer, basically, free  infrastructure, so free communications infrastructure.</p><p>What the Chinese are doing with that is, is that they're ensuring that they  control the communications infrastructure so then they can monitor, for  economic purposes, those businesses and others that they may want to get  involved in, so that they have total control and manipulation capability  over those countries and governments.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining me right now is Retired Four-Star General, FOX News  Senior Strategic Analyst, General Jack Keane, General, it's good to see you  this morning.</p><p>GEN. JACK KEANE (RET.), FOX NEWS SENIOR STRATEGIC ANALYST:  Yes, good to  see you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  From Devin Nunes, on China, I mean, you know -- Mr. Nunes  has, sort of, choreographed what China has been doing with me, all year,  and I was worried about, you know, the military stuff, but they are going  into various countries, in particular, Africa, a lot of African countries,  according to John Bolton, and say, we'll give you a free telecom  infrastructure, but it's -- the way to tap into spying.</p><p>What are your thoughts on China's behavior?</p><p>KEANE:  Yes, the Chinese are conducting economic warfare and they are  absolutely predators in doing it.  They largely take advantage of emerging  countries, where they go in -- they put millions of dollars in the elites'  pockets, get them to influence the government, they come in with  extraordinary good loans to the government, but in the long-term, they have  high interest rates.</p><p>And they're building infrastructure, bridges, dams, highways, et cetera.   And they force everybody to accept Chinese labor, they will not use local  labor, whatsoever, whether it's in South America, Africa, South Asia,  Southeast Asia.  And then, over time, the interest rates rise on those  loans, so much so, that they default, and then the Chinese own all of the  infrastructure that they build, it's really quite extraordinary.</p><p>The second thing they do, and what Chairman Nunes is talking about, they  force them to accept Huawei in a telecommunication systems, therefore, they  own the personal intelligence of that country for generations to come, not  just on the business side, but particularly on the government side and on  the military side.  It is absolutely extraordinary.  We have never seen  anything quite like it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, but, I mean -- </p><p>KEANE:  And that is why -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>KEANE:  -- this administration, the Trump administration has identified  China as the long-term strategic threat to the American people and to the  security of the United States, economically, politically and militarily.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And I'm sure that's right.  I mean, we're seeing all evidence  of it, but where is this going?  In then, meanwhile, our markets are  selling off, there's all of this uncertainty over the two world powers in  the world, U.S. and China, do you think there will be any kind of an  agreement, in the year ahead, between the U.S. and China given that there  are certain things we are not going to change?</p><p>KEANE:  No, I actually do think so, and I think the President is doing the  right thing in standing up to China, economically.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  For sure.</p><p>KEANE:  We have to do it politically, and we also have to do it militarily.   And listen, when we -- China is a behemoth, but when we bring all of our  allies together, with the United States, and combine that economically and  militarily, we're considerably larger than China, even if in terms of  potential growth.  The Chinese certainly see that.  What's happened is,  they've never had anybody confront them before.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KEANE:  And that is what needs to happen.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Meanwhile, we thought that China was going to be helpful in  North Korea.  There are more North Korea tensions.  The North Korean  government slamming U.S. sanctions on the rogue regime.</p><p>A report in the Journal shows that North Koreans are getting around these  sanctions, it's titled this, North Korea turns coal into gas to weather  sanctions: isolated regime transforms an abundant resource to survive curbs  on oil imports, your reaction on the North Koreans getting around the U.S.  sanctions?</p><p>KEANE:  Yes, when it comes to oil issue and, you know, fuel for -- to drive  electricity, et cetera, what -- there's two things they are doing, one, is  they are doing ship to ship transfer of oil, offshore, and I've felt for a  long time that we've got to get the United States Navy and our allies up  there, and start blocking that.</p><p>The second thing is, what you're talking about, is the gasification of  coal, it's an old technology, the Germans did it during World War II, and  they were being pressured because of losing their oil production, South  Africa did it when sanctions were slapped on them.</p><p>And here's the kicker here, they're able to do this because China has given  North Korea the technology to gasify coal and it's helping them with about  10 percent of their oil production in terms of replacing that capacity  level.</p><p>So, here again, China has opened the aperture, yes, they said that abiding  by the sanctions, but no, the truth is, they're helping North Korea.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KEANE:  And we have got to get tough on all of this.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Let me ask you about military spending because we know  this is front and center, this week.  The Congressional Budget Office  releasing recommendations on how the U.S. could curve defense spending.</p><p>Some of those recommendations including capping pay increases for service  members, cancelling purchases of F-35 joint strike Fighters and stopping  the production of Ford class aircraft carriers among others.  What's your  reaction here, General?</p><p>Because, you know, there's all this worry of overspending.  We've got a  budget partial shutdown coming this week.  Do you think these  recommendations make sense or no?</p><p>KEANE:  Well, I think the whole idea of the Defense Department looking  inside to find -- to find savings and significant savings is a good thing.   And I think, you know, Secretary of Defense needs to be told to do that, he  has already got a program to do that.</p><p>I think, we should let them figure out where the savings are.  Captain --  capping military pay makes no sense to me, whatsoever.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.</p><p>KEANE:  The economy is good, we are being challenged in terms of recruiting  and retention, we've got to keep that pay up there, with the -- with the  private sector, so the military is competitive.  We don't need to be ahead  of the private sector, but we have to be reasonable with it, so when people  look at the military and say, well, yes, I can -- I can raise a family  there and have a reasonable life, quality of life experience there.</p><p>We don't want them to have to come in and suffer to the point where we're  only going to keep them for three or four years and then leave.  That makes  no sense to me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KEANE:  But all -- yes, the idea that the Congressional Budget Office is  saying, the Defense Department should take a hard look at itself, and find  programs that cut that are wasteful, and we're not efficient, I'm all for  it, and I think of something that needs to be done.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And we should point out that this week is really not about  defense because that's already been taken care of, in terms of this partial  government shutdown.</p><p>KEANE:  I don't think -- well, hopefully, we don't have a government  shutdown, but -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You don't?  OK.</p><p>KEANE:  -- if we do, the Defense Department will be fine.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  General, it's good to see you this morning, thanks so much.</p><p>KEANE:  Yes, it's good talking to you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  General Jack Keane, joining us there.  Coming up, Facebook,  Google, Twitter under fire, this morning, the technology giants accused of  failing to provide all their data, in the probe, into Russia interference  in 2016 and the Presidential Election, the fallout coming up, next up.</p><p>And then, more politics seeping into the NFL, take a look at the Panthers'  Safety, Eric Reid's custom cleats, featuring Colin Kaepernick, more in  sports coming up.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  The President is tweeting this morning, he just  did, just a moment ago.  Here's what he just said, good luck today in court  to General Michael Flynn.  Will be interesting to see what he has to say,  despite tremendous pressure being put on him, about Russian collusion in  our great and, obviously, highly successful political campaign.  There was  no collusion, writes the President.  Social media giants are under fire,  meanwhile, pertaining to that interference, Cheryl Casone with the details  now, Cheryl?  </p><p>CASONE:  All connected, Maria, that's right.  Facebook, Twitter, Google are  being criticized for providing incomplete data in the Senate's  investigation into Russia's online meddling in the 2016 election.  So,  according to a report from a cybersecurity firm, the companies did the bear  minimum when it came to meeting requests by the Senate Intelligence  Committee.  Meanwhile, the NAACP has returned a recent donation from  Facebook and is calling on uses to boycott the site as well as Instagram  today -- Facebook owns Instagram.  The move coming after a Senate report  revealed how Facebook's platform was used to suppress African-American  turnout in the election.  </p><p>We'll take a look at shares at Twitter, they fell almost seven percent  after they disclosed suspicious traffic to a customer support form.   There's yesterday's price action Twitter.  They say that a large amount of  traffic to site came from I.P. addresses in China and Saudi Arabia -- and  that those I.P. addresses may have ties to state-sponsored actors.  The  data exposed included the country code of user's phone numbers.  Twitter  says, those directly affected have been informed about this.  </p><p>And then talking about Twitter again, they are accused of being a toxic  place for women, that's according a to report from the human rights  organization, Amnesty International.  The group says that Twitter is a  platform where abuse against women flourishes often with little  accountability, in fact, female politicians and journalists were allegedly  abused on Twitter every 30 seconds, Maria, in 2017.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What?  That's incredible.  Every 30 seconds.</p><p>CASONE:  Every 30 seconds and they're saying, look, that the company lets  this happen, they don't police their content.  And then, it's abusive.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  We had a guest on, I think,  it was a week or a couple weeks ago who talked about the diversity in  Silicon Valley.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, what diversity?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And I was like, what diversity?  Particularly, in these  technology companies, the attrition rate is high for women.  Women are not  represented, Black Americans are not represented, Latino Americans are not  represented in the way that they should if you're going to present yourself  as a diverse certainly progressive industry and company.  </p><p>So, like, I think if you look at Apple as one example, less than one-third  of its global workforce is woman.  In technology jobs, it's is less than  one-quarter of those jobs are held by women.  Like tech -- they're trying  to improve that.  But then you had companies like Uber, it was -- open  secret, it was almost common knowledge in Silicon Valley that they treated  women horribly.  This is before (INAUDIBLE) took over.  But nevertheless,  it was kept within the confines of the technology world.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Are you surprised by that?  </p><p>WOLF:  I know that we're all capitalist and we want less regulation but  there is something to say to look at regulating these companies like  they're media companies.  There's no question that Twitter and Google and  Facebook are now media companies.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  They're media companies.  </p><p>WOLF:  And I think as you talk about diversity or whatever else and  certainly the idea of doing forensic on what they have their outputs are,  they're going to have to be looked upon much different next year.  There's  no question about it.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  A huge portion of people get their news from Twitter.  </p><p>WOLF:  Exactly.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I had a conversation -- this is something that resonates with  every American.  I had a conversation with a friend in the last couple of  days about this very thing and the person said, why do these companies have  a liability waiver for users to write content if they're going to decide  who gets to publish on their platform.  They are still -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Who know that's going away?</p><p>WOLF:  You can't be the largest advertise, the largest distributor of  content and say that well, it's not my content.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And then, Google has 90 percent market share in search.  90  percent.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right and Twitter increasingly is like shutting down  conservative -- </p><p>WOLF:  This is where regulation should take a harsher (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>FORBES:  But it's amazing how tone deaf politically those companies are.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, Google blew up the hearing, initially, I'm not going.  </p><p>FORBES:  Well, you take prior university.  Harmless online thing, their  content often is censored.  And you'd think somebody in California say,  hey, we got a problem here, let's fix it, let's bring them in, apologize --  fix it.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, remember during the GOP primary?  The GOP primary in  California.  If you Googled, you did Google search of who is the GOP in  California, a list of descriptions of them came up.  Number one or two was  Nazi-ism.  Nazi-ism.  How does that happen?  Who programs that into an  algorithm and then they say, oh, it was the algorithm.  Guess what, a human  being is putting algorithm together.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And quite frankly, these companies and the management they treat  everybody in this country who doesn't work in technology like a bunch of  hays.  There's nothing to see here; you just don't understand how it works.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, we're smarter than you, right.  </p><p>WOLF:  The good thing about free markets is technology, always up ends  these companies, watch out what block chain does, read George Gilder's book  in the next five to 10 years.  Remember General Motors are going to take  over the world, IBM take over, Microsoft going to take over the world.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  One of my family members is reading that book trying to make  sure that they don't get basically innovated out of business.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  All right, we'll take a break, when we come back a  surfing Houdini trick, you've got to see this.  Watch as pro-surfer, Kelly  Slater, magically regains control of his board after a complete wipe out.   Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  The Panthers playoffs hope is crushed.  Dagen  McDowell on sports headlines this morning.  What a game, Dagen.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Crushed by New Orleans Saints, Maria Bartiromo.  So, the Saint's  edging out Carolina Panther's 12-9.  A Monday night football -- it was not  a stylish win.  The Saints keeping their spot at the top of the NFC with  just two weeks left in the regular season.  This marks the Panthers' six  loss in a row; ending their hopes to make post-season run.  </p><p>Panthers' defensive back, Eric Reed, making political statement with his  cleats.  The cleats depicting activist including an image of Colin  Kaepernick kneeling during the season.  Reed has continued to protest the  national anthem.  </p><p>A major change in the world of soccer.  Manchester United firing its  manager, Jose Mourinho, after less than three years with the team.  Man. U.  is sixth in the Premier League.  I think this is going to cost him about 18  million-pounds to get rid of the guy.  </p><p>Plus, a wild ride in Hawaii.  Surfing great an all-around awesome dude,  Kelly Slater, recovering from fall mid ride at the pipe master competition.   He is a really good dude and he is incredible to watch surf.  </p><p>And now, onto the most influential in sports business, shows a big shift.   Coming in at number one, according to Sports Business Daily: the American  Sports Gambler, it topped the commissioners of the major sports league.   Adam Silver came in number two, the NBA Commissioner Roger Goodell at  number three -- we all know what sport he tries to run.  Eric Shanks, Fox  Sports CEO, is number four and then Rob Manfred, Major League Baseball  Commissioner.  And guess who's coming up here on MORNINGS WITH MARIA -- Rob  Manfred.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, he's going to be coming up shortly.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  So, I just want to point out, the Saints have the best record in  the entire NFL.  They are 12-2, Robert's Patriots -- I think you lost two  weeks in a row, didn't you?  </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Your number one in the AFC with the 9-5.  </p><p>WOLF:  Can I just say something?  You have Rob Manfred coming on.  We  should go back to talking about my Red Sox today.  OK, because -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You don't want to talk about the Patriots?  </p><p>WOLF:  I'm happy to talk Patriots.  We're going to make the playoffs -- you  know, let's just wait.  You're going to short Tom Brady?  Come on, not  happening. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  No, I would never short Tom Brady, but I might not go long.  I  might put my money on -- </p><p>WOLF:  Saints are fun to watch, I have to admit.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  My home's -- I would, I think I would go long home. </p><p>FORBES:  Stick to the Red Sox.  They're claiming they are the best team in  baseball history, but I've got news for them.  Go back to the Yankees 1949  to 1953, five in a row.  So, stop the boasting.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good stuff.  All right, good stuff, Dagen.  Stay with us.  I  will be sitting down for an exclusive interview with the MLB Commissioner  Rob Manfred, he's coming up in studio, so do join us at 8:30 this morning.   But first, J&amp;J is slammed; the company taking a hit on Monday over concerns  of baby powder safety.  We'll talk about it next hour right here in  MORNINGS WITH MARIA, stay with us.  Johnson &amp; Johnson in the spotlight.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

Good Tuesday  morning, everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it is Tuesday, December 18th.  We're happy you're  with us. </p><p>Your top stories right now at 7:00 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>Investors trying to find their footing this morning.  Futures are at the  highs of the morning showing a gain at the start of trading.  Dow  Industrials up 87 points, a third of a percent.  The S&amp;P is also up a  third.  And the Nasdaq is up 34 points.  That's one-half of 1 percent  higher.</p><p>After a sharp selloff on Wall Street again yesterday, all the major indices  down sharply, down better than 2 percent on the day on global growth and  interest rate concerns.  The Dow was down 506 points.  And the Nasdaq was  down 157 points. </p><p>The Federal Reserve kicks off its two-day meeting today.  We are expecting  the Fed to raise rates and announce that tomorrow.</p><p>In Europe markets are mixed today.  FT 100 is down 31.  CAC is down just a  fraction.  And the DAX index is up almost 50 points, one-half of a percent  higher in Germany.</p><p>In Asia overnight declines across the board -- take a look.  Worst  performer was Japan once again.  Nikkei average down almost 2 percent.</p><p>We're watching the price of oil -- crude oil is under pressure again, it  has fallen below $50 a barrel for the first time in over a year.  AS you  can see it is down 3 percent this morning at $48.42.  Got to wonder when  this starts impacting the shale companies significantly as oil prices move  lower.</p><p>Johnson &amp; Johnson under fire.  The company slammed over its safety of the  baby powder, now after new pressure after it announced a $5 billion buyback  yesterday.  The company is facing more pressure this morning.</p><p>Plus this.  Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is not even in Congress yet and she  says she's already needing to take a break.  She says she's feeling burned  out.  All right.</p><p>And now this.</p><p>Fortnite facing a lawsuit -- Carlton from the \"Fresh Prince of Bel-air\" is  taking on the gaming giant over his signature dance.  Wait until you see  this.</p><p>All those stories coming up this Tuesday morning.  And joining me to break  it all down, Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell; Forbes Media chairman  and former Republican presidential candidate Steve Forbes; and 32Advisors  CEO, former economic adviser to President Obama Robert Wolf.  Good to see  you this morning.  </p><p>ROBERT WOLF, CEO, 32ADVISORS:  Good to be with you.</p><p>Great first hour.</p><p>STEVE FORBES, CHAIRMAN, FORBES MEDIA:  Great first hour.</p><p>WOLF:  Yes.</p><p>FORBES:  Great first hour.  Still a lot happening in the world.  Nice to  see that green again on the futures but after a thousand points we better  have some green.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, well a thousand points plus.  And it's all of these  worries over rates and over trade that has investors wondering.  </p><p>WOLF:  And no question with China and Europe slowing down, and Brexit, and  the chaos in Washington continuing.  It seems like everyone's going to  their corner.  It's a tough time.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All this gloom and doom.</p><p>FORBES:  Sounds like a bi-signal(ph).</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So riddle me this.  All this gloom and doom, how come the IPO  calendar is so strong?  You've got some real familiar names going public  next year like Uber, like Lyft, like Slack, like Pinterest -- a lot of  them.  And the market did not discourage these companies from making their  filings.  </p><p>WOLF:  And I'm not questioning that.  I think the economy is much better  than the gloominess today.  But we're going to be in December and it will  be the first time possibly since 2009 that we'll have no high yield  issuance.</p><p>And so there is definitely a feeling right now, people are walking in, and  they have no idea what to expect for the day because a lot of these things  are out of their hands. </p><p>What happened in France, ok; the idea of the hang-up in Brexit; China  slowing -- these are just things that come up out of the blue in a very  unexpected way.  And you can't position yourself for it.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  There's a lot of uncertainty for sure.  </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  I just want to point out that  the Russell 2000 is now in a bear market, down more than 20 percent.  Those  small cap stocks which from the high this year, that speaks to what's going  on here in the United States. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Not around the globe.  Great run-up until the turn but down more  than 20 percent.  And the transports are close to being in a bear market.   They're down more than 18 percent from the recent highs.  So that bears  watching.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Message of the markets -- message of the markets is  nervousness.  </p><p>WOLF:  And I was bringing up earlier that it's surprising the S&amp;P is lower  than where we were before the tax deal happened.  That being said, we had  such a run-up in 2017, it's a bit not surprising.  The question is, is 2018  just really a pause or are we into a slowdown period?  It doesn't feel like  -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let's see if it's -- </p><p>FORBES:  The good thing on the IPOs, you have to ask the question or make  the point, it's about time.  IPOs have been terrible -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  That's true.  </p><p>FORBES:  -- in the last generation.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, it's a big calendar next year.  </p><p>FORBES:  And if they get this trade thing -- that uncertainty out of the  way -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>FORBES:  -- and the U.S. starts to get strong, it's going to have a  positive tonic effect in the rest of the world.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well let's see.  </p><p>FORBES:  That is hurting investment now -- that uncertainty.  Let's see -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  There's a lot of uncertainty.  Let's see how much uncertainty  is the fault of Washington because that's our top story right now.</p><p>The clock is ticking.  The deadline to avoid a partial government shutdown  is now just three days away.  The President is demanding that Congress  provide $5 billion in funding for the border wall.  The Democrats are  showing no signs of budging.  </p><p>House Freedom Caucus chairman Mark Meadows weighed in on Capitol Hill  yesterday.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. MARK MEADOWS (R), NORTH CAROLINA:  What makes January any better than  December 21st?  I'm willing to stay here through Christmas to get it done  right on behalf of the American people.  And you know, we continue to punt.   This is not anybody -- to anybody's surprise.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining us right now is Kansas Congressman and member of the  House Committee on small business, Roger Marshall.  Congressman -- it's  good to see you.  Thanks so much for joining us.  </p><p>REP. ROGER MARSHALL (R), KANSAS:  Good morning to everybody.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So all of this nervousness in terms of markets, we know there's  a situation of uncertainty between China and the U.S. and we know that  we're also facing uncertainty with interest rates.  But how much of this is  Washington, the fact that we're looking at a partial government shutdown  this week, the fact that this Mueller probe is constantly asking questions  and putting these suggestions of collusion out there, even though there's  no evidence of it.  The fact that we've got all of this sort of vitriol  between the Republicans and Democrats.  </p><p>MARSHALL:  You know, absolutely, you're right.  When I was in the position  back in Kansas, I didn't follow these issues quite as closely and my stock  market brokers loved me because I didn't call them every day.  Now I have  to pay attention to every up and down, seeing the market overreact to all  the uncertainty, whether it's the threat of a government shutdown, trade  tariffs or potential interest rates being raised today or tomorrow.</p><p>So all these uncertainties are adding up.  And as you pointed out, these  markets don't like the uncertainty.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  But what are you going to do about it.  You're a lawmaker  and a leader in Congress.  Are you going to -- I mean how can you help the  situation in your position and are we going to see this shutdown?  What's  the impact?  </p><p>MARSHALL:  Yes.  I think my job is to remain calm and clear, to make good  decisions up here.</p><p>Border security is such an important issue I'm willing to shut down a very  small fraction of the government.  So my job as a congressman is to  communicate, look, if the government shuts down, we're only really talking  about 10 percent of the spend of the Federal government.  Medicare is taken  care of.  Social security, the military-- this is a very small segment.</p><p>Border security, national security is so important.  I'm willing to jump on  this grenade and shut down this small sliver of the government to fund the  border wall.  </p><p>WOLF:  Congressman -- just a question.  Last year there was a billion given  to border -- for the border wall.  That hasn't been spent.  So the question  is, the President's looking for $5 billion.  What's the compromise? </p><p>Because I know that you're comfortable shutting down 10 percent of the  government.  But I guarantee those people who are going to lose their job  over Christmas aren't comfortable.  I think you're still getting paid.  So  I think it's a very uncomfortable situation for Washington, Republican or  Democrat, to say we're going to shut down part of the government over  Christmas.  My question to you is and a Democrat if he was sitting here --  what is the compromise?  </p><p>MARSHALL:  Yes.  I would prefer to keep the government open-- don't get me  wrong.  So actually we built about 31 miles of border security with the  funding we gave the President last year and that's going to go towards a  total 40 miles in total.  This funding of $5 billion will build another 200  miles of border security out.</p><p>That's a priority for us.  It's a political football right now.  You know,  the President's working on a compromise.  I'm going to stand beside the  President.  I think this is when we need leadership from the President and  from Congress as well.</p><p>I do think there is a compromise there.  But I would prefer the $5 billion.  </p><p>WOLF:  Right.  But the bid offer is $1.6 billion which I think has been  approved to $5.  So why doesn't the House members, Republican and  Democrats, and the Senate come up and say a different number and ask the  President to go with them on this?  </p><p>MARSHALL:  Well, it would seem like both -- the Democrats have said it's a  nonstarter.  They want to fund zero or perhaps now they're up to $1.7  billion.  So I think as a congressman I have to prioritize national  security.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  No, I understand that.  And the President is keeping his  promises.  The Trump administration following through on that second round  of bailout payments for farmers hurt by the ongoing trade dispute with  China.  $9.5 billion will be distributed to farmers in total.</p><p>But you know, then you have to ask yourself well, what about other  industries?  Maybe the retailers need a bailout.  What about the banks.  I  mean can we really just give bailouts to those groups that are getting hurt  by the tariffs and not everybody?  I mean doesn't this have a big downside  risk?  </p><p>MARSHALL:  You know, certainly I understand your point and agree with it  for the most part.  When the President first presented to this, the farmers  said it's a no go.  We don't want a handout.  We want long-term access to  trade markets and that's always been our mantra.</p><p>But right now back in Kansas, farm income is 50 percent of what it was.   Farm bankruptcies are up 600 percent.  So it's hard times back home.  This  funding will allow the farmers to maybe get the loan to plant next year's  crop.  It's a drop in the bucket.  We're grateful for it but it's not what  we asked for.</p><p>We're asking to get -- we asked to get the USMCA, the NAFTA 2.0 done and  that's been accomplished, still needs to go through Congress.  And now  we're asking to get the European Union trade agreement done, the Japan  trade agreement done.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  But there are a lot of Democrats who say they're not  going to vote for the USMCA the way it is.  Are you ready to make changes?  </p><p>MARSHALL:  Certainly I'm willing to make some changes.  I think there's a  lot of crying and gnashing of teeth.  I think if we field that on the House  floor today that it passes with probably a majority -- the majority as well  as probably 40 percent or 50 percent of the Democrats.</p><p>I think they're posturing, wanting to make the perfect the enemy of the  good.  </p><p>FORBES:  Congressman, your district we've been talking about agriculture  but as we know since we were on a panel together a few weeks ago, your  district is very widespread in terms of its economy including medical  equipment.  You were in the business.</p><p>And you talked about how tariffs are hurting imports of critical medical  equipment that do diagnosis.  Do you see any prospect of getting this China  uncertainty out of the way because it is hurting the economy and hurting  your district?  </p><p>MARSHALL:  Well, certainly, Mr. Forbes.  And it's great to see you again.   And I enjoyed being on that panel with you. You're right, so hospitals buy MRIs and mammograms, most of those are made  in China and in Southeast Asia.  So we're seeing the prices of those go up  25 percent, 50 percent as well.  </p><p>So it's impacting more than just agriculture.  These trade wars, these  tariffs could impact the GDP 2 percent.  It could impact the average family  to the tune of a couple thousand dollars per family next year.</p><p>And that's the pressure we're putting on the President.  We put pressure on  him.  We held him accountable.  He came through with an improved agreement  with NAFTA.  And we think there's an opportunity for an improved agreement  with China.</p><p>But we know this -- Mr. Forbes, we can't keep doing what we've been doing  with China either.  However bad I thought the trade imbalances were and the  unfair trade practices with China are, they're even worse when I dove into  them.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  It's pretty incredible what China has been doing and it's  well beyond trade.  I agree with you, Congressman.</p><p>It's good to see you this morning.  Thank you.  </p><p>MARSHALL:  Yes.  Good morning.  Thanks for having me.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Congressman Roger Marshall joining us there.</p><p>Coming up, Johnson &amp; Johnson is under fire this morning.  The healthcare  giant faces an asbestos scandal in its baby powder.  The company now trying  to bolster investor confidence with a stock buyback.  Details there.</p><p>Already needing a break -- incoming congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez  takes a vacation before she even started.  The story coming up.</p><p>Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>Goldman Sachs reportedly ignored warning signs of its dealings with 1MDB.</p><p>Cheryl Casone with the details on this -- Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Yes.  This story is  still unfolding, Maria, this morning.  The \"Wall Street Journal\" is now  reporting that Goldman's push for Asian business and its lax oversight of  partners led it to dismiss several red flags.  Malaysia filed criminal  charges yesterday against Goldman and its two former executives for their  role in a multibillion dollar fraud.  </p><p>But the bank is firing back.  They say, quote,\" certain members of the  former Malaysian government and 1MDB lied to Goldman Sachs, outside counsel  and others about the use of proceeds from these transactions.\"  So Goldman  stated yesterday it's going to fight back on this one.  The stock though  down 32 percent so far this year.</p><p>Well, after falling about 10 percent on Friday, shares of Johnson &amp; Johnson  dropped another 3 percent yesterday because of concerns over its baby  powder.  Reports say that Johnson &amp; Johnson knew for years that some of its  powder contained asbestos.  The company's firing back with full page ads in  papers, defending themselves.</p><p>Meanwhile India federal drug regulator says that the report about the baby  powder is under consideration and that it's 2016 test found that the  product was safe.  Yesterday Johnson &amp; Johnson announced a new plan to buy  back $5 billion in stocks.  Shares of the company slightly higher in the  premarket, more than half a percent right now.</p><p>Well, the rivalry between Netflix and ABC's parent Walt Disney continues to  heat up.  Netflix has hired Channing Dungey, this is ABC's former  entertainment president, to be vice president of original content at  Netflix.  Now Dungey starts the job in February.  But this comes as Disney  is finalizing its purchase of most of 21st Century Fox's entertainment  assets.  The war is heating up.  21st Century Fox, of course, is the parent  of Fox Business Network.</p><p>Shares of Netflix have soared nearly 40 percent this year.  That outpaces  shares of Walt Disney. </p><p>And then finally, from movies to food -- spice up your Christmas gifts this  year with a little Chipotle wrapping.  For the burrito lover on your list,  the Mexican chain is offering wrapping paper that looks like guacamole  salsa and aluminum foil.  Each roll, $14.  The whole set which has 10  silver boughs, five gift bags, 10 pieces of tissue paper -- that's $50,  Maria.  You know, it's better to look at the burrito than eat it, really -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>CASONE:  -- if you're trying to watch your holiday, you know, consumption  as we go through the holiday season.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Yes, we do.  </p><p>Thank you -- Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE:  You bet.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The President is tweeting.  He just tweeted moments ago.  We  want to get this out.  He says this, \"I hope the people over at the Fed  will read today's \"Wall Street Journal\" editorial before they make yet  another mistake.  Also, don't let the market become any more illiquid than  it already is.  Stop with the 50 B's, feel the market, don't just go by  meaningless numbers.  Good luck.\"</p><p>Stop with the 50 b's.  What does that mean?  </p><p>WOLF:  The 50 b's.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, I know -- $50 billion in winddown.  Stop with the $50  billion in winddown.  He's asking them to slow down the winddown because  they're cutting the balance sheet $50 billion a month.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  All right.  So now he's weighing in on that part of it.  </p><p>FORBES:  Actually that's a good thing.  Do you want Washington bureaucrats  them controlling $50 billion?  Do you want to affect the normal banking  system again?</p><p>WOLF:  Although I think -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  They have to unwind the balance sheet.  </p><p>WOLF:  No, I know.  But you would agree, Steve, that QE3 was not needed.  </p><p>FORBES:  QE3 was a disaster.  </p><p>WOLF:  So we should be unwinding.  </p><p>FORBES:  You bet it should.  </p><p>WOLF:  Exactly.  So I mean -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  When you say QE, you have to say quantitative easing or bond  buying.  </p><p>FORBES:  Quantitative easing.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, thank you.</p><p>FORBES:  It's the idea that the Federal Reserve could revive the economy by  having banks park their reserves at the Federal Reserve.  Real genius --  and hurt credit for small businesses.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So you agree with the President?  </p><p>FORBES:  I would agree -- no, I think that the Fed should unwind.  </p><p>WOLF:  They should unwind.</p><p>FORBES:  Absolutely.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You want the unwind to happen.  </p><p>FORBES:  Yes, absolutely.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Because that's also a form of tightening and the President is  basically saying stop with the tightening.  </p><p>FORBES:  That's not tightening.  That's liberating capital.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Ok.  Won't the market see it though as a further tightening?   We talk about this every morning.  I mean if you're unwinding $50 billion a  month as well as raising interest rates, isn't that like a double  tightening?  </p><p>FORBES:  You know, in the commodity market, the gold market, the dollar has  been strong only because other currencies have been weak.  So the Fed's  been relatively neutral.  And the more capital they get back into the  economy, the better.  And if we get this trade overhang out of the way,  everything's going to be much better.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So it's the trade overhang.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I want to point this out.  What happened when they were buying  bonds and during the quantitative easing, it lifted all these risk assets.</p><p>So what happens when you pull that money out of the financial system.   There's been incredible volatility, liquidity problem particularly in bond  trading in recent weeks.  And it means that will asset prices drop?  And  again -- I was going to say something political, I won't.  We will discuss  it later.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Ok.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But I think that the Obama administration for eight years got a  lot of cover for some missteps in fiscal policy because of what the Federal  Reserve was doing.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, they had zero rates.  I mean, you know.</p><p>WOLF:  Why is everybody looking at me?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Because you were an economic advisor, Robert Wolf.  You were  economic advisor to President Obama.  Who are we going to look at?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WOLF:  Ok.  And so when the market in eight straight years was averaging 16  percent gains, we were all loving it.  Let's not kid ourselves.  </p><p>FORBES:  But small businesses and households couldn't get credits like the  Soviet Union.  The health care was free but you didn't get any loans.  </p><p>WOLF:  Well, we can't help that.  People were borrowing more than they had.   Ok, consumers, right -- over 100 percent leverage.  </p><p>FORBES:  That's big companies.  The small companies starved, bad.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Coming up, consumers beware -- another major recall is hitting  store shelves.  We've got the details you want to know about it.</p><p>And then changing viewing habits.  I'll speak with the CEO of Nielsen.   David Kenny in the studio -- get his take on the changing media landscape.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>Well, for decades if you wanted to know what consumers are watching or  buying, you would know the name Nielsen.  The company tracks consumer  behavior across multiple media platforms.</p><p>In November, the company appointed a new chief executive officer.  He is  with me now.  Joining me right now, the CEO of Nielsen is David Kenny.   Great to see you -- David.</p><p>DAVID KENNY, CEO, NIELSEN:  Great to be here -- Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Congratulations to you.  I want to first talk about your plans  for the company.  There are reports that Nielsen is looking to change its  structure.  Are you expecting to go private?  </p><p>KENNY:  We don't know that.  The board's looking at all the options.  There  are certainly folks interested in the company.  Right now I work for the  public shareholders and we're going to do what's best for them.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Tell me what you're doing because you have all of these  different platforms to look at and Nielsen is the name in terms of  monitoring all of that and giving us the true accurate numbers of audience.   Tell us where the growth is at Nielsen.</p><p>KENNY:  Well, certainly the growth follows our customers.  So media  companies are finding more platforms.  They're certainly taking a lot of  things digital in addition to TV and radio.  What we're finding is  consumers can consume more media because at least 45 percent of them, the  big media users are doing two things at once.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's true -- we all do two things at once.  </p><p>KENNY:  So they're watching this show and they're on their mobile phone  checking something else out.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So how do you monitor that and measure that?  I mean consumers  are turning more and more to portable devices.  Like you've got your  iPhone.  They're making purchases while consuming media on TV.  How have  you changed your business as a result of that?  </p><p>KENNY:  Well, certainly we start with the best panels in the world.  So  groups of consumers that allow us to track everything through lots of  devices and monitoring.  What we do very carefully is make sure we do that  in a way that we don't know who they are.  There's no privacy problem with  that.</p><p>And people let us see what their patterns are in their home and in their  life and in their car, all day long.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And where's the growth in terms of the audience?  Is it  online or -- and are the dollars do you think still in traditional TV?  </p><p>KENNY:  There's still a lot of dollars in TV.  The biggest hour is between  9:00 and 10:00 p.m. where people are watching TV but then again, 45 percent  of them are also doing something on a second device.  So they're really  engaging in new ways and sharing more media as well which brings more of  their friends in.  </p><p>So media is certainly healthy and growing.  People want to connect, consume  and be entertained.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I want to get your take on China.  And I know you know a lot  about China, not just for your role here but your former role, in your  former life at IBM, which you've done a great job there.  This weekend I  spoke with the chairman of the intel committee on the house side, Devin  Nunes.</p><p>KENNY:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And he told me some really interesting things about what China  does on \"SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES\".  We talked about the concerns that China  is trying to access people's data.  Watch this.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The CFO of Huawei was arrested.  She was held in Canada.  She  got out on bail.  Is that more about espionage than it was about Iran's  sanctions?  </p><p>REP. DEVIN NUNES (R), CALIFORNIA:  You know, I don't know about that.  I  would refer to the Department of Justice and it's probably not something  that I should comment on.</p><p>But I do know that Huawei is actively going around the globe and offering  products way below their own cost.  So that doesn't make any sense.   Somebody is subsidizing that.</p><p>And in today's world with the ever-growing and quickly changing ways that  we communicate, if routers are put in, and this is something that we've  worked on for many years on the House Intelligence Committee, looking at  routers can take that information and quickly route the information quickly  back to China where then they can comb through it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>NUNES:  And I think that's the concern is that there would be games being  played within the communications infrastructure that would allow for the  Chinese to spy very easily.  And I think that's one of the big concerns  that we have here is that the American people have been having to listen to  this Russia nonsense for so long and it's not that Putin's not a bad guy  and in fact we had been the ones that had warned about Putin's ever- advancing capabilities.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>NUNES:  But at the same time we've totally ignored China.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What's your take on China?  I know Nielsen is in China.  We've  seen breaches in U.S. companies, including Marriott and a lot of people say  China was behind the Marriott breach.  Do you have concerns about that?  </p><p>KENNY:  First of all, we have a great business in China.  We serve a lot of  Chinese companies, serving Chinese consumers.  And that's well.  </p><p>This issue is about, you know, global espionage.  We are very concerned  about privacy.  Everything we've ever done in Nielsen is about  understanding what's going on without having personal information.  We  don't in any way want to make it easy for people to target folks.  People  deserve their privacy.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Tell me your agenda.  What are you doing in terms of leading  this company to further growth?  </p><p>KENNY:  What I'm focusing on is our customers.  So we've got two big sets.   With the media companies we're helping them understand new and better ways  to reach their audience, new ways to engage people and we also helped a  very trusted transaction between the ad agencies and advertisers to buy  media and know that the audience was actually there and how to develop the  audience.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So tell us how to do that.  How do you reach more customers  today?  What's the changing trends that you see?  </p><p>KENNY:  I think part of it is to understand that people, again, are  multitasking.  So you've got to get them in short episodes.  You've got to  get them in short segments to get them engaged.</p><p>A lot of things we're seeing is the value of engaging and sharing.  If  people start to share content, that means they're bringing in their friends  so that it's more of an audience as well.  We certainly do care that there  be truth in everything we're seeing, so we're looking a lot at making sure  that all the news is based on facts and there are ways to build brands that  people can really trust what they're seeing.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  David, it's great to have you on the show.  </p><p>NIELSEN:  Great.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  David Kenny joining us there, CEO of  Nielsen.  </p><p>President Trump just tweeted this morning and here's what he's saying about  social media.  Facebook, Twitter and Google are so biased toward the  Democrats, it is ridiculous, writes the president.  Twitter in fact has  made it much more difficult for people to join @realDonaldTrump.  They have  removed many names and greatly slowed the level and speed of increase.   They have acknowledged and done nothing.  </p><p>Coming up, taking a self-care break.  That is what incoming Congresswoman  Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez plans on doing before she heads to Capitol Hill in  the new Congress next year.</p><p>Then, suing over a dance move, find out which sitcom star thinks the  Fortnite video game stole his signature move, the story coming up.  Stay  with us.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Tuesday morning, everybody, thanks so much  for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Tuesday, December 18th.   Your top story right now 7:34 a.m. on the East Coast.  </p><p>Futures are higher this morning.  Take a look, we're at the highs of the  morning with a gain of 121 points right now on the Dow Jones Industrial  average, the S&amp;P is up 13 and the NASDAQ is up 41-1/2 points, that's two  thirds of one percent.  </p><p>This ahead of the Federal Reserve today meeting -- it begins today.  The  Fed is expected to raise interest rates tomorrow for the last time this  year.  We are expecting that announcement 02:00 tomorrow.  </p><p>Markets are rallying ahead of it.  The major indices though had a tough day  yesterday, down about two percent apiece on global growth and interest rate  concerns.  As you can see, the Dow is down 507 points at the close  yesterday.  </p><p>In Europe this morning, mixed story.  Take a look at the indices there with  the FT-100 is down and the CAC Quarante is also weaker by a fraction but  the DAX Index in Germany is up 43 points.  </p><p>Asian markets meanwhile closing lower overnight with the weakest link in  Japan, Nikkei average down 1.8 percent.  </p><p>Crude is a big story this morning, crude awakening.  Take a look at the  price of oil, back below $50.00 a barrel for the first time since October  2017.  Crude oil is down almost three percent right now, it is now in a  bear market, it has been since November 8th.  And that of course means 20  percent lower from the highs.  </p><p>The E. coli recall expands.  The farm behind the romaine lettuce recall now  has affected vegetables.  We will tell you which ones have to be added to  the list that you should not purchase.  </p><p>Then, game on.  \"The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air\" actor behind the Carlton  dance suing the makers of Fortnite for allegedly stealing his moves.  Let  me check out the moves.</p><p>And then the quiet kennel, details on Ford's new technology project to  bring more -- to bring noise cancelling to your dog's kennel.  </p><p>All those stories coming up.  But first, taking a break before your job  even begins.  New York Congresswoman-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez taking  to Twitter to announce that she is taking a self-care break before Congress  starts after the New Year.  She says this, I'm taking a few days to take  care of myself before what is sure to be an eventful term.  For working  people, immigrants, and the poor, self-care is political, not because we  want it to be but because of the inevitable shaming of someone doing a face  mask while financially stressed.  </p><p>Joining us right now is former White House Communications Director,  SkyBridge Capital founder Anthony Scaramucci.  Good to see you, Anthony.  </p><p>ANTHONY SCARAMUCCI, FOUNDER, SKYBRIDGE CAPITAL:  I'm taking self-care right  now here on the show, Maria.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, what are you doing?  How are you self-caring right now?</p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  I'm hoping -- I'm hoping that Robert's going to give me a  mani-pedi in the break, that's what I'm hoping for.  I don't even  understand what that means.</p><p>ROBERT WOLF, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CONTRIBUTOR:  I don't even know what that  is, right.  But I guess you have to have 11 days.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  You know what it is.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  A manicure and pedicure?</p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  It's not 11 days of fame, OK.  It's lasted a lot longer than  that.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But listen, the story --</p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  I don't know what it means but I love this person.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez?  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  I think she's fantastic because she's got everybody upset for  some reason.  I can't actually figure it out.  When she talks, it's clear  that she was probably missing a few of those classes in social studies when  you're learning about American history, but she is a force of nature, OK.   So, I have to just tell you, I'm totally impressed with her.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Steve what do you --</p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  (INAUDIBLE) I mean, just being totally direct.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, you're good with the self-care?  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  I'm good with the self-care.  If she needs any of my skin  products, I can offer them up to her, even though she's very young, she  probably doesn't need it right now, but if she ever does need it.  </p><p>WOLF:  And who knows (INAUDIBLE) better than Anthony?</p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  Well I think it's great.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But listen, there's a big story here, OK.  Now I know you guys  are joking, you're friends for a long time.  There's a bigger story here,  you are a moderate guy and a Democrat.  But you have these new-comers  coming into your party like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez who is a socialist,  Robert.  You've got another one in Michigan.  You've got Bernie Sanders,  pulling the party all the way to the left and what do you think about that?  </p><p>WOLF:  Listen, I'm not on the populist left.  And to me, we have lost the  center, which is why Washington is a disaster right now.  The truth is with  Ocasio she's preaching, OK, to literally wear all the populism lies.  She's  preaching on climate change and on immigration and it's resonating with the  base.  I think to Anthony's point, she may be pissing a lot of people off  but she's exciting a lot of people.  Listen, she --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, you think it's good then?  </p><p>WOLF:  I think it's good for the party any time you have excitement.  I'm  not that far left.  So personally speaking, there -- you know, I probably  would have voted if I lived in the city for Joe Crowley instead of Ocasio.   That being said, I have to applaud her.  She gets out there and she has a  view and I don't see many people actually saying, I don't -- I'm not for  your green energy and I'm not for this.  They may be dissing her on other  things but it's not on her substance.  </p><p>FORBES:  So, what does that mean, getting a candidate in 2020 that can win  an election?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's exactly -- that's right, that's the question.  </p><p>WOLF:  Listen, I think it's going to be -- it's going to be an incredibly  interesting primary.  I think we'll have more than where the Republicans  had, we'll have north of 16.  And I'm not sure that the party's not going  to be pushed to the left and it will be a very interesting whether we can  bring a candidate who can beat the president.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But the president, though, people on the left bash the president  nonstop about --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Nonstop.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- mistakes that he makes, things he tweets and I think that in  terms of policy, if Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez brags about her economics  degree from college and then doesn't know how the unemployment rate's  calculated, saying the unemployment rate is low because people are working  two jobs.  Well, that's not how the un -- that has nothing to do with the  unemployment rate, it's the number of unemployed people divided by the size  of the labor force.  </p><p>So, again, I think that it's fair to hit her on things like that.  But if  she wants to you get a full body scrub on her days off, then that's fine.  </p><p>WOLF:  Well, I just have -- I just have to make one comment because it  would be unfair.  I mean, you have the president telling us trade deficits  are losses, we know that's not economic expert either.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  You know what, and I have sat on this program, Robert Wolf, and  said that --</p><p>WOLF:  I just want --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- that it's not a loss.  </p><p>WOLF:  Right, OK.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That a tariff is not interest on a debt.  It's not -- so he  makes mistakes.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  She used your full name here so that's a little bit of a --</p><p>WOLF:  There you go.</p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  She used your full name that was a little bit of a shot on  you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What do you want to say?</p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  But here's what I want to say, she's going to come right into  the center.  This one is very -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Really?</p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  Yes, I think so.  She's very smart.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  No way.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.</p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  We'll see.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No way.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  You'll see.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  There's no center in New York.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Why would she -- then she's going to --</p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  Let me tell you something, in 1969, Hillary Clinton gave a  very far left commencement speech.  </p><p>FORBES:  Has she changed?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  She's never changed.</p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  Well, but her ambition changed through absolutely.  She  probably didn't change but she put on some cling-on cloaking devices and  pretended that she was in the center for 25 years.  This woman is a force  to be reconned with, OK.  You can feel the charisma coming off of her.  You  -- I mean, I like her, I certainly don't like her ideological views.  But I  think she's around and she's going to be here for longer than we think.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, the media, they give her the level of coverage that she  does.  And we're all guilty of this, just like Beto O'Rourke, because she's  attractive.  </p><p>WOLF:  But I would --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Let's be clear, it's because she is very photogenic and  telegenic.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  She's very attractive, Dagen, this is like a newsflash for me.   Is it like, that's like breaking news, she's attractive.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Beto O'Rourke looks like a Kennedy, that's why people threw  money at him.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Like he was going to win in Texas.</p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  OK.</p><p>FORBES:  And what a name, Beto.  Better than this --</p><p>WOLF:  I think there's more much more depth than that, but that's the depth  --  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, who do you think are the leading contenders on the  Democratic side for 2020 then?  </p><p>WOLF:  I think -- you listen, I think Beto and Kamala the new names and I  think Biden and Bernie are the names that have been in the past.  But I  think there's an incredible excitement around Kamala Harris and Beto O'  Rourke.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you think the president gets reelected, Anthony?  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  I do.  You know, I know that's a -- I mean, if you watch these  other networks, you know, we're all going to jail, we're all going to have  orange suits on.  But I don't -- I don't -- I don't see the level of  criminality that (INAUDIBLE).  So, he gets reelected.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let me -- wait, let me ask you, because Michael Flynn is facing  sentencing -- we're going to talk about this, for lying to the FBI.  This  coming as former FBI Director Jim Comey continued a second round of  questioning by the House Judiciary Committee yesterday.  What are you  expecting in terms of the Jim Comey and Michael Flynn situation, Michael  Flynn first.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  Five percent chance that they throw the entire thing out on  them for a number of different procedural reasons.  95 percent chance he  gets no jail time and he gets -- he gets hit a little hard.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Michael Flynn?  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  Yes.  </p><p>WOLF:  Just a question, I know you just announced your new Opportunity Zone  funds.  Can you just give us 30 seconds on it?  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  Well, I mean, we set up a private REIT to take advantage of  what's going on in these opportunity zones.  And so, just quickly, you can  take a very low basis stock that's had a high value now.  You can sell it,  move it into our fund.  You get a 10 year abatement on the taxes and then  you get a 15 percent reduction on your capital gains.  But then, any return  that you make off of the fund, you get that return 100 percent tax free.  </p><p>WOLF:  And that was Senator Tim Scott working with on and --  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  Tim Scott and also -- and also Senator Cory Booker, it's a  bipartisan strategy.  This is something right out of Steve Forbes' playbook  from 1996 about flooding the zone where people need the money and figuring  out ways to unleash capital into our system.  </p><p>FORBES:  Are you giving me a finder's fee on this?  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  If you help me --</p><p>WOLF:  No, but you can invest in Steven's fund.</p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  Steven, if you help me raise dough, you know, fast pay makes  fast friends on Wall Street, you know that, right?  That's why Robert and I  are so close.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Where are the opportunities?  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  So, there are basically the 2010 census has delineated about  12 percent of the country Maria, are considered Opportunity Zones, that's  where 20 percent of the population is below the poverty line.  And so, in  those zones you have this tax abatement opportunity.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  You better throw some money at Eastern North Carolina or I'll  hurt you.  </p><p>WOLF:  And we did a -- we did our exclusive, Maria --</p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  You're going to use my full name on live television?</p><p>WOLF:  And we're even thinking of using our investments Maria at  Opportunity Zone.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Really, great opportunity.  Thank you so much.  </p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  Very smart stuff.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Great to see you.</p><p>SCARAMUCCI:  I appreciate being here, thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Anthony Scaramucci.  Coming up, stolen dance, Carlton from \"The  Fresh Prince of Bel-Air\" takes on the gaming giant Fortnite over his  signature dance, the story coming up.  </p><p>Then, some stocks restocking.  We have guest picks that -- one guest says  they could be better gifts at Christmas.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, this is important.  A California farm linked to an E.  coli outbreak is recalling more products.  Cheryl Casone with all the  details now, Cheryl.  </p><p>CASONE:  Yes, this is Adams Bros. farms in California where the FDA linked  the current romaine lettuce recall.  They're now recalling red leaf  lettuce, green leaf lettuce, even cauliflower.  The farm says it's  recalling those products out of an abundance of caution.  The red, the  green leaf lettuce says -- made its way to many states including  Pennsylvania and Texas.  The cauliflower distributed across the country  including Illinois, New York, even New Jersey.  </p><p>Well, \"The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air\" star, Alfonso Ribeiro is suing the  creators of Fortnite and NBA 2K for using his famous dance on the video  games.  Now, Ribeiro alleges that the epic games and take two interactive  used his dance, the Carlton dance without his permission or credit.  It was  popularized obviously through his character Carlton Banks on the 1990s  sitcom that we all loved, OK.  </p><p>And then finally this, Ford is focusing on Dagen's best friend.  The  company has developed a kennel that canceled out noise for dogs that are  scared of fireworks, if that sounds familiar.  The Ford Quite Kennel  apparently use the same noise cancellation technology that's found in the  Ford Edge.  It's only a prototype for now but they say it's also working on  other projects that use auto tech to solve nonautomotive problems.  Shares  of Ford are down more than 30 percent this year.  It's not just dogs, Maria  that's scared of fireworks, cats are too.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's true and I think that's good.  Are you happy with that?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, it's good.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  They need to step up and start selling it.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, I don't like when the dogs are just afraid of the  fireworks and running for cover.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  No, and like horrible -- particularly leaning up to New Year's  Eve.  Horrible problem that dogs get out and a lot of people lose their  dogs because they're really not paying attention during the fireworks  celebration in the summer and around New Years.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Really scary.  All right, coming up, some Wall Street for your  stocking.  My next guest has some stock picks that could be better than  gifts this Christmas, up next.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Well, how about filling your Christmas stockings  with stocks.  Joining me right now is Larrea Wealth Management CEO, Aquiles  Larrea with gifts that keep on giving year after year.  Great to see you,  Aquiles.</p><p>AQUILES LARREA, CEO, LARREA WEALTH MANAGEMENT:  Nice to see you again,  Maria.  Thank you so much for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.  So what do you think -- are  you recommending buying stocks for kids or for everybody?  </p><p>LARREA:  Well, actually it's for kids, it can be for teenagers, as well.   This is an ideal gift that keeps on giving year after year.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right, tell us about that.  </p><p>LARREA:  So that they'll remember you forever.  Because what you're doing  is you're establishing a habit.  You're allowing your kids to a little bit  of a lesson.  As I mentioned in an article, you want them to establish the  habit early, to purchase the stock.  They also -- your little capitalist  will get a dividend as well and that's another allowance for that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I love this idea because you're really educating the child or  the youngster about how investing works, and then they can watch it grow or  go down.  I mean, that's another lesson, not all stocks go up.  </p><p>LARREA:  Yes, absolutely.  And especially with this volatility that  occurred just recently.  I call it the holiday special, you get to pick it  up cheaper.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.  So, some of the stocks you're recommending are very  familiar names for a -- for a youngster, right, like Nike or Under Armour.   These are your two stock picks?  </p><p>LARREA:  Well, the stock picks are not as important.  I mean, we can talk  about Google, we can talk about Apple.  More importantly is to establish  that habit where say if they bought Google at $100 it would be four times  the amount. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, you -- are you not recommending Nike?  </p><p>LARREA:  Well, no.  I'm not saying I'm not recommending anything.  All I'm  saying is that with names like this, they are names you can grow with.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.</p><p>LARREA:  They can grow with over several years.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So what do you like right now in terms of investing?  </p><p>LARREA:  Well, I do like the valuations on Google.  I do like the  valuations on Netflix.  I do like Nike.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.  So tell us about Google, what you like about Google.  </p><p>LARREA:  The thing about Google is they're establishing their campus here  in New York.  They've just expanded what they're going to be doing on the  west side.  It's a great stock.  If you look at the valuation, you just  can't go on the P.E. of course, you have to go on the fact that the  expansion here on the east coast bodes well for them and that they're  entrenched in multiple areas.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Revenue $33 billion in 18.  But look at the stock year-to-date,  it's had a rough couple of months.  Is that --</p><p>LARREA:  Well, everybody's had a rough couple of months.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, so is that something to point out in terms of valuation  for the youngster?  </p><p>LARREA:  Well, for the -- you definitely want to teach them, yes,  absolutely, that it's going to go down a bit but at the same time we're  going to go and we purchased it for you at a cheaper price so you say  here's the opportunity or in their devalue.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, what are the rules for a youngster?  I mean, a parent can  set up the account and hold it in that person's name?  What if you're too  young to actually have a brokerage account?  What is too young -- what is  too young?  </p><p>LARREA:  Well, it's 18 and younger.  I mean, you could do uniform gift  trust for a minors.  But generally you want to make sure that the parents  or the grandparents or your own aunts and uncles, they can purchase these  stocks and establish these accounts for kids.  They can get together with  the parents in on this and purchase over the years.  Or even do so in a --  in a drip plan as well.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, tell us about a drip plan.  What is a drip plan?</p><p>LARREA:  The drip plan is where they're investing directly with the  company.  I've seen many successful clients when they were -- they were  kids, the parents would set them up with a direct purchase from the  company, all right?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.  </p><p>LARREA:  It's not something I advocate for everybody.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And I've got -- I've got a couple names that you like, Nike,  Disney, Google, AT&amp;T, Under Armour, Netflix and Facebook.  That sounds  about right?  </p><p>LARREA:  Sounds right to me.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK, Aquiles, it's great to have you on the show this morning.</p><p>LARREA:  Thank you so much for having me.</p><p>LARREA:  It's a great idea, stock in your stocking.  Aquiles Larrea joining  us there.  </p><p>Still ahead, my exclusive interview with MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred, next  hour, right here, MORNINGS WITH MARIA, stay with us.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.

Take a look at Futures  big rally underway now.  We are at the highs of the morning with the Dow  Jones Industrial average up 178 points, three quarters of one percent  higher on Dow and the S&amp;P.  NASDAQ is up 52 points almost one percent  higher, big rally this morning after sharp selloff on Wall Street  yesterday.  </p><p>Yesterday, it was a tough day at the close.  All the major indices declined  better than two percent on the session.  On global growth and interest rate  worries, the Federal Reserve's two-day meeting on rates getting underway  today and we are expected the Feds to raise rates tomorrow.  </p><p>In Europe markets are mixed.  Take a look at the European indices right now  where the FT-100 is down 22 points, a third of a percent.  The CAC Quarante  is down a fraction and the DAX Index is up in Germany up 46 points.  </p><p>In Asia overnight, declines across the board, worst per former Japan, down  almost two percent.</p><p>We are watching the price of oil this morning.  Take a look, down 2-1/3  percent.  Crude oil down below $50.00 a barrel up for the first time in  over a year.  $48.74 a barrel on oil this morning.  </p><p>Les Moonves has been denied his severance package.  CBS announcing its  former CEO will not receive the expected $120 million package.  The details  on the board decision after the meeting Monday, coming up.  </p><p>The big business of baseball, I will sit down with MLB commissioner Rob  Manfred in a Fox Business exclusive this morning.  Get his take on growth  for the league and the latest on a deal for the regional sports networks  and streaming rights.  </p><p>All those stories coming up this morning and joining me to break it all  down, Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell, Forbes media chairman, former  Republican presidential candidate, Steve Forbes and 32 Advisor CEO and  former economic advisor to President Obama, Robert Wolf.  Great to see you  this morning.  </p><p>ROBERT WOLF, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CONTRIBUTOR:  Great to be here.</p><p>STEVE FORBES, CHAIRMAN AND EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, FORBES MEDIA:  Good morning.</p><p>WOLF:  So question, do you think with President Trump's tweets he kind of  hammering the Fed, don't do anything -- don't do anything.  You think  that's why the market just popped over the last hour?  And do you think  there could be a little head fake into the Fed decision?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I don't think so.  I don't think the Federal Reserve is going  to change its action because of the president's pressure, I don't.  I think  the Fed stated that I don't think Jay Powell is going to do -- I think the  winds are showing us that thing are slowing down.  The Federal Reserve  probably shouldn't raise rates tomorrow.  </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  But to that point, --</p><p>FORBES:  They have to do it just simply because to show that they're not  kowtowing to the president.  </p><p>WOLF:  Right, that's what my --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So they have to do it.</p><p>FORBES:  But the statement though put out will indicate instead of four  rate increases next year, they'll see how predictions well. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  The Journal's editorial today -- </p><p>FORBES:  And by the way, when Powell gave that speech couple of weeks ago,  they're now trying to walk it back, he was surrendering.  Any time the  White House goes after the Fed in a serious way the White House always  wins.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So you think the Fed is listening to the president, they're  surrendering.  </p><p>FORBES:  Yes, they've surrendered.  They're saying for next year they've  pulled back from a very aggressive program with rate increases they  surrender.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  Yes, but it's not just the president.  Dagen, the economy  is slowing down even the editorial board in the Journal is saying at this  morning.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right, that's what I was going to bring up is the time for a Fed  pause and they go through all the reasons why the Fed could and should  pause no sign of an inflation breakout.  Global economy that's slowing  signs that the U.S. is slowing with housing and autos, both down.</p><p>And then, basically, the biggest argument being the Fed is already  unwinding its balance sheet, the largest monetary experiment in modern  history.  </p><p>And they actually outline what Jay Powell should say about the president if  he's asked the inevitable question at his press conference.  Just I've seen  the president's comments but the Federal Reserve is an independent central  bank.  His comments make our job harder because they might call some  investors to think we make decisions based on political pressure.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I can assure you that we make our decisions on economic merit.   Some may choose not to believe that but they do so at their own risk.   That's the Journal writing what Jay Powell should say.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, just because the president saw the slowdown coming before  all of this about the Fed doesn't mean that they're kowtowing to the -- to  the president.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  The irony is it's part -- it's part of his policy that's caused  the turmoil in the markets and the slowdown because of the way that he's  handled trade.  And I talked about it all year long.  That you did so much  right with the tax cuts and the tax reform but then you slap tariffs on  American businesses to help you hurting a lot.  To help a few.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That is part -- that is part of it, for sure.  </p><p>WOLF:  I have been for rate increases to unwind what's happened in the last  few years where I think the Fed went too far on quantitative easing.  That  being said, the strong dollar based on what's going on around the world is  going to really impact us in a negative way.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let's bring in on that note Charles Schwabb chief investor  strategist Liz Ann Sonders.  I'm sure she has a thing or two to say about  that.  Good to see you Liz Ann, thank you so much for joining the  conversation.  </p><p>LIZ ANN SONDERS, CHIEF INVESTOR STRATEGIST, CHARLES SCHWAB:  Thank you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So what do you think in terms of rates and the dollar?  Robert  is bringing up the strong dollar here.  We have oil prices below $50.00 a  barrel this morning.  We've got a Federal Reserve possibly on hold if they  do, in fact, do the rate hike tomorrow but after that, on hold your  thoughts on where we are in terms of investing in markets today in the face  of all of these outside forces?  </p><p>SONDERS:  Well, we do think that Fed raises rates tomorrow and it's not  just to make a political statement.  But in line with their mandate.  You  know Maria, you were sitting on the day I set the Powell lunch at the  Economics Club of New York.  And I think one of the more important things  that he said was not that Fed funds rate was just full of the neutral rate  but re-enforcing the idea that financial market volatility alone is not  going to be a trigger for the Fed but it has to morph into financial system  stability.</p><p>And I think he made a very important distinction between those in essence  sending a message, we are not going to make monetary policy changes simply  because of market action, and given the fact that real rates are still only  zero and the fact that the market expects a hike.  I think if the Fed were  to pause tomorrow and not do something, I'm not so sure that would be a  positive message for market perspective.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right, because the president --</p><p>SONDERS:  Now, whether they caused hanging into next year data dependency  is legitimate.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right, because the president keeps talking about it.  In fact  he tweeted earlier this morning on the Fed and he said this, I hope that  people over at the Fed will read today's Wall Street Journal editorial  before they make yet another mistake.  Also, don't let the market become  anymore illiquid than it already is.  Stop with the $50 billion in the wind  down, feel the market, don't just go by meaningless numbers.  Good luck,  writes the president.  </p><p>Do you think the Fed gets political and listen to the Fed or is really what  driving the Fed the actual reality of this slowdown that we're seeing?   Which is what I mentioned a month ago?  </p><p>SONDERS:  I don't think -- I don't think the Fed gets political, and I  think the market doesn't want the Fed to get political.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>SONDERS:  I hope that Fed does not get political.  I think they should  continue to operate monetary policy by looking at their dual mandate.  And  we have to understand that as -- you know, a lot -- a lot of comments about  don't say it's different this time.  The laughter that tends to come about  about when you say that.  But it is certainly different in this environment  with rates having gone to zero into negative territory outside of the  United States.  $25 trillion added to global central bank -- central bank  balance sheets.  And we're now seeing that liquidity tied come out.  </p><p>There are no free lunches in even a normal environment when you start to  see tighter monetary policy, tighter financial conditions.  You tend to see  higher volatility in the equity market.  You shorten the duration between  then and a recession, you typically get a bear market, that's normal in a  cycle.  And I don't think we should attempt to change the cycle this time.   We are going to have the end of this cycle at some point.  </p><p>We will get another recession, we will have a bear market, in many ways  we're already in a bear market.  We've been in this stealth rolling bear  market which is a necessary reprising of many higher risk asset classes due  to this very different liquidity environment.  This is not a unique and  abnormal situation other than the extent of this unprecedented monetary  policy this time.  </p><p>FORBES:  Well you have the -- Liz Ann, Steve Forbes here.  You have  earnings going up next year not as robustly as they did after that tax cut.   And the economy is still growing.  Isn't it really the trade uncertainty  that is hurting now capital expenditures by businesses and the global  economy?  That if we got that out of the way then we'd be roaring ahead  again?  </p><p>SONDERS:  I don't know about roaring ahead.  I think trade is certainly one  of the near term uncertainties but tighter financial conditions has always  put downward pressure on multiples.  And multiples I think are also under  pressure because looking ahead to 2019, going from above 20 percent  earnings growth courtesy of tax cuts to now mid-single digits.  </p><p>Keep in mind too that the number one sector in terms of year over year  earnings growth expectations for next year is energy.  There's been almost  no haircutting to earnings yet on the energy sector for the collapse we've  seen in oil prices.  There also hasn't been much haircutting for the  strength of the dollar in the impact on exporters.</p><p>So, I think the path of least resistance for 2019 earnings is actually down  and we're not far from where we are toward potentially and earnings  recession like we got in late 2015 and 2016.  So I don't think even if some  of the trade concerns are alleviated that that is all systems go for next  year.  </p><p>Also, we've seen rate of change in the economy.  Better or worse matters  more than good or bad when it comes to the relationship between economic  data and the stock market.  Now investors often forget that.  It's not just  is it good or is it bad, is it stronger, is it weak.  But what's the  direction of change.  And there's enough underlying weakness happening in  some of the leading indicators.  The average workweek notwithstanding the  recent move back down a three month up trend in unemployment claims.  We'll  see what ISM new orders look like in the next release.  </p><p>So, those are some -- kind of in the armor that I think the market is  keying off of.  </p><p>WOLF:  Liz Ann, first of all I thought your 2019 market outlook piece was  great.  Really great read.  </p><p>SONDERS:  Thank you.</p><p>WOLF:  And I agree with you that this strong dollar something people aren't  focused on going into 19, especially with exports and manufacturing.  But  my question to you is can you talk a little about the lack of inflation  we're seeing and where do you see that impacting maybe a slowly raising  rate environment and maybe a slowdown that feels a little like -- you know,  you feel like there could be a stagnation coming the way -- the way you  kind of talk about it.  </p><p>SONDERS:  Right.  So there are -- there are long-term global secular  pressures down on inflation which I think will persist as -- you know, in  the near to medium term.  What we don't know is whether we're going start  to see some cyclical pressures on the upside courtesy of the tight labor  market.  And that's what makes it difficult sometimes for the Fed to put  something a little bit of a pickle, because unlike other central banks that  only have a single mandate and inflation, the Fed has dual mandate of full  employment and price stability.  And although we've got price stability,  we've got the tightness in the labor market and the increase in wages which  is great for workers, but could start to filter into rising core measures  of inflation.  </p><p>And given that core CPI is running above the Fed's target.  They have to  operate right now with their mandates maybe sending slightly different  messages right now.  And it is a difficult environment for them but given  that real rates are at zero right now, I don't think a hike this week  suggests that it's a major mistake and they've gone way too far on the --  on the tightening side.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Any thoughts on oil where it is?  Is that indicating that we're  seeing a sharp slowdown across the world?  I mean, oil below 50 it's either  an indicator or its going to be a positive for the economy, right?  </p><p>SONDERS:  I think there's a component of it reflecting global demand but  there's also, obviously, the supply side of the story as well.  You know,  we're at a level now 48 -- you know, I'm not an expert on oil but there is  sort of a sweet spot where it's high enough to be above break evens for the  shale and fracking companies.  But low enough that it's still a boost the  consumer part of the sector.  </p><p>But remember when we saw the collapse back in 2014, into 2015 it did lead  to a four consecutive quarter earnings recession, and did cause hits to the  capital spending side energy related.  </p><p>So, we do have to be mindful that this is not a purely positive story  anymore.  As it relates to lower oil prices simile being a benifit to the  consumer.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I totally agree.  Liz Ann, it's good to see you this morning.   Thank you so much.  </p><p>SONDERS:  Thanks.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Liz Ann Sonders, joining us.</p><p>President Trump just tweeted moments ago and here's what he's saying this  morning, illegal immigration cost the United States more than $200 billion  a year.  How was this allowed to happen?  Now the government shutdown is  looming on the horizon with just three full days left to broker a deal.   Our own Blake Burman is live at the White House this morning with the  latest on that.  Blake, good morning to you.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)</p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Maria, good morning to  you as well.  We could tell you that White House officials are already  preparing for the possibility that there could be a partial government  shutdown come this weekend.  We are told that President Trump does not want  a short-term solution in the name of one or two weeks that would  essentially just kick the can down a road -- down the road and have to deal  with this again in the upcoming days.  The White House also suggesting that  the president's threat still remains.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MERCEDES SCHLAPP, DIRECTOR, WHITE HOUSE STRATEGIC COMMUNICATIONS:  The  president as he mentioned last week, he would shut down the government to  increase funding for border security.  Now the key here is that we're going  see what deal the senate brings up.  And looking at a those details we'll  basically make the determination in which direction we're going to go.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURMAN:  So here's where things stand, President Trump wants $5 billion for  a border wall.  Democrats, though, willing to give less than a third of  that for what they are calling border security.  Chuck Schumer saying  yesterday on the floor of the Senate, that the simple reality is this, the  president does not have the votes on Capitol Hill to get his desired $5  billion.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. CHARLES SCHUMER (D-NY), SENATE MINORITY LEADER:  Even with a  Republican Congress, no threat or temper tantrum will get the president his  wall.  On the other hand, Democrats are altogether.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURMAN:  Maria, there was even a rumor at one pont yesterday afternoon that  there would be some sort of compromise that would be presented from up on  Capitol Hil but that never materialized.  It remains very unclear this  morning where both sides go from here but most especially the president,  Maria.  </p><p>(END VIDEO TAPE)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Blake thank you.  Blake Burman is at the White House this  morning.  We're going to take a short break.

Details   from the board meeting, coming up.  </p><p>Then the big business of baseball, why the Major League Baseball may be  abandoning the paid T.V. focus model.  I'll speak exclusively with MLB  commissioner Rob Manfred, coming up.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  CBS says Les Moonves will not receive his  severance package after all.  Cheryl Casone with the details now.  Cheryl?  </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Yes.  That severance was  potentially worth a 120 million.  This comes after an investigation into  allegations Moonves sexually assaulted several women.  According to the  board of directors, investigators found that he violated company policy  breached his employment contract, and intentionally failed to cooperate  fully with the investigation.  Now CBS is down 18 percent so far this year.</p><p>Well, former Nissan Chairman Carlos Ghosn pushed increase market share in  the U.S. creating tension with the company's management.  That's according  to The Wall Street Journal which says that Nissan executives believe that  Ghosn's plan would hurt investments in Japan.  Now Ghosn remains in jail  after being arrested in Japan last month for allegedly underreporting  income by 44 million.  Now he's denied any wrongdoing.  Taking a look at  shares Nissan they're down 18 percent so far this year.  The story  continues towns fold.</p><p>Well, Boeing is feeling bullish about its business by concerns about  slowing global growth.  The company is raising its quarterly dividend by 20  percent.  $2.05 a share.  Boeing also boosting its share buyback program to  20 billion.  Maria Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg discussed what's ahead for  his company with you recently.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, you've expanded the business, you've got commercial  airspace, you've got defense and then you've got services.  Tell us how  business is right now.</p><p>DENNIS MUILENBURG, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, BOEING:  Well, aerospace is a  tremendous growth business.  We look out over the next 10 years as $8.1  trillion marketplace, passenger traffic is growing at about six to seven  percent per year sustained.  The world needs about 43,000 new commercial  airplanes over the next 20 years.  Part of that have is the 737 as we  ramped up to 52 a month this year.  We'll be producing it 57 a month next  year.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE:  All right.  Shares of Boeing basically flat ahead of the opening  bell.  Actually, excuse me they are higher pup by 2-1/2 percent.  My  apologies, Maria.  There's the current premarket read on Boeing looking  good.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And that's one of the reason the market has accelerated  this morning, Boeing as a Dow Component.  Thank you, Cheryl.  Coming up.   Big tech in trouble.  Facebook, Twitter, Google all under fire for  reportedly providing insufficient information in the Russia probe.  We've  got that when we come right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Technology giants under fire after reports says  that they did not do enough to help lawmakers with the investigation into  Russian election interference.  Gerri Willis is on the floor of the New  York Stock Exchange this morning expecting a big rally at the start of  trading.  Gerri, good morning to you.  </p><p>GERRI WILLIS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Yes.  It does look like a big  rally but I got to tell you, Twitter, Facebook, Google all having their  issues this morning after third party studies.  Two of them written for the  Senate Intelligence Committee concluded that the companies did the bare  minimum possible and I'm quoting there to explain the Russian  misinformation campaign and how they manipulated these social media sites.</p><p>And the rechair extraordinary, that's what we're finding out of these  studies.  126 million on Facebook, 20 million on Instagram, and today the  NAACP getting into the act returning a donation from Facebook.  And they're  calling for a daylong boycott that is of the social media network.  Why,  revelations that the platform was used to manipulate black voters in the  2016 election aiming for voter suppression.</p><p>Now, Sheryl Sandberg, the COO there, she had something to say about this  and I quote, \"Facebook committed to working with leading U.S. civil rights  organizations to strengthen an advance civil rights honor service.  They've  raised a number of important concerns, she says, and I'm grateful for their  candor and guidance\".  So big headlines there.  Those stocks moving higher  actually in the premarket.</p><p>Meanwhile, Oracle reporting last night and it was considered a positive  report despite the fact that the company reported flat revenue.  You talk  to, Maria, you talked to Larry Ellison recently about the company and its  prospects.  Listen.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>WILLIS:  Tell us where you find the growth stories within Oracle and the  industry, what's the most exciting now?  </p><p>LARRY ELLISON, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, ORACLE:  Well, in terms of growth,  I mean, if you're looking at the numbers, there is two separate questions.   What do you think the coolest new technology is that we're working on,  which might not have shown up in the numbers yet and then what, you know,  what showing up in the numbers, what have we been doing well for a while so  you can actually see it through the financial results?</p><p>And that's our status applications.  We are by far in a way the largest  provider of cloud applications for financial accounting or for supply  chain.  For manufacturing, we have now 6,000 ERP customers for our fusion  sweep.  Another 15,000 for our net sweep, ERP customers financial  accounting customers.  Our closest competitor claims to have a couple of  hundred customers.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILLIS:  So the company reporting flat revenue for the quarter but that was  better than Wall Street expected.  The company stock closed down yesterday  but we'll keep an eye on it today, Maria.  Back to you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Gerri.  Thank you so much.  Gerri Willins on the  floor of the NYC.  Dagen, your thoughts?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I think that you have been so far head on talking to these  technology executives.  I think that the people know -- can see the world  12 months ahead as they watch this program regularly.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's all about growth and we've pinpointed growth in all of  these sectors throughout the year but you're right, this year we had a  number of the leading executives from technology on.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Ellison, Satya Nadella, numerous people from Microsoft, even  Steve Ballmer talking about China.  You name it.  Dan Niles has been  basically if investors were watching this program they would have seen the  downfall of Apple stock if they listened to your interview with Dan Niles.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  He was excellent actually and he still has issue in terms  of Apple and what's going on with the consumer.  So we'll see.  I think it  will be a good fourth quarter in terms of holiday sales.  What do you think  in terms of the consumer right now?  A lot of people coming this program,  the head of the international shopping centers came on, he said it's going  to be a fantastic holiday shopping season.  What do you think, how's the  consumer right now?  </p><p>FORBES:  I think the consumer is going to buy it but with an eye towards  holding back in the first quarter of next year.  They want to have a good  Christmas.  They want to make everyone happy.  But they're going to be very  uncertain going into January.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>FORBES:  What do we do next?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  A lot of uncertainties out there.  Coming up.  Helicopter  parent alert.  Parent putting themselves in financial danger supporting  their adult children.  Details coming up.  Then the MLB could be on move.   I'm talking to future of baseball in an exclusive interview with MLB  Commissioner Rob Manfred after this.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back to Tuesday morning, everybody.  Thanks so much for  joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it is Tuesday, December 18th.  Your  top stories right now, 8:30 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>Bulls taking the lead this morning.  Take a look at Futures indicating a  nice rally at the start of trading.  Now, we are off of the highs of the  morning here.  But we're looking at again at the start of trading of about  150 points.  Two-thirds of one percent higher on the Dow, almost one  percent higher on the Nasdaq.</p><p>This, of course, ahead of the Federal Reserve's two-day meeting which  begins today.  The Fed is expected to raise interest rates tomorrow for the  last time in 2018.  We're expecting a couple of heights next year, as well.</p><p>European Indexes look like this, this morning.  A mixed story in Europe  with the FT-100 down 27 points, the CAC Quarante in Paris down 4 points.   And the DAX index in Germany up at 35 percent, 37 points higher.</p><p>Asian markets closed lower overnight as you see here across the board.   Crude oil is a big story this morning.  The price of crude now back below  $50.00 a barrel.  For the first time since October 2017, with the decline  of 2-1/2 percent right now at 48.67.</p><p>Then, the bank of mom and dad.  How parents are putting themselves in  danger supporting their adult children.  What is the cutoff there?  We're  going to take a look, coming up.  But first, the big business of baseball.   A lot going on in the offseason, and it is all about growth.</p><p>From streaming rights to betting on games, to getting Millennials back into  America's favorite pastime.  Joining me right now, the Commissioner of  Major League Baseball, Rob Manfred.  Commissioner, it's great to see you.</p><p>ROB MANFRED, COMMISSIONER, MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL:  Nice to see you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.  So, where is the growth in  baseball right now?  This is not your father's baseball game anymore, is  it?</p><p>MANFRED:  Well, I think the growth for us over the last decade is really  been to places in there -- in our traditional media business.  And then, in  the digital area.  We've been a leader in that space at that's the leading  sports app out there, and it's been a great growth driver for us.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And the games are on traditional broadcast television.  Still  bringing in the money, we know that strong rating, as well, for the  traditional baseball.  But you're moving also into streaming.  Tell us what  you're doing?</p><p>MANFRED:  Well, we were one of the first direct-to-consumer, over-the-top  products offered to the consumer.  We've been a leader in this space.  The  current opportunity relates to the existing cable model, the regional  sports networks that are for sale.</p><p>Obviously, they're a creature of the cable model, but our ownership that  digital rights presents, a real opportunity for the industry going forward.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Those are big opportunity.  So, tell us, have you seen any  reaction from fans about this?</p><p>MANFRED:  Well, I think our fans want to be able to consume the game and  the platforms that they're naturally on.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Everywhere.</p><p>MANFRED:  That's why we have experimented with things.  We had 30 games on  Facebook last year, we have a relationship with Twitter.  YouTube is been  very active with respect to our product.  And it's important for us to  deliver games in the way that fans want to see them.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Now, I'm glad you mentioned Facebook, how did that go with  Facebook?</p><p>MANFRED:  Well, I think the most interesting thing about Facebook is it  gave us an audience that was dramatically different from our traditional  broadcast audience.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow!</p><p>MANFRED:  And obviously that encourages you to be more aggressive because  you're not cannibalizing your traditional product.  In fact, it's an  additive opportunity.  So we're very positive on the experiment.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Now, MLB is also emerging as a suitor for Fox regional sports  networks.  Can you tell us about that?</p><p>MANFRED:  Yes, we're interested in the regionals -- you know that in 12  markets, baseball on the regional sports network is the number one  programming throughout this summer.  In 24 or 25 markets that we operate in  were the number one programming on cable.</p><p>So these regional sport networks are really valuable, valuable assets.  And  we think that the combination of that traditional mode of delivery and the  digital rights that we control is an opportunity for the game.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Amazon also reportedly interested in making a deal?</p><p>MANFRED:  Amazon has been around the process.  You know, exactly who's  going to be in, who's going to be out remains to be seen.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, the last time we spoke, you were talking a little about  technology, in how you've inserted lots of tech into the game to get people  in the seats in the stadium.</p><p>MANFRED:  Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How's that going?  I mean a lot of people have the goods to  watch the game at home on their big screen T.V., and they don't need to  come to the stadium.</p><p>MANFRED:  Well, I think baseball is fortunate.  There's a huge  differentiation between our in part product and watching the game on T.V.   The social aspect of it is really important to a lot of our fans and we've  been very fortunate in terms of our ability to continue to get people to go  to the stadium.</p><p>But I think in order to continue that trend, it's important that we deliver  the fans, opportunities in the stadium.  And the best way to do that is by  technology.  Great example is our Ballpark app.</p><p>It gives fans the opportunity to look while they're in the stadium and find  entertainment alternatives in the stadium while they're there.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I love it.  I love it.  All right, let's talk about sports  betting.  Because you recently announced a gaming partnership with MGM  Resorts.  Tell us about that.  Where does the gambling model for baseball  go at this point?</p><p>MANFRED:  Well, I think it's important to pick the right partners, and MGM  certainly fit that bill.  We wanted a partner that we could proceed slowly  with, that we can make sure that we always protect the integrity of the  game.</p><p>For us right now, we see it as a sponsorship fan, engagement opportunity.   You know, fans are always looking for ways to get a deeper involvement with  the game, and sports betting is one of those avenues.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I mean we know people are betting.  Why not do it in a legal  platform.</p><p>MANFRED:  Well, I think all of the commissioners, two of the major sports  to a greater or lesser extent have recognized that sports betting is going  on, and we're better off having it legal than we are illegal.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Exactly.  So, let's talk about the game in general.  Because  it's slower than other sports games.  And that has some people thinking  well, that's for my father, for my grandfather.  How do you get the  Millennials engaged, young people engaged into the game?</p><p>MANFRED:  Well, I think that I can mention four things.  Number one is  technology.  We've talked about that already.  Nothing Millennials like  better than technology.  And our technology has been a leader for more than  a decade.</p><p>Secondly, our clubs have done a phenomenal job about redesigning stadiums,  having what they refer to as millennial areas.  They're more like bars,  flexible seating arrangements, flexible ticketing arrangements.</p><p>You buy a pass for the month, you can go whenever you want.  Maybe don't  stay the whole game.  But you're there, you're in the ballpark.  And then,  I think there's ancillary items like food, we did a -- we started a new  program last year.  The MLB Food Fest had a tremendous interest herein New  York, and it featured the ballpark food that a lot of our fans, love.  And  we know, Millennials and food go together.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MANFRED:  So, those are just three examples of the things we're trying to  do.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What do we expects for ticket prices?</p><p>MANFRED:  Look, our ticket prices -- I think have grown at a very, very  modest rate that we remain the best buy in sports in terms of the  opportunity to attend the game live.  And from a pricing perspective, our  theory always has been that we need to be a family-friendly price product.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, because this is a family -- this is a family outing.</p><p>MANFRED:  It is indeed.  I mean, and we think that's an important part of  how the game gets passed on to the next generation.  I think a lot of us, I  certainly do have memories of my parents taking me and it started my love  to the game.  And we think that fundamental family activity is still really  important for us.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, we're in the offseason, we've already seen some big trades.   Tell us about that, Robertson, can now going to the Mets.  Do you expect  more blockbuster traits like that deals this offseason?</p><p>MANFRED:  I do expect that the activity will continue to be high through  the offseason.  Our calendar is moved a little bit.  It used to be by the  time you get to the holiday break that a lot of the activity was done, in  more recent years, we've seen that activity continued into January and  February.  And I think that's good for the sport.  You know it generates  interest during the offseason.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What about the big prizes in this year's free agent class?  I  mean, Bryce Harper, obviously.  How much money is it going to take to land  some of these guys?</p><p>MANFRED:  Well, look, you know, you'll appreciate this.  The market will  determine how much money it takes the -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  But it's a record-breaking deals, right?</p><p>MANFRED:  Right, yes.  Look, there are two great players that entered free  agency at a relatively young age.  And I think they're going to be  appealing to clubs.  I'm sure there'll be a lot of activity for both of  them.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Now, what do you -- what do you expecting in terms of the year  ahead?  Give us your expectations.</p><p>MANFRED:  Well, I think we're looking forward to another great year.  One  of the great things about baseball in sort of our modern incarnation is the  competitive balance that we have.</p><p>I think, last year, some of the surprise stories from clubs that people  didn't think we're going to be competitive.  Clubs like Tampa, I think make  for real excitement for us.  Tampa, Oakland, Pittsburgh, we're all in that  category.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're right.</p><p>MANFRED:  So, we're hoping that we have those surprises that continue to  drive an interest.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Great.  Commissioner, it's great to see you.</p><p>MANFRED:  It's great to see you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  Commissioner Rob Manfred, there.  Coming  up, going back to its roots.  How the nation's oldest brewery is  celebrating its 190th birthday.  Then, a warning for parent; you could be  putting yourself in financial danger if you're supporting adult children.   The alarming new study right after this.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Two police officers were killed in the line of  duty.  Cheryl Casone with the details now, Cheryl.  </p><p>CASONE:  Well, Maria, the Chicago Police Department says officers Eduardo  Marmolejo and Conrad Gary were fatally struck by a train, while they were  looking for a shooting suspect.  They were investigating a shots-fired call  on the city's far-south side.  Both officers served less than three year on  the force.  Chicago Police say the suspect was later taken into custody.  </p><p>Well, a judge in Missouri has decided to add a special feature to a deer  poacher sentence.  David Barry and four other men had their hunting  privileges revoked; had to pay 51,000 in fines for illegally killing  wildlife.  But the judge also ordered Barry to watch this every month.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Quick, the second.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Faster, faster Bambi.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>CASONE:  Yes, that's right.  Barry has to watch Disney classic \"Bambi,\" at  least once a month during his year-long jail sentence.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CASONE:  Can't make this up.  Conservation agents have called this deer  poaching case one of the largest in Missouri history, OK.  </p><p>And then, there was this.  (INAUDIBLE) is taking a page from its history to  celebrate its 190th anniversary; this is the oldest brewery in the United  States and they're rolling out five limited edition cans of Lager.  The  cans, which are going to be released each month from now until April are  going to show how the breweries label has changed since 1829.  They're also  going to release a limited-edition Bourbon barrel aged beer; those aged in  caves.  They were dug by hand back in the 1800s.</p><p>Finally, there is this, check this out.  A three-year-old boy nails the  national anthem before a Syracuse women's basketball game.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave.</p><p>(CHEERING)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>CASONE:  Yes, he's three.  Drake Winslow got a huge ovation from the crowd;  he belted out anthem.  He didn't even look at the words, Maria; he just  knew it and sang it.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I love it.  Great.  And I like the \"Bambi\" movie, too.  You  watch \"Bambi\" and you're going to like it.  </p><p>CASONE:  Yes, you're going to watch that every month buddy.  Stop hunting.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much, Cheryl.  Coming up, taking care of adult  children a startling new study out with a surprising number of adults still  living with their parents.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  How about this, the bank of mom and dad is open  for business.  A new study from Merrill Lynch finds American parents are  spending $500 billion a year to support their adult children; that number  represents twice the amount those parents are investing in their own  retirements.  Joining us right now is the author of the upcoming book,  \"Everyday Millionaires,\" Ramsey Solutions Financial Expert, Chris Hogan.   Chris, good see you.  </p><p>CHRIS HOGAN, FINANCIAL EXPERT, RAMSEY SOLUTIONS:  Good to see you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, this study is basically saying if you are supporting your  adult children, as they get older, that money is being taken away from your  own retirement?</p><p>HOGAN:  It really is.  And it's alarming, Maria.  I mean 63 percent of the  parents say that they've sacrificed their own financial security to be able  to help adult grown children.  So, what parents need to do is set their  kids up for success, help them to learn how to be independent by teaching  them money skills, and how to deal with it.  Another aspect of the study  said one in four people in homes are either working or going to school.  So  I want to know what are they doing?</p><p>FORBES:  Hey, do you think -- Steve Forbes here, do you think that the  booming economy, bringing people back in the labor force is going to help  the situation, get the kids out of the basement before they reach  eligibility for Social Security?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>HOGAN:  Well, Steve, I think, you know, the job and the booming economy is  one thing, but if you don't have motivated young people that don't know  that they need to do something, I don't think anything will change.  So, I  think parents need to understand there's a difference between helping  versus hampering these adult children.  Help them do a resume, help them  get out and get any kind of job to have income coming in.</p><p>FORBES:  Chris, I just want to play devil's advocate here 20, 25 years ago,  529s was not a big thing.  Savings plan for colleges and all these type of  things, so today, kids are coming out of school with much more student loan  debt than they ever had.  Wages have slowed since they've actually entered  their adulthood.  And so, what do you say about those causes that actually  in some ways forces the parents to be a helping hand?  I just could play  the other side if you just look at the last decade.</p><p>HOGAN:  Well, I think we can always look and see how things are changing,  how inflation causes the cost of things to be able to go up, but I'm here  to tell you, you can go to school without taking out student loans, you can  work at night and go to school during the day or work during the day and go  to school at night.  So I think there are opportunities that are out there.   There are pizzas that need to be delivered, there are jobs that can be  done.  What we don't want to do is make an excuse for people not moving  forward.  I don't think any parent wants to hamper their child.  I think  they want to set them up for success.  So, it's about taking steps moving  in the right directions.  Your name is M-O-M not A-T-M, so young people  need to learn how to make their own money and take care of business.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I like that.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's the veruca salt economy, Chris.  It is the I want it, and I  want it now.  I want to feast, I want a bean feast, cream cakes and donuts  and fruitcake with no nuts.  Give it to me now, and that's the parents'  fault. </p><p>HOGAN:  Well, I agree.  I mean, young people are kids.  I mean, there's a  difference between kids and grown adult children.  I mean, parents love  kids and they want to show love to their kids, but I think we have to be  careful that we're not spoiling them and setting them up to have this  expectation for everything they want right when they want it.  It's OK,  it's called a plan.  You save up and then you buy.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  All right.  Cut them off, Chris, that's your advice.   Thank you so much.  Chris Hogan joining us there.  Coming up, final  thoughts from this all-star panel.  We'll be right back.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Let's take a look at Futures this morning.  We  are expecting a rally at the start of trading.  Now, that's the start of  trading.  We'll see how it ends, but the Dow Industrials right now showing  a gain of 138 points, S&amp;P is up 14-1/2, NASDAQ is up 37-1/2.  But, of  course, it's been a rough couple of months with the main culprits being,  what, you think it's this trade uncertainty, Steve.  We also have a Federal  Reserve meeting which begins today, and we are expecting the Feds to raise  rates tomorrow.</p><p>FORBES:  Yes, and that's been signaled for months so that wouldn't be  affecting the market.  But the uncertainty about trade is hurting  investment, hurting capital expenditures, hurting economies around world.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You want a China deal.</p><p>FORBES:  I want a China deal.  Sooner the better.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I don't know how soon that's going to happen, Robert.  You  know, there are some real issues that China -- Chinese are doing like  spying, espionage, like you know, not opening up its markets to foreigners  and stealing I.P.</p><p>WOLF:  Listen, we've been speaking about this for a long time but a lot  over the last few months.  I'm completely support of President Trump  playing hardball with china on intellectual property and patent.  I think  there's ways to go criminally after them with espionage.  OK, stealing our  business and economic patents.  That being said, Steve and I would agree on  this, we don't support the policy of tariffs.  It hits back at our own  consumers, and then the largest nation in the world of consumers 75 percent  of our GDP is consumption.  You're taxing them.  So I think there's a  better way to go about it.  To answer your question in a long, winded  approach, I don't see a trade deal coming in the next 60 days since the day  count started December 1st.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, I've got to say, Dagen, you were on these tariffs --  particularly, the steel and aluminum tariffs from day one.  You saw it as a  negative, you saw it that it would cut into profits, and that it would hurt  the economy.  That's exactly what's playing out in markets right now.  You  are right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  And ham-handed haphazard policy and the President is  tweeting, you know, relentlessly about the Federal Reserve.  He might not  be able to control Jay Powell despite the fact that he picked him to run  the Central Bank, but he can control the tariffs that have been slapped on  American businesses.  To the point that retaliation from China has caused  two tranches of corporate welfare for farmers in these countries.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Yes, go ahead.</p><p>FORBES:  Maria, if I can say one thing, think about this circle that has  taken place.  We are borrowing from China, then we do the trade tariffs,  and now we're talking the money we've borrowed from China and we just gave  $9 billion to the farmers who are being hurt by the tariffs.  I mean, if  that's not a circular disaster, I mean, honestly.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, it leads me -- it leads me to the conversation of money,  and you have a documentary that you are launching tonight, previewing  tonight: \"IN MONEY WE TRUST\" Steve Forbes, tell us about it.</p><p>FORBES:  Yes, it's done under the hospice of American -- Maryland Public  television.  There's a presenting station, but it's the history of money  over 2500 years based on the book that I co-authored several years ago, and  it makes the point, when money is trustworthy, societies prosper, when  money is unstable, as it has been in recent years, you not only see  economic consequences but also social consequences as well.  We demystify  money, there's too much jargon around it we play it out simple.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Where's the trust today.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No, the (INAUDIBLE) people were paying their rent with butter.</p><p>FORBES:  We have a chapter on that in the film.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I knew you would, Steve Forbes.  I knew you would.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That is great.  All right.  So, in money we trust is the film.   Congrats on that film.</p><p>FORBES:  Yes.  We have over public T.V. stations January and following.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We look forward to it.</p><p>FORBES:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Great show, everybody.  Great to see you, Dagen, Steve Forbes,  and Robert Wolf. </p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

Good  morning to you, and happy Tuesday.  Good morning, everyone.  Thank you for  joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Tuesday, December 18th.  Your  top stories right now just before 6:00 a.m. on the East Coast. </p><p> Investors finding their footing today, take a look.  A little stabilization  going on after another rough day yesterday.  Futures indicating a higher  opening this morning for the broader averages, Dow Industrials set to open  up better than 60 points, quarter of a percent.

And joining me to break to all down, FOX Business Network's Dagen  McDowell, Forbes Media Chairman and Former Republican Presidential  Candidate, Steve Forbes, and 32 Advisors CEO, Former Economic Adviser to  President Obama, Robert Wolf is here.  Great to see you this morning.  </p><p> ROBERT WOLF, 32 ADVISORS CEO &amp; FORMER ECONOMIC ADVISOR TO PRESIDENT OBAMA:   Great morning.  </p><p> STEVE FORBES, FORBES MEDIA CHAIRMAN AND FORMER REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL  CANDIDATE:  Good to be here.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Morning.  </p><p> FORBES:  And those futures -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p> FORBES:  -- after a thousand-point fall, yes, we like the green, but we'd  like to see more green. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  For sure.  What is going on, Steve?  This month has been one of  the worst months we've seen in terms of markets.  </p><p> FORBES:  Everyone suddenly has become pessimistic, the concern about trade,  very, very real, you know, it's nice vibrations coming out, but people now  want to see a real deal.  This is holding back capital expenditures, U.S.  economy starting to show signs of slowing down.  If we get this trade thing  out of the way, you'll see the U.S. pick up and you'll start to see finally  next year, Europe making serious structural changes -- </p><p> WOLF:  Yes.  </p><p> FORBES:  -- in their economies just as it happened in 1980s when Ronald  Reagan showed the way in the U.S.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p> FORBES:  Within a few years, Maria, 50 countries reduced sharply their  taxes. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Wow, OK.  </p><p> WOLF:  Yes, I -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So you want to see a deal with China?  That's the big sticking  point. </p><p> FORBES:  I want to see -- yes, that's the big one.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  OK.  </p><p> WOLF:  And I think their incredible headwinds geopolitically, I mean Brexit  -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p> WOLF:  -- highly unlikely it's going to take place as is.  Germany slowing,  France we will talk about what's going on there.  China's slowing -- so the  -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Italy, budget issues. </p><p> WOLF:  So I think all around us, you know, we're doing so much better, but  it eventually impacts a little, too, but I think right now, there's also  incredible anxiety coming in with the Democratic house and the, you know,  and the President, you know.  Hopefully, we can get back to work as opposed  to just keep on attacking each other but -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p> WOLF:  -- it feels like that's not working too well right now either. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's true.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  And -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  A lot of uncertainty over that. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  The Wall Street Journal Editorial Page, we'll discuss this as  the morning move on, but time for a Fed pause -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  And they lay out the case for pausing and I know Steve is going  to agree with -- maybe agree with that, I don't know.  But then also I  would argue that it's hard to quantify this, but the Mueller Probe -- </p><p> WOLF:  Yes.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  -- is weighing on markets as well.  We saw it during the Ken  Starr investigation into President Bill Clinton in the -- in the months  leading up.  There was a lot of other things going on, long-term capital  management collapsed, which I know that you know well.  But, again, it was  on the margin.  It was -- </p><p> WOLF:  Real lack of confidence in the system right now. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  -- adding through the -- yes.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  I think you're right. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Absolutely.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  I think, you know, this -- the president is being investigated  in all corners of his life -- </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  -- right now.  You've got the Democratic majority coming in in  the new congress.  People don't know where this is going. </p><p> FORBES:  Well, they want to -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So -- </p><p> FORBES:  -- do the political equivalent of killing him by a thousand cuts.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's right.  </p><p> FORBES:  Now a big thing, but just every part of his life.  </p><p> WOLF:  And then lastly -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, and markets know that.</p><p> WOLF: Yes.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And I think you're absolutely right about that. </p><p> WOLF:  And one topic we'll speak about, a government shutdown's never good. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p> WOLF:  So, they should also get a deal. </p><p> BARTIROMO: But that's the least of it.  I mean is it because it's a partial  shutdown?  </p><p> FORBES:  Yes.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  It's another uncertainty piece.  We got a big show this  morning, coming up.  Joining the conversation, Kansas Congressman and House  Committee on Small Business member, Roger Marshall, is here this morning,  along with Former White House Communications Director SkyBridge Capital  Founder, Anthony Scaramucci, with us this miss a moment.  The CEO of  Nielsen is here, David Kenny, going to walk us through what he's seeing out  there.  And the Commissioner of the MLB, Rob Manfred, making an appearance.   He's in studio this morning.  Don't miss a moment of it.  We got a big  three hours coming up.  </p><p> We kick it off with this top story, and that is markets, Futures indicating  we could see a higher opening this morning.  But of course nothing to the  tune of what we've been seeing on the downside.  The Dow fell more than 500  points yesterday on global growth concerns.  This morning, we're looking at  the market up 81 on the Dow, 29 higher on the NASDAQ.  This is the Federal  Reserve is being its two-day policy meeting today.  Officials are expected  to announce they will raise interest rates tomorrow.  </p><p> Joining us right now to talk more about all of that is Barry Bannister.  He  is Stifel, Head of Equity of Strategist.  And Barry, it's good to see you  today.  Thanks so much for joining us.  What's your take -- </p><p> BARRY BANNISTER, HEAD OF EQUITY STRATEGY, STIFEL:  Thanks, Maria,</p><p> BARTIROMO:  -- on what's been going on with these markets down so much?  So  such nervousness.  </p><p> BANNISTER:  Look, I know that trade and politics grabs a lot of headlines,  but their background music, the lead singer in this band is the Fed.  We've  had three concerns this year, one is our earnings estimate around midyear  was a six percent below the average of sell side strategists.  Second, we  knew that interest rates, in a real sense, which is the interest rate after  inflation, as it began to rise off a real low level, the P/E ratio, the  price to earnings ratio, the market would come down. </p><p> And the third is I think the Fed's making the same mistake they made in the  second half of 2014 and all of 2015, which is that there are interest rate  policies diverging from the rest of the world.  So, that's been pressuring  the market. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I mean The Journal this morning, as Dagen noted earlier,  has an editorial commenting on the impending Fed decision.  The article is  titled \"Time for a Fed Pause,\" and the article writes this in part, \"The  right answer is to ignore the politics inside and outside the Fed and  follow the signals that suggest a prudent pause in raising interest rates,  get the monetary policy that best serves the economy and politics will work  itself out.\"  I assume you agree with that.  Do you expect the Fed raises  rates tomorrow and how many are you expecting in 2019? </p><p> BANNISTER:  I think the Fed will raise rates, but we see this deceleration  in the economy, and that's pretty normal, as the economy expands for a long  time.  Think of a car going from 65 miles an hour down to about 40 or 45  miles an hour, that's the order of magnitude of the slowdown.  I do think  the Fed will pause, but that would be after rate hike tomorrow.  </p><p> One thing to consider, though, is that I actually think by 2020, they  unwind the rate increase of September 26 and tomorrow, and have to cut  rates, but that would just be normal operations of policy as the cycle  matures. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Next year, you think they'll cut? </p><p> BANNISTER:  Well, that would take a while before they cut rates. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  OK.  So maybe 2020? </p><p> BANNISTER:  But what we're seeing right now is that they're -- yes, well,  we're talking about weakness in 2020 when the fiscal policy stimulus really  wears off.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Understood.  </p><p> BANNISTER:  And the economy will be in a more advanced stage, yes.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Steve Forbes. </p><p> FORBES:  Barry, in terms of the Fed, the Fed has been signaling these  interest rate hikes, especially this one for months and months, why would  the markets suddenly react when this has been on the table and the Fed's  made it clear what's going to happen for months and months?  The market  always anticipates the future.  Don't you think it's other factors that are  weighing on the market not just the Fed, which told us they're going to --  months ago, they're going to raise the rate this month? </p><p> BANNISTER:  Yes, we've had the -- as I said, the lowest target for earnings  next year, of all the sell-side strategist and the second large -- lowest  price target at 2,800.  So, what we've been discounting is the earnings,  weakness, and the valuation compression.  But I do think earnings will grow  next year albeit low to mid-single digits, and I think the price to  earnings ratio will stabilize.  So, things should start to get better.  But  right now, the market's been weighed on by simple math.  Earnings, price to  earnings ratio, and interest rates. </p><p> WOLF:  Hey -- </p><p> MCDOWELL:  No, one thing -- </p><p> WOLF:  Go ahead.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  -- I just wanted to point out that The Journal mentions in the  editorial, there -- there's this kind of knee-jerk fixation on short-term  interest rates and what the Fed is doing, because in history, that's what  we focus on.  But this is a historic expansion of the balance sheet, it was  unprecedented during the financial crisis and The Journal Editorial Page  writes the larger argument.  It's not just that inflation is contained,  that the global economy is slowing.  </p><p> But the larger argument for a pause is the Fed is unwinding, the largest  monetary experiment in modern history, Central Banks move -- around the  world, moving away from the multitrillion dollar bond purchases, which we  saw in Europe just last week and zero interest rates.  What is the normal  interest rate in this post-crisis world, we don't know, and we doubt the  Fed does either.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  So it's been focused on the balance sheet and that's what the  Fed should be doing in terms of pausing according to The Journal. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And that goes against the feeling the day after the Powell  speech, right?  Where people were surmising that he was basically saying,  \"We're at neutral.  We're close to neutral.\"</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right.  Which The Journal, some days later, wrote -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Exactly.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  -- \"Hey,\" because again they're kind of the bullhorn for the  Federal Reserve.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  And they warn the market got it wrong. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  He said that he was close to the range of being neutral, which  is two and a half to three and a half percent. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  So, we're at two and a two to two and a quarter before the high  -- </p><p> WOLF:  Listen, can I just -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  It's not what Ray Dalio -- </p><p> WOLF:  Hey, Barry -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  -- near neutral, but -- </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  -- we will see.  That's the debate. </p><p> WOLF:  Barry, I was surprised by your comments of expecting a slowdown next  year.  Is that with GD -- with growth below three percent, is that with a  loosening of the labor market?  Where do you see the slower growth coming  in? </p><p> BANNISTER:  Yes.  I was talking about nominal growth.  I'm in the view that  the Fed is actually failing its price stability mandate and that gives them  an excuse to pause.  They'll probably do pauses on a quarterly basis with  renewals.  I doubt they're going to commit to any sort of full-year view,  but right now, I think inflation will pull back and that would push you  down towards around three, three and a half percent nominal GDP, and about  two and a half percent, maybe three percent industrial production growth  and S&amp;P earnings tend to be -- this S&amp;P 500, tend to be more cyclical than  the broader economy because larger capital intensive companies are publicly  held. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.  What about the China fight?  You're expecting the  ceasefire at the G20 meeting with China to fade? </p><p> WOLF:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p> BANNISTER:  Well, one of the problems with the market today is a vacuum.   We don't have a lot of information.  In other words, during Bush 41's  funeral, the Fed's testimony to Congress was canceled Wednesday two weeks  ago.  So, the Fed went into a quiet period and we have absolutely no idea  what they're thinking, and doing, and talking about.  The second thing is  these 90-day renew -- renewals on trade talks are not something into which  the public has much visibility. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's true.  </p><p> BANNISTER:  So in the absence of information, you've got a vacuum, and when  you have a vacuum, prices fall. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  All right, Barry.  You do like consumer staples, you say  health care utilizes and telecom because you think bond proxies are better  in this environment.  </p><p> BANNISTER:  Yes, Maria.  When I was on your show a couple of weeks ago, I  said the 10-year yield would fall, it's come in from about three and a  quarter to 2.88.  I think that thing could fall down to around 2.7, invert  the 10 to two.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Wow.  </p><p> BANNISTER:  And when you look at the 10-year minus the two-year yield,  what'll happen is the Fed will be forced to pause for longer.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p> BANNISTER:  And if the Fed tries to ignore the yield curve, I think they'll  be making a mistake.  They made excuses for why the yield curve didn't  matter in 2000 and 2007.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Hmm.  </p><p> BANNISTER:  The whole world is a carry trade.  The last thing you want to  do is invert the curve.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll leave it there.  We'll be watching, Barry.   Great insights from you.  Thanks so much.  </p><p> BANNISTER:  Thank you.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Barry Bannister from Stifel there.  Coming up, severance has  been denied for outset CBS Head, Les Moonves.  He will not receive a $120  million package with he was expecting.  Details from the board meeting  coming up.  And then the tale of two companies, new questions for the Elon  Musk over the financial ties between his Boring Company and SpaceX, back in  a moment with that.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Two police officers were hit and killed by a  train.  Cheryl Casone with headlines now, Cheryl. </p><p> CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  This is such a sad story,  Maria.  Good morning to you.  The Chicago Police Department says that  officers Eduardo Marmolejo and Conrad Gary were fatally struck by a train  while looking for a shooting suspect.  Of course this happened in Chicago.   They were investigating a shots fired called on the city's far south side,  both officers served less than three years on the force.  Chicago Police  say the suspect was later taken into custody.  </p><p> Well, CBS says it will not pay former Chairman and CEO Les Moonves any of  this $120 million severance package.  The decision coming after an  investigator and to allegations he sexually assaulted several women.   According to the Board of Directors, investigators found that he violated  company policy, he breached his employment contract, and he intentionally  failed to cooperate fully with the investigation.  Take a look at shares of  CBS, the stock itself actually down 18 percent so far this year.  </p><p> Well, Elon Musk's tunnel-digging project, the Boring Company set to open  its first tunnel today in Los Angeles.  This comes as Musk is, again,  coming under fire, this time for the relationship between two of his  companies.  Wall Street Journal reports that the Boring Company is being  pulled into Musk controversial practice of spreading overlapping assets  across this different companies.  Now The Journal writes this arraignment  has alarmed some long-time investors in SpaceX, including its largest  outside backer, Peter Thiel's Founders Fund pet.  The investors questioned  SpaceX about why their investment dollars were instead partly used to start  a separate company that benefited Musk. </p><p> OK.  Frustrated New York commuters are going to feel more the Christmas  spirit today.  The Christmas decorations over the Holland Tunnel that  caused a lot of angst and anger, because, you know, New Yorkers are just  never angry, right?  Well, you're going to recall, here's the story.  The  location of the tree over the letter \"N\" and a wreath over the \"U\" sparked  a lot of, well, controversy.  Stuff for the New York Post.  </p><p> Anyway, officials there in the tunnel shifted the position of the  decorations after conducting an online poll.  The holiday scene is now  bringing a lot more joy.  What we get upset about in New York, especially  with the holidays, Maria, would be things like this.  Back to you. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much, Cheryl. </p><p> CASONE:  People were freaking out in New York. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Oh my God.  </p><p> CASONE:  It's a big story.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  I know.  Well, you know what, the stress that comes with the  holidays, I guess, is also a part of it, but that -- </p><p> FORBES:  The world can't be that bad if you're worried about wreaths on the  Holland Tunnel. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's right.  That's right.  All right.  Les Moonves, let's  talk about this, because the board had this meeting on Monday, apparently  this thing that he tried to delete evidence, he deleted texts, he tried to  hide evidence in terms of the sexual misconduct, and that's why he's not  getting the 120 million, Dagen.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  The statement -- the five-paragraph statement that CBS released  was, to quote the Wall Street Journal, \"Notably brief and vague.\"  But we  know the details about what was going on based on the investigators' notes  because The New York Times reviewed those notes from investigators, so not  fake news, incredible reporting on this -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  -- on the Me Too movement by the Times.  It detailed -- the  notes detailed efforts by Les Moonves to destroy evidence that showed he  had sought to silence a potential accuser by getting her a role on a T.V.  show.  There were -- there's other information.  Eliza Dushku, the actress,  got a $9 and a half million payment -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  -- because she was removed from the legal drama, Bull, not  related to Les Moonves, but she complained about sexually charged comments  by the show's start.  She got removed and was paid out $9 and a half  million.  So, again, it's not just Les Moonves.  There were problems.   Remember Charlie Rose?  They're still dealing with that on the \"CBS Morning  Show.\"</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  There were problems at CBS.  And the board did -- the board  yesterday did vote to deny a hundred and twenty million dollar severance to  Les Moonves.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  He seems to be getting ready to fight it based on his lawyer's  comments but we'll see. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  But the ramifications are still falling out at CBS, right?   There are still people who are leaving, getting pushed out for any number  of reasons because they were tied to that situation.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  The stars, particularly male stars, were never held accountable  for their conduct, and if you said anything about it, you were punished.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  And they retaliated against you.  And so we've experienced it  obviously in previous history here, but, again, it goes on and there's  still a focus on what's going on at these big companies. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, you're right.  All right.  We'll keep watching that.   We'll take a break.  When we come back, extreme weather to tell you about.   A late-week storm will cause holiday travel headaches apparently.  We got a  full report in the snow, rain, and wind right up next.  And then surf's up  here, Kelly Slater pulls off an incredible trick on the water and even he  can't believe it happened.  Back in a moment.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Millions of Americans will be traveling this  week ahead of the holidays, but delays are not the only thing to be  prepared for.  FOX News Senior Meteorologist, Janice Dean, with the details  on the late-week storm coming.  Janice, good morning to you. </p><p> JANICE DEAN, FOX NEWS CHANNEL METEOROLOGIST:  Hi, Maria.  We'll start off  with the good news.  So, for the next six, seven, eight days, the really  cold air stays up north in Canada and we're relatively mild for much of the  country heading into this weekend and even Christmas week.  But in January,  just a heads up, that's when we could see some of that arctic air make its  way southward.  </p><p> Let's take a look at the temperatures, 33 here in New York, 26 in  Cincinnati, so there are seasonal temperatures about average for this time  of year.  We did have a storm system across the northeast, we do have a  little bit of lake-effect snow, interior snow across the northeast, but not  a big deal.  This is our next big system that's going to cause the  potential travel delays Thursday and Friday, which you mentioned that is  moving cross the west, so the northwest is going to remain active with the  storm every other day, pushing in from the Pacific coastal rain event, and  some snow across the higher elevations of the Intermountain West and the  Northern Rockies.  </p><p> And then eventually, this is going to move across country and interact with  some gulf moisture Thursday and Friday, and that's going to give us  potential delays Thursday, Friday for the East Coast, mainly a rain event.   All right.  Will we have a White Christmas?  Everyone's is talking about  that.  Here is the historical White Christmas probability.  Certainly we're  going to see the potential for that across the west, across the mountainous  regions, but as we go through time, through Saturday, Sunday, Monday, and  Tuesday, this is where we're going to see the snow across the west, coastal  areas will see rain, Upper Midwest could see some snow, Great Lakes  certainly, the interior northeast, but I will tell you along the coast here  from the northeast down towards the southeast in Florida, it could be a wet  one.  </p><p> We will keep you posted.  Certainly, the delays will start Thursday,  Friday, but not a big winter storm, but just look ahead for New Year's Eve  and January, much colder air invades the country, back to you, Maria. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Uh-oh.  Oh, all right.  Get ready for that. </p><p> DEAN:  Yes.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Janice, thank you.  </p><p> DEAN:  You got it.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Janice Dean.  Coming up, Twitter tanks, new disclosure from the  social media giant over exposing user data to China and to Saudi Arabia.   And the Saints go marching in.  New Orleans beat the Panthers last night,  crushing Carolina's NFL playoff hopes.  Plus Eric Reid honoring Colin  Kaepernick, the controversial cleats coming up.  Back in a minute.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Tuesday morning, everybody.  Thanks so much  for joining us, I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Tuesday, December 18th.   Your top stories right now, 6:30 a.m. on the button, on the East Coast.</p><p> Some morning green on Wall Street, this morning, not to the extent that  we've seen losses this week, but the Dow Industrials are expected to open  higher, by about 90 points.  This is the high of the morning, right here,  S&amp;P is up 10-1/2, and the NASDAQ is up 34 points right now.  That's a half  a percent higher.</p><p> This, of course, ahead of the Federal Reserve's two-day meeting, it begins  today.  We are expecting the Fed to announce it will raise rates for the  last time, this year, and we are expecting that announcement tomorrow at  about 2:15 p.m. Eastern.</p><p> Yesterday, another rough day at the office, the major indices down better  than two percent apiece, on global growth and interest rate worries, the  Dow Industrials down 507 points at the close, the NASDAQ down 156 points at  the close, yesterday, two and a quarter percent.</p><p> European indices this morning, taking a cue from Wall Street, mostly, well,  it's actually a mixed story.  Take a look.  The FT 100 is down 33 points  right now, one-half a percent, but the CAC Quarante in Paris has turned  positive, it's up 2 points, and the DAX Index in Germany is up 51 points,  so very much a mixed story in the Euro zone, this morning.  Asian markets  were lower, overnight, across the board, as you can see.</p><p> Crude oil is slipping, take a look at the price of oil, now below $50.00 a  barrel.  First time we are seeing this since October 2017.  Crude oil has  now been in a bear market since November 8th, and that of course, means 20  percent lower from the highs, oil down, two and three-quarters percent,  right now, $1.36 lower, at 48.52.</p><p> Technology is under fire, social media giants Facebook and Twitter and  Google, accused of providing incomplete data to the Senate Intelligence  Committee, this, as part of an investigation into Russian interference in  the 2016 election, details there, coming up.</p><p> And the saints go marching on, New Orleans beat the Panthers, crushing  Carolinas playoff hopes.  Meanwhile, Panthers' Safety, Eric Reid, paid  tribute to Colin Kaepernick, with his new cleats.  We'll bring it to you.</p><p> And it is a surfing miracle.  Check this out, legendary surfer, Kelly  Slater, pulling a move at the Pipe Masters in Hawaii that even impressed  himself.</p><p> We want to show you what the President is thinking this morning.</p><p> The President tweeted just a little while ago, and here's what he says,  biggest outrage yet in the long, winding and highly conflicted Mueller  witch hunt is the fact that 19,000 demanded text messages between Peter  Strzok and his FBI lover, Lisa Page, were purposely and illegally deleted,  would have explained the whole hoax, which is now under protest, from the  President, this morning.</p><p> And, of course, there were 19,000 texts that were deleted, apparently, by  the Special Counsel.</p><p> Our top story this half an hour, the growing China threat, Chinese  President Xi Jinping taking a hard stance amid privacy concerns and trade  tensions with the United States, saying in a speech earlier today, this, no  one is in a position to dictate to the Chinese people what should or should  not be done.</p><p> We must resolutely reform what should and can be changed.  We must  resolutely not reform what shouldn't and can't be changed.</p><p> This weekend on \"SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES,\" I spoke with House Intelligence  Committee Chairman, Devin Nunes, and he gave me some startling things above  his investigation into China.  Here's what he said is most concerning right  now.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  We've spoken on a number of times on this program with you,  about how China is using its economic power and putting it on its military  complex.  Tell us what China is doing with regard to espionage in America?</p><p> REP. DEVIN NUNES (R-CA), CHAIRMAN, HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE:  They are  moving in with -- first, with leverage, like loaning money, building  infrastructure, I think most concerning is when they get a hold of the  electrical grid, they get a hold of the banking system.  And then, they go  in with companies like Huawei or ZTE, and they offer, basically, free  infrastructure, so free communications infrastructure.</p><p> What the Chinese are doing with that is, is that they're ensuring that they  control the communications infrastructure so then they can monitor, for  economic purposes, those businesses and others that they may want to get  involved in, so that they have total control and manipulation capability  over those countries and governments.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Joining me right now is Retired Four-Star General, FOX News  Senior Strategic Analyst, General Jack Keane, General, it's good to see you  this morning.</p><p> GEN. JACK KEANE (RET.), FOX NEWS SENIOR STRATEGIC ANALYST:  Yes, good to  see you, Maria.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Wow.  From Devin Nunes, on China, I mean, you know -- Mr. Nunes  has, sort of, choreographed what China has been doing with me, all year,  and I was worried about, you know, the military stuff, but they are going  into various countries, in particular, Africa, a lot of African countries,  according to John Bolton, and say, we'll give you a free telecom  infrastructure, but it's -- the way to tap into spying.</p><p> What are your thoughts on China's behavior?</p><p> KEANE:  Yes, the Chinese are conducting economic warfare and they are  absolutely predators in doing it.  They largely take advantage of emerging  countries, where they go in -- they put millions of dollars in the elites'  pockets, get them to influence the government, they come in with  extraordinary good loans to the government, but in the long-term, they have  high interest rates.</p><p> And they're building infrastructure, bridges, dams, highways, et cetera.   And they force everybody to accept Chinese labor, they will not use local  labor, whatsoever, whether it's in South America, Africa, South Asia,  Southeast Asia.  And then, over time, the interest rates rise on those  loans, so much so, that they default, and then the Chinese own all of the  infrastructure that they build, it's really quite extraordinary.</p><p> The second thing they do, and what Chairman Nunes is talking about, they  force them to accept Huawei in a telecommunication systems, therefore, they  own the personal intelligence of that country for generations to come, not  just on the business side, but particularly on the government side and on  the military side.  It is absolutely extraordinary.  We have never seen  anything quite like it.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, but, I mean -- </p><p> KEANE:  And that is why -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p> KEANE:  -- this administration, the Trump administration has identified  China as the long-term strategic threat to the American people and to the  security of the United States, economically, politically and militarily.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And I'm sure that's right.  I mean, we're seeing all evidence  of it, but where is this going?  In then, meanwhile, our markets are  selling off, there's all of this uncertainty over the two world powers in  the world, U.S. and China, do you think there will be any kind of an  agreement, in the year ahead, between the U.S. and China given that there  are certain things we are not going to change?</p><p> KEANE:  No, I actually do think so, and I think the President is doing the  right thing in standing up to China, economically.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  For sure.</p><p> KEANE:  We have to do it politically, and we also have to do it militarily.   And listen, when we -- China is a behemoth, but when we bring all of our  allies together, with the United States, and combine that economically and  militarily, we're considerably larger than China, even if in terms of  potential growth.  The Chinese certainly see that.  What's happened is,  they've never had anybody confront them before.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> KEANE:  And that is what needs to happen.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Meanwhile, we thought that China was going to be helpful in  North Korea.  There are more North Korea tensions.  The North Korean  government slamming U.S. sanctions on the rogue regime.</p><p> A report in the Journal shows that North Koreans are getting around these  sanctions, it's titled this, North Korea turns coal into gas to weather  sanctions: isolated regime transforms an abundant resource to survive curbs  on oil imports, your reaction on the North Koreans getting around the U.S.  sanctions?</p><p> KEANE:  Yes, when it comes to oil issue and, you know, fuel for -- to drive  electricity, et cetera, what -- there's two things they are doing, one, is  they are doing ship to ship transfer of oil, offshore, and I've felt for a  long time that we've got to get the United States Navy and our allies up  there, and start blocking that.</p><p> The second thing is, what you're talking about, is the gasification of  coal, it's an old technology, the Germans did it during World War II, and  they were being pressured because of losing their oil production, South  Africa did it when sanctions were slapped on them.</p><p> And here's the kicker here, they're able to do this because China has given  North Korea the technology to gasify coal and it's helping them with about  10 percent of their oil production in terms of replacing that capacity  level.</p><p> So, here again, China has opened the aperture, yes, they said that abiding  by the sanctions, but no, the truth is, they're helping North Korea.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> KEANE:  And we have got to get tough on all of this.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Let me ask you about military spending because we know  this is front and center, this week.  The Congressional Budget Office  releasing recommendations on how the U.S. could curve defense spending.</p><p> Some of those recommendations including capping pay increases for service  members, cancelling purchases of F-35 joint strike Fighters and stopping  the production of Ford class aircraft carriers among others.  What's your  reaction here, General?</p><p> Because, you know, there's all this worry of overspending.  We've got a  budget partial shutdown coming this week.  Do you think these  recommendations make sense or no?</p><p> KEANE:  Well, I think the whole idea of the Defense Department looking  inside to find -- to find savings and significant savings is a good thing.   And I think, you know, Secretary of Defense needs to be told to do that, he  has already got a program to do that.</p><p> I think, we should let them figure out where the savings are.  Captain --  capping military pay makes no sense to me, whatsoever.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  OK.</p><p> KEANE:  The economy is good, we are being challenged in terms of recruiting  and retention, we've got to keep that pay up there, with the -- with the  private sector, so the military is competitive.  We don't need to be ahead  of the private sector, but we have to be reasonable with it, so when people  look at the military and say, well, yes, I can -- I can raise a family  there and have a reasonable life, quality of life experience there.</p><p> We don't want them to have to come in and suffer to the point where we're  only going to keep them for three or four years and then leave.  That makes  no sense to me.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> KEANE:  But all -- yes, the idea that the Congressional Budget Office is  saying, the Defense Department should take a hard look at itself, and find  programs that cut that are wasteful, and we're not efficient, I'm all for  it, and I think of something that needs to be done.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And we should point out that this week is really not about  defense because that's already been taken care of, in terms of this partial  government shutdown.</p><p> KEANE:  I don't think -- well, hopefully, we don't have a government  shutdown, but -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  You don't?  OK.</p><p> KEANE:  -- if we do, the Defense Department will be fine.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  General, it's good to see you this morning, thanks so much.</p><p> KEANE:  Yes, it's good talking to you, Maria.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  General Jack Keane, joining us there.  Coming up, Facebook,  Google, Twitter under fire, this morning, the technology giants accused of  failing to provide all their data, in the probe, into Russia interference  in 2016 and the Presidential Election, the fallout coming up, next up.</p><p> And then, more politics seeping into the NFL, take a look at the Panthers'  Safety, Eric Reid's custom cleats, featuring Colin Kaepernick, more in  sports coming up.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  The President is tweeting this morning, he just  did, just a moment ago.  Here's what he just said, good luck today in court  to General Michael Flynn.  Will be interesting to see what he has to say,  despite tremendous pressure being put on him, about Russian collusion in  our great and, obviously, highly successful political campaign.  There was  no collusion, writes the President.  Social media giants are under fire,  meanwhile, pertaining to that interference, Cheryl Casone with the details  now, Cheryl?  </p><p> CASONE:  All connected, Maria, that's right.  Facebook, Twitter, Google are  being criticized for providing incomplete data in the Senate's  investigation into Russia's online meddling in the 2016 election.  So,  according to a report from a cybersecurity firm, the companies did the bear  minimum when it came to meeting requests by the Senate Intelligence  Committee.  Meanwhile, the NAACP has returned a recent donation from  Facebook and is calling on uses to boycott the site as well as Instagram  today -- Facebook owns Instagram.  The move coming after a Senate report  revealed how Facebook's platform was used to suppress African-American  turnout in the election.  </p><p> We'll take a look at shares at Twitter, they fell almost seven percent  after they disclosed suspicious traffic to a customer support form.   There's yesterday's price action Twitter.  They say that a large amount of  traffic to site came from I.P. addresses in China and Saudi Arabia -- and  that those I.P. addresses may have ties to state-sponsored actors.  The  data exposed included the country code of user's phone numbers.  Twitter  says, those directly affected have been informed about this.  </p><p> And then talking about Twitter again, they are accused of being a toxic  place for women, that's according a to report from the human rights  organization, Amnesty International.  The group says that Twitter is a  platform where abuse against women flourishes often with little  accountability, in fact, female politicians and journalists were allegedly  abused on Twitter every 30 seconds, Maria, in 2017.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  What?  That's incredible.  Every 30 seconds.</p><p> CASONE:  Every 30 seconds and they're saying, look, that the company lets  this happen, they don't police their content.  And then, it's abusive.</p><p> DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  We had a guest on, I think,  it was a week or a couple weeks ago who talked about the diversity in  Silicon Valley.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, what diversity?  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  And I was like, what diversity?  Particularly, in these  technology companies, the attrition rate is high for women.  Women are not  represented, Black Americans are not represented, Latino Americans are not  represented in the way that they should if you're going to present yourself  as a diverse certainly progressive industry and company.  </p><p> So, like, I think if you look at Apple as one example, less than one-third  of its global workforce is woman.  In technology jobs, it's is less than  one-quarter of those jobs are held by women.  Like tech -- they're trying  to improve that.  But then you had companies like Uber, it was -- open  secret, it was almost common knowledge in Silicon Valley that they treated  women horribly.  This is before (INAUDIBLE) took over.  But nevertheless,  it was kept within the confines of the technology world.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Are you surprised by that?  </p><p> WOLF:  I know that we're all capitalist and we want less regulation but  there is something to say to look at regulating these companies like  they're media companies.  There's no question that Twitter and Google and  Facebook are now media companies.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  They're media companies.  </p><p> WOLF:  And I think as you talk about diversity or whatever else and  certainly the idea of doing forensic on what they have their outputs are,  they're going to have to be looked upon much different next year.  There's  no question about it.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  A huge portion of people get their news from Twitter.  </p><p> WOLF:  Exactly.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  I had a conversation -- this is something that resonates with  every American.  I had a conversation with a friend in the last couple of  days about this very thing and the person said, why do these companies have  a liability waiver for users to write content if they're going to decide  who gets to publish on their platform.  They are still -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Who know that's going away?</p><p> WOLF:  You can't be the largest advertise, the largest distributor of  content and say that well, it's not my content.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And then, Google has 90 percent market share in search.  90  percent.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right and Twitter increasingly is like shutting down  conservative -- </p><p> WOLF:  This is where regulation should take a harsher (INAUDIBLE).</p><p> FORBES:  But it's amazing how tone deaf politically those companies are.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, Google blew up the hearing, initially, I'm not going.  </p><p> FORBES:  Well, you take prior university.  Harmless online thing, their  content often is censored.  And you'd think somebody in California say,  hey, we got a problem here, let's fix it, let's bring them in, apologize --  fix it.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, remember during the GOP primary?  The GOP primary in  California.  If you Googled, you did Google search of who is the GOP in  California, a list of descriptions of them came up.  Number one or two was  Nazi-ism.  Nazi-ism.  How does that happen?  Who programs that into an  algorithm and then they say, oh, it was the algorithm.  Guess what, a human  being is putting algorithm together.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  And quite frankly, these companies and the management they treat  everybody in this country who doesn't work in technology like a bunch of  hays.  There's nothing to see here; you just don't understand how it works.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, we're smarter than you, right.  </p><p> WOLF:  The good thing about free markets is technology, always up ends  these companies, watch out what block chain does, read George Gilder's book  in the next five to 10 years.  Remember General Motors are going to take  over the world, IBM take over, Microsoft going to take over the world.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  One of my family members is reading that book trying to make  sure that they don't get basically innovated out of business.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  All right, we'll take a break, when we come back a  surfing Houdini trick, you've got to see this.  Watch as pro-surfer, Kelly  Slater, magically regains control of his board after a complete wipe out.   Back in a minute.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  The Panthers playoffs hope is crushed.  Dagen  McDowell on sports headlines this morning.  What a game, Dagen.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Crushed by New Orleans Saints, Maria Bartiromo.  So, the Saint's  edging out Carolina Panther's 12-9.  A Monday night football -- it was not  a stylish win.  The Saints keeping their spot at the top of the NFC with  just two weeks left in the regular season.  This marks the Panthers' six  loss in a row; ending their hopes to make post-season run.  </p><p> Panthers' defensive back, Eric Reed, making political statement with his  cleats.  The cleats depicting activist including an image of Colin  Kaepernick kneeling during the season.  Reed has continued to protest the  national anthem.  </p><p> A major change in the world of soccer.  Manchester United firing its  manager, Jose Mourinho, after less than three years with the team.  Man. U.  is sixth in the Premier League.  I think this is going to cost him about 18  million-pounds to get rid of the guy.  </p><p> Plus, a wild ride in Hawaii.  Surfing great an all-around awesome dude,  Kelly Slater, recovering from fall mid ride at the pipe master competition.   He is a really good dude and he is incredible to watch surf.  </p><p> And now, onto the most influential in sports business, shows a big shift.   Coming in at number one, according to Sports Business Daily: the American  Sports Gambler, it topped the commissioners of the major sports league.   Adam Silver came in number two, the NBA Commissioner Roger Goodell at  number three -- we all know what sport he tries to run.  Eric Shanks, Fox  Sports CEO, is number four and then Rob Manfred, Major League Baseball  Commissioner.  And guess who's coming up here on MORNINGS WITH MARIA -- Rob  Manfred.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, he's going to be coming up shortly.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  So, I just want to point out, the Saints have the best record in  the entire NFL.  They are 12-2, Robert's Patriots -- I think you lost two  weeks in a row, didn't you?  </p><p> (LAUGHTER) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Your number one in the AFC with the 9-5.  </p><p> WOLF:  Can I just say something?  You have Rob Manfred coming on.  We  should go back to talking about my Red Sox today.  OK, because -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  You don't want to talk about the Patriots?  </p><p> WOLF:  I'm happy to talk Patriots.  We're going to make the playoffs -- you  know, let's just wait.  You're going to short Tom Brady?  Come on, not  happening. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  No, I would never short Tom Brady, but I might not go long.  I  might put my money on -- </p><p> WOLF:  Saints are fun to watch, I have to admit.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  My home's -- I would, I think I would go long home. </p><p> FORBES:  Stick to the Red Sox.  They're claiming they are the best team in  baseball history, but I've got news for them.  Go back to the Yankees 1949  to 1953, five in a row.  So, stop the boasting.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Good stuff.  All right, good stuff, Dagen.  Stay with us.  I  will be sitting down for an exclusive interview with the MLB Commissioner  Rob Manfred, he's coming up in studio, so do join us at 8:30 this morning.   But first, J&amp;J is slammed; the company taking a hit on Monday over concerns  of baby powder safety.  We'll talk about it next hour right here in  MORNINGS WITH MARIA, stay with us.  Johnson &amp; Johnson in the spotlight.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

Good Tuesday  morning, everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p> I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it is Tuesday, December 18th.  We're happy you're  with us. </p><p> Your top stories right now at 7:00 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p> Investors trying to find their footing this morning.  Futures are at the  highs of the morning showing a gain at the start of trading.  Dow  Industrials up 87 points, a third of a percent.  The S&amp;P is also up a  third.  And the Nasdaq is up 34 points.  That's one-half of 1 percent  higher.</p><p> After a sharp selloff on Wall Street again yesterday, all the major indices  down sharply, down better than 2 percent on the day on global growth and  interest rate concerns.  The Dow was down 506 points.  And the Nasdaq was  down 157 points. </p><p> The Federal Reserve kicks off its two-day meeting today.  We are expecting  the Fed to raise rates and announce that tomorrow.</p><p> In Europe markets are mixed today.  FT 100 is down 31.  CAC is down just a  fraction.  And the DAX index is up almost 50 points, one-half of a percent  higher in Germany.</p><p> In Asia overnight declines across the board -- take a look.  Worst  performer was Japan once again.  Nikkei average down almost 2 percent.</p><p> We're watching the price of oil -- crude oil is under pressure again, it  has fallen below $50 a barrel for the first time in over a year.  AS you  can see it is down 3 percent this morning at $48.42.  Got to wonder when  this starts impacting the shale companies significantly as oil prices move  lower.</p><p>Johnson &amp; Johnson under fire.  The company slammed over its safety of the  baby powder, now after new pressure after it announced a $5 billion buyback  yesterday.  The company is facing more pressure this morning.</p><p> Plus this.  Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is not even in Congress yet and she  says she's already needing to take a break.  She says she's feeling burned  out.  All right.</p><p> And now this.</p><p> Fortnite facing a lawsuit -- Carlton from the \"Fresh Prince of Bel-air\" is  taking on the gaming giant over his signature dance.  Wait until you see  this.</p><p> All those stories coming up this Tuesday morning.  And joining me to break  it all down, Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell; Forbes Media chairman  and former Republican presidential candidate Steve Forbes; and 32Advisors  CEO, former economic adviser to President Obama Robert Wolf.  Good to see  you this morning.  </p><p> ROBERT WOLF, CEO, 32ADVISORS:  Good to be with you.</p><p> Great first hour.</p><p> STEVE FORBES, CHAIRMAN, FORBES MEDIA:  Great first hour.</p><p> WOLF:  Yes.</p><p> FORBES:  Great first hour.  Still a lot happening in the world.  Nice to  see that green again on the futures but after a thousand points we better  have some green.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, well a thousand points plus.  And it's all of these  worries over rates and over trade that has investors wondering.  </p><p> WOLF:  And no question with China and Europe slowing down, and Brexit, and  the chaos in Washington continuing.  It seems like everyone's going to  their corner.  It's a tough time.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All this gloom and doom.</p><p> FORBES:  Sounds like a bi-signal(ph).</p><p> BARTIROMO:  So riddle me this.  All this gloom and doom, how come the IPO  calendar is so strong?  You've got some real familiar names going public  next year like Uber, like Lyft, like Slack, like Pinterest -- a lot of  them.  And the market did not discourage these companies from making their  filings.  </p><p> WOLF:  And I'm not questioning that.  I think the economy is much better  than the gloominess today.  But we're going to be in December and it will  be the first time possibly since 2009 that we'll have no high yield  issuance.</p><p> And so there is definitely a feeling right now, people are walking in, and  they have no idea what to expect for the day because a lot of these things  are out of their hands. </p><p> What happened in France, ok; the idea of the hang-up in Brexit; China  slowing -- these are just things that come up out of the blue in a very  unexpected way.  And you can't position yourself for it.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  There's a lot of uncertainty for sure.  </p><p> DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  I just want to point out that  the Russell 2000 is now in a bear market, down more than 20 percent.  Those  small cap stocks which from the high this year, that speaks to what's going  on here in the United States. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Not around the globe.  Great run-up until the turn but down more  than 20 percent.  And the transports are close to being in a bear market.   They're down more than 18 percent from the recent highs.  So that bears  watching.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Message of the markets -- message of the markets is  nervousness.  </p><p> WOLF:  And I was bringing up earlier that it's surprising the S&amp;P is lower  than where we were before the tax deal happened.  That being said, we had  such a run-up in 2017, it's a bit not surprising.  The question is, is 2018  just really a pause or are we into a slowdown period?  It doesn't feel like  -- </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Let's see if it's -- </p><p> FORBES:  The good thing on the IPOs, you have to ask the question or make  the point, it's about time.  IPOs have been terrible -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  That's true.  </p><p> FORBES:  -- in the last generation.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, it's a big calendar next year.  </p><p> FORBES:  And if they get this trade thing -- that uncertainty out of the  way -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> FORBES:  -- and the U.S. starts to get strong, it's going to have a  positive tonic effect in the rest of the world.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well let's see.  </p><p> FORBES:  That is hurting investment now -- that uncertainty.  Let's see -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  There's a lot of uncertainty.  Let's see how much uncertainty  is the fault of Washington because that's our top story right now.</p><p> The clock is ticking.  The deadline to avoid a partial government shutdown  is now just three days away.  The President is demanding that Congress  provide $5 billion in funding for the border wall.  The Democrats are  showing no signs of budging.  </p><p> House Freedom Caucus chairman Mark Meadows weighed in on Capitol Hill  yesterday.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> REP. MARK MEADOWS (R), NORTH CAROLINA:  What makes January any better than  December 21st?  I'm willing to stay here through Christmas to get it done  right on behalf of the American people.  And you know, we continue to punt.   This is not anybody -- to anybody's surprise.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Joining us right now is Kansas Congressman and member of the  House Committee on small business, Roger Marshall.  Congressman -- it's  good to see you.  Thanks so much for joining us.  </p><p> REP. ROGER MARSHALL (R), KANSAS:  Good morning to everybody.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So all of this nervousness in terms of markets, we know there's  a situation of uncertainty between China and the U.S. and we know that  we're also facing uncertainty with interest rates.  But how much of this is  Washington, the fact that we're looking at a partial government shutdown  this week, the fact that this Mueller probe is constantly asking questions  and putting these suggestions of collusion out there, even though there's  no evidence of it.  The fact that we've got all of this sort of vitriol  between the Republicans and Democrats.  </p><p> MARSHALL:  You know, absolutely, you're right.  When I was in the position  back in Kansas, I didn't follow these issues quite as closely and my stock  market brokers loved me because I didn't call them every day.  Now I have  to pay attention to every up and down, seeing the market overreact to all  the uncertainty, whether it's the threat of a government shutdown, trade  tariffs or potential interest rates being raised today or tomorrow.</p><p> So all these uncertainties are adding up.  And as you pointed out, these  markets don't like the uncertainty.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  But what are you going to do about it.  You're a lawmaker  and a leader in Congress.  Are you going to -- I mean how can you help the  situation in your position and are we going to see this shutdown?  What's  the impact?  </p><p> MARSHALL:  Yes.  I think my job is to remain calm and clear, to make good  decisions up here.</p><p> Border security is such an important issue I'm willing to shut down a very  small fraction of the government.  So my job as a congressman is to  communicate, look, if the government shuts down, we're only really talking  about 10 percent of the spend of the Federal government.  Medicare is taken  care of.  Social security, the military-- this is a very small segment.</p><p> Border security, national security is so important.  I'm willing to jump on  this grenade and shut down this small sliver of the government to fund the  border wall.  </p><p> WOLF:  Congressman -- just a question.  Last year there was a billion given  to border -- for the border wall.  That hasn't been spent.  So the question  is, the President's looking for $5 billion.  What's the compromise? </p><p> Because I know that you're comfortable shutting down 10 percent of the  government.  But I guarantee those people who are going to lose their job  over Christmas aren't comfortable.  I think you're still getting paid.  So  I think it's a very uncomfortable situation for Washington, Republican or  Democrat, to say we're going to shut down part of the government over  Christmas.  My question to you is and a Democrat if he was sitting here --  what is the compromise?  </p><p> MARSHALL:  Yes.  I would prefer to keep the government open-- don't get me  wrong.  So actually we built about 31 miles of border security with the  funding we gave the President last year and that's going to go towards a  total 40 miles in total.  This funding of $5 billion will build another 200  miles of border security out.</p><p> That's a priority for us.  It's a political football right now.  You know,  the President's working on a compromise.  I'm going to stand beside the  President.  I think this is when we need leadership from the President and  from Congress as well.</p><p> I do think there is a compromise there.  But I would prefer the $5 billion.  </p><p> WOLF:  Right.  But the bid offer is $1.6 billion which I think has been  approved to $5.  So why doesn't the House members, Republican and  Democrats, and the Senate come up and say a different number and ask the  President to go with them on this?  </p><p> MARSHALL:  Well, it would seem like both -- the Democrats have said it's a  nonstarter.  They want to fund zero or perhaps now they're up to $1.7  billion.  So I think as a congressman I have to prioritize national  security.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  No, I understand that.  And the President is keeping his  promises.  The Trump administration following through on that second round  of bailout payments for farmers hurt by the ongoing trade dispute with  China.  $9.5 billion will be distributed to farmers in total.</p><p> But you know, then you have to ask yourself well, what about other  industries?  Maybe the retailers need a bailout.  What about the banks.  I  mean can we really just give bailouts to those groups that are getting hurt  by the tariffs and not everybody?  I mean doesn't this have a big downside  risk?  </p><p> MARSHALL:  You know, certainly I understand your point and agree with it  for the most part.  When the President first presented to this, the farmers  said it's a no go.  We don't want a handout.  We want long-term access to  trade markets and that's always been our mantra.</p><p> But right now back in Kansas, farm income is 50 percent of what it was.   Farm bankruptcies are up 600 percent.  So it's hard times back home.  This  funding will allow the farmers to maybe get the loan to plant next year's  crop.  It's a drop in the bucket.  We're grateful for it but it's not what  we asked for.</p><p> We're asking to get -- we asked to get the USMCA, the NAFTA 2.0 done and  that's been accomplished, still needs to go through Congress.  And now  we're asking to get the European Union trade agreement done, the Japan  trade agreement done.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  But there are a lot of Democrats who say they're not  going to vote for the USMCA the way it is.  Are you ready to make changes?  </p><p> MARSHALL:  Certainly I'm willing to make some changes.  I think there's a  lot of crying and gnashing of teeth.  I think if we field that on the House  floor today that it passes with probably a majority -- the majority as well  as probably 40 percent or 50 percent of the Democrats.</p><p> I think they're posturing, wanting to make the perfect the enemy of the  good.  </p><p> FORBES:  Congressman, your district we've been talking about agriculture  but as we know since we were on a panel together a few weeks ago, your  district is very widespread in terms of its economy including medical  equipment.  You were in the business.</p><p> And you talked about how tariffs are hurting imports of critical medical  equipment that do diagnosis.  Do you see any prospect of getting this China  uncertainty out of the way because it is hurting the economy and hurting  your district?  </p><p> MARSHALL:  Well, certainly, Mr. Forbes.  And it's great to see you again.   And I enjoyed being on that panel with you. You're right, so hospitals buy MRIs and mammograms, most of those are made  in China and in Southeast Asia.  So we're seeing the prices of those go up  25 percent, 50 percent as well.  </p><p> So it's impacting more than just agriculture.  These trade wars, these  tariffs could impact the GDP 2 percent.  It could impact the average family  to the tune of a couple thousand dollars per family next year.</p><p> And that's the pressure we're putting on the President.  We put pressure on  him.  We held him accountable.  He came through with an improved agreement  with NAFTA.  And we think there's an opportunity for an improved agreement  with China.</p><p> But we know this -- Mr. Forbes, we can't keep doing what we've been doing  with China either.  However bad I thought the trade imbalances were and the  unfair trade practices with China are, they're even worse when I dove into  them.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  It's pretty incredible what China has been doing and it's  well beyond trade.  I agree with you, Congressman.</p><p> It's good to see you this morning.  Thank you.  </p><p> MARSHALL:  Yes.  Good morning.  Thanks for having me.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Congressman Roger Marshall joining us there.</p><p> Coming up, Johnson &amp; Johnson is under fire this morning.  The healthcare  giant faces an asbestos scandal in its baby powder.  The company now trying  to bolster investor confidence with a stock buyback.  Details there.</p><p> Already needing a break -- incoming congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez  takes a vacation before she even started.  The story coming up.</p><p> Stay with us.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>Goldman Sachs reportedly ignored warning signs of its dealings with 1MDB.</p><p> Cheryl Casone with the details on this -- Cheryl.</p><p> CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Yes.  This story is  still unfolding, Maria, this morning.  The \"Wall Street Journal\" is now  reporting that Goldman's push for Asian business and its lax oversight of  partners led it to dismiss several red flags.  Malaysia filed criminal  charges yesterday against Goldman and its two former executives for their  role in a multibillion dollar fraud.  </p><p> But the bank is firing back.  They say, quote,\" certain members of the  former Malaysian government and 1MDB lied to Goldman Sachs, outside counsel  and others about the use of proceeds from these transactions.\"  So Goldman  stated yesterday it's going to fight back on this one.  The stock though  down 32 percent so far this year.</p><p> Well, after falling about 10 percent on Friday, shares of Johnson &amp; Johnson  dropped another 3 percent yesterday because of concerns over its baby  powder.  Reports say that Johnson &amp; Johnson knew for years that some of its  powder contained asbestos.  The company's firing back with full page ads in  papers, defending themselves.</p><p> Meanwhile India federal drug regulator says that the report about the baby  powder is under consideration and that it's 2016 test found that the  product was safe.  Yesterday Johnson &amp; Johnson announced a new plan to buy  back $5 billion in stocks.  Shares of the company slightly higher in the  premarket, more than half a percent right now.</p><p> Well, the rivalry between Netflix and ABC's parent Walt Disney continues to  heat up.  Netflix has hired Channing Dungey, this is ABC's former  entertainment president, to be vice president of original content at  Netflix.  Now Dungey starts the job in February.  But this comes as Disney  is finalizing its purchase of most of 21st Century Fox's entertainment  assets.  The war is heating up.  21st Century Fox, of course, is the parent  of Fox Business Network.</p><p> Shares of Netflix have soared nearly 40 percent this year.  That outpaces  shares of Walt Disney. </p><p> And then finally, from movies to food -- spice up your Christmas gifts this  year with a little Chipotle wrapping.  For the burrito lover on your list,  the Mexican chain is offering wrapping paper that looks like guacamole  salsa and aluminum foil.  Each roll, $14.  The whole set which has 10  silver boughs, five gift bags, 10 pieces of tissue paper -- that's $50,  Maria.  You know, it's better to look at the burrito than eat it, really -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> CASONE:  -- if you're trying to watch your holiday, you know, consumption  as we go through the holiday season.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Yes, we do.  </p><p> Thank you -- Cheryl.</p><p> CASONE:  You bet.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  The President is tweeting.  He just tweeted moments ago.  We  want to get this out.  He says this, \"I hope the people over at the Fed  will read today's \"Wall Street Journal\" editorial before they make yet  another mistake.  Also, don't let the market become any more illiquid than  it already is.  Stop with the 50 B's, feel the market, don't just go by  meaningless numbers.  Good luck.\"</p><p> Stop with the 50 b's.  What does that mean?  </p><p> WOLF:  The 50 b's.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Oh, I know -- $50 billion in winddown.  Stop with the $50  billion in winddown.  He's asking them to slow down the winddown because  they're cutting the balance sheet $50 billion a month.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  All right.  So now he's weighing in on that part of it.  </p><p> FORBES:  Actually that's a good thing.  Do you want Washington bureaucrats  them controlling $50 billion?  Do you want to affect the normal banking  system again?</p><p> WOLF:  Although I think -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  They have to unwind the balance sheet.  </p><p> WOLF:  No, I know.  But you would agree, Steve, that QE3 was not needed.  </p><p> FORBES:  QE3 was a disaster.  </p><p> WOLF:  So we should be unwinding.  </p><p> FORBES:  You bet it should.  </p><p> WOLF:  Exactly.  So I mean -- </p><p> MCDOWELL:  When you say QE, you have to say quantitative easing or bond  buying.  </p><p> FORBES:  Quantitative easing.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes, thank you.</p><p> FORBES:  It's the idea that the Federal Reserve could revive the economy by  having banks park their reserves at the Federal Reserve.  Real genius --  and hurt credit for small businesses.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So you agree with the President?  </p><p> FORBES:  I would agree -- no, I think that the Fed should unwind.  </p><p> WOLF:  They should unwind.</p><p> FORBES:  Absolutely.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  You want the unwind to happen.  </p><p> FORBES:  Yes, absolutely.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Because that's also a form of tightening and the President is  basically saying stop with the tightening.  </p><p> FORBES:  That's not tightening.  That's liberating capital.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Ok.  Won't the market see it though as a further tightening?   We talk about this every morning.  I mean if you're unwinding $50 billion a  month as well as raising interest rates, isn't that like a double  tightening?  </p><p> FORBES:  You know, in the commodity market, the gold market, the dollar has  been strong only because other currencies have been weak.  So the Fed's  been relatively neutral.  And the more capital they get back into the  economy, the better.  And if we get this trade overhang out of the way,  everything's going to be much better.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So it's the trade overhang.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  I want to point this out.  What happened when they were buying  bonds and during the quantitative easing, it lifted all these risk assets.</p><p> So what happens when you pull that money out of the financial system.   There's been incredible volatility, liquidity problem particularly in bond  trading in recent weeks.  And it means that will asset prices drop?  And  again -- I was going to say something political, I won't.  We will discuss  it later.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Ok.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  But I think that the Obama administration for eight years got a  lot of cover for some missteps in fiscal policy because of what the Federal  Reserve was doing.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, they had zero rates.  I mean, you know.</p><p> WOLF:  Why is everybody looking at me?  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Because you were an economic advisor, Robert Wolf.  You were  economic advisor to President Obama.  Who are we going to look at?</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> WOLF:  Ok.  And so when the market in eight straight years was averaging 16  percent gains, we were all loving it.  Let's not kid ourselves.  </p><p> FORBES:  But small businesses and households couldn't get credits like the  Soviet Union.  The health care was free but you didn't get any loans.  </p><p> WOLF:  Well, we can't help that.  People were borrowing more than they had.   Ok, consumers, right -- over 100 percent leverage.  </p><p> FORBES:  That's big companies.  The small companies starved, bad.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Coming up, consumers beware -- another major recall is hitting  store shelves.  We've got the details you want to know about it.</p><p> And then changing viewing habits.  I'll speak with the CEO of Nielsen.   David Kenny in the studio -- get his take on the changing media landscape.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p> Well, for decades if you wanted to know what consumers are watching or  buying, you would know the name Nielsen.  The company tracks consumer  behavior across multiple media platforms.</p><p> In November, the company appointed a new chief executive officer.  He is  with me now.  Joining me right now, the CEO of Nielsen is David Kenny.   Great to see you -- David.</p><p> DAVID KENNY, CEO, NIELSEN:  Great to be here -- Maria.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Congratulations to you.  I want to first talk about your plans  for the company.  There are reports that Nielsen is looking to change its  structure.  Are you expecting to go private?  </p><p> KENNY:  We don't know that.  The board's looking at all the options.  There  are certainly folks interested in the company.  Right now I work for the  public shareholders and we're going to do what's best for them.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Tell me what you're doing because you have all of these  different platforms to look at and Nielsen is the name in terms of  monitoring all of that and giving us the true accurate numbers of audience.   Tell us where the growth is at Nielsen.</p><p> KENNY:  Well, certainly the growth follows our customers.  So media  companies are finding more platforms.  They're certainly taking a lot of  things digital in addition to TV and radio.  What we're finding is  consumers can consume more media because at least 45 percent of them, the  big media users are doing two things at once.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  It's true -- we all do two things at once.  </p><p> KENNY:  So they're watching this show and they're on their mobile phone  checking something else out.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So how do you monitor that and measure that?  I mean consumers  are turning more and more to portable devices.  Like you've got your  iPhone.  They're making purchases while consuming media on TV.  How have  you changed your business as a result of that?  </p><p> KENNY:  Well, certainly we start with the best panels in the world.  So  groups of consumers that allow us to track everything through lots of  devices and monitoring.  What we do very carefully is make sure we do that  in a way that we don't know who they are.  There's no privacy problem with  that.</p><p> And people let us see what their patterns are in their home and in their  life and in their car, all day long.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And where's the growth in terms of the audience?  Is it  online or -- and are the dollars do you think still in traditional TV?  </p><p> KENNY:  There's still a lot of dollars in TV.  The biggest hour is between  9:00 and 10:00 p.m. where people are watching TV but then again, 45 percent  of them are also doing something on a second device.  So they're really  engaging in new ways and sharing more media as well which brings more of  their friends in.  </p><p> So media is certainly healthy and growing.  People want to connect, consume  and be entertained.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  I want to get your take on China.  And I know you know a lot  about China, not just for your role here but your former role, in your  former life at IBM, which you've done a great job there.  This weekend I  spoke with the chairman of the intel committee on the house side, Devin  Nunes.</p><p> KENNY:  Yes.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And he told me some really interesting things about what China  does on \"SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES\".  We talked about the concerns that China  is trying to access people's data.  Watch this.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  The CFO of Huawei was arrested.  She was held in Canada.  She  got out on bail.  Is that more about espionage than it was about Iran's  sanctions?  </p><p> REP. DEVIN NUNES (R), CALIFORNIA:  You know, I don't know about that.  I  would refer to the Department of Justice and it's probably not something  that I should comment on.</p><p> But I do know that Huawei is actively going around the globe and offering  products way below their own cost.  So that doesn't make any sense.   Somebody is subsidizing that.</p><p> And in today's world with the ever-growing and quickly changing ways that  we communicate, if routers are put in, and this is something that we've  worked on for many years on the House Intelligence Committee, looking at  routers can take that information and quickly route the information quickly  back to China where then they can comb through it.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p> NUNES:  And I think that's the concern is that there would be games being  played within the communications infrastructure that would allow for the  Chinese to spy very easily.  And I think that's one of the big concerns  that we have here is that the American people have been having to listen to  this Russia nonsense for so long and it's not that Putin's not a bad guy  and in fact we had been the ones that had warned about Putin's ever- advancing capabilities.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p> NUNES:  But at the same time we've totally ignored China.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  What's your take on China?  I know Nielsen is in China.  We've  seen breaches in U.S. companies, including Marriott and a lot of people say  China was behind the Marriott breach.  Do you have concerns about that?  </p><p> KENNY:  First of all, we have a great business in China.  We serve a lot of  Chinese companies, serving Chinese consumers.  And that's well.  </p><p> This issue is about, you know, global espionage.  We are very concerned  about privacy.  Everything we've ever done in Nielsen is about  understanding what's going on without having personal information.  We  don't in any way want to make it easy for people to target folks.  People  deserve their privacy.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Tell me your agenda.  What are you doing in terms of leading  this company to further growth?  </p><p> KENNY:  What I'm focusing on is our customers.  So we've got two big sets.   With the media companies we're helping them understand new and better ways  to reach their audience, new ways to engage people and we also helped a  very trusted transaction between the ad agencies and advertisers to buy  media and know that the audience was actually there and how to develop the  audience.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So tell us how to do that.  How do you reach more customers  today?  What's the changing trends that you see?  </p><p> KENNY:  I think part of it is to understand that people, again, are  multitasking.  So you've got to get them in short episodes.  You've got to  get them in short segments to get them engaged.</p><p> A lot of things we're seeing is the value of engaging and sharing.  If  people start to share content, that means they're bringing in their friends  so that it's more of an audience as well.  We certainly do care that there  be truth in everything we're seeing, so we're looking a lot at making sure  that all the news is based on facts and there are ways to build brands that  people can really trust what they're seeing.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  David, it's great to have you on the show.  </p><p>NIELSEN:  Great.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  David Kenny joining us there, CEO of  Nielsen.  </p><p> President Trump just tweeted this morning and here's what he's saying about  social media.  Facebook, Twitter and Google are so biased toward the  Democrats, it is ridiculous, writes the president.  Twitter in fact has  made it much more difficult for people to join @realDonaldTrump.  They have  removed many names and greatly slowed the level and speed of increase.   They have acknowledged and done nothing.  </p><p> Coming up, taking a self-care break.  That is what incoming Congresswoman  Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez plans on doing before she heads to Capitol Hill in  the new Congress next year.</p><p> Then, suing over a dance move, find out which sitcom star thinks the  Fortnite video game stole his signature move, the story coming up.  Stay  with us.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Tuesday morning, everybody, thanks so much  for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Tuesday, December 18th.   Your top story right now 7:34 a.m. on the East Coast.  </p><p> Futures are higher this morning.  Take a look, we're at the highs of the  morning with a gain of 121 points right now on the Dow Jones Industrial  average, the S&amp;P is up 13 and the NASDAQ is up 41-1/2 points, that's two  thirds of one percent.  </p><p> This ahead of the Federal Reserve today meeting -- it begins today.  The  Fed is expected to raise interest rates tomorrow for the last time this  year.  We are expecting that announcement 02:00 tomorrow.  </p><p> Markets are rallying ahead of it.  The major indices though had a tough day  yesterday, down about two percent apiece on global growth and interest rate  concerns.  As you can see, the Dow is down 507 points at the close  yesterday.  </p><p> In Europe this morning, mixed story.  Take a look at the indices there with  the FT-100 is down and the CAC Quarante is also weaker by a fraction but  the DAX Index in Germany is up 43 points.  </p><p> Asian markets meanwhile closing lower overnight with the weakest link in  Japan, Nikkei average down 1.8 percent.  </p><p> Crude is a big story this morning, crude awakening.  Take a look at the  price of oil, back below $50.00 a barrel for the first time since October  2017.  Crude oil is down almost three percent right now, it is now in a  bear market, it has been since November 8th.  And that of course means 20  percent lower from the highs.  </p><p> The E. coli recall expands.  The farm behind the romaine lettuce recall now  has affected vegetables.  We will tell you which ones have to be added to  the list that you should not purchase.  </p><p> Then, game on.  \"The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air\" actor behind the Carlton  dance suing the makers of Fortnite for allegedly stealing his moves.  Let  me check out the moves.</p><p> And then the quiet kennel, details on Ford's new technology project to  bring more -- to bring noise cancelling to your dog's kennel.  </p><p> All those stories coming up.  But first, taking a break before your job  even begins.  New York Congresswoman-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez taking  to Twitter to announce that she is taking a self-care break before Congress  starts after the New Year.  She says this, I'm taking a few days to take  care of myself before what is sure to be an eventful term.  For working  people, immigrants, and the poor, self-care is political, not because we  want it to be but because of the inevitable shaming of someone doing a face  mask while financially stressed.  </p><p> Joining us right now is former White House Communications Director,  SkyBridge Capital founder Anthony Scaramucci.  Good to see you, Anthony.  </p><p> ANTHONY SCARAMUCCI, FOUNDER, SKYBRIDGE CAPITAL:  I'm taking self-care right  now here on the show, Maria.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, what are you doing?  How are you self-caring right now?</p><p> SCARAMUCCI:  I'm hoping -- I'm hoping that Robert's going to give me a  mani-pedi in the break, that's what I'm hoping for.  I don't even  understand what that means.</p><p> ROBERT WOLF, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CONTRIBUTOR:  I don't even know what that  is, right.  But I guess you have to have 11 days.  </p><p> SCARAMUCCI:  You know what it is.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  A manicure and pedicure?</p><p> SCARAMUCCI:  It's not 11 days of fame, OK.  It's lasted a lot longer than  that.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  But listen, the story --</p><p> SCARAMUCCI:  I don't know what it means but I love this person.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez?  </p><p> SCARAMUCCI:  I think she's fantastic because she's got everybody upset for  some reason.  I can't actually figure it out.  When she talks, it's clear  that she was probably missing a few of those classes in social studies when  you're learning about American history, but she is a force of nature, OK.   So, I have to just tell you, I'm totally impressed with her.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Steve what do you --</p><p> SCARAMUCCI:  (INAUDIBLE) I mean, just being totally direct.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So, you're good with the self-care?  </p><p> SCARAMUCCI:  I'm good with the self-care.  If she needs any of my skin  products, I can offer them up to her, even though she's very young, she  probably doesn't need it right now, but if she ever does need it.  </p><p> WOLF:  And who knows (INAUDIBLE) better than Anthony?</p><p> SCARAMUCCI:  Well I think it's great.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  But listen, there's a big story here, OK.  Now I know you guys  are joking, you're friends for a long time.  There's a bigger story here,  you are a moderate guy and a Democrat.  But you have these new-comers  coming into your party like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez who is a socialist,  Robert.  You've got another one in Michigan.  You've got Bernie Sanders,  pulling the party all the way to the left and what do you think about that?  </p><p> WOLF:  Listen, I'm not on the populist left.  And to me, we have lost the  center, which is why Washington is a disaster right now.  The truth is with  Ocasio she's preaching, OK, to literally wear all the populism lies.  She's  preaching on climate change and on immigration and it's resonating with the  base.  I think to Anthony's point, she may be pissing a lot of people off  but she's exciting a lot of people.  Listen, she --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  So, you think it's good then?  </p><p> WOLF:  I think it's good for the party any time you have excitement.  I'm  not that far left.  So personally speaking, there -- you know, I probably  would have voted if I lived in the city for Joe Crowley instead of Ocasio.   That being said, I have to applaud her.  She gets out there and she has a  view and I don't see many people actually saying, I don't -- I'm not for  your green energy and I'm not for this.  They may be dissing her on other  things but it's not on her substance.  </p><p> FORBES:  So, what does that mean, getting a candidate in 2020 that can win  an election?  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's exactly -- that's right, that's the question.  </p><p> WOLF:  Listen, I think it's going to be -- it's going to be an incredibly  interesting primary.  I think we'll have more than where the Republicans  had, we'll have north of 16.  And I'm not sure that the party's not going  to be pushed to the left and it will be a very interesting whether we can  bring a candidate who can beat the president.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  But the president, though, people on the left bash the president  nonstop about --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Nonstop.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  -- mistakes that he makes, things he tweets and I think that in  terms of policy, if Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez brags about her economics  degree from college and then doesn't know how the unemployment rate's  calculated, saying the unemployment rate is low because people are working  two jobs.  Well, that's not how the un -- that has nothing to do with the  unemployment rate, it's the number of unemployed people divided by the size  of the labor force.  </p><p> So, again, I think that it's fair to hit her on things like that.  But if  she wants to you get a full body scrub on her days off, then that's fine.  </p><p> WOLF:  Well, I just have -- I just have to make one comment because it  would be unfair.  I mean, you have the president telling us trade deficits  are losses, we know that's not economic expert either.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  You know what, and I have sat on this program, Robert Wolf, and  said that --</p><p> WOLF:  I just want --</p><p> MCDOWELL:  -- that it's not a loss.  </p><p> WOLF:  Right, OK.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  That a tariff is not interest on a debt.  It's not -- so he  makes mistakes.  </p><p> SCARAMUCCI:  She used your full name here so that's a little bit of a --</p><p> WOLF:  There you go.</p><p> SCARAMUCCI:  She used your full name that was a little bit of a shot on  you.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  What do you want to say?</p><p> SCARAMUCCI:  But here's what I want to say, she's going to come right into  the center.  This one is very -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Really?</p><p> SCARAMUCCI:  Yes, I think so.  She's very smart.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  No way.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  OK.</p><p> SCARAMUCCI:  We'll see.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  No way.  </p><p> SCARAMUCCI:  You'll see.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  There's no center in New York.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Why would she -- then she's going to --</p><p> SCARAMUCCI:  Let me tell you something, in 1969, Hillary Clinton gave a  very far left commencement speech.  </p><p> FORBES:  Has she changed?  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  She's never changed.</p><p> SCARAMUCCI:  Well, but her ambition changed through absolutely.  She  probably didn't change but she put on some cling-on cloaking devices and  pretended that she was in the center for 25 years.  This woman is a force  to be reconned with, OK.  You can feel the charisma coming off of her.  You  -- I mean, I like her, I certainly don't like her ideological views.  But I  think she's around and she's going to be here for longer than we think.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes, the media, they give her the level of coverage that she  does.  And we're all guilty of this, just like Beto O'Rourke, because she's  attractive.  </p><p> WOLF:  But I would --</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Let's be clear, it's because she is very photogenic and  telegenic.  </p><p> SCARAMUCCI:  She's very attractive, Dagen, this is like a newsflash for me.   Is it like, that's like breaking news, she's attractive.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Beto O'Rourke looks like a Kennedy, that's why people threw  money at him.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's right.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Like he was going to win in Texas.</p><p> SCARAMUCCI:  OK.</p><p> FORBES:  And what a name, Beto.  Better than this --</p><p> WOLF:  I think there's more much more depth than that, but that's the depth  --  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, who do you think are the leading contenders on the  Democratic side for 2020 then?  </p><p> WOLF:  I think -- you listen, I think Beto and Kamala the new names and I  think Biden and Bernie are the names that have been in the past.  But I  think there's an incredible excitement around Kamala Harris and Beto O'  Rourke.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Do you think the president gets reelected, Anthony?  </p><p> SCARAMUCCI:  I do.  You know, I know that's a -- I mean, if you watch these  other networks, you know, we're all going to jail, we're all going to have  orange suits on.  But I don't -- I don't -- I don't see the level of  criminality that (INAUDIBLE).  So, he gets reelected.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Let me -- wait, let me ask you, because Michael Flynn is facing  sentencing -- we're going to talk about this, for lying to the FBI.  This  coming as former FBI Director Jim Comey continued a second round of  questioning by the House Judiciary Committee yesterday.  What are you  expecting in terms of the Jim Comey and Michael Flynn situation, Michael  Flynn first.  </p><p> SCARAMUCCI:  Five percent chance that they throw the entire thing out on  them for a number of different procedural reasons.  95 percent chance he  gets no jail time and he gets -- he gets hit a little hard.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Michael Flynn?  </p><p> SCARAMUCCI:  Yes.  </p><p> WOLF:  Just a question, I know you just announced your new Opportunity Zone  funds.  Can you just give us 30 seconds on it?  </p><p> SCARAMUCCI:  Well, I mean, we set up a private REIT to take advantage of  what's going on in these opportunity zones.  And so, just quickly, you can  take a very low basis stock that's had a high value now.  You can sell it,  move it into our fund.  You get a 10 year abatement on the taxes and then  you get a 15 percent reduction on your capital gains.  But then, any return  that you make off of the fund, you get that return 100 percent tax free.  </p><p> WOLF:  And that was Senator Tim Scott working with on and --  </p><p> SCARAMUCCI:  Tim Scott and also -- and also Senator Cory Booker, it's a  bipartisan strategy.  This is something right out of Steve Forbes' playbook  from 1996 about flooding the zone where people need the money and figuring  out ways to unleash capital into our system.  </p><p> FORBES:  Are you giving me a finder's fee on this?  </p><p> SCARAMUCCI:  If you help me --</p><p> WOLF:  No, but you can invest in Steven's fund.</p><p> SCARAMUCCI:  Steven, if you help me raise dough, you know, fast pay makes  fast friends on Wall Street, you know that, right?  That's why Robert and I  are so close.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Where are the opportunities?  </p><p> SCARAMUCCI:  So, there are basically the 2010 census has delineated about  12 percent of the country Maria, are considered Opportunity Zones, that's  where 20 percent of the population is below the poverty line.  And so, in  those zones you have this tax abatement opportunity.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  You better throw some money at Eastern North Carolina or I'll  hurt you.  </p><p> WOLF:  And we did a -- we did our exclusive, Maria --</p><p> SCARAMUCCI:  You're going to use my full name on live television?</p><p> WOLF:  And we're even thinking of using our investments Maria at  Opportunity Zone.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Really, great opportunity.  Thank you so much.  </p><p> SCARAMUCCI:  Very smart stuff.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Great to see you.</p><p> SCARAMUCCI:  I appreciate being here, thank you.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Anthony Scaramucci.  Coming up, stolen dance, Carlton from \"The  Fresh Prince of Bel-Air\" takes on the gaming giant Fortnite over his  signature dance, the story coming up.  </p><p> Then, some stocks restocking.  We have guest picks that -- one guest says  they could be better gifts at Christmas.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, this is important.  A California farm linked to an E.  coli outbreak is recalling more products.  Cheryl Casone with all the  details now, Cheryl.  </p><p> CASONE:  Yes, this is Adams Bros. farms in California where the FDA linked  the current romaine lettuce recall.  They're now recalling red leaf  lettuce, green leaf lettuce, even cauliflower.  The farm says it's  recalling those products out of an abundance of caution.  The red, the  green leaf lettuce says -- made its way to many states including  Pennsylvania and Texas.  The cauliflower distributed across the country  including Illinois, New York, even New Jersey.  </p><p> Well, \"The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air\" star, Alfonso Ribeiro is suing the  creators of Fortnite and NBA 2K for using his famous dance on the video  games.  Now, Ribeiro alleges that the epic games and take two interactive  used his dance, the Carlton dance without his permission or credit.  It was  popularized obviously through his character Carlton Banks on the 1990s  sitcom that we all loved, OK.  </p><p> And then finally this, Ford is focusing on Dagen's best friend.  The  company has developed a kennel that canceled out noise for dogs that are  scared of fireworks, if that sounds familiar.  The Ford Quite Kennel  apparently use the same noise cancellation technology that's found in the  Ford Edge.  It's only a prototype for now but they say it's also working on  other projects that use auto tech to solve nonautomotive problems.  Shares  of Ford are down more than 30 percent this year.  It's not just dogs, Maria  that's scared of fireworks, cats are too.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  It's true and I think that's good.  Are you happy with that?  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, it's good.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  They need to step up and start selling it.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, I don't like when the dogs are just afraid of the  fireworks and running for cover.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  No, and like horrible -- particularly leaning up to New Year's  Eve.  Horrible problem that dogs get out and a lot of people lose their  dogs because they're really not paying attention during the fireworks  celebration in the summer and around New Years.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Really scary.  All right, coming up, some Wall Street for your  stocking.  My next guest has some stock picks that could be better than  gifts this Christmas, up next.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Well, how about filling your Christmas stockings  with stocks.  Joining me right now is Larrea Wealth Management CEO, Aquiles  Larrea with gifts that keep on giving year after year.  Great to see you,  Aquiles.</p><p> AQUILES LARREA, CEO, LARREA WEALTH MANAGEMENT:  Nice to see you again,  Maria.  Thank you so much for having me.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.  So what do you think -- are  you recommending buying stocks for kids or for everybody?  </p><p> LARREA:  Well, actually it's for kids, it can be for teenagers, as well.   This is an ideal gift that keeps on giving year after year.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right, tell us about that.  </p><p> LARREA:  So that they'll remember you forever.  Because what you're doing  is you're establishing a habit.  You're allowing your kids to a little bit  of a lesson.  As I mentioned in an article, you want them to establish the  habit early, to purchase the stock.  They also -- your little capitalist  will get a dividend as well and that's another allowance for that.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  I love this idea because you're really educating the child or  the youngster about how investing works, and then they can watch it grow or  go down.  I mean, that's another lesson, not all stocks go up.  </p><p> LARREA:  Yes, absolutely.  And especially with this volatility that  occurred just recently.  I call it the holiday special, you get to pick it  up cheaper.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  OK.  So, some of the stocks you're recommending are very  familiar names for a -- for a youngster, right, like Nike or Under Armour.   These are your two stock picks?  </p><p> LARREA:  Well, the stock picks are not as important.  I mean, we can talk  about Google, we can talk about Apple.  More importantly is to establish  that habit where say if they bought Google at $100 it would be four times  the amount. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So, you -- are you not recommending Nike?  </p><p> LARREA:  Well, no.  I'm not saying I'm not recommending anything.  All I'm  saying is that with names like this, they are names you can grow with.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  OK.</p><p> LARREA:  They can grow with over several years.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So what do you like right now in terms of investing?  </p><p> LARREA:  Well, I do like the valuations on Google.  I do like the  valuations on Netflix.  I do like Nike.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  OK.  So tell us about Google, what you like about Google.  </p><p> LARREA:  The thing about Google is they're establishing their campus here  in New York.  They've just expanded what they're going to be doing on the  west side.  It's a great stock.  If you look at the valuation, you just  can't go on the P.E. of course, you have to go on the fact that the  expansion here on the east coast bodes well for them and that they're  entrenched in multiple areas.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Revenue $33 billion in 18.  But look at the stock year-to-date,  it's had a rough couple of months.  Is that --</p><p> LARREA:  Well, everybody's had a rough couple of months.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, so is that something to point out in terms of valuation  for the youngster?  </p><p> LARREA:  Well, for the -- you definitely want to teach them, yes,  absolutely, that it's going to go down a bit but at the same time we're  going to go and we purchased it for you at a cheaper price so you say  here's the opportunity or in their devalue.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, what are the rules for a youngster?  I mean, a parent can  set up the account and hold it in that person's name?  What if you're too  young to actually have a brokerage account?  What is too young -- what is  too young?  </p><p> LARREA:  Well, it's 18 and younger.  I mean, you could do uniform gift  trust for a minors.  But generally you want to make sure that the parents  or the grandparents or your own aunts and uncles, they can purchase these  stocks and establish these accounts for kids.  They can get together with  the parents in on this and purchase over the years.  Or even do so in a --  in a drip plan as well.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, tell us about a drip plan.  What is a drip plan?</p><p> LARREA:  The drip plan is where they're investing directly with the  company.  I've seen many successful clients when they were -- they were  kids, the parents would set them up with a direct purchase from the  company, all right?  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  OK.  </p><p> LARREA:  It's not something I advocate for everybody.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And I've got -- I've got a couple names that you like, Nike,  Disney, Google, AT&amp;T, Under Armour, Netflix and Facebook.  That sounds  about right?  </p><p> LARREA:  Sounds right to me.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  OK, Aquiles, it's great to have you on the show this morning.</p><p> LARREA:  Thank you so much for having me.</p><p> LARREA:  It's a great idea, stock in your stocking.  Aquiles Larrea joining  us there.  </p><p> Still ahead, my exclusive interview with MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred, next  hour, right here, MORNINGS WITH MARIA, stay with us.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.

Take a look at Futures  big rally underway now.  We are at the highs of the morning with the Dow  Jones Industrial average up 178 points, three quarters of one percent  higher on Dow and the S&amp;P.  NASDAQ is up 52 points almost one percent  higher, big rally this morning after sharp selloff on Wall Street  yesterday.  </p><p> Yesterday, it was a tough day at the close.  All the major indices declined  better than two percent on the session.  On global growth and interest rate  worries, the Federal Reserve's two-day meeting on rates getting underway  today and we are expected the Feds to raise rates tomorrow.  </p><p> In Europe markets are mixed.  Take a look at the European indices right now  where the FT-100 is down 22 points, a third of a percent.  The CAC Quarante  is down a fraction and the DAX Index is up in Germany up 46 points.  </p><p> In Asia overnight, declines across the board, worst per former Japan, down  almost two percent.</p><p> We are watching the price of oil this morning.  Take a look, down 2-1/3  percent.  Crude oil down below $50.00 a barrel up for the first time in  over a year.  $48.74 a barrel on oil this morning.  </p><p> Les Moonves has been denied his severance package.  CBS announcing its  former CEO will not receive the expected $120 million package.

Get his take on growth  for the league and the latest on a deal for the regional sports networks  and streaming rights.  </p><p> All those stories coming up this morning and joining me to break it all  down, Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell, Forbes media chairman, former  Republican presidential candidate, Steve Forbes and 32 Advisor CEO and  former economic advisor to President Obama, Robert Wolf.  Great to see you  this morning.  </p><p> ROBERT WOLF, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CONTRIBUTOR:  Great to be here.</p><p> STEVE FORBES, CHAIRMAN AND EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, FORBES MEDIA:  Good morning.</p><p> WOLF:  So question, do you think with President Trump's tweets he kind of  hammering the Fed, don't do anything -- don't do anything.  You think  that's why the market just popped over the last hour?  And do you think  there could be a little head fake into the Fed decision?  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  I don't think so.  I don't think the Federal Reserve is going  to change its action because of the president's pressure, I don't.  I think  the Fed stated that I don't think Jay Powell is going to do -- I think the  winds are showing us that thing are slowing down.  The Federal Reserve  probably shouldn't raise rates tomorrow.  </p><p> DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  But to that point, --</p><p> FORBES:  They have to do it just simply because to show that they're not  kowtowing to the president.  </p><p> WOLF:  Right, that's what my --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  So they have to do it.</p><p> FORBES:  But the statement though put out will indicate instead of four  rate increases next year, they'll see how predictions well. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  The Journal's editorial today -- </p><p> FORBES:  And by the way, when Powell gave that speech couple of weeks ago,  they're now trying to walk it back, he was surrendering.  Any time the  White House goes after the Fed in a serious way the White House always  wins.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So you think the Fed is listening to the president, they're  surrendering.  </p><p> FORBES:  Yes, they've surrendered.  They're saying for next year they've  pulled back from a very aggressive program with rate increases they  surrender.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Wow.  Yes, but it's not just the president.  Dagen, the economy  is slowing down even the editorial board in the Journal is saying at this  morning.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right, that's what I was going to bring up is the time for a Fed  pause and they go through all the reasons why the Fed could and should  pause no sign of an inflation breakout.  Global economy that's slowing  signs that the U.S. is slowing with housing and autos, both down.</p><p> And then, basically, the biggest argument being the Fed is already  unwinding its balance sheet, the largest monetary experiment in modern  history.  </p><p> And they actually outline what Jay Powell should say about the president if  he's asked the inevitable question at his press conference.  Just I've seen  the president's comments but the Federal Reserve is an independent central  bank.  His comments make our job harder because they might call some  investors to think we make decisions based on political pressure.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I can assure you that we make our decisions on economic merit.   Some may choose not to believe that but they do so at their own risk.   That's the Journal writing what Jay Powell should say.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, just because the president saw the slowdown coming before  all of this about the Fed doesn't mean that they're kowtowing to the -- to  the president.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  The irony is it's part -- it's part of his policy that's caused  the turmoil in the markets and the slowdown because of the way that he's  handled trade.  And I talked about it all year long.  That you did so much  right with the tax cuts and the tax reform but then you slap tariffs on  American businesses to help you hurting a lot.  To help a few.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  That is part -- that is part of it, for sure.  </p><p> WOLF:  I have been for rate increases to unwind what's happened in the last  few years where I think the Fed went too far on quantitative easing.  That  being said, the strong dollar based on what's going on around the world is  going to really impact us in a negative way.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Let's bring in on that note Charles Schwabb chief investor  strategist Liz Ann Sonders.  I'm sure she has a thing or two to say about  that.  Good to see you Liz Ann, thank you so much for joining the  conversation.  </p><p> LIZ ANN SONDERS, CHIEF INVESTOR STRATEGIST, CHARLES SCHWAB:  Thank you.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So what do you think in terms of rates and the dollar?  Robert  is bringing up the strong dollar here.  We have oil prices below $50.00 a  barrel this morning.  We've got a Federal Reserve possibly on hold if they  do, in fact, do the rate hike tomorrow but after that, on hold your  thoughts on where we are in terms of investing in markets today in the face  of all of these outside forces?  </p><p> SONDERS:  Well, we do think that Fed raises rates tomorrow and it's not  just to make a political statement.  But in line with their mandate.  You  know Maria, you were sitting on the day I set the Powell lunch at the  Economics Club of New York.  And I think one of the more important things  that he said was not that Fed funds rate was just full of the neutral rate  but re-enforcing the idea that financial market volatility alone is not  going to be a trigger for the Fed but it has to morph into financial system  stability.</p><p> And I think he made a very important distinction between those in essence  sending a message, we are not going to make monetary policy changes simply  because of market action, and given the fact that real rates are still only  zero and the fact that the market expects a hike.  I think if the Fed were  to pause tomorrow and not do something, I'm not so sure that would be a  positive message for market perspective.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right, because the president --</p><p> SONDERS:  Now, whether they caused hanging into next year data dependency  is legitimate.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right, because the president keeps talking about it.  In fact  he tweeted earlier this morning on the Fed and he said this, I hope that  people over at the Fed will read today's Wall Street Journal editorial  before they make yet another mistake.  Also, don't let the market become  anymore illiquid than it already is.  Stop with the $50 billion in the wind  down, feel the market, don't just go by meaningless numbers.  Good luck,  writes the president.  </p><p> Do you think the Fed gets political and listen to the Fed or is really what  driving the Fed the actual reality of this slowdown that we're seeing?   Which is what I mentioned a month ago?  </p><p> SONDERS:  I don't think -- I don't think the Fed gets political, and I  think the market doesn't want the Fed to get political.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p> SONDERS:  I hope that Fed does not get political.  I think they should  continue to operate monetary policy by looking at their dual mandate.  And  we have to understand that as -- you know, a lot -- a lot of comments about  don't say it's different this time.  The laughter that tends to come about  about when you say that.  But it is certainly different in this environment  with rates having gone to zero into negative territory outside of the  United States.  $25 trillion added to global central bank -- central bank  balance sheets.  And we're now seeing that liquidity tied come out.  </p><p> There are no free lunches in even a normal environment when you start to  see tighter monetary policy, tighter financial conditions.  You tend to see  higher volatility in the equity market.  You shorten the duration between  then and a recession, you typically get a bear market, that's normal in a  cycle.  And I don't think we should attempt to change the cycle this time.   We are going to have the end of this cycle at some point.  </p><p> We will get another recession, we will have a bear market, in many ways  we're already in a bear market.  We've been in this stealth rolling bear  market which is a necessary reprising of many higher risk asset classes due  to this very different liquidity environment.  This is not a unique and  abnormal situation other than the extent of this unprecedented monetary  policy this time.  </p><p> FORBES:  Well you have the -- Liz Ann, Steve Forbes here.  You have  earnings going up next year not as robustly as they did after that tax cut.   And the economy is still growing.  Isn't it really the trade uncertainty  that is hurting now capital expenditures by businesses and the global  economy?  That if we got that out of the way then we'd be roaring ahead  again?  </p><p> SONDERS:  I don't know about roaring ahead.  I think trade is certainly one  of the near term uncertainties but tighter financial conditions has always  put downward pressure on multiples.  And multiples I think are also under  pressure because looking ahead to 2019, going from above 20 percent  earnings growth courtesy of tax cuts to now mid-single digits.  </p><p> Keep in mind too that the number one sector in terms of year over year  earnings growth expectations for next year is energy.  There's been almost  no haircutting to earnings yet on the energy sector for the collapse we've  seen in oil prices.  There also hasn't been much haircutting for the  strength of the dollar in the impact on exporters.</p><p> So, I think the path of least resistance for 2019 earnings is actually down  and we're not far from where we are toward potentially and earnings  recession like we got in late 2015 and 2016.  So I don't think even if some  of the trade concerns are alleviated that that is all systems go for next  year.  </p><p> Also, we've seen rate of change in the economy.  Better or worse matters  more than good or bad when it comes to the relationship between economic  data and the stock market.  Now investors often forget that.  It's not just  is it good or is it bad, is it stronger, is it weak.  But what's the  direction of change.  And there's enough underlying weakness happening in  some of the leading indicators.  The average workweek notwithstanding the  recent move back down a three month up trend in unemployment claims.  We'll  see what ISM new orders look like in the next release.  </p><p> So, those are some -- kind of in the armor that I think the market is  keying off of.  </p><p> WOLF:  Liz Ann, first of all I thought your 2019 market outlook piece was  great.  Really great read.  </p><p> SONDERS:  Thank you.</p><p> WOLF:  And I agree with you that this strong dollar something people aren't  focused on going into 19, especially with exports and manufacturing.  But  my question to you is can you talk a little about the lack of inflation  we're seeing and where do you see that impacting maybe a slowly raising  rate environment and maybe a slowdown that feels a little like -- you know,  you feel like there could be a stagnation coming the way -- the way you  kind of talk about it.  </p><p> SONDERS:  Right.  So there are -- there are long-term global secular  pressures down on inflation which I think will persist as -- you know, in  the near to medium term.  What we don't know is whether we're going start  to see some cyclical pressures on the upside courtesy of the tight labor  market.  And that's what makes it difficult sometimes for the Fed to put  something a little bit of a pickle, because unlike other central banks that  only have a single mandate and inflation, the Fed has dual mandate of full  employment and price stability.  And although we've got price stability,  we've got the tightness in the labor market and the increase in wages which  is great for workers, but could start to filter into rising core measures  of inflation.  </p><p> And given that core CPI is running above the Fed's target.  They have to  operate right now with their mandates maybe sending slightly different  messages right now.  And it is a difficult environment for them but given  that real rates are at zero right now, I don't think a hike this week  suggests that it's a major mistake and they've gone way too far on the --  on the tightening side.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Any thoughts on oil where it is?  Is that indicating that we're  seeing a sharp slowdown across the world?  I mean, oil below 50 it's either  an indicator or its going to be a positive for the economy, right?  </p><p> SONDERS:  I think there's a component of it reflecting global demand but  there's also, obviously, the supply side of the story as well.  You know,  we're at a level now 48 -- you know, I'm not an expert on oil but there is  sort of a sweet spot where it's high enough to be above break evens for the  shale and fracking companies.  But low enough that it's still a boost the  consumer part of the sector.  </p><p> But remember when we saw the collapse back in 2014, into 2015 it did lead  to a four consecutive quarter earnings recession, and did cause hits to the  capital spending side energy related.  </p><p> So, we do have to be mindful that this is not a purely positive story  anymore.  As it relates to lower oil prices simile being a benifit to the  consumer.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  I totally agree.  Liz Ann, it's good to see you this morning.   Thank you so much.  </p><p> SONDERS:  Thanks.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Liz Ann Sonders, joining us.</p><p> President Trump just tweeted moments ago and here's what he's saying this  morning, illegal immigration cost the United States more than $200 billion  a year.  How was this allowed to happen?  Now the government shutdown is  looming on the horizon with just three full days left to broker a deal.   Our own Blake Burman is live at the White House this morning with the  latest on that.  Blake, good morning to you.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)</p><p> BLAKE BURMAN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Maria, good morning to  you as well.  We could tell you that White House officials are already  preparing for the possibility that there could be a partial government  shutdown come this weekend.  We are told that President Trump does not want  a short-term solution in the name of one or two weeks that would  essentially just kick the can down a road -- down the road and have to deal  with this again in the upcoming days.  The White House also suggesting that  the president's threat still remains.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MERCEDES SCHLAPP, DIRECTOR, WHITE HOUSE STRATEGIC COMMUNICATIONS:  The  president as he mentioned last week, he would shut down the government to  increase funding for border security.  Now the key here is that we're going  see what deal the senate brings up.  And looking at a those details we'll  basically make the determination in which direction we're going to go.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BURMAN:  So here's where things stand, President Trump wants $5 billion for  a border wall.  Democrats, though, willing to give less than a third of  that for what they are calling border security.  Chuck Schumer saying  yesterday on the floor of the Senate, that the simple reality is this, the  president does not have the votes on Capitol Hill to get his desired $5  billion.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SEN. CHARLES SCHUMER (D-NY), SENATE MINORITY LEADER:  Even with a  Republican Congress, no threat or temper tantrum will get the president his  wall.  On the other hand, Democrats are altogether.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BURMAN:  Maria, there was even a rumor at one pont yesterday afternoon that  there would be some sort of compromise that would be presented from up on  Capitol Hil but that never materialized.  It remains very unclear this  morning where both sides go from here but most especially the president,  Maria.  </p><p> (END VIDEO TAPE)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Blake thank you.  Blake Burman is at the White House this  morning.  We're going to take a short break.  When we come back his  severance has been denied, ousted CBS chief Les Moonves not receiving his  $120 million package that he expected as he walks out the door.  Details   from the board meeting, coming up.  </p><p> Then the big business of baseball, why the Major League Baseball may be  abandoning the paid T.V. focus model.  I'll speak exclusively with MLB  commissioner Rob Manfred, coming up.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  CBS says Les Moonves will not receive his  severance package after all.  Cheryl Casone with the details now.  Cheryl?  </p><p> CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Yes.  That severance was  potentially worth a 120 million.  This comes after an investigation into  allegations Moonves sexually assaulted several women.  According to the  board of directors, investigators found that he violated company policy  breached his employment contract, and intentionally failed to cooperate  fully with the investigation.  Now CBS is down 18 percent so far this year.</p><p> Well, former Nissan Chairman Carlos Ghosn pushed increase market share in  the U.S. creating tension with the company's management.  That's according  to The Wall Street Journal which says that Nissan executives believe that  Ghosn's plan would hurt investments in Japan.  Now Ghosn remains in jail  after being arrested in Japan last month for allegedly underreporting  income by 44 million.  Now he's denied any wrongdoing.  Taking a look at  shares Nissan they're down 18 percent so far this year.  The story  continues towns fold.</p><p> Well, Boeing is feeling bullish about its business by concerns about  slowing global growth.  The company is raising its quarterly dividend by 20  percent.  $2.05 a share.  Boeing also boosting its share buyback program to  20 billion.  Maria Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg discussed what's ahead for  his company with you recently.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  So, you've expanded the business, you've got commercial  airspace, you've got defense and then you've got services.  Tell us how  business is right now.</p><p> DENNIS MUILENBURG, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, BOEING:  Well, aerospace is a  tremendous growth business.  We look out over the next 10 years as $8.1  trillion marketplace, passenger traffic is growing at about six to seven  percent per year sustained.  The world needs about 43,000 new commercial  airplanes over the next 20 years.  Part of that have is the 737 as we  ramped up to 52 a month this year.  We'll be producing it 57 a month next  year.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CASONE:  All right.  Shares of Boeing basically flat ahead of the opening  bell.  Actually, excuse me they are higher pup by 2-1/2 percent.  My  apologies, Maria.  There's the current premarket read on Boeing looking  good.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And that's one of the reason the market has accelerated  this morning, Boeing as a Dow Component.  Thank you, Cheryl.  Coming up.   Big tech in trouble.  Facebook, Twitter, Google all under fire for  reportedly providing insufficient information in the Russia probe.  We've  got that when we come right back.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>  BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Technology giants under fire after reports says  that they did not do enough to help lawmakers with the investigation into  Russian election interference.  Gerri Willis is on the floor of the New  York Stock Exchange this morning expecting a big rally at the start of  trading.  Gerri, good morning to you.  </p><p> GERRI WILLIS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Yes.  It does look like a big  rally but I got to tell you, Twitter, Facebook, Google all having their  issues this morning after third party studies.  Two of them written for the  Senate Intelligence Committee concluded that the companies did the bare  minimum possible and I'm quoting there to explain the Russian  misinformation campaign and how they manipulated these social media sites.</p><p> And the rechair extraordinary, that's what we're finding out of these  studies.  126 million on Facebook, 20 million on Instagram, and today the  NAACP getting into the act returning a donation from Facebook.  And they're  calling for a daylong boycott that is of the social media network.  Why,  revelations that the platform was used to manipulate black voters in the  2016 election aiming for voter suppression.</p><p> Now, Sheryl Sandberg, the COO there, she had something to say about this  and I quote, \"Facebook committed to working with leading U.S. civil rights  organizations to strengthen an advance civil rights honor service.  They've  raised a number of important concerns, she says, and I'm grateful for their  candor and guidance\".  So big headlines there.  Those stocks moving higher  actually in the premarket.</p><p> Meanwhile, Oracle reporting last night and it was considered a positive  report despite the fact that the company reported flat revenue.  You talk  to, Maria, you talked to Larry Ellison recently about the company and its  prospects.  Listen.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> WILLIS:  Tell us where you find the growth stories within Oracle and the  industry, what's the most exciting now?  </p><p> LARRY ELLISON, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, ORACLE:  Well, in terms of growth,  I mean, if you're looking at the numbers, there is two separate questions.   What do you think the coolest new technology is that we're working on,  which might not have shown up in the numbers yet and then what, you know,  what showing up in the numbers, what have we been doing well for a while so  you can actually see it through the financial results?</p><p> And that's our status applications.  We are by far in a way the largest  provider of cloud applications for financial accounting or for supply  chain.  For manufacturing, we have now 6,000 ERP customers for our fusion  sweep.  Another 15,000 for our net sweep, ERP customers financial  accounting customers.  Our closest competitor claims to have a couple of  hundred customers.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> WILLIS:  So the company reporting flat revenue for the quarter but that was  better than Wall Street expected.  The company stock closed down yesterday  but we'll keep an eye on it today, Maria.  Back to you.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right, Gerri.  Thank you so much.  Gerri Willins on the  floor of the NYC.  Dagen, your thoughts?  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  I think that you have been so far head on talking to these  technology executives.  I think that the people know -- can see the world  12 months ahead as they watch this program regularly.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  It's all about growth and we've pinpointed growth in all of  these sectors throughout the year but you're right, this year we had a  number of the leading executives from technology on.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Ellison, Satya Nadella, numerous people from Microsoft, even  Steve Ballmer talking about China.  You name it.  Dan Niles has been  basically if investors were watching this program they would have seen the  downfall of Apple stock if they listened to your interview with Dan Niles.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  He was excellent actually and he still has issue in terms  of Apple and what's going on with the consumer.  So we'll see.  I think it  will be a good fourth quarter in terms of holiday sales.  What do you think  in terms of the consumer right now?  A lot of people coming this program,  the head of the international shopping centers came on, he said it's going  to be a fantastic holiday shopping season.  What do you think, how's the  consumer right now?  </p><p> FORBES:  I think the consumer is going to buy it but with an eye towards  holding back in the first quarter of next year.  They want to have a good  Christmas.  They want to make everyone happy.  But they're going to be very  uncertain going into January.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> FORBES:  What do we do next?  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  A lot of uncertainties out there.  Coming up.  Helicopter  parent alert.  Parent putting themselves in financial danger supporting  their adult children.  Details coming up.  Then the MLB could be on move.   I'm talking to future of baseball in an exclusive interview with MLB  Commissioner Rob Manfred after this.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back to Tuesday morning, everybody.  Thanks so much for  joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it is Tuesday, December 18th.  Your  top stories right now, 8:30 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p> Bulls taking the lead this morning.  Take a look at Futures indicating a  nice rally at the start of trading.  Now, we are off of the highs of the  morning here.  But we're looking at again at the start of trading of about  150 points.  Two-thirds of one percent higher on the Dow, almost one  percent higher on the Nasdaq.</p><p> This, of course, ahead of the Federal Reserve's two-day meeting which  begins today.  The Fed is expected to raise interest rates tomorrow for the  last time in 2018.  We're expecting a couple of heights next year, as well.</p><p> European Indexes look like this, this morning.  A mixed story in Europe  with the FT-100 down 27 points, the CAC Quarante in Paris down 4 points.   And the DAX index in Germany up at 35 percent, 37 points higher.</p><p> Asian markets closed lower overnight as you see here across the board.   Crude oil is a big story this morning.  The price of crude now back below  $50.00 a barrel.  For the first time since October 2017, with the decline  of 2-1/2 percent right now at 48.67.</p><p> Then, the bank of mom and dad.  How parents are putting themselves in  danger supporting their adult children.  What is the cutoff there?  We're  going to take a look, coming up.  But first, the big business of baseball.   A lot going on in the offseason, and it is all about growth.</p><p> From streaming rights to betting on games, to getting Millennials back into  America's favorite pastime.  Joining me right now, the Commissioner of  Major League Baseball, Rob Manfred.  Commissioner, it's great to see you.</p><p> ROB MANFRED, COMMISSIONER, MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL:  Nice to see you, Maria.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.  So, where is the growth in  baseball right now?  This is not your father's baseball game anymore, is  it?</p><p> MANFRED:  Well, I think the growth for us over the last decade is really  been to places in there -- in our traditional media business.  And then, in  the digital area.  We've been a leader in that space at that's the leading  sports app out there, and it's been a great growth driver for us.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And the games are on traditional broadcast television.  Still  bringing in the money, we know that strong rating, as well, for the  traditional baseball.  But you're moving also into streaming.  Tell us what  you're doing?</p><p> MANFRED:  Well, we were one of the first direct-to-consumer, over-the-top  products offered to the consumer.  We've been a leader in this space.  The  current opportunity relates to the existing cable model, the regional  sports networks that are for sale.</p><p> Obviously, they're a creature of the cable model, but our ownership that  digital rights presents, a real opportunity for the industry going forward.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Those are big opportunity.  So, tell us, have you seen any  reaction from fans about this?</p><p> MANFRED:  Well, I think our fans want to be able to consume the game and  the platforms that they're naturally on.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Everywhere.</p><p> MANFRED:  That's why we have experimented with things.  We had 30 games on  Facebook last year, we have a relationship with Twitter.  YouTube is been  very active with respect to our product.  And it's important for us to  deliver games in the way that fans want to see them.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Now, I'm glad you mentioned Facebook, how did that go with  Facebook?</p><p> MANFRED:  Well, I think the most interesting thing about Facebook is it  gave us an audience that was dramatically different from our traditional  broadcast audience.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Wow!</p><p> MANFRED:  And obviously that encourages you to be more aggressive because  you're not cannibalizing your traditional product.  In fact, it's an  additive opportunity.  So we're very positive on the experiment.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Now, MLB is also emerging as a suitor for Fox regional sports  networks.  Can you tell us about that?</p><p> MANFRED:  Yes, we're interested in the regionals -- you know that in 12  markets, baseball on the regional sports network is the number one  programming throughout this summer.  In 24 or 25 markets that we operate in  were the number one programming on cable.</p><p> So these regional sport networks are really valuable, valuable assets.  And  we think that the combination of that traditional mode of delivery and the  digital rights that we control is an opportunity for the game.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Amazon also reportedly interested in making a deal?</p><p> MANFRED:  Amazon has been around the process.  You know, exactly who's  going to be in, who's going to be out remains to be seen.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  So, the last time we spoke, you were talking a little about  technology, in how you've inserted lots of tech into the game to get people  in the seats in the stadium.</p><p> MANFRED:  Right.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  How's that going?  I mean a lot of people have the goods to  watch the game at home on their big screen T.V., and they don't need to  come to the stadium.</p><p> MANFRED:  Well, I think baseball is fortunate.  There's a huge  differentiation between our in part product and watching the game on T.V.   The social aspect of it is really important to a lot of our fans and we've  been very fortunate in terms of our ability to continue to get people to go  to the stadium.</p><p> But I think in order to continue that trend, it's important that we deliver  the fans, opportunities in the stadium.  And the best way to do that is by  technology.  Great example is our Ballpark app.</p><p> It gives fans the opportunity to look while they're in the stadium and find  entertainment alternatives in the stadium while they're there.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  I love it.  I love it.  All right, let's talk about sports  betting.  Because you recently announced a gaming partnership with MGM  Resorts.  Tell us about that.  Where does the gambling model for baseball  go at this point?</p><p> MANFRED:  Well, I think it's important to pick the right partners, and MGM  certainly fit that bill.  We wanted a partner that we could proceed slowly  with, that we can make sure that we always protect the integrity of the  game.</p><p> For us right now, we see it as a sponsorship fan, engagement opportunity.   You know, fans are always looking for ways to get a deeper involvement with  the game, and sports betting is one of those avenues.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  I mean we know people are betting.  Why not do it in a legal  platform.</p><p> MANFRED:  Well, I think all of the commissioners, two of the major sports  to a greater or lesser extent have recognized that sports betting is going  on, and we're better off having it legal than we are illegal.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Exactly.  So, let's talk about the game in general.  Because  it's slower than other sports games.  And that has some people thinking  well, that's for my father, for my grandfather.  How do you get the  Millennials engaged, young people engaged into the game?</p><p> MANFRED:  Well, I think that I can mention four things.  Number one is  technology.  We've talked about that already.  Nothing Millennials like  better than technology.  And our technology has been a leader for more than  a decade.</p><p> Secondly, our clubs have done a phenomenal job about redesigning stadiums,  having what they refer to as millennial areas.  They're more like bars,  flexible seating arrangements, flexible ticketing arrangements.</p><p> You buy a pass for the month, you can go whenever you want.  Maybe don't  stay the whole game.  But you're there, you're in the ballpark.  And then,  I think there's ancillary items like food, we did a -- we started a new  program last year.  The MLB Food Fest had a tremendous interest herein New  York, and it featured the ballpark food that a lot of our fans, love.  And  we know, Millennials and food go together.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> MANFRED:  So, those are just three examples of the things we're trying to  do.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  What do we expects for ticket prices?</p><p> MANFRED:  Look, our ticket prices -- I think have grown at a very, very  modest rate that we remain the best buy in sports in terms of the  opportunity to attend the game live.  And from a pricing perspective, our  theory always has been that we need to be a family-friendly price product.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, because this is a family -- this is a family outing.</p><p> MANFRED:  It is indeed.  I mean, and we think that's an important part of  how the game gets passed on to the next generation.  I think a lot of us, I  certainly do have memories of my parents taking me and it started my love  to the game.  And we think that fundamental family activity is still really  important for us.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  So, we're in the offseason, we've already seen some big trades.   Tell us about that, Robertson, can now going to the Mets.  Do you expect  more blockbuster traits like that deals this offseason?</p><p> MANFRED:  I do expect that the activity will continue to be high through  the offseason.  Our calendar is moved a little bit.  It used to be by the  time you get to the holiday break that a lot of the activity was done, in  more recent years, we've seen that activity continued into January and  February.  And I think that's good for the sport.  You know it generates  interest during the offseason.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  What about the big prizes in this year's free agent class?  I  mean, Bryce Harper, obviously.  How much money is it going to take to land  some of these guys?</p><p> MANFRED:  Well, look, you know, you'll appreciate this.  The market will  determine how much money it takes the -- </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  But it's a record-breaking deals, right?</p><p> MANFRED:  Right, yes.  Look, there are two great players that entered free  agency at a relatively young age.  And I think they're going to be  appealing to clubs.  I'm sure there'll be a lot of activity for both of  them.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Now, what do you -- what do you expecting in terms of the year  ahead?  Give us your expectations.</p><p> MANFRED:  Well, I think we're looking forward to another great year.  One  of the great things about baseball in sort of our modern incarnation is the  competitive balance that we have.</p><p> I think, last year, some of the surprise stories from clubs that people  didn't think we're going to be competitive.  Clubs like Tampa, I think make  for real excitement for us.  Tampa, Oakland, Pittsburgh, we're all in that  category.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  You're right.</p><p> MANFRED:  So, we're hoping that we have those surprises that continue to  drive an interest.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Great.  Commissioner, it's great to see you.</p><p> MANFRED:  It's great to see you.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  Commissioner Rob Manfred, there.  Coming  up, going back to its roots.  How the nation's oldest brewery is  celebrating its 190th birthday.  Then, a warning for parent; you could be  putting yourself in financial danger if you're supporting adult children.   The alarming new study right after this.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Two police officers were killed in the line of  duty.  Cheryl Casone with the details now, Cheryl.  </p><p> CASONE:  Well, Maria, the Chicago Police Department says officers Eduardo  Marmolejo and Conrad Gary were fatally struck by a train, while they were  looking for a shooting suspect.  They were investigating a shots-fired call  on the city's far-south side.  Both officers served less than three year on  the force.  Chicago Police say the suspect was later taken into custody.  </p><p> Well, a judge in Missouri has decided to add a special feature to a deer  poacher sentence.  David Barry and four other men had their hunting  privileges revoked; had to pay 51,000 in fines for illegally killing  wildlife.  But the judge also ordered Barry to watch this every month.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Quick, the second.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Faster, faster Bambi.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> CASONE:  Yes, that's right.  Barry has to watch Disney classic \"Bambi,\" at  least once a month during his year-long jail sentence.  </p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> CASONE:  Can't make this up.  Conservation agents have called this deer  poaching case one of the largest in Missouri history, OK.  </p><p> And then, there was this.  (INAUDIBLE) is taking a page from its history to  celebrate its 190th anniversary; this is the oldest brewery in the United  States and they're rolling out five limited edition cans of Lager.  The  cans, which are going to be released each month from now until April are  going to show how the breweries label has changed since 1829.  They're also  going to release a limited-edition Bourbon barrel aged beer; those aged in  caves.  They were dug by hand back in the 1800s.</p><p> Finally, there is this, check this out.

Drake Winslow got a huge ovation from the crowd;  he belted out anthem.  He didn't even look at the words, Maria; he just  knew it and sang it.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  I love it.  Great.  And I like the \"Bambi\" movie, too.  You  watch \"Bambi\" and you're going to like it.  </p><p> CASONE:  Yes, you're going to watch that every month buddy.  Stop hunting.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much, Cheryl.  Coming up, taking care of adult  children a startling new study out with a surprising number of adults still  living with their parents.  Stay with us.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  How about this, the bank of mom and dad is open  for business.  A new study from Merrill Lynch finds American parents are  spending $500 billion a year to support their adult children; that number  represents twice the amount those parents are investing in their own  retirements.  Joining us right now is the author of the upcoming book,  \"Everyday Millionaires,\" Ramsey Solutions Financial Expert, Chris Hogan.   Chris, good see you.  </p><p> CHRIS HOGAN, FINANCIAL EXPERT, RAMSEY SOLUTIONS:  Good to see you.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So, this study is basically saying if you are supporting your  adult children, as they get older, that money is being taken away from your  own retirement?</p><p> HOGAN:  It really is.  And it's alarming, Maria.  I mean 63 percent of the  parents say that they've sacrificed their own financial security to be able  to help adult grown children.  So, what parents need to do is set their  kids up for success, help them to learn how to be independent by teaching  them money skills, and how to deal with it.  Another aspect of the study  said one in four people in homes are either working or going to school.  So  I want to know what are they doing?</p><p> FORBES:  Hey, do you think -- Steve Forbes here, do you think that the  booming economy, bringing people back in the labor force is going to help  the situation, get the kids out of the basement before they reach  eligibility for Social Security?</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> HOGAN:  Well, Steve, I think, you know, the job and the booming economy is  one thing, but if you don't have motivated young people that don't know  that they need to do something, I don't think anything will change.  So, I  think parents need to understand there's a difference between helping  versus hampering these adult children.  Help them do a resume, help them  get out and get any kind of job to have income coming in.</p><p> FORBES:  Chris, I just want to play devil's advocate here 20, 25 years ago,  529s was not a big thing.  Savings plan for colleges and all these type of  things, so today, kids are coming out of school with much more student loan  debt than they ever had.  Wages have slowed since they've actually entered  their adulthood.  And so, what do you say about those causes that actually  in some ways forces the parents to be a helping hand?  I just could play  the other side if you just look at the last decade.</p><p> HOGAN:  Well, I think we can always look and see how things are changing,  how inflation causes the cost of things to be able to go up, but I'm here  to tell you, you can go to school without taking out student loans, you can  work at night and go to school during the day or work during the day and go  to school at night.  So I think there are opportunities that are out there.   There are pizzas that need to be delivered, there are jobs that can be  done.  What we don't want to do is make an excuse for people not moving  forward.  I don't think any parent wants to hamper their child.  I think  they want to set them up for success.  So, it's about taking steps moving  in the right directions.  Your name is M-O-M not A-T-M, so young people  need to learn how to make their own money and take care of business.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  I like that.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  It's the veruca salt economy, Chris.  It is the I want it, and I  want it now.  I want to feast, I want a bean feast, cream cakes and donuts  and fruitcake with no nuts.  Give it to me now, and that's the parents'  fault. </p><p> HOGAN:  Well, I agree.  I mean, young people are kids.  I mean, there's a  difference between kids and grown adult children.  I mean, parents love  kids and they want to show love to their kids, but I think we have to be  careful that we're not spoiling them and setting them up to have this  expectation for everything they want right when they want it.  It's OK,  it's called a plan.  You save up and then you buy.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  All right.  Cut them off, Chris, that's your advice.   Thank you so much.  Chris Hogan joining us there.  Coming up, final  thoughts from this all-star panel.  We'll be right back.  Stay with us.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Let's take a look at Futures this morning.  We  are expecting a rally at the start of trading.  Now, that's the start of  trading.  We'll see how it ends, but the Dow Industrials right now showing  a gain of 138 points, S&amp;P is up 14-1/2, NASDAQ is up 37-1/2.  But, of  course, it's been a rough couple of months with the main culprits being,  what, you think it's this trade uncertainty, Steve.  We also have a Federal  Reserve meeting which begins today, and we are expecting the Feds to raise  rates tomorrow.</p><p> FORBES:  Yes, and that's been signaled for months so that wouldn't be  affecting the market.  But the uncertainty about trade is hurting  investment, hurting capital expenditures, hurting economies around world.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  You want a China deal.</p><p> FORBES:  I want a China deal.  Sooner the better.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  I don't know how soon that's going to happen, Robert.  You  know, there are some real issues that China -- Chinese are doing like  spying, espionage, like you know, not opening up its markets to foreigners  and stealing I.P.</p><p> WOLF:  Listen, we've been speaking about this for a long time but a lot  over the last few months.  I'm completely support of President Trump  playing hardball with china on intellectual property and patent.  I think  there's ways to go criminally after them with espionage.  OK, stealing our  business and economic patents.  That being said, Steve and I would agree on  this, we don't support the policy of tariffs.  It hits back at our own  consumers, and then the largest nation in the world of consumers 75 percent  of our GDP is consumption.  You're taxing them.  So I think there's a  better way to go about it.  To answer your question in a long, winded  approach, I don't see a trade deal coming in the next 60 days since the day  count started December 1st.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, I've got to say, Dagen, you were on these tariffs --  particularly, the steel and aluminum tariffs from day one.  You saw it as a  negative, you saw it that it would cut into profits, and that it would hurt  the economy.  That's exactly what's playing out in markets right now.  You  are right.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right.  And ham-handed haphazard policy and the President is  tweeting, you know, relentlessly about the Federal Reserve.  He might not  be able to control Jay Powell despite the fact that he picked him to run  the Central Bank, but he can control the tariffs that have been slapped on  American businesses.  To the point that retaliation from China has caused  two tranches of corporate welfare for farmers in these countries.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Yes, go ahead.</p><p> FORBES:  Maria, if I can say one thing, think about this circle that has  taken place.  We are borrowing from China, then we do the trade tariffs,  and now we're talking the money we've borrowed from China and we just gave  $9 billion to the farmers who are being hurt by the tariffs.  I mean, if  that's not a circular disaster, I mean, honestly.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, it leads me -- it leads me to the conversation of money,  and you have a documentary that you are launching tonight, previewing  tonight: \"IN MONEY WE TRUST\" Steve Forbes, tell us about it.</p><p> FORBES:  Yes, it's done under the hospice of American -- Maryland Public  television.  There's a presenting station, but it's the history of money  over 2500 years based on the book that I co-authored several years ago, and  it makes the point, when money is trustworthy, societies prosper, when  money is unstable, as it has been in recent years, you not only see  economic consequences but also social consequences as well.  We demystify  money, there's too much jargon around it we play it out simple.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Where's the trust today.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  No, the (INAUDIBLE) people were paying their rent with butter.</p><p> FORBES:  We have a chapter on that in the film.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I knew you would, Steve Forbes.  I knew you would.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  That is great.  All right.  So, in money we trust is the film.   Congrats on that film.</p><p> FORBES:  Yes.  We have over public T.V. stations January and following.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  We look forward to it.</p><p> FORBES:  Thank you.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Great show, everybody.  Great to see you, Dagen, Steve Forbes,  and Robert Wolf. </p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

Dow Jones Industrials very little change over the course of the  late afternoon sessions, just about even Stevens and we'll show you the  numbers to see exactly what I mean.  A lot of your banks ringing, one, two,  three - that was a bit of a wimpy gavel, trading is now over, start of a  new week, it is Monday, it's July 23rd.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Tonight, oil markets on alert.  Donald Trump warns Iran of consequences  like never before.  A leadership crisis at Fiat-Chrysler.  Another boss  quits as the Chief Executive remains gravely ill.  And Mesut Ozil slams his  sponsors for not sticking by him when things get tough.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> I'm Richard Quest, live in the world's financial capital, which is rather a  misty financial capital, rainy and misty, but fear not, we will still be  heading course, I'm Richard Quest, in New York where I mean business.  </p><p> A very busy hour ahead for us.  As you'll hear our exclusive interview with  Jamie Dimon and why he thinks the White House got it all wrong on China.   We're also going to have earnings from Google's parent company any minute  now, and we'll take you inside the British steel mills facing threats on  multiple fronts, a squeeze by tariffs on one side and Brexit on the other.  </p><p> We begin tonight now of course with the fire and fury over oil.  Moments  ago, President Trump told reporters he has no concerns about provoking  Iran.  The war of words between the President and the President of Iran has  caused alarm on oil markets.  Now, there was a spike, not a huge one, but  there was a spike in prices to $74.50 on Brent blend.  By Monday morning  though prices have moved back as investors turned their attention to the  problems of oversupply in the market.  </p><p> The movements started after the President sent his all caps tweet to his  rival, President Rouhani, \"Never ever threaten the United States again or  you will suffer consequences, the likes of which few throughout history  have ever suffered before.  We are no longer a country that will stand for  your demented words of violence and death.  Be cautious.\"  The President -  the U.S. President that is, was reacting to this threat from President  Rouhani.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> HASSAN ROUHANI, PRESIDENT OF IRAN (Through a translator.):  Don't play with  the lion's tail.  This will only lead to regret.  You will forever regret  it.  We have been the guarantor of the regional waterways security  throughout history.  Remember, we established the security of oil shipping  routes in history.  Don't forget this.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> QUEST:  Now, the oil shipping route in question is the Straits of Hormuz.   It is the oil world's most important chokepoint and if you join me over at  sub screen, you'll see exactly what I mean.  Here you have the strait -  it's a strait, not straits - Strait of Hormuz from the Persian Gulf out  towards the Gulf of Oman, and you see it here, to Oman down to Iran and the  UAE.  </p><p> It links the gulf with the Arabian Sea and one third of oil tanker traffic  goes through it.  That is 18.5 million barrels a day.  Now, there is  nothing new about the strategic importance of the Strait of Hormuz.  I  mean, if you go back to the 50's, 60's and 70's, it was well known of  course, the importance of this particular area, but closing it off or any  form of dislocation or disruption, well that's a different matter, because  now, you are choking off Asia's biggest economies - China, of course,  Japan, India, South Korea, and Singapore - all receive their oil through  the Strait of Hormuz.  </p><p> You'll see exactly what I mean.  If you think about it, it comes from here,  it comes out through the Strait of Hormuz, goes out and then across over  towards Asia.  </p><p> Denton Cinquegrana is the chief oil analyst of the Oil Price Information  Service (OPIS), and he joins me now via Skype.  The issue of course is very  clear.  We see from our graph and our map, the strategic importance, so why  wasn't there a greater reaction in the market today as a result of the  threats?  </p><p> DENTON CINQUEGRANA, CHIEF OIL ANALYST, OIL PRICE INFORMATION SERVICE:  Big  question because I was expecting a much higher response as well.  Market  turned around, it went lower today actually as you illustrated before.  A  lot of talk about more supply coming from the - to market from places like  Saudi Arabia.  So, Saudi Arabia and Russia.  U.S. production has reached 11  million barrels a day.  The dollar was a little bit stronger, too.  So,  there's that correlation when you have a stronger dollar, oil tends to drop  and vice versa.  </p><p> [16:05:10]  </p><p> CINQUEGRANA:  So, you had a couple of other things - the trade war stuff  that remains a concern.  Possible currency wars, but the rhetoric is  certainly being ramped up.  </p><p> QUEST:  Now, would you agree with me that if the Strait of Hormuz did  actually in some shape or form get blocked or there was some form of  dislocation, away from threats, but real action, then we're in a different  league.  Then, we're into $150.00 maybe $200.00.  I see some people have  even been talking of $200.00 per barrel if there was real action.  </p><p> CINQUEGRANA:  Yes, we tried to put it an actual number on that, but yes, we  would certainly see a spike in triple digits would certainly not be out of  the question if something like that were to happen.  </p><p> QUEST:  The level of supply bearing in mind the recent OPEC conference  which agreed essentially to increase supply from Saudi and others.   Are we  at a position of where the glut is now starting to really push prices down?  </p><p> CINQUEGRANA:  I don't think we're reaching glut that is like we saw in 2016  and 2017, if you remember, Venezuela, their production is really  struggling.  Libya is on and off again with rises in production and then it  falls apart again.  Nigeria is always another question mark, so I don't  think we're really even close to approaching glut status once again like we  were just a couple of short years ago.  </p><p> QUEST:  Good to see you, sir.  Thank you.  I appreciate it.  Thank you.  </p><p> CINQUEGRANA:  Likewise.  </p><p> QUEST:  Chief Executive of JP Morgan is worried that Donald Trump's trade  wars could derail the U.S. economy.  Jamie Dimon spoke exclusively to CNN's  Christine Romans at an event for the bank's Entrepreneurs of Color Fund,  where he said the President was attacking the right problems in the wrong  way.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> JAMIE DIMON, CEO, JP MORGAN CHASE:  The way to look at trade, the President  has raised serious issues that are pretty accurate around China that need  to be fixed.  We want NAFTA done.  I think Mexico is a wonderful neighbor.   We want NAFTA done, and to be torturing Mexico this way and my opinion is  dead wrong and it should be fixed, we thought that what the President  should do is work with Mexico, work with Canada, do TPP, work with our  European allies and our Japanese allies and go to China with a common  front, not against them, but this is the way the modern world should deal  with trade or particularly around IP, state-owned enterprises and all of  these various issues.  </p><p> Now, we have a kind of a little bit of a trade war, trade skirmish -  however you want to define it with our allies and China, so if somehow, if  the President's team do a great job, maybe we'll have a great outcome, but  I would remind folks, the President's team has already said there would be  no retaliation.  They've already been wrong.  </p><p> If you do another $200 billion of tariffs in this national security about  cars, I think that you're getting pretty there close to having - reversing  some of the benefits that we've seen in the economy.  </p><p> CHRISTINE ROMANS, CNN HOST:  Trade adviser to the President in the White  House tell me with great confidence that the economy is so strong that this  is exactly the time for them to be addressing these issues with China and  with Europe and bringing back steel jobs.  Do you buy that, that it is so  strong this is ...  </p><p> DIMON:  No, I don't buy that, and I'd be a skeptic.  I think their argument  is after the fact.  I think you should do the right thing in trade whether  the economy is strong or not.  </p><p> ROMANS:  You once said of the President - of Trump, he's the President of  the United States, I believe he's the pilot flying our airplane.  I would  ask you, you support him because he is the President of the United States  obviously.  But is it clear what the flight path of this airplane?  Do you  see the strategy in where he is going here?  </p><p> DIMON:  I don't agree with all of the policy of the President.  I've  already spoken about trade and immigration, and so - but I still want to  get immigration done and if he was - if we can help get it done, we're  going to be there, so you can't take this up off the plane field.  </p><p> One of my daughters sent me a note about getting involved and that I  shouldn't be involved like that and she gave me a Martin Luther King quote,  and I called her up and said, \"Julia, sweetheart, you're right, but Martin  Luther King didn't think about the plane field.\"  He'd be calling the  President every time he can't defer this agenda, and so that's what  business does.  </p><p> I think it's a mistake to say this because business is trying to work with  government, that they're supporting every policy of the government.  That  just is not true.  </p><p> ROMANS:  Are you happy with the tax cuts overall?  I mean, there's a lot of  money flowing now when you look at the corporate - the quarterly earnings  reports.  A lot of stock buy backers, there's been some criticisms, which I  think you don't buy that the stock buybacks somehow are favoring companies  and the rich and the shareholder - the investor class and not the worker  class.  </p><p> DIMON:  We focus on the business taxes and they should be competitive.  I  think it's a really bad idea to say, \"I am willing to accept an  uncompetitive global tax system,\" and you think you're doing a good job for  America.  So, in the individual side, I might have done different things.   You need a competitive tax system for the future health of the economy of  the United States of America.  This is the most prosperous economy the  world has ever seen.  We need to make sure it's that way because it's good  for our people.  </p><p> A lot of companies came out and raised minimum wages, did some capital  expenditures, but the fact is, the benefit is cumulative over time, as  capital gets retained and redeployed, dividends and stock buybacks are  simply redeployment of capital to a better and higher use.  And so you  might get higher dividends and you might buy something with it.  Someone  else may reinvest it.  It might go to a venture capital.  It might go to  different things, but it needs to be reinvested.  You can't use it  yourself.  </p><p> [16:10:10]  </p><p> DIMON:  So, this is notion is somewhat - it's a bad thing.  It's a bad  idea.  And remember, our shareholders, 100 million individuals through  pension plans, they're also veterans, retirees, teachers, union folks that  we work hard to benefit our shareholders and that's a huge mass of society.   It's not like a few rich people.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> QUEST:  Jamie Dimon, now it was a choppy day on Wall Street.  Choppy day of  trade.  If you look at it, pretty much for most of the session, while  volume was low, the market was down and then you get this afternoon where  it was literally just bouncing around a couple of points up, a couple of  points down, and when all was said and done, the market is off 13 points -  just a fraction or so.  </p><p> Financials and tech shares saw the strongest gains.  Alphabet shares were  up five percent after hours.  Their earnings have just come out.  I shall  tease you liberally.  I say, we'll talk more about Alphabet shares in just  a moment.  </p><p> Iran got one tweet from President Trump.  Amazon and \"The Washington Post\"  got two.  Mr. Trump repeated his often made criticism, that Amazon pays too  little to use the U.S. Postal Service, which the President calls Amazon's  delivery boy.  Mr. Trump went on to accuse \"The Washington Post\" of being a  lobbyist for Amazon, that's owned by Jeff Bezos who owns the - the head of  Amazon, and attempting to shield Amazon from antitrust claims.  </p><p>Amazon's stock dipped when the market opened.  Shares have returned and  recovered.  They closed off less than 1 percent.  CNN's Jeff Zeleny with me  from the White House.  He's not letting up on Amazon, is he?  What's behind  this?  </p><p> JEFF ZELENY, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT:  He's not Richard.  I  mean, the question of what's behind it seems to be a question of ego, it  seems to be a question of personality.  President Trump clearly does not  see eye to eye with Jeff Bezos.  He clearly is trying to sort of wrap in a  business argument with his broader attack on the media, and of course, the  Washington Post covers this President aggressively as several news  organizations, but it's unclear if President Trump actually believes that  Jeff Bezos is directing sort of the stories and the editorial direction of  \"The Washington Post.\"  He is not.  In fact, he rarely is in the newsroom,  I am told.  He does not have a role in that.  </p><p> But the President clearly seizing on his broader fake news argument, if you  will, to try to tie into this antitrust argument and the Postal Service.   He's been talking again and again and again about how Amazon is essentially  responsible for the decline of the Postal Service, that simply is not true.  </p><p>Amazon of course gives them a lot of business.  You can discuss the  negotiated contract if Amazon should be paying a higher rate or not, but  they are certainly not to blame for that.  So, it was just more of the same  this morning, but interestingly, a lot of rants on Twitter, I think 17 or  so in the last 24 hours or so, Richard.  </p><p> QUEST:  And is there any indication that the attacks on Amazon will lead to  any action?  I mean, so far the President is on his own, but I don't hear  anybody in Congress saying that they need to actually tax (inaudible) -  it's a private contract between two parties, so I don't see any actual move  other than noise and bluster.  </p><p> ZELENY:  I think that's right.  We have not heard anyone else joining in  the criticism here.  Of course, if any cities across the country including  here in Washington, D.C., the local authorities - Republicans and Democrats  both sides are eager for Amazon to look for and build its second  headquarters in their cities, so Amazon comes with a lot of jobs in the  supply chain, other matters here.  </p><p> So President Trump is criticizing it.  I do not hear a lot of that echoing  up on Capitol Hill and as for what it means in terms of antitrust policies  and laws, it's hard to say, I mean, from a regulatory standpoint.  It could  have some effect, but so far, it does not appear that it has.  </p><p> QUEST:  Jeff Zeleny is at the White House and we thank you.  Good to see  you, sir.  </p><p> ZELENY:  Sure.  </p><p> QUEST:  As we continue tonight, we get to business on the move where  RyanAir, Alphabet and Hasbro, the prices have all been moving and we will  tell you exactly why.  After the break, it's \"Quest Means Business\" live in  New York.  </p><p> [16:15:00]  </p><p> QUEST:  RyanAir, the largest airline in Europe saw their profits sink some  20 percent.  The reasons were soaring staff costs.  Now, as for the Chief  Executive, Michael O'Leary, he is worried - he is always worried about  something.  He is worried about Brexit and the fears of a hard Brexit,  which he says are underestimated.  </p><p> A different toy story - oh come on, that was good - for Hasbro, makers of  the Nerf gun, well, the Nerf gun be testament and if you look underneath  it, you'll see things like, more of a recovered ground, plus the Toys R' Us  bankruptcy.  As with this, my favorite, Twister shares soared as a result  of that with some 14 percent and Hasbro 1.2 percent.  Alphabet has much to  celebrate.  The earnings beat expectations, the revenue is up 26 percent.   The stock is up in after-hours trading.  We'll talk more about it as we  have business on the move.  </p><p> Joining me to put this into perspective, Paul La Monica.  Good to see you.  </p><p> PAUL LA MONICA, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Good to see you, sir.  </p><p> QUEST:  These Alphabet results, what actually did they show?  </p><p> LA MONICA:  They showed that Google owner Alphabet continues to dominate  online search and online advertising.  Revenues were up 26 percent per a  year ago, strong growth and profits.  They did break out what the numbers  were including the big E.U. fine that they are appealing.  They still have  a $3.2 billion profit even with the fine, without that fine, it's $8.3  billion earnings beat estimates.  This is a company that now has $102.25  billion in cash balance sheet ...  </p><p> QUEST:  How much?  </p><p> LA MONICA:  $102.25 billion in cash on the balance sheet.  Of course,  that's still less than half of what Apple has, but it's by no means any  less potatoes.  </p><p> QUEST:  A $102 billion in cash.  </p><p> LA MONICA:  All of these big tech companies have these hug war chests right  now.  Google, Alphabet - well, they are the same - Apple, Microsoft - all  of them, even Facebook and Amazon are building lots of cash.  </p><p> QUEST:  But what you do with it because I mean, I suppose you do have to be  biting especially remember, Facebook paid $17 billion for what's happened  ...  </p><p> LA MONICA:  Yes, we have seen companies buying things.  They are spending  more on R&amp;D.  </p><p> QUEST:  What's the weak point in the earnings so far?  I mean, I realize  you've only had 10 minutes to look at them, but what's the weak point do  you think?  </p><p> LA MONICA:  I didn't see anything particularly troublesome at first blush.   I think that one of the biggest criticisms with Google will continue to be  that they are spending a lot of money on these businesses that may never  yield any profits, that's part of the bigger Alphabet division, the things  like having internet access via balloons and things of that nature.  </p><p> QUEST:  Right, but this - the other projects.  I mean, how much of Alphabet  is Google and how much of Google's revenues and the significance of the  company is the rest?  </p><p> LA MONICA:  This is still a company that's dominated by, not just search  anymore because YouTube is increasingly an important part of the picture as  well, but the other bets division of Google is still a tiny fraction of the  overall company.  </p><p> [16:20:11]  </p><p> QUEST:  Let's turn to Tesla.  Tesla had a difficult day and once again,  it's arguably the result of their own misfortune in terms of comments.   Look at the price cost of 3 percent today.  </p><p> LA MONICA:  Yes, Tesla, I think really is facing this problem right now of  when are they ever going to be profitable?  Are they ever going to be like  a mature Detroit, if you will or some of the big auto companies in Tokyo,  in Germany, people want this company to generate profits on a consistent  basis and you have Elon Musk asking suppliers reportedly for - to get some  money back to help them out with profitability.  That's not exactly the  sign of a healthy company.  </p><p> QUEST:  But when I was talking to one particular broker, who was talking  about their view on the stock price, they have the stock price down in a  160 or something by the end of the year or middle of next year, so the  downward pressure if the market believes that that 303 is unsustainable or  anything like it?  </p><p> LA MONICA:  I think it's going to be very difficult to try and figure out  what is a fair value for Tesla because you can't look at it like a GM, a  Ford, a Toyota and any other major auto company.  </p><p> QUEST:  But they are the competitors.  </p><p> LA MONICA:  Right, they are the competitors.  I mean, you have to compare  them, too in terms of vehicles sold, but because of the fact that it's a  much higher growth or expected to be higher growth someday type of company,  people aren't valuing it on a pure earnings or revenue basis the way they  are with these other large auto companies.  </p><p> QUEST:  We've got more results this week, haven't we?  </p><p> LA MONICA:  We have a lot of them.  You're going to be busy on the  staircase if that still exists.  </p><p> QUEST:  Have you heard that it's not?  </p><p> LA MONICA:  Oh my gosh, I saw the little conveyor belt, but the staircase  is gone.  </p><p> QUEST:  No.  Thank you, Paul La Monica.  </p><p> LA MONICA:  My apologies.  </p><p> QUEST:  \"Future Forward.\"  A Chinese city is signing a deal for U.S.  Hyperloop train system.  The trains will be built in Tongren City in the  Guizhou province.  The plan is to speed it up to a thousand kilometers an  hour.  </p><p> Earlier on \"QUEST EXPRESS\" at the stock exchange, the CEO of Hyperloop said  China could make it happen faster than other countries can.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)  </p><p> DIRK AHLBORN, CEO, HYPERLOOP TRANSPORTATION TECHNOLOGIES:  We are able to  build and operate much cheaper than high speed rail for example.  So, all  of our feasibility studies so far have shown roughly construction cost from  $20 million to $30 million per kilometer, but we estimate that in China, we  actually might be able to build it much cheaper.  </p><p> QUEST:  The one big problem is, I mean, the theory is good, and the limited  practical examples that have been built so far seem to be good, but there's  no full scale up and running project and I'm wondering, China is taking a  risk in deciding to build this?  </p><p> AHLBORN:  No actually, we are now in the commercialization phase, so we are  building a full scale prototype interlude in France, all the tests so far  have been done, but you need to really build a full sized system to really  make everything work.  I mean, the technology is not really the hurdle.   The technologies have been working for quite some time.  There is - it's  more an integration issue, right?  </p><p> So, you have to bring all of these technologies together and make them work  in a perfect way.  </p><p> QUEST:  Right, what's fascinating is that it is China that is taking the  risk here.  Once again, it is China that is being forward looking and  saying, \"Look, this might work.  It might solve a very real problem.\"  This  is different, too in many places in the West, which is tinkering with  Hyperloop, but nobody is committed.  </p><p> AHLBORN:  Well, we actually do have some other commercial projects already,  so we are working with the Emirates and Abu Dhabi.  The Ukrainian  government has some attempt to build a commercial system and now, China of  course is a very big player.  China is a leader when it comes to high speed  rails.  They have the highest spending when it comes to infrastructure and  they have problems, right?  The cities are overflowing, so we need to solve  those issues.  </p><p> QUEST:  When do you think this will be up and running?  Give me - I won't  hold you to it, sir.  I won't hold you to it, I promise you, but give me a  rough idea of when I might put my bum on a seat?  </p><p> AHLBORN:  China is always very aggressive, so our time estimates are a  little bit more conservative.  We estimate that roughly within three years,  we should be able to go and ride in the first Hyperloop together on the  first 10 kilometers.  But, our Chinese colleagues are very aggressive and  believes that they can do it much faster.  </p><p> (END VIDEO TAPE)  </p><p> QUEST:  And he almost promised me a seat on that first one, but I shall  hold him to that.  Well, because if I am going along, you're going along as  well.  </p><p> [16:25:05]  </p><p> QUEST:  As we continue tonight, on top of the day's business headlines, in  just 90 seconds, try our Daily Briefing podcast, updated twice a day before  and after the bell rings on Wall Street and you can just Alexa or your  Google Home Device.  CNNMoney/briefing and if you're being polite, you'll  say \"Please, Alexa.\"  </p><p> As we continue, it's a hard act to follow, Fiat puts a new man at the helm  or behind the wheel as illness is forcing Sergio Marchionne to step down as  Chief Executive.  </p><p> Hello, I'm Richard Quest.  There's more QUEST MEANS BUSINESS in just a  moment.  The Chief Executive of Fiat has some serious and difficult tasks  ahead and already has to fill top jobs that people had left.  There's  double trouble for British steel companies.  We're going to take you to the  heart of England's steel industry, and as we continue tonight, you are  watching CNN and on this network, the facts always come first.  </p><p> The White House is defending President Trump's Sunday night Twitter attack  against Iran calling it consistent with his previous comments.  Mr. Trump  declared that if Iran threatens the U.S. again, it will suffer consequences  which in his words, \"few throughout history have ever suffered.\"  </p><p> Police say the man suspected of shooting 14 people in a popular area of  Toronto on Sunday was 29 years old and a native of the city.  He exchanged  gun fire with officers before fleeing and took a bullet, but it's not clear  if that's what killed him.  An autopsy is scheduled for the coming days,  and the gunman killed two people and wounded 13.  </p><p> The U.K. government says it would not object if two British members of an  ISIS cell were executed in the United States.  The two men are believed to  be responsible for beheading hostages in Iraq and Syria.  </p><p> [16:30:00] While the U.K. government typically does not cooperate with  foreign governments where the death penalty is on the table, it says, it  will share information with the U.S. in this case.  </p><p> The German football star Mesut Ozil is stepping down from his country's  national team  and raving racism and disrespect, and he says he's been  subjected to on account of his Turkish heritage.</p><p> A spokeswoman for German Chancellor Angela Merkel said his decision has to  be respected.  Four men have been arrested in connection with a suspected  acid attack on a three-year-old boy in the English city of Worcester.  The  toddler suffered serious burns on his face and arms. </p><p> Police have detained three men in London after they arrested the third on  Sunday.  They say it's not clear why the boy was attacked.  The leadership  crisis at Fiat-Chrysler after the chief executive was forced to step down  over the weekend.</p><p> Now, in New York, the shares of Fiat-Chrysler closed lower to stuff, nearly  2 percent following two resignations.  First of all, Sergio Marchionne who  quit after 14 years at the helm -- declining serious grave health issues.  </p><p> And the head of the Jeep division is now running the company, Mike Manley  has to replace both himself and also the head of Fiat-Chrysler Europe who  quit this morning.  Rebecca Lindland is the executive analyst at Kelley  Blue Book who joins me from Stamford, Connecticut. </p><p> Good to see you as always.  We do need to pass this quite carefully.  First  of all, let's begin with Marchionne and I mean, it's very said that we have  to talk in such terms, but the understanding is that we're talking about  grave illness.</p><p> REBECCA LINDLAND, EXECUTIVE ANALYST, KELLEY BLUE BOOK:  Yes, we are and  that it's important that the listeners understand the viewership understand  that he was basically forced to resign because he became gravely ill on  Friday evening.</p><p> And Saturday, the board met and really kind of de facto, put him into a  position where they know he cannot return to the company.  But my  understanding is that he is gravely ill in a hospital in Zurich,  Switzerland.  So they've asked Mike Manley to take over. </p><p> As you said, he has been running Jeep really very masterfully and also Ram  Pickup trucks.</p><p> QUEST:  So -- </p><p> LINDLAND:  So he's well positioned. </p><p> QUEST:  Has he taken over -- I mean, obviously Marchionne is not coming  back in that sense to the job -- </p><p> LINDLAND:  Right -- </p><p> QUEST:  But has Manley been given the job or is he taking it on a temporary  basis whiles the search is underway.</p><p> LINDLAND:  Initially, there was some confusion about whether this was just  an interim position, but now we've read that he is now given the position  and they are not conducting a search.</p><p> Manley was one of the top three contenders for this position, and so I --  but the transition was supposed to happen in April of 2019 -- </p><p> QUEST:  Right -- </p><p> LINDLAND:  Which is why there was already a plan in place.  </p><p> QUEST:  The decision of the head of Europe to go, we're hearing this  because he didn't get the top job.  If -- </p><p> LINDLAND:  Right -- </p><p> QUEST:  I mean -- look, that's not unique, that does happen -- </p><p> LINDLAND:  Yes -- </p><p> QUEST:  When people don't get the top job, it affects -- </p><p> LINDLAND:  Yes -- </p><p> QUEST:  But I can't help feeling, there's a sour taste here that he's gone  so quickly at a time when the company is in crisis.  He could at least wait  to a couple of weeks and to help the new man out.</p><p> LINDLAND:  This is why I love being on with you, Richard, because that was  exactly my thought.  It's a bit egregious I think -- </p><p> QUEST:  Yes -- </p><p> LINDLAND:  Because of the circumstances with which Manley has been  assigned.  This is -- this is a total shock, Marchionne, you know, was in  relatively good health, he had shoulder surgery a couple of weeks ago and  then had very massive grave complications.</p><p> So I agree with you, I was very -- it didn't sit well with me really, that  Otto Vitter(ph) would just resign like this.  It's not unusual, but I  thought it would have been a professional great -- professional  gracefulness -- </p><p> QUEST:  Yes -- </p><p> LINDLAND:  If he had stayed.</p><p> QUEST:  And -- </p><p> LINDLAND:  Yes -- </p><p> QUEST:  Now, let's talk about -- so Manley has to appease himself and head  of Jeep -- </p><p> LINDLAND:  Yes -- </p><p> QUEST:  And he has to replace -- </p><p> LINDLAND:  Yes -- </p><p> QUEST:  The head of Europe.  But he's been at the top of the company for  some time.  So one is not expecting strategic change of direction, are we? </p><p> LINDLAND:  You know, I don't think so.  You know, somebody asked me  recently if we thought that they were going to tear up the five-year plan  that was revealed in Italy at the beginning of June where I was there to  hear it.</p><p> [16:35:00] I don't anticipate Manley making those kinds of changes.  He is  very much a loyal lieutenant to Marchionne, and what he really needs to do  is execute on Marchionne's plan.  He was very integral there, he was right  up there with Marchionne, John Elkann also the head of the company. </p><p> So I think that Manley -- </p><p> QUEST:  Right -- </p><p> LINDLAND:  Faced, a reputation precedes him. </p><p> QUEST:  Finally, let's talk about the Elkann family, I once interviewed  John Elkann many years ago in Italy.  Do they still play much of a role?  Are they still involved on a daily basis? </p><p> LINDLAND:  Well, John Elkann is -- I -- they -- you know, when you have a  leader as dynamic and strong and successful as Marchionne, you're going to  let him run.  So I think that maybe we'll see a little bit more involvement  as they reassign.  </p><p> Keep in mind, Tudor(ph) and Marchionne had five or six other titles within  the family of foundation.  So they've assigned -- they've now had to put  different CEOs in place at each of these different levels -- </p><p> QUEST:  Right -- </p><p> LINDLAND:  In different companies.  So I think that he will be involved  during this transition.</p><p> QUEST:  Good to see you as always from Stamford, Connecticut, thank you for  joining us.  </p><p> LINDLAND:  Likewise, thanks.  </p><p> QUEST:  Now, as we continue, it started with a picture of a German football  star with a Turkish president and it then ends with Mesut Ozil also  quitting his country's team in disgust and the sponsors are left to deal  with the fallout.  We'll be back. </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> QUEST:  Mesut Ozil is quitting the German national team over the response  to this photograph of the Turkish president, and says his sponsors bear  some of the blame.  Now, Ozil's announcement on Twitter had an entire  section devoted just to sponsors.</p><p> This is the recent Mercedes campaign featuring him, they are a major  sponsor of the German national team.  But in his open letter, Ozil accused  an unnamed sponsor of dropping him from their promotions and seem to bring  up (INAUDIBLE). </p><p> He said it hurts me they would do so.  He said, \"for them, it was no longer  good to be seen with me and called the situation crisis management.  This  is all ironic because a German ministry declared their products have a  legal and authorized software devices in them.</p><p> And I'm writing, thinking this is worse than a picture with a president of  my family's country.  As I said before, partners should stick with you in  all situations.\" </p><p> [16:40:00] The company is Mercedes, Mercedes Benz, and he says the company  is looking into the claims, but at the same time, Ozil praises Adidas  sponsors for being loyal.  Today, Adidas said it regrets that he is  quitting the German team. </p><p> Isn't it strange story, the size and range that he would quit in such a way  over a picture with President Erdogan and then lambast in such a way.   Kevin Kelly is co-president of the BigBuzz marketing group and joins me  now.</p><p> And it is a strange story, isn't it? </p><p> KEVIN KELLY, PRESIDENT AND CHIEF GROWTH OFFICER, BIGBUZZ MARKETING GROUP:   Absolutely.</p><p> QUEST:  I mean, the reason why he's gone, the decision just to uptick in  such a way. </p><p> KELLY:  It's disappointing in the brands, isn't it? You know, I think that  it's so often they fall into a crisis management posture, right? It really  is an opportunity for them to show their colors, stick to their values. </p><p> And the problem with so many brands is that they don't really know where  their values lie.  They're following the money and most of their actions  are dictated.</p><p> QUEST:  So let's go through this bit by bit.  First of all, the picture of  him with the President Erdogan which is his father -- I mean -- </p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> Meet the president of a country anyway.  Whatever all may think of his  politics -- </p><p> KELLY:  Exactly, yes.  </p><p> QUEST:  He's still the president of Turkey.  But what happens after that,  he's complaining he didn't get support from his sponsors.  What was he  hoping for? </p><p> KELLY:  I think he was hoping for some loyalty, right? So I think that what  we've seen from Adidas and from his other brands that have stuck by him is  what you want to see.</p><p> They have done their due diligence, they know who he is, right? And you  know, these athletes are passionate, right? And so they will stick to their  values, it was nice to see that he did, and he made a choice that was -- </p><p> QUEST:  Sure -- </p><p> KELLY:  A very difficult one. </p><p> QUEST:  He comes up feeling again with this one, it's such the lower end of  anything that's gone wrong.  That the -- </p><p> KELLY:  Right -- </p><p> QUEST:  All he has is a picture with the president of a country that -- </p><p> KELLY:  He didn't sleep with the wrong person --       </p><p> QUEST:  Yes, he didn't sleep with the wrong person, there's no scandal  involved.  He's got a picture of himself with a president of a country that  his family comes from.  And out of this, so from the sponsors point of  view, you're Mercedes, what are you thinking tonight? </p><p> KELLY:  Oh, I'm rethinking if I'm Mercedes, right? I'm thinking that  something we talk about emphasis all the time, discouraging, creativity,  they've shown no courage, they need to find a way to re-evaluate and show  some courage and find a way to support him. </p><p> QUEST:  Yes, what does support him mean? And there's something of a -- this  is why I'm having difficulty in this thing -- </p><p> (COUGHING) </p><p> Excuse me, there's one criticism for this picture, but what does supporting  mean? Coming out and making a statement, putting out a press release -- </p><p> KELLY:  Greatest thing they could do, in all these situations, what we've  done is we failed to look at the details, right? We react to something that  looks seemingly offensive, right? But the reality was it's some country.</p><p> It's something that he thought strongly about to support his family.  So if  I'm Mercedes, I'm going to say -- I'm going to look deeper into what he's  doing and support those things.</p><p> QUEST:  We've seen -- </p><p> KELLY:  Education, child support, right? Paying for life-changing -- what  was the quote? Life-changing surgeries for kids in Russia.</p><p> QUEST:  We see this in this country with the NFL, the kneeling and the  whole question of sponsors for -- I mean -- </p><p> KELLY:  Great example -- </p><p> QUEST:  We can -- we can be (INAUDIBLE) and say sports and politics and  sporting controversy should not mix.  But that is just naive. </p><p> KELLY:  It is right? What pays for that football game to be on -- the NFL  television, \"Nbc\" and all these networks, right? These players are so  passionate, you've got to understand, right? This person earns his way onto  the field, he earned his way onto the team and he's earned his way onto all  of your screens.</p><p> So one guy said, hey, I have an opportunity to have my voice heard.  And I  will say also that not one person who raised their fist or kneeled down on  the field ever meant any disrespect to the military. </p><p> I think it's -- again, it's a matter of we haven't taken time to look at  the details of the situation.</p><p> QUEST:  Good to see you, sir.</p><p> KELLY:  Thanks so much -- </p><p> QUEST:  I deeply appreciate it -- </p><p> KELLY:  My pleasure -- </p><p> QUEST:  Thank you.  As we continue tonight, the U.K. foreign secretary says  Britain could crush out of the single market by accident.  And claims  Britain would blame the E.U. for years to come.  </p><p> [16:45:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> QUEST:  Britain's new foreign secretary says the European Union needs to  change tactics while there's a risk the U.K. will leave the E.U. without a  deal.  Now speaking of his first day overseas trip after taking over from  Boris Johnson, when Jeremy Hunt said a hard Brexit would hurt the British  economy and the U.K. public would blame Brussels for the damage.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> JEREMY HUNT, FOREIGN SECRETARY, BRITAIN:  And without a real change in  approach from the E.U. negotiators, we do not face a real risk of no deal  by accident.  And that would be incredibly challenging economically. </p><p> My real concern is so that it would change British public attitudes to  Europe for a generation.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> QUEST:  Few areas would feel the effects of a hard Brexit as it's known,  more than Britain's industrial heartland where decades of decline have  already pushed many of its once thriving businesses at the edge of  extinction.</p><p> Steel makers though are finding themselves uniquely caught between a trade  war with the U.S. and Brexit uncertainty in Europe.  Cnn's Anna Stewart has  sent us this report from western England. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) </p><p> ANNA STEWART, CNN  CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Heat, crush and mould it.   This is high grade steel and that's heading to the United States and the  E.U..  Peter Davies' own steel work employing around 200 people. </p><p> PETER DAVIES, OWNER, ORIGINAL STEEL SERVICES:  Steel is the basic commodity  that drives the west midlands.  </p><p> STEWART:  Once the beating heart of industrial Britain, now this region is  caught between a rock and a hard place, Brexit and U.S. tariffs.  The  uncertainty putting hundreds of thousands of dollars in new investment on  hold. </p><p> DAVIES:  For the first time, I think in my life, I am genuinely worried.   If you're a multinational or you've got billions at the bank, then it's  fine.  You can ride all these things, but we haven't.  We live day-to-day. </p><p> STEWART:  The steel he sells to America is highly specialized, used in  railroads and mining equipments, it's not subject to tariffs yet.  But he  worries his factories could become collateral damage in President Trump's  trade war.</p><p> DAVIES:  This is an e-mail from one of our major American customer asking  what the impact will be on the steel tariffs.</p><p> STEWART:  Davies says the two sides should negotiate instead of retaliating  further.</p><p> DAVIES:  They are literally like kids, you know, I'm going to slap this --  I'm taking the whole -- you can have my back.  The problem is that this is  real people, real jobs. </p><p> STEWART:  And many of the workers here, it's the only job they've ever  known.  They sympathize with tariffs to protect those who are in the  industry.  Cheap steel from China and automation have forced hundreds of  small factories to close in recent years.</p><p> [16:50:00] Many voted for Brexit for the same reason.  Andrew Rich; the  operations director is one of them. </p><p> ANDREW RICH, OPERATIONS DIRECTOR, BROMFORD IRON &amp; STEEL:  When I look  around me, the decision is typically worse -- </p><p> STEWART:  But are you worried now the E.U., this is quite damaging for this  industry especially your boss. </p><p> RICH:  Yes, I am, I'm not sure what's going to happen after the Brexit,  we'll find out about -- we need some certainty. </p><p> STEWART:  And yet, he says he wouldn't change his vote. </p><p> DAVIES:  A lot of them are sort of Sanguine, it will be a ripe, they don't  roll over in the middle of the night, thinking, oh, my God, where am I -- </p><p> STEWART (on camera):  And that there's no job -- </p><p> DAVIES:  That's my job, that's my job, you know, I'm paid to worry.</p><p> STEWART:  His company source for steel from Germany, and if the U.K.  crushes out of the E.U. without a deal, his cost could spike.  What will  that mean for your business? </p><p> DAVIES:  It could mean closure.  We would probably lose up to 50 or 60  percent of our market, and that would be devastating. </p><p> STEWART (voice-over):  Until then, workers here can only hope that  politicians keep hammering away at a deal.  Anna Stewart, Cnn, West  Bromwich, U.K.</p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE) </p><p> QUEST:  Now, of course, nothing to do with the west of England is in the  midlands as I said.  The head of U.K. steel for the EEF industry groups  says jobs losses from this combination of trade tariffs and then Brexit  uncertainty could make the industry unsustainable.  </p><p> Speaking to Bianna earlier, Gareth Stace said steel makers are already  seeing the effects on their balanced sheets and it could get a whole lot  worse. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> GARETH STACE, DIRECTOR OF U.K. STEEL:  From what we've seen with the 25  percent tariff tax slapped on all of the vast steel is that we've seen some  jobs canceled in terms of orders that were on the water. </p><p> We've also seen some American customers of the U.K. Steel sector where  they've just had to pay that tariff.  But this is the short-term reaction,  but the longer term reaction is going to be -- that we're going to see a  damage to this market for us.</p><p> Which is our second biggest export market after the E.U.  It's some $500  million worth in 2017.  So anything that puts that risk is going to have a  significant impact on our sector.</p><p> BIANNA GOLODRYGA, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, 10 percent of your steel is  actually sent to the U.S.  You mentioned having 25 million tons of steel  needing to find a new home.  What is doing -- what is being done now to  avoid a glut of steel in the U.K. as we have seen just a couple of years  ago.</p><p> STACE:  Well, as soon as we now knew that President Trump was going to slap  this tax on our steel, we looked to the European Commission in Brussels to  take swift, firm and effective action. </p><p> What they've done and we've seen that coming later this week is what's  called safeguard measures.  And that actually limits the amounts of steel  that can come in globally onto the U.K. -- sorry on to the E.U. market.</p><p> And that will limit that surge, anticipate its surge of steel that will now  go to the U.S. market that needs to find a new home to go to.  </p><p> So we're very pleased that the European Commission has taken that swift  action, because if it didn't, we'd have a double one(ph), not only do we  have a tax slapped on our steel that goes to the U.S., but we also see our  market just flooded with steel, the price would go down and we would find  that there were jobs at risk in our sector in the U.K. like we saw in 2015,  2016 which was the worst steel crisis in the U.K. steel sector and well  over a generation.</p><p> GOLODRYGA:  And there's real consequences obviously first and foremost  jobs.  Talk about the number of jobs in the U.K. alone that are dependent  on this production and if in fact you do go back to the 2016 levels, the  crisis that you've seen there.  What kind of impact will that have, not  only on jobs, but the economy as a whole? </p><p> STACY:  Well, in 2015 and 2016, we lost 5,000 to 6,000 jobs in our sector.   Let me put that into context.  We employ currently today, about 31,000  people directly in the steel sector, and you multiply that by four or five  times in terms of indirect jobs. </p><p> So we lost a significant proportion.  You know, if we were to lose the  similar proportion, we would then potentially become unsustainable sector  in the U.K., and that could lead to severe problems and we don't want to go  there.</p><p> Because actually, you know, the future really for the steel sector in the  U.K., in Europe and actually globally should have a brighter future than we  see at the moment.</p><p> GOLODRYGA:  Tell me, what is a bigger concern right now, the 25 percent  steel tariffs coming in from your number two export being the U.S. or  Brexit negotiations? </p><p> STACY:  Well, I think the tariffs, the 25 percent tariff is an immediate  and short-term concern.  You know, I'd like to think we can find some  resolution there.  </p><p> [16:55:00] I was hoping that when President Trump came over to London and  Scotland last weekend, that he would bring a gift with him and that gift  would be that he would exempt the U.K. from the tariffs, that didn't  happen.</p><p> But the Brexit concern is such an unknown, it's unprecedented as you've  said before.  We've never seen -- we've never seen this in the last 40  years, we don't know what it's like to be out of Europe.  And therefore,  it's just totally unknown territory. </p><p> And that's why it's very concerned for all businesses lesser than the steel  sector, because we thrive on free trade in the global steel sector, and if  we limited that in any way in the U.K., we'd have problems going forward.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> QUEST:  As we head towards the top of the hour, and let's just remind  ourselves how the European markets traded, where they all went down pretty  much across the section.  Not huge losses, the worst was being in Milan  with the MTA which was off nearly 1 percent.  </p><p> The Italian shares were pulled down of course, fairly obvious by Fiat- Chrysler which is a major part of the market.  And the Dow, what a day for  the Dow, strange sort of day.  Down but -- and then happened, the movements  were very small, and as a result we are off just a fraction and the tad(ph)  still holding on of course to 25,000. </p><p> As we continue, I will have our profitable moment after the break. </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> QUEST:  Tonight's profitable moment, so the U.K. foreign secretary has  spoken the truth, I dare not speak his name, that they could crush out of - - the U.K. could crush out of the E.U. without a deal and there will be  dire consequences as a result. </p><p> Nothing new about that, nothing startling about it.  What's interesting is  that he said it and he's put it on the table which is why when Theresa May  and her cabinet now go around Europe trying to sell the Chequers agreement,  it becomes so crucial. </p><p> At some point, these other countries are going to have to say to the  commission, either block the U.K. in the eye and let them go without a deal  or we're going to have to make some movement in terms of the single market,  we're going to have to give them something. </p><p> Now, I do not know how this is going to play out, but I do know time is  tight(ph) towards October.  And what's even more significant is the reality  that if there's no deal, it would be pretty disastrous for all concerned.   Never let you say you haven't been warned.</p><p> And that's QUEST MEANS BUSINESS for tonight, I am Richard Quest in New  York.  Whatever you're up to in the hours ahead, I hope it's profitable,  we'll do it again tomorrow. </p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and programming copyright 2018 Cable News Network, Inc.

Dow Jones Industrials very little change over the course of the late afternoon sessions, just about even Stevens and we'll show you the numbers to see exactly what I mean. A lot of your banks ringing, one, two, three - that was a bit of a wimpy gavel, trading is now over, start of a new week, it is Monday, it's July 23rd.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Tonight, oil markets on alert. Donald Trump warns Iran of consequences like never before. A leadership crisis at Fiat-Chrysler. Another boss quits as the Chief Executive remains gravely ill. And Mesut Ozil slams his sponsors for not sticking by him when things get tough.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I'm Richard Quest, live in the world's financial capital, which is rather a misty financial capital, rainy and misty, but fear not, we will still be heading course, I'm Richard Quest, in New York where I mean business.</p><p>A very busy hour ahead for us. As you'll hear our exclusive interview with Jamie Dimon and why he thinks the White House got it all wrong on China. We're also going to have earnings from Google's parent company any minute now, and we'll take you inside the British steel mills facing threats on multiple fronts, a squeeze by tariffs on one side and Brexit on the other.</p><p>We begin tonight now of course with the fire and fury over oil. Moments ago, President Trump told reporters he has no concerns about provoking Iran. The war of words between the President and the President of Iran has caused alarm on oil markets. Now, there was a spike, not a huge one, but there was a spike in prices to $74.50 on Brent blend. By Monday morning though prices have moved back as investors turned their attention to the problems of oversupply in the market.</p><p>The movements started after the President sent his all caps tweet to his rival, President Rouhani, \"Never ever threaten the United States again or you will suffer consequences, the likes of which few throughout history have ever suffered before. We are no longer a country that will stand for your demented words of violence and death. Be cautious.\" The President - the U.S. President that is, was reacting to this threat from President Rouhani.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HASSAN ROUHANI, PRESIDENT OF IRAN (Through a translator.): Don't play with the lion's tail. This will only lead to regret. You will forever regret it. We have been the guarantor of the regional waterways security throughout history. Remember, we established the security of oil shipping routes in history. Don't forget this.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: Now, the oil shipping route in question is the Straits of Hormuz. It is the oil world's most important chokepoint and if you join me over at sub screen, you'll see exactly what I mean. Here you have the strait - it's a strait, not straits - Strait of Hormuz from the Persian Gulf out towards the Gulf of Oman, and you see it here, to Oman down to Iran and the UAE.</p><p>It links the gulf with the Arabian Sea and one third of oil tanker traffic goes through it. That is 18.5 million barrels a day. Now, there is nothing new about the strategic importance of the Strait of Hormuz. I mean, if you go back to the 50's, 60's and 70's, it was well known of course, the importance of this particular area, but closing it off or any form of dislocation or disruption, well that's a different matter, because now, you are choking off Asia's biggest economies - China, of course, Japan, India, South Korea, and Singapore - all receive their oil through the Strait of Hormuz.</p><p>You'll see exactly what I mean. If you think about it, it comes from here, it comes out through the Strait of Hormuz, goes out and then across over towards Asia.</p><p>Denton Cinquegrana is the chief oil analyst of the Oil Price Information Service (OPIS), and he joins me now via Skype. The issue of course is very clear. We see from our graph and our map, the strategic importance, so why wasn't there a greater reaction in the market today as a result of the threats?</p><p>DENTON CINQUEGRANA, CHIEF OIL ANALYST, OIL PRICE INFORMATION SERVICE: Big question because I was expecting a much higher response as well. Market turned around, it went lower today actually as you illustrated before. A lot of talk about more supply coming from the - to market from places like Saudi Arabia. So, Saudi Arabia and Russia. U.S. production has reached 11 million barrels a day. The dollar was a little bit stronger, too. So, there's that correlation when you have a stronger dollar, oil tends to drop and vice versa.</p><p>[16:05:10]</p><p>CINQUEGRANA: So, you had a couple of other things - the trade war stuff that remains a concern. Possible currency wars, but the rhetoric is certainly being ramped up.</p><p>QUEST: Now, would you agree with me that if the Strait of Hormuz did actually in some shape or form get blocked or there was some form of dislocation, away from threats, but real action, then we're in a different league. Then, we're into $150.00 maybe $200.00. I see some people have even been talking of $200.00 per barrel if there was real action.</p><p>CINQUEGRANA: Yes, we tried to put it an actual number on that, but yes, we would certainly see a spike in triple digits would certainly not be out of the question if something like that were to happen.</p><p>QUEST: The level of supply bearing in mind the recent OPEC conference which agreed essentially to increase supply from Saudi and others. Are we at a position of where the glut is now starting to really push prices down?</p><p>CINQUEGRANA: I don't think we're reaching glut that is like we saw in 2016 and 2017, if you remember, Venezuela, their production is really struggling. Libya is on and off again with rises in production and then it falls apart again. Nigeria is always another question mark, so I don't think we're really even close to approaching glut status once again like we were just a couple of short years ago.</p><p>QUEST: Good to see you, sir. Thank you. I appreciate it. Thank you.</p><p>CINQUEGRANA: Likewise.</p><p>QUEST: Chief Executive of JP Morgan is worried that Donald Trump's trade wars could derail the U.S. economy. Jamie Dimon spoke exclusively to CNN's Christine Romans at an event for the bank's Entrepreneurs of Color Fund, where he said the President was attacking the right problems in the wrong way.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JAMIE DIMON, CEO, JP MORGAN CHASE: The way to look at trade, the President has raised serious issues that are pretty accurate around China that need to be fixed. We want NAFTA done. I think Mexico is a wonderful neighbor. We want NAFTA done, and to be torturing Mexico this way and my opinion is dead wrong and it should be fixed, we thought that what the President should do is work with Mexico, work with Canada, do TPP, work with our European allies and our Japanese allies and go to China with a common front, not against them, but this is the way the modern world should deal with trade or particularly around IP, state-owned enterprises and all of these various issues.</p><p>Now, we have a kind of a little bit of a trade war, trade skirmish - however you want to define it with our allies and China, so if somehow, if the President's team do a great job, maybe we'll have a great outcome, but I would remind folks, the President's team has already said there would be no retaliation. They've already been wrong.</p><p>If you do another $200 billion of tariffs in this national security about cars, I think that you're getting pretty there close to having - reversing some of the benefits that we've seen in the economy.</p><p>CHRISTINE ROMANS, CNN HOST: Trade adviser to the President in the White House tell me with great confidence that the economy is so strong that this is exactly the time for them to be addressing these issues with China and with Europe and bringing back steel jobs. Do you buy that, that it is so strong this is ...</p><p>DIMON: No, I don't buy that, and I'd be a skeptic. I think their argument is after the fact. I think you should do the right thing in trade whether the economy is strong or not.</p><p>ROMANS: You once said of the President - of Trump, he's the President of the United States, I believe he's the pilot flying our airplane. I would ask you, you support him because he is the President of the United States obviously. But is it clear what the flight path of this airplane? Do you see the strategy in where he is going here?</p><p>DIMON: I don't agree with all of the policy of the President. I've already spoken about trade and immigration, and so - but I still want to get immigration done and if he was - if we can help get it done, we're going to be there, so you can't take this up off the plane field.</p><p>One of my daughters sent me a note about getting involved and that I shouldn't be involved like that and she gave me a Martin Luther King quote, and I called her up and said, \"Julia, sweetheart, you're right, but Martin Luther King didn't think about the plane field.\" He'd be calling the President every time he can't defer this agenda, and so that's what business does.</p><p>I think it's a mistake to say this because business is trying to work with government, that they're supporting every policy of the government. That just is not true.</p><p>ROMANS: Are you happy with the tax cuts overall? I mean, there's a lot of money flowing now when you look at the corporate - the quarterly earnings reports. A lot of stock buy backers, there's been some criticisms, which I think you don't buy that the stock buybacks somehow are favoring companies and the rich and the shareholder - the investor class and not the worker class.</p><p>DIMON: We focus on the business taxes and they should be competitive. I think it's a really bad idea to say, \"I am willing to accept an uncompetitive global tax system,\" and you think you're doing a good job for America. So, in the individual side, I might have done different things. You need a competitive tax system for the future health of the economy of the United States of America. This is the most prosperous economy the world has ever seen. We need to make sure it's that way because it's good for our people.</p><p>A lot of companies came out and raised minimum wages, did some capital expenditures, but the fact is, the benefit is cumulative over time, as capital gets retained and redeployed, dividends and stock buybacks are simply redeployment of capital to a better and higher use. And so you might get higher dividends and you might buy something with it. Someone else may reinvest it. It might go to a venture capital. It might go to different things, but it needs to be reinvested. You can't use it yourself.</p><p>[16:10:10]</p><p>DIMON: So, this is notion is somewhat - it's a bad thing. It's a bad idea. And remember, our shareholders, 100 million individuals through pension plans, they're also veterans, retirees, teachers, union folks that we work hard to benefit our shareholders and that's a huge mass of society. It's not like a few rich people.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: Jamie Dimon, now it was a choppy day on Wall Street. Choppy day of trade. If you look at it, pretty much for most of the session, while volume was low, the market was down and then you get this afternoon where it was literally just bouncing around a couple of points up, a couple of points down, and when all was said and done, the market is off 13 points - just a fraction or so.</p><p>Financials and tech shares saw the strongest gains. Alphabet shares were up five percent after hours. Their earnings have just come out. I shall tease you liberally. I say, we'll talk more about Alphabet shares in just a moment.</p><p>Iran got one tweet from President Trump. Amazon and \"The Washington Post\" got two. Mr. Trump repeated his often made criticism, that Amazon pays too little to use the U.S. Postal Service, which the President calls Amazon's delivery boy. Mr. Trump went on to accuse \"The Washington Post\" of being a lobbyist for Amazon, that's owned by Jeff Bezos who owns the - the head of Amazon, and attempting to shield Amazon from antitrust claims.</p><p>Amazon's stock dipped when the market opened. Shares have returned and recovered. They closed off less than 1 percent. CNN's Jeff Zeleny with me from the White House. He's not letting up on Amazon, is he? What's behind this?</p><p>JEFF ZELENY, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: He's not Richard. I mean, the question of what's behind it seems to be a question of ego, it seems to be a question of personality. President Trump clearly does not see eye to eye with Jeff Bezos. He clearly is trying to sort of wrap in a business argument with his broader attack on the media, and of course, the Washington Post covers this President aggressively as several news organizations, but it's unclear if President Trump actually believes that Jeff Bezos is directing sort of the stories and the editorial direction of \"The Washington Post.\" He is not. In fact, he rarely is in the newsroom, I am told. He does not have a role in that.</p><p>But the President clearly seizing on his broader fake news argument, if you will, to try to tie into this antitrust argument and the Postal Service. He's been talking again and again and again about how Amazon is essentially responsible for the decline of the Postal Service, that simply is not true.</p><p>Amazon of course gives them a lot of business. You can discuss the negotiated contract if Amazon should be paying a higher rate or not, but they are certainly not to blame for that. So, it was just more of the same this morning, but interestingly, a lot of rants on Twitter, I think 17 or so in the last 24 hours or so, Richard.</p><p>QUEST: And is there any indication that the attacks on Amazon will lead to any action? I mean, so far the President is on his own, but I don't hear anybody in Congress saying that they need to actually tax (inaudible) - it's a private contract between two parties, so I don't see any actual move other than noise and bluster.</p><p>ZELENY: I think that's right. We have not heard anyone else joining in the criticism here. Of course, if any cities across the country including here in Washington, D.C., the local authorities - Republicans and Democrats both sides are eager for Amazon to look for and build its second headquarters in their cities, so Amazon comes with a lot of jobs in the supply chain, other matters here.</p><p>So President Trump is criticizing it. I do not hear a lot of that echoing up on Capitol Hill and as for what it means in terms of antitrust policies and laws, it's hard to say, I mean, from a regulatory standpoint. It could have some effect, but so far, it does not appear that it has.</p><p>QUEST: Jeff Zeleny is at the White House and we thank you. Good to see you, sir.</p><p>ZELENY: Sure.</p><p>QUEST: As we continue tonight, we get to business on the move where RyanAir, Alphabet and Hasbro, the prices have all been moving and we will tell you exactly why. After the break, it's \"Quest Means Business\" live in New York.</p><p>[16:15:00]</p><p>QUEST: RyanAir, the largest airline in Europe saw their profits sink some 20 percent. The reasons were soaring staff costs. Now, as for the Chief Executive, Michael O'Leary, he is worried - he is always worried about something. He is worried about Brexit and the fears of a hard Brexit, which he says are underestimated.</p><p>A different toy story - oh come on, that was good - for Hasbro, makers of the Nerf gun, well, the Nerf gun be testament and if you look underneath it, you'll see things like, more of a recovered ground, plus the Toys R' Us bankruptcy. As with this, my favorite, Twister shares soared as a result of that with some 14 percent and Hasbro 1.2 percent. Alphabet has much to celebrate. The earnings beat expectations, the revenue is up 26 percent. The stock is up in after-hours trading. We'll talk more about it as we have business on the move.</p><p>Joining me to put this into perspective, Paul La Monica. Good to see you.</p><p>PAUL LA MONICA, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Good to see you, sir.</p><p>QUEST: These Alphabet results, what actually did they show?</p><p>LA MONICA: They showed that Google owner Alphabet continues to dominate online search and online advertising. Revenues were up 26 percent per a year ago, strong growth and profits. They did break out what the numbers were including the big E.U. fine that they are appealing. They still have a $3.2 billion profit even with the fine, without that fine, it's $8.3 billion earnings beat estimates. This is a company that now has $102.25 billion in cash balance sheet ...</p><p>QUEST: How much?</p><p>LA MONICA: $102.25 billion in cash on the balance sheet. Of course, that's still less than half of what Apple has, but it's by no means any less potatoes.</p><p>QUEST: A $102 billion in cash.</p><p>LA MONICA: All of these big tech companies have these hug war chests right now. Google, Alphabet - well, they are the same - Apple, Microsoft - all of them, even Facebook and Amazon are building lots of cash.</p><p>QUEST: But what you do with it because I mean, I suppose you do have to be biting especially remember, Facebook paid $17 billion for what's happened ...</p><p>LA MONICA: Yes, we have seen companies buying things. They are spending more on R&amp;D.</p><p>QUEST: What's the weak point in the earnings so far? I mean, I realize you've only had 10 minutes to look at them, but what's the weak point do you think?</p><p>LA MONICA: I didn't see anything particularly troublesome at first blush. I think that one of the biggest criticisms with Google will continue to be that they are spending a lot of money on these businesses that may never yield any profits, that's part of the bigger Alphabet division, the things like having internet access via balloons and things of that nature.</p><p>QUEST: Right, but this - the other projects. I mean, how much of Alphabet is Google and how much of Google's revenues and the significance of the company is the rest?</p><p>LA MONICA: This is still a company that's dominated by, not just search anymore because YouTube is increasingly an important part of the picture as well, but the other bets division of Google is still a tiny fraction of the overall company.</p><p>[16:20:11]</p><p>QUEST: Let's turn to Tesla. Tesla had a difficult day and once again, it's arguably the result of their own misfortune in terms of comments. Look at the price cost of 3 percent today.</p><p>LA MONICA: Yes, Tesla, I think really is facing this problem right now of when are they ever going to be profitable? Are they ever going to be like a mature Detroit, if you will or some of the big auto companies in Tokyo, in Germany, people want this company to generate profits on a consistent basis and you have Elon Musk asking suppliers reportedly for - to get some money back to help them out with profitability. That's not exactly the sign of a healthy company.</p><p>QUEST: But when I was talking to one particular broker, who was talking about their view on the stock price, they have the stock price down in a 160 or something by the end of the year or middle of next year, so the downward pressure if the market believes that that 303 is unsustainable or anything like it?</p><p>LA MONICA: I think it's going to be very difficult to try and figure out what is a fair value for Tesla because you can't look at it like a GM, a Ford, a Toyota and any other major auto company.</p><p>QUEST: But they are the competitors.</p><p>LA MONICA: Right, they are the competitors. I mean, you have to compare them, too in terms of vehicles sold, but because of the fact that it's a much higher growth or expected to be higher growth someday type of company, people aren't valuing it on a pure earnings or revenue basis the way they are with these other large auto companies.</p><p>QUEST: We've got more results this week, haven't we?</p><p>LA MONICA: We have a lot of them. You're going to be busy on the staircase if that still exists.</p><p>QUEST: Have you heard that it's not?</p><p>LA MONICA: Oh my gosh, I saw the little conveyor belt, but the staircase is gone.</p><p>QUEST: No. Thank you, Paul La Monica.</p><p>LA MONICA: My apologies.</p><p>QUEST: \"Future Forward.\" A Chinese city is signing a deal for U.S. Hyperloop train system. The trains will be built in Tongren City in the Guizhou province. The plan is to speed it up to a thousand kilometers an hour.</p><p>Earlier on \"QUEST EXPRESS\" at the stock exchange, the CEO of Hyperloop said China could make it happen faster than other countries can.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)</p><p>DIRK AHLBORN, CEO, HYPERLOOP TRANSPORTATION TECHNOLOGIES: We are able to build and operate much cheaper than high speed rail for example. So, all of our feasibility studies so far have shown roughly construction cost from $20 million to $30 million per kilometer, but we estimate that in China, we actually might be able to build it much cheaper.</p><p>QUEST: The one big problem is, I mean, the theory is good, and the limited practical examples that have been built so far seem to be good, but there's no full scale up and running project and I'm wondering, China is taking a risk in deciding to build this?</p><p>AHLBORN: No actually, we are now in the commercialization phase, so we are building a full scale prototype interlude in France, all the tests so far have been done, but you need to really build a full sized system to really make everything work. I mean, the technology is not really the hurdle. The technologies have been working for quite some time. There is - it's more an integration issue, right?</p><p>So, you have to bring all of these technologies together and make them work in a perfect way.</p><p>QUEST: Right, what's fascinating is that it is China that is taking the risk here. Once again, it is China that is being forward looking and saying, \"Look, this might work. It might solve a very real problem.\" This is different, too in many places in the West, which is tinkering with Hyperloop, but nobody is committed.</p><p>AHLBORN: Well, we actually do have some other commercial projects already, so we are working with the Emirates and Abu Dhabi. The Ukrainian government has some attempt to build a commercial system and now, China of course is a very big player. China is a leader when it comes to high speed rails. They have the highest spending when it comes to infrastructure and they have problems, right? The cities are overflowing, so we need to solve those issues.</p><p>QUEST: When do you think this will be up and running? Give me - I won't hold you to it, sir. I won't hold you to it, I promise you, but give me a rough idea of when I might put my bum on a seat?</p><p>AHLBORN: China is always very aggressive, so our time estimates are a little bit more conservative. We estimate that roughly within three years, we should be able to go and ride in the first Hyperloop together on the first 10 kilometers. But, our Chinese colleagues are very aggressive and believes that they can do it much faster.</p><p>(END VIDEO TAPE)</p><p>QUEST: And he almost promised me a seat on that first one, but I shall hold him to that. Well, because if I am going along, you're going along as well.</p><p>[16:25:05]</p><p>QUEST: As we continue tonight, on top of the day's business headlines, in just 90 seconds, try our Daily Briefing podcast, updated twice a day before and after the bell rings on Wall Street and you can just Alexa or your Google Home Device. CNNMoney/briefing and if you're being polite, you'll say \"Please, Alexa.\"</p><p>As we continue, it's a hard act to follow, Fiat puts a new man at the helm or behind the wheel as illness is forcing Sergio Marchionne to step down as Chief Executive.</p><p>Hello, I'm Richard Quest. There's more QUEST MEANS BUSINESS in just a moment. The Chief Executive of Fiat has some serious and difficult tasks ahead and already has to fill top jobs that people had left. There's double trouble for British steel companies. We're going to take you to the heart of England's steel industry, and as we continue tonight, you are watching CNN and on this network, the facts always come first.</p><p>The White House is defending President Trump's Sunday night Twitter attack against Iran calling it consistent with his previous comments. Mr. Trump declared that if Iran threatens the U.S. again, it will suffer consequences which in his words, \"few throughout history have ever suffered.\"</p><p>Police say the man suspected of shooting 14 people in a popular area of Toronto on Sunday was 29 years old and a native of the city. He exchanged gun fire with officers before fleeing and took a bullet, but it's not clear if that's what killed him. An autopsy is scheduled for the coming days, and the gunman killed two people and wounded 13.</p><p>The U.K. government says it would not object if two British members of an ISIS cell were executed in the United States. The two men are believed to be responsible for beheading hostages in Iraq and Syria.</p><p>[16:30:00] While the U.K. government typically does not cooperate with foreign governments where the death penalty is on the table, it says, it will share information with the U.S. in this case.</p><p>The German football star Mesut Ozil is stepping down from his country's national team and raving racism and disrespect, and he says he's been subjected to on account of his Turkish heritage.</p><p>A spokeswoman for German Chancellor Angela Merkel said his decision has to be respected. Four men have been arrested in connection with a suspected acid attack on a three-year-old boy in the English city of Worcester. The toddler suffered serious burns on his face and arms.</p><p>Police have detained three men in London after they arrested the third on Sunday. They say it's not clear why the boy was attacked. The leadership crisis at Fiat-Chrysler after the chief executive was forced to step down over the weekend.</p><p>Now, in New York, the shares of Fiat-Chrysler closed lower to stuff, nearly 2 percent following two resignations. First of all, Sergio Marchionne who quit after 14 years at the helm -- declining serious grave health issues.</p><p>And the head of the Jeep division is now running the company, Mike Manley has to replace both himself and also the head of Fiat-Chrysler Europe who quit this morning. Rebecca Lindland is the executive analyst at Kelley Blue Book who joins me from Stamford, Connecticut.</p><p>Good to see you as always. We do need to pass this quite carefully. First of all, let's begin with Marchionne and I mean, it's very said that we have to talk in such terms, but the understanding is that we're talking about grave illness.</p><p>REBECCA LINDLAND, EXECUTIVE ANALYST, KELLEY BLUE BOOK: Yes, we are and that it's important that the listeners understand the viewership understand that he was basically forced to resign because he became gravely ill on Friday evening.</p><p>And Saturday, the board met and really kind of de facto, put him into a position where they know he cannot return to the company. But my understanding is that he is gravely ill in a hospital in Zurich, Switzerland. So they've asked Mike Manley to take over.</p><p>As you said, he has been running Jeep really very masterfully and also Ram Pickup trucks.</p><p>QUEST: So --</p><p>LINDLAND: So he's well positioned.</p><p>QUEST: Has he taken over -- I mean, obviously Marchionne is not coming back in that sense to the job --</p><p>LINDLAND: Right --</p><p>QUEST: But has Manley been given the job or is he taking it on a temporary basis whiles the search is underway.</p><p>LINDLAND: Initially, there was some confusion about whether this was just an interim position, but now we've read that he is now given the position and they are not conducting a search.</p><p>Manley was one of the top three contenders for this position, and so I -- but the transition was supposed to happen in April of 2019 --</p><p>QUEST: Right --</p><p>LINDLAND: Which is why there was already a plan in place.</p><p>QUEST: The decision of the head of Europe to go, we're hearing this because he didn't get the top job. If --</p><p>LINDLAND: Right --</p><p>QUEST: I mean -- look, that's not unique, that does happen --</p><p>LINDLAND: Yes --</p><p>QUEST: When people don't get the top job, it affects --</p><p>LINDLAND: Yes --</p><p>QUEST: But I can't help feeling, there's a sour taste here that he's gone so quickly at a time when the company is in crisis. He could at least wait to a couple of weeks and to help the new man out.</p><p>LINDLAND: This is why I love being on with you, Richard, because that was exactly my thought. It's a bit egregious I think --</p><p>QUEST: Yes --</p><p>LINDLAND: Because of the circumstances with which Manley has been assigned. This is -- this is a total shock, Marchionne, you know, was in relatively good health, he had shoulder surgery a couple of weeks ago and then had very massive grave complications.</p><p>So I agree with you, I was very -- it didn't sit well with me really, that Otto Vitter(ph) would just resign like this. It's not unusual, but I thought it would have been a professional great -- professional gracefulness --</p><p>QUEST: Yes --</p><p>LINDLAND: If he had stayed.</p><p>QUEST: And --</p><p>LINDLAND: Yes --</p><p>QUEST: Now, let's talk about -- so Manley has to appease himself and head of Jeep --</p><p>LINDLAND: Yes --</p><p>QUEST: And he has to replace --</p><p>LINDLAND: Yes --</p><p>QUEST: The head of Europe. But he's been at the top of the company for some time. So one is not expecting strategic change of direction, are we?</p><p>LINDLAND: You know, I don't think so. You know, somebody asked me recently if we thought that they were going to tear up the five-year plan that was revealed in Italy at the beginning of June where I was there to hear it.</p><p>[16:35:00] I don't anticipate Manley making those kinds of changes. He is very much a loyal lieutenant to Marchionne, and what he really needs to do is execute on Marchionne's plan. He was very integral there, he was right up there with Marchionne, John Elkann also the head of the company.</p><p>So I think that Manley --</p><p>QUEST: Right --</p><p>LINDLAND: Faced, a reputation precedes him.</p><p>QUEST: Finally, let's talk about the Elkann family, I once interviewed John Elkann many years ago in Italy. Do they still play much of a role? Are they still involved on a daily basis?</p><p>LINDLAND: Well, John Elkann is -- I -- they -- you know, when you have a leader as dynamic and strong and successful as Marchionne, you're going to let him run. So I think that maybe we'll see a little bit more involvement as they reassign.</p><p>Keep in mind, Tudor(ph) and Marchionne had five or six other titles within the family of foundation. So they've assigned -- they've now had to put different CEOs in place at each of these different levels --</p><p>QUEST: Right --</p><p>LINDLAND: In different companies. So I think that he will be involved during this transition.</p><p>QUEST: Good to see you as always from Stamford, Connecticut, thank you for joining us.</p><p>LINDLAND: Likewise, thanks.</p><p>QUEST: Now, as we continue, it started with a picture of a German football star with a Turkish president and it then ends with Mesut Ozil also quitting his country's team in disgust and the sponsors are left to deal with the fallout. We'll be back.</p><p>QUEST: Mesut Ozil is quitting the German national team over the response to this photograph of the Turkish president, and says his sponsors bear some of the blame. Now, Ozil's announcement on Twitter had an entire section devoted just to sponsors.</p><p>This is the recent Mercedes campaign featuring him, they are a major sponsor of the German national team. But in his open letter, Ozil accused an unnamed sponsor of dropping him from their promotions and seem to bring up (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>He said it hurts me they would do so. He said, \"for them, it was no longer good to be seen with me and called the situation crisis management. This is all ironic because a German ministry declared their products have a legal and authorized software devices in them.</p><p>And I'm writing, thinking this is worse than a picture with a president of my family's country. As I said before, partners should stick with you in all situations.\"</p><p>[16:40:00] The company is Mercedes, Mercedes Benz, and he says the company is looking into the claims, but at the same time, Ozil praises Adidas sponsors for being loyal. Today, Adidas said it regrets that he is quitting the German team.</p><p>Isn't it strange story, the size and range that he would quit in such a way over a picture with President Erdogan and then lambast in such a way. Kevin Kelly is co-president of the BigBuzz marketing group and joins me now.</p><p>And it is a strange story, isn't it?</p><p>KEVIN KELLY, PRESIDENT AND CHIEF GROWTH OFFICER, BIGBUZZ MARKETING GROUP: Absolutely.</p><p>QUEST: I mean, the reason why he's gone, the decision just to uptick in such a way.</p><p>KELLY: It's disappointing in the brands, isn't it? You know, I think that it's so often they fall into a crisis management posture, right? It really is an opportunity for them to show their colors, stick to their values.</p><p>And the problem with so many brands is that they don't really know where their values lie. They're following the money and most of their actions are dictated.</p><p>QUEST: So let's go through this bit by bit. First of all, the picture of him with the President Erdogan which is his father -- I mean --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>Meet the president of a country anyway. Whatever all may think of his politics --</p><p>KELLY: Exactly, yes.</p><p>QUEST: He's still the president of Turkey. But what happens after that, he's complaining he didn't get support from his sponsors. What was he hoping for?</p><p>KELLY: I think he was hoping for some loyalty, right? So I think that what we've seen from Adidas and from his other brands that have stuck by him is what you want to see.</p><p>They have done their due diligence, they know who he is, right? And you know, these athletes are passionate, right? And so they will stick to their values, it was nice to see that he did, and he made a choice that was --</p><p>QUEST: Sure --</p><p>KELLY: A very difficult one.</p><p>QUEST: He comes up feeling again with this one, it's such the lower end of anything that's gone wrong. That the --</p><p>KELLY: Right --</p><p>QUEST: All he has is a picture with the president of a country that --</p><p>KELLY: He didn't sleep with the wrong person --</p><p>QUEST: Yes, he didn't sleep with the wrong person, there's no scandal involved. He's got a picture of himself with a president of a country that his family comes from. And out of this, so from the sponsors point of view, you're Mercedes, what are you thinking tonight?</p><p>KELLY: Oh, I'm rethinking if I'm Mercedes, right? I'm thinking that something we talk about emphasis all the time, discouraging, creativity, they've shown no courage, they need to find a way to re-evaluate and show some courage and find a way to support him.</p><p>QUEST: Yes, what does support him mean? And there's something of a -- this is why I'm having difficulty in this thing --</p><p>(COUGHING)</p><p>Excuse me, there's one criticism for this picture, but what does supporting mean? Coming out and making a statement, putting out a press release --</p><p>KELLY: Greatest thing they could do, in all these situations, what we've done is we failed to look at the details, right? We react to something that looks seemingly offensive, right? But the reality was it's some country.</p><p>It's something that he thought strongly about to support his family. So if I'm Mercedes, I'm going to say -- I'm going to look deeper into what he's doing and support those things.</p><p>QUEST: We've seen --</p><p>KELLY: Education, child support, right? Paying for life-changing -- what was the quote? Life-changing surgeries for kids in Russia.</p><p>QUEST: We see this in this country with the NFL, the kneeling and the whole question of sponsors for -- I mean --</p><p>KELLY: Great example --</p><p>QUEST: We can -- we can be (INAUDIBLE) and say sports and politics and sporting controversy should not mix. But that is just naive.</p><p>KELLY: It is right? What pays for that football game to be on -- the NFL television, \"Nbc\" and all these networks, right? These players are so passionate, you've got to understand, right? This person earns his way onto the field, he earned his way onto the team and he's earned his way onto all of your screens.</p><p>So one guy said, hey, I have an opportunity to have my voice heard. And I will say also that not one person who raised their fist or kneeled down on the field ever meant any disrespect to the military.</p><p>I think it's -- again, it's a matter of we haven't taken time to look at the details of the situation.</p><p>QUEST: Good to see you, sir.</p><p>KELLY: Thanks so much --</p><p>QUEST: I deeply appreciate it --</p><p>KELLY: My pleasure --</p><p>QUEST: Thank you. As we continue tonight, the U.K. foreign secretary says Britain could crush out of the single market by accident. And claims Britain would blame the E.U. for years to come.</p><p>[16:45:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>QUEST: Britain's new foreign secretary says the European Union needs to change tactics while there's a risk the U.K. will leave the E.U. without a deal. Now speaking of his first day overseas trip after taking over from Boris Johnson, when Jeremy Hunt said a hard Brexit would hurt the British economy and the U.K. public would blame Brussels for the damage.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JEREMY HUNT, FOREIGN SECRETARY, BRITAIN: And without a real change in approach from the E.U. negotiators, we do not face a real risk of no deal by accident. And that would be incredibly challenging economically.</p><p>My real concern is so that it would change British public attitudes to Europe for a generation.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: Few areas would feel the effects of a hard Brexit as it's known, more than Britain's industrial heartland where decades of decline have already pushed many of its once thriving businesses at the edge of extinction.</p><p>Steel makers though are finding themselves uniquely caught between a trade war with the U.S. and Brexit uncertainty in Europe. Cnn's Anna Stewart has sent us this report from western England.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ANNA STEWART, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Heat, crush and mould it. This is high grade steel and that's heading to the United States and the E.U.. Peter Davies' own steel work employing around 200 people.</p><p>PETER DAVIES, OWNER, ORIGINAL STEEL SERVICES: Steel is the basic commodity that drives the west midlands.</p><p>STEWART: Once the beating heart of industrial Britain, now this region is caught between a rock and a hard place, Brexit and U.S. tariffs. The uncertainty putting hundreds of thousands of dollars in new investment on hold.</p><p>DAVIES: For the first time, I think in my life, I am genuinely worried. If you're a multinational or you've got billions at the bank, then it's fine. You can ride all these things, but we haven't. We live day-to-day.</p><p>STEWART: The steel he sells to America is highly specialized, used in railroads and mining equipments, it's not subject to tariffs yet. But he worries his factories could become collateral damage in President Trump's trade war.</p><p>DAVIES: This is an e-mail from one of our major American customer asking what the impact will be on the steel tariffs.</p><p>STEWART: Davies says the two sides should negotiate instead of retaliating further.</p><p>DAVIES: They are literally like kids, you know, I'm going to slap this -- I'm taking the whole -- you can have my back. The problem is that this is real people, real jobs.</p><p>STEWART: And many of the workers here, it's the only job they've ever known. They sympathize with tariffs to protect those who are in the industry. Cheap steel from China and automation have forced hundreds of small factories to close in recent years.</p><p>[16:50:00] Many voted for Brexit for the same reason. Andrew Rich; the operations director is one of them.</p><p>ANDREW RICH, OPERATIONS DIRECTOR, BROMFORD IRON &amp; STEEL: When I look around me, the decision is typically worse --</p><p>STEWART: But are you worried now the E.U., this is quite damaging for this industry especially your boss.</p><p>RICH: Yes, I am, I'm not sure what's going to happen after the Brexit, we'll find out about -- we need some certainty.</p><p>STEWART: And yet, he says he wouldn't change his vote.</p><p>DAVIES: A lot of them are sort of Sanguine, it will be a ripe, they don't roll over in the middle of the night, thinking, oh, my God, where am I --</p><p>STEWART (on camera): And that there's no job --</p><p>DAVIES: That's my job, that's my job, you know, I'm paid to worry.</p><p>STEWART: His company source for steel from Germany, and if the U.K. crushes out of the E.U. without a deal, his cost could spike. What will that mean for your business?</p><p>DAVIES: It could mean closure. We would probably lose up to 50 or 60 percent of our market, and that would be devastating.</p><p>STEWART (voice-over): Until then, workers here can only hope that politicians keep hammering away at a deal. Anna Stewart, Cnn, West Bromwich, U.K.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>QUEST: Now, of course, nothing to do with the west of England is in the midlands as I said. The head of U.K. steel for the EEF industry groups says jobs losses from this combination of trade tariffs and then Brexit uncertainty could make the industry unsustainable.</p><p>Speaking to Bianna earlier, Gareth Stace said steel makers are already seeing the effects on their balanced sheets and it could get a whole lot worse.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GARETH STACE, DIRECTOR OF U.K. STEEL: From what we've seen with the 25 percent tariff tax slapped on all of the vast steel is that we've seen some jobs canceled in terms of orders that were on the water.</p><p>We've also seen some American customers of the U.K. Steel sector where they've just had to pay that tariff. But this is the short-term reaction, but the longer term reaction is going to be -- that we're going to see a damage to this market for us.</p><p>Which is our second biggest export market after the E.U. It's some $500 million worth in 2017. So anything that puts that risk is going to have a significant impact on our sector.</p><p>BIANNA GOLODRYGA, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, 10 percent of your steel is actually sent to the U.S. You mentioned having 25 million tons of steel needing to find a new home. What is doing -- what is being done now to avoid a glut of steel in the U.K. as we have seen just a couple of years ago.</p><p>STACE: Well, as soon as we now knew that President Trump was going to slap this tax on our steel, we looked to the European Commission in Brussels to take swift, firm and effective action.</p><p>What they've done and we've seen that coming later this week is what's called safeguard measures. And that actually limits the amounts of steel that can come in globally onto the U.K. -- sorry on to the E.U. market.</p><p>And that will limit that surge, anticipate its surge of steel that will now go to the U.S. market that needs to find a new home to go to.</p><p>So we're very pleased that the European Commission has taken that swift action, because if it didn't, we'd have a double one(ph), not only do we have a tax slapped on our steel that goes to the U.S., but we also see our market just flooded with steel, the price would go down and we would find that there were jobs at risk in our sector in the U.K. like we saw in 2015, 2016 which was the worst steel crisis in the U.K. steel sector and well over a generation.</p><p>GOLODRYGA: And there's real consequences obviously first and foremost jobs. Talk about the number of jobs in the U.K. alone that are dependent on this production and if in fact you do go back to the 2016 levels, the crisis that you've seen there. What kind of impact will that have, not only on jobs, but the economy as a whole?</p><p>STACY: Well, in 2015 and 2016, we lost 5,000 to 6,000 jobs in our sector. Let me put that into context. We employ currently today, about 31,000 people directly in the steel sector, and you multiply that by four or five times in terms of indirect jobs.</p><p>So we lost a significant proportion. You know, if we were to lose the similar proportion, we would then potentially become unsustainable sector in the U.K., and that could lead to severe problems and we don't want to go there.</p><p>Because actually, you know, the future really for the steel sector in the U.K., in Europe and actually globally should have a brighter future than we see at the moment.</p><p>GOLODRYGA: Tell me, what is a bigger concern right now, the 25 percent steel tariffs coming in from your number two export being the U.S. or Brexit negotiations?</p><p>STACY: Well, I think the tariffs, the 25 percent tariff is an immediate and short-term concern. You know, I'd like to think we can find some resolution there.</p><p>[16:55:00] I was hoping that when President Trump came over to London and Scotland last weekend, that he would bring a gift with him and that gift would be that he would exempt the U.K. from the tariffs, that didn't happen.</p><p>But the Brexit concern is such an unknown, it's unprecedented as you've said before. We've never seen -- we've never seen this in the last 40 years, we don't know what it's like to be out of Europe. And therefore, it's just totally unknown territory.</p><p>And that's why it's very concerned for all businesses lesser than the steel sector, because we thrive on free trade in the global steel sector, and if we limited that in any way in the U.K., we'd have problems going forward.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: As we head towards the top of the hour, and let's just remind ourselves how the European markets traded, where they all went down pretty much across the section. Not huge losses, the worst was being in Milan with the MTA which was off nearly 1 percent.</p><p>The Italian shares were pulled down of course, fairly obvious by Fiat- Chrysler which is a major part of the market. And the Dow, what a day for the Dow, strange sort of day. Down but -- and then happened, the movements were very small, and as a result we are off just a fraction and the tad(ph) still holding on of course to 25,000.</p><p>As we continue, I will have our profitable moment after the break.</p><p>QUEST: Tonight's profitable moment, so the U.K. foreign secretary has spoken the truth, I dare not speak his name, that they could crush out of - - the U.K. could crush out of the E.U. without a deal and there will be dire consequences as a result.</p><p>Nothing new about that, nothing startling about it. What's interesting is that he said it and he's put it on the table which is why when Theresa May and her cabinet now go around Europe trying to sell the Chequers agreement, it becomes so crucial.</p><p>At some point, these other countries are going to have to say to the commission, either block the U.K. in the eye and let them go without a deal or we're going to have to make some movement in terms of the single market, we're going to have to give them something.</p><p>Now, I do not know how this is going to play out, but I do know time is tight(ph) towards October. And what's even more significant is the reality that if there's no deal, it would be pretty disastrous for all concerned. Never let you say you haven't been warned.</p><p>And that's QUEST MEANS BUSINESS for tonight, I am Richard Quest in New York. Whatever you're up to in the hours ahead, I hope it's profitable, we'll do it again tomorrow.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNI-2018072301cbk27</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNNI2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SW4-67C1-JB20-G34R-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">246052</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7689\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN INTERNATIONAL</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"07\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>July 23, 2018 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0002R1H</classCode><className>FIAT CHRYSLER AUTOMOBILES NV</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"67\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0001Y2C</classCode><className>DOW JONES &amp;

The Boeing Company (BA[1]) dragged on the Dow after weekend reports detailed a too-cozy relationship between the company and its regulator's approval process. The Nasdaq and S...00 also suffered a little as big tech struggled to shake off a rare Facebook, Inc. (FB[2]) downgrade.Meanwhile, OPEC[3]deferred a decision on whether to continue its production cuts until June, which is essentially the same thing as an extension of OPEC's production cuts for a few more months at least. </p><p>The announcement drove oil prices slightly higher, which has been good for the energy sector within the S...00.The move higher in energy is also a positive change for emerging markets[4] (EM). Oil prices and EM have a high level of correlation for two reasons. First, many EM economies, like Mexico, are also major oil producers. Second, demand for commodities is often driven by EM themselves when industrial production is rising. The first factor is playing a much more significant role right now than the second, which puts EM at risk of a reversal if OPEC changes its posture in the near term.The current rally in oil prices is a continuation of the breakout from a bullish inverse head and shoulders[5] pattern in February. Oil prices retested the neckline[6] and have since continued to the upside. This technical pattern has been emerging in other asset classes with greater frequency in recent weeks.I ran a screen today and found that 14 inverse head and shoulders patterns have appeared and been confirmed this month alone among stocks with a market cap larger than $2 billion, including Aflac Incorporated (AFL[7]), General Mills, Inc. (GIS[8]), Dril-Quip, Inc. (DRQ[9]) and a few others that all completed their own patterns on Thursday of last week. In my experience, although there are still major issues facing the market, this confluence of signals is justification to keep a bullish outlook.S...00 As I mentioned previously, the S...00 was stunted by both underperformance among tech names, like Facebook, and slowing among dividend payers in the utilities sector. I don't expect the weakness in utilities to continue for any fundamental reasons. Interest rates remain flat, and if the Fed keeps its dovish stance, investors will still likely be cautious enough to favor more conservative stocks.Although weak trading in tech stocks was a problem for the S...00 today, the index remained within its breakout range above 2,800. I believe it is reasonable to expect the S...00 to reach its short-termpivot[10]in the 2,875 range if the Fed's statement on Wednesday both reaffirms a positive outlook for the economy and a dovish stance against further rate hikes in the short term.Read more:Risk Indicators - Transportation Earnings In the middle of each quarter, a few important companies, likeFedEx Corporation (FDX[11]), release mid-season earnings reports that provide some early insight into the status of thebusiness cycle[12]. FedEx will be reporting on Tuesday after the market closes. The stock isn't a perfect bellwether for the rest of the season, but it is worth watching.For example, the negative disappointments from FedEx in both September and December 2018 preceded major declines in the market indexes. Conversely, the positive surprises in both September and December 2017 signaled a continued rally in the major indexes.Traders care about stocks like FedEx because they are an important component of the transportation sector. If the S...00 is at new short-term highs, technical investors will requireconfirmation[13]from transportation stocks, which should also be at new short-term highs, before considering the rally to be confirmed. So far, that confirmation has been missing, which may be one of the reasons large investors have been slow to move back into risky sectors.Read more:Bottom Line: Prepping for the Fed The Fed'sFOMC[14]meeting will take place this Tuesday and Wednesday. This meeting will also feature a new update to the Fed's projections for economic growth and interest rates. At this point, I expect the Fed to reaffirm expectations for no further rate hikes this year - that should help to provide support for equity prices.According to theCME Group's[15] Fed Watch Tool, bond traders are pricing in a 95%+ probability that the Fed will not raise or lower the target interest rate on Wednesday. Further, traders are pricing in a nearly 70% chance that the target rate will still be the same in December, with a 30% chance that it will be lower.This much consensus is a good sign that we won't see much volatility on Wednesday. But if there are any missteps in the Fed's statement or Chairman Powell's press conference, the magnitude of the reaction could be high. I expect this meeting to pass smoothly, but it is always good to be on alert for the unexpected during these announcements.Read more:Enjoy this article?Get more bysigning up[16]for the Chart Advisor newsletter.

In The Age of Surveillance Capitalism, she warns against mistaking the soothing voice of a personal digital assistant for \"anything other than the exploitation of your needs.\" The cliche that \"if you're not paying for it, you're the product\" isn't alarming enough for her. She likens the big tech platforms to elephant poachers, and our personal data to ivory tusks. \"You are not the product,\" she says. \"You are the abandoned carcass.\"</p><p>OK, Zuboff, tell me more. It's a testament to how extraordinarily intelligent her book is that by the time I was compared to an elephant carcass, I resisted the urge to toss it across the room. Zuboff, a professor emerita of Harvard Business School and author of In the Age of the Smart Machine (1988), has a dramatic streak that could come off as simply grandiose if she didn't so painstakingly make her case. She says we're living through such \"a bold and unprecedented shift in capitalist methods\" that even as we encounter the occasional story about Facebook allowing its corporate clients to read users' private messages or the software in Google's Street View cars scraping unencrypted information from people's homes, people don't yet grasp the new dispensation in its entirety.</p><p>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt; 'The Age of Surveillance Capitalism' book cover Image Credit: Supplied &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;</p><p>So many people take care to calibrate their privacy settings just so, sharing certain things with friends and keeping other things hidden, while their data still gets collected and shared among apps for possible monetisation now or later. Google and Facebook might not call to mind the belching smoke stacks and child labourers of the Industrial Revolution, but Zuboff argues that they're run by people who have turned out to be just as ruthless and profit-seeking as any Gilded Age tycoon. Instead of mining the natural landscape, surveillance capitalists extract their raw material from human experience.</p><p>This business model emerged almost by accident. Zuboff describes how Google, in its early days, happened to keep a cache of data byproducts \u2014 spelling, click patterns, location \u2014 that were produced with each search. It was only after the dot-com bubble burst in 2000 that the company was forced to figure out how to do more than simply provide a free service to its users. It settled on selling advertising, but the advertising would be \"relevant\" and \"targeted,\" using all the detailed behavioural information Google had collected from users.</p><p>\"This new market form declares that serving the genuine needs of people is less lucrative, and therefore less important, than selling predictions of their behaviour,\" Zuboff writes. Whatever gauzy sentiments the new kinds of capitalists espouse (or even believe) about building community and democratising knowledge get subordinated to the brute demands of economic survival \u2013 hence the relentless accumulation of additional data sources, and the ardent lobbying against government regulation.</p><p>Surveillance capitalism has flourished precisely because it fulfills what Zuboff concedes are real needs and desires. Online platforms offer us ways to \"ease the complexities of our harried lives.\" In exchange for surveillance we get convenience, efficiency and social connection. Google comes in for plenty of criticism from Zuboff, but she is equally scathing about Facebook. (She calls Sheryl Sandberg, who worked at Google before becoming Facebook's chief operating officer, \"the 'Typhoid Mary' of surveillance capitalism.\") Facebook has learned how to manipulate empathy and attachment in order to increase engagement and make billions.</p><p>In a document sent to advertisers in Australia and New Zealand, Facebook bragged of its ability to discern exactly when a young person could use a \"confidence boost.\" And then there are the Facebook scandals involving Cambridge Analytica and the Kremlin during the 2016 election, with their deployment of personality tests and viral memes; it's all fun and games until the host of The Apprentice becomes president.</p><p>Surveillance capitalists like to depict themselves as more socially enlightened than their industrial predecessors, but in Zuboff's reckoning they ask for a lot while giving relatively little back. Their companies operate at \"hyperscale\": Despite their enormous market capitalisation, Google and Facebook each employ far fewer workers than General Motors once did, even during the depths of the Great Depression. Citing economic historian Karl Polanyi, Zuboff shows how postwar corporations were expected to offer some sort of communal reciprocity \u2014 hiring workers and hiking wages, sharing prosperity rather than hoarding it. The ascendancy of neoliberalism in the 1970s, she says, laid the groundwork for Silicon Valley to promote an extreme form of entrepreneurial capitalism, unencumbered by any substantive responsibility to the communities it purports to serve.</p><p>Zuboff can get overheated with her metaphors; an extended passage with tech executives as Spanish conquistadors and the rest of us as indigenous peoples is frankly ridiculous, even if I can understand how Zuboff thought the phrase \"rivers of blood\" would get her urgency across. The system she minutely describes is scary enough (I now have a clearer picture of why the Pokemon Go app, a real data gobbler, was offered for free) without dialing the volume up to 11.</p><p>But then maybe my reflexive discomfort only indicates that I've become acclimated \u2014 or \"habituated,\" as Zuboff likes to say \u2014 to the world that surveillance capitalists have created. Absorbing Zuboff's methodical determination, the way she pieces together sundry examples into this comprehensive work of scholarship and synthesis, requires patience, but the rewards are considerable \u2014 a heightened sense of awareness, and a deeper appreciation of what's at stake. A business model that seeks growth by cataloging our \"every move, emotion, utterance and desire\" is too radical to be taken for granted. As Zuboff repeatedly says near the end of the book, \"It is not OK.\"</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://imgs.syndigate.info/34/57/53/155066766439.jpg\">http://imgs.syndigate.info/34/57/53/155066766439.jpg</url></p><p><br/></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://imgs.syndigate.info/34/57/43/155066766460.jpg\">http://imgs.syndigate.info/34/57/43/155066766460.jpg</url></p><p><br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GULNWS-138176734</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GULNWS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VG5-7761-JDJN-637K-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">338760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-02-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1122\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Gulf News - Al Nisr Publishing LLC.

In \"The Age of Surveillance Capitalism,\" she warns against mistaking the soothing voice of a personal digital assistant for \"anything other than the exploitation of your needs.\" The clich\u00e9 that \"if you're not paying for it, you're the product\" isn't alarming enough for her. She likens the big tech platforms to elephant poachers, and our personal data to ivory tusks. \"You are not the product,\" she says. \"You are the abandoned carcass.\"</p><p>O.K., Zuboff, tell me more. It's a testament to how extraordinarily intelligent her book is that by the time I was compared to an elephant carcass, I resisted the urge to toss it across the room. Zuboff, a professor emerita of Harvard Business School and the author of \"In the Age of the Smart Machine\" (1988), has a dramatic streak that could come off as simply grandiose if she didn't so painstakingly make her case. She says we're living through such \"a bold and unprecedented shift in capitalist methods\" that even as we encounter the occasional story about Facebook allowing its corporate clients to read users' private messages or the software in Google's Street View cars scraping unencrypted information from people's homes, the American public doesn't yet grasp the new dispensation in its entirety.</p><p>So many people take care to calibrate their privacy settings just so, sharing certain things with friends and keeping other things hidden, while their data still gets collected and shared among apps for possible monetization now or later. Google and Facebook might not call to mind the belching smoke stacks and child laborers of the Industrial Revolution, but Zuboff argues that they're run by people who have turned out to be just as ruthless and profit-seeking as any Gilded Age tycoon. Instead of mining the natural landscape, surveillance capitalists extract their raw material from human experience.</p><p>This business model emerged almost by accident. Zuboff describes how Google, in its early days, happened to keep a cache of data byproducts - spelling, click patterns, location - that were produced with each search. It was only after the dot-com bubble burst in 2000 that the company was forced to figure out how to do more than simply provide a free service to its users. It settled on selling advertising, but the advertising would be \"relevant\" and \"targeted,\" using all the detailed behavioral information Google had collected from users.</p><p>\"This new market form declares that serving the genuine needs of people is less lucrative, and therefore less important, than selling predictions of their behavior,\" Zuboff writes. Whatever gauzy sentiments the new kinds of capitalists espouse (or even believe) about building community and democratizing knowledge get subordinated to the brute demands of economic survival - hence the relentless accumulation of additional data sources, and the ardent lobbying against government regulation.</p><p>Surveillance capitalism has flourished precisely because it fulfills what Zuboff concedes are real needs and desires. Online platforms offer us ways to \"ease the complexities of our harried lives.\" In exchange for surveillance we get convenience, efficiency and social connection.</p><p>Google comes in for plenty of criticism from Zuboff, but she is equally scathing about Facebook. (She calls Sheryl Sandberg, who worked at Google before becoming Facebook's chief operating officer, \"the 'Typhoid Mary' of surveillance capitalism.\") Facebook has learned how to manipulate empathy and attachment in order to increase engagement and make billions. In a document sent to advertisers in Australia and New Zealand, Facebook bragged of its ability to discern exactly when a young person could use a \"confidence boost.\" And then there are the Facebook scandals involving Cambridge Analytica and the Kremlin during the 2016 election, with their deployment of personality tests and viral memes; it's all fun and games until the host of \"The Apprentice\" becomes president.</p><p>Surveillance capitalists like to depict themselves as more socially enlightened than their industrial predecessors, but in Zuboff's reckoning they ask for a lot while giving relatively little back. Their companies operate at \"hyperscale\": Despite their enormous market capitalization, Google and Facebook each employ far fewer workers than General Motors once did, even during the depths of the Great Depression. Citing the economic historian Karl Polanyi, Zuboff shows how postwar corporations were expected to offer some sort of communal reciprocity - hiring workers and hiking wages, sharing prosperity rather than hoarding it. The ascendancy of neoliberalism in the 1970s, she says, laid the groundwork for Silicon Valley to promote an extreme form of entrepreneurial capitalism, unencumbered by any substantive responsibility to the communities it purports to serve.</p><p>Zuboff can get overheated with her metaphors; an extended passage with tech executives as Spanish conquistadors and the rest of us as indigenous peoples is frankly ridiculous, even if I can understand how Zuboff thought the phrase \"rivers of blood\" would get her urgency across. The system she minutely describes is scary enough (I now have a clearer picture of why the Pok\u00e9mon Go app, a real data gobbler, was offered for free) without dialing the volume up to 11.</p><p>But then maybe my reflexive discomfort only indicates that I've become acclimated - or \"habituated,\" as Zuboff likes to say - to the world that surveillance capitalists have created. Absorbing Zuboff's methodical determination, the way she pieces together sundry examples into this comprehensive work of scholarship and synthesis, requires patience, but the rewards are considerable - a heightened sense of awareness, and a deeper appreciation of what's at stake. A business model that seeks growth by cataloging our \"every move, emotion, utterance and desire\" is too radical to be taken for granted. As Zuboff repeatedly says near the end of the book, \"It is not O.K.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Follow New York Times Books on </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Facebook,</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Twitter and Instagram, s</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">ign up for </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">our newsletter </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">or </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">our literary calendar</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">.

It's a testament to how extraordinarily intelligent her book is that by the time I was compared to an elephant carcass, I resisted the urge to toss it across the room. Zuboff, a professor emerita of Harvard Business School and the author of ''In the Age of the Smart Machine'' (1988), has a dramatic streak that could come off as simply grandiose if she didn't so painstakingly make her case. She says we're living through such ''a bold and unprecedented shift in capitalist methods'' that even as we encounter the occasional story about Facebook allowing its corporate clients to read users' private messages or the software in Google's Street View cars scraping unencrypted information from people's homes, the American public doesn't yet grasp the new dispensation in its entirety.</p><p>  So many people take care to calibrate their privacy settings just so, sharing certain things with friends and keeping other things hidden, while their data still gets collected and shared among apps for possible monetization now or later. Googleand Facebook might not call to mind the belching smoke stacks and child laborers of the Industrial Revolution, but Zuboff argues that they're run by people who have turned out to be just as ruthless and profit-seeking as any Gilded Age tycoon. Instead of mining the natural landscape, surveillance capitalists extract their raw material from human experience.</p><p>  This business model emerged almost by accident. Zuboff describes how Google, in its early days, happened to keep a cache of data byproducts -- spelling, click patterns, location -- that were produced with each search. It was only after the dot-com bubble burst in 2000 that the company was forced to figure out how to do more than simply provide a free service to its users. It settled on selling advertising, but the advertising would be ''relevant'' and ''targeted,'' using all the detailed behavioral information Googlehad collected from users.</p><p>  ''This new market form declares that serving the genuine needs of people is less lucrative, and therefore less important, than selling predictions of their behavior,'' Zuboff writes. Whatever gauzy sentiments the new kinds of capitalists espouse (or even believe) about building community and democratizing knowledge get subordinated to the brute demands of economic survival -- hence the relentless accumulation of additional data sources, and the ardent lobbying against government regulation.</p><p>  Surveillance capitalism has flourished precisely because it fulfills what Zuboff concedes are real needs and desires. Online platforms offer us ways to ''ease the complexities of our harried lives.'' In exchange for surveillance we get convenience, efficiency and social connection.</p><p>Googlecomes in for plenty of criticism from Zuboff, but she is equally scathing about Facebook. (She calls Sheryl Sandberg, who worked at Googlebefore becoming Facebook's chief operating officer, ''the 'Typhoid Mary' of surveillance capitalism.'') Facebook has learned how to manipulate empathy and attachment in order to increase engagement and make billions. In a document sent to advertisers in Australia and New Zealand, Facebook bragged of its ability to discern exactly when a young person could use a ''confidence boost.'' And then there are the Facebook scandals involving Cambridge Analytica and the Kremlin during the 2016 election, with their deployment of personality tests and viral memes; it's all fun and games until the host of ''The Apprentice'' becomes president.</p><p>  Surveillance capitalists like to depict themselves as more socially enlightened than their industrial predecessors, but in Zuboff's reckoning they ask for a lot while giving relatively little back. Their companies operate at ''hyperscale'': Despite their enormous market capitalization, Googleand Facebook each employ far fewer workers than General Motors once did, even during the depths of the Great Depression. Citing the economic historian Karl Polanyi, Zuboff shows how postwar corporations were expected to offer some sort of communal reciprocity -- hiring workers and hiking wages, sharing prosperity rather than hoarding it. The ascendancy of neoliberalism in the 1970s, she says, laid the groundwork for Silicon Valley to promote an extreme form of entrepreneurial capitalism, unencumbered by any substantive responsibility to the communities it purports to serve.</p><p>  Zuboff can get overheated with her metaphors; an extended passage with tech executives as Spanish conquistadors and the rest of us as indigenous peoples is frankly ridiculous, even if I can understand how Zuboff thought the phrase ''rivers of blood'' would get her urgency across. The system she minutely describes is scary enough (I now have a clearer picture of why the Pok\u00e9mon Go app, a real data gobbler, was offered for free) without dialing the volume up to 11.</p><p>  But then maybe my reflexive discomfort only indicates that I've become acclimated -- or ''habituated,'' as Zuboff likes to say -- to the world that surveillance capitalists have created. Absorbing Zuboff's methodical determination, the way she pieces together sundry examples into this comprehensive work of scholarship and synthesis, requires patience, but the rewards are considerable -- a heightened sense of awareness, and a deeper appreciation of what's at stake. A business model that seeks growth by cataloging our ''every move, emotion, utterance and desire'' is too radical to be taken for granted. As Zuboff repeatedly says near the end of the book, ''It is not O.K.''</p><p>  Follow New York Times Books on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, sign up for our newsletter or our literary calendar.

Very pleased to have with us from Okta, Co-Founder and CEO, Frederic Kerrest. Frederic, thank you for joining us.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">JACQUES FREDERIC KERREST, CO-FOUNDER, EXECUTIVE VICE CHAIRPERSON &amp; COO, OKTA, INC.: Thanks a lot for having me, Keith. Excited to be here.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Questions and Answers</p><p>KEITH WEISS: Excellent. So the theme of the conference is zero trust architectures. We're hearing that phrase a lot. Hearing it from a lot of vendors in a lot of different contexts. Two things I want to sort of get your view on. One, what's the Okta perspective on zero trust architectures and kind of really what it means? And two, where does Okta solution fit into that? We hear a lot about identity in relation to zero trust architectures. Do you really sort of help us understand why identity is so important in that equation?</p><p>JACQUES FREDERIC KERREST: Yes. Absolutely. Happy to do that. So thanks again for having me. Very excited to be here today. I think that there's a huge opportunity ahead with zero trust architecture, so I'm very happy you're putting this conference together, Keith, and the rest of your team.</p><p>So to Okta, zero trust means that you look at all of this adoption of mobile and cloud and the acceleration of everyone working on any device, anywhere from anytime, and you no longer have the network perimeter-centric view in security, right? You're working in an airplane, you're working in a -- well, you were working at an airplane. You will, again, at some point in the future, be working at an airplane. Or from a hotel or from a Starbucks or even we all just moved to home very quickly. And instead, we need to securely enable access for all the various users, employees, partners, contractors, regardless of location, device or network. Moreover, everyone is walking around with $1,000 iPhones today, and companies don't want to buy that nor do we have the resources to do that for 10,000, 20,000 employees. At the same time, they want me to use this supercomputer that I have in my pocket and use it for business purposes. So here's a good situation. How do I, as an employer, make sure that my employees can actually use all these applications from wherever they are on their little phones in their pockets? And I think that's the big opportunity. So there's no silver bullet, I think, when it comes to achieving a zero trust secured architecture. But identity access management is obviously the core technology for that. And organizations, a lot of times, are starting to talk -- as far as starting with zero trust, so we can talk about a whole bunch of customer examples at the top of it.</p><p>KEITH WEISS: Sure. Sure. And I guess, my follow-on question on that is, is this something that customers are talking to you about? Like one of the things we're trying to figure out, is this a kind of marketing sort of PowerPoint presentation from vendors of sort of how to think about all our technologies holistically? Or is this actually something that customers are asking about, that we want to go towards a zero trust architecture and utilize Okta sort of to help us get there?</p><p>JACQUES FREDERIC KERREST: Yes. I mean I think there's been a lot of noise about zero trust and what it really means has become kind of a buzzword. It's kind of like digital transformation in everything and nothing and whatever else you want it to be. So I totally agree that there's a lot of that flood going on. At the same time, there are -- it is a real thing for customers. I'll give you an example. We have been working now with FedEx, obviously, the large supplier and mover of shipping of goods around the world, for some time now. I went personally down in Memphis, worked with them in headquarters a number of times. And they brought us in because they had, among their base security architecture framework and vision, something called zero trust. And this was like 6, 9, 12 months ago, they already had it. But we actually became -- they became a customer of ours because of their zero trust initiative. Now obviously things have accelerated dramatically over the last 4 or 5 months with the COVID-19 pandemic. But a very good example of that is actually FedEx had this whole plan to go live, sure, steady, go as you go, have a whole plan ahead of it, make sure it's well done. And then they actually might go live to 85,000 employees, 250 apps over a weekend. So I was talking to Gene Sun, the CIO, in like February and March, he's like, yes, rollouts are in February. He's like rollouts planned for April, May, June, we're super excited about it. They called us in March and goes, \"Guess what? We got to go live this weekend.\" We're like, \"Okay.\" So it went so well, in fact, that at earnings a month ago, we put out a press release with Gene about their successful go-live in deployment. But you can see that these are things major international organizations, been around forever, all sorts of infrastructure have a vision for zero trust and it's like, boom, I got to get it going this weekend, and they can now do that. And I think that really speaks to not only the importance of it, but the power of implementation and how quickly you can get things up and running at a modern security environment.</p><p>KEITH WEISS: Got it. And just want to understand sort of the causality there. So we were talking earlier, zero trust architectures are really about enabling trust in a more distributed world where you can no longer rely on the corporate perimeter for your security, your visibility, your control or your policy. You now have to go to a zero trust architecture, which enables trust between individual devices, individual users and data. And the COVID crisis is just an accelerator on that distribution. That's what's sort of causing this higher priority, this need for speed, if you will, from your customers like Fedex?</p><p>JACQUES FREDERIC KERREST: I think that's right, right? Because zero trust, very fundamentally, is just making sure -- so you don't have the 4 walls to the firewall and the VPN token to get in, in the back of building. That was the security infrastructure and perimeter that everyone understood 10 years ago. You don't have that today. It's does the right person have access to the right data, from the right device with the right times in the right place. That's the very simple version of zero trust, and you want to make sure that, that authentication is continuously monitored and checked.</p><p>So if you think about traditional security architectures, they're built for 2 groups in mind, right? Trusted individuals are able to access everything inside the organization and untrusted individuals outside the organization. And security and IT teams have invested in these defensive systems that protected the barrier between those 2 with firewalls and PPMs and all sort of stuff. As we've all gone home, as we've all gone on all these devices, as we're starting to use the iPad that our kids are also playing with to go check e-mail and everything else, you just want to make sure that the right device has access to the right information at the right time. And I think in this cloud mobile world, like you said, more people are accessing resources and data from more devices and locations than ever before, and they're doing it like instantly, like over a weekend. We had a large financial services customer, typically had 18,000 of their 100,000 folks work remotely before COVID. Within a weekend, it went from 18,000 to almost the full 100,000 and their VPN was like coming to its knees because it wasn't designed to handle that scale. And those are -- that's a very real situation. You're like, oh, man, my employees can't work tomorrow, it's Monday. Those are real driving situations of new giant technology transformation that I think are very exciting.</p><p>KEITH WEISS: Got it. Got it. That is very exciting. So can you talk to us what happens to those -- the legacy architecture? So now we're setting up these zero trust environments. When you think about a big corporation like FedEx, they have a ton of -- in their invested capital and their security architectures. They have firewalls there and the IPS protection and web security. Does this layer on, on top of this? Or is this a replacement for what they were doing before? Like, how does the zero trust architectures, in particular, how does Okta come into this environment?</p><p>JACQUES FREDERIC KERREST: Yes. So that's a good question. Well, first of all, enterprise IT is notorious for not throwing anything away. They buy new things and they Google them on the front, right? They want to make sure they take advantage of the resources and the investments they made before while still taking advantage of the transition or where they can possibly go. So that's the short answer is, no, they've got all this infrastructure, and they're trying to say, okay, now how do I move it forward? So in a lot of cases, it is going to be a roadmap process of, okay, I quickly got all the 80,000 employees who now are working remotely up and running on this system. We augmented the VPNs. We've got them around the VPNs. We have all this new infrastructure. Okay, let me take a big breath. Now it's working. Now let me think about what are we going to be able to decommission, what are we going to be able to accelerate the move to the cloud, where I'm going to make these new investments. I think that's exciting. But I will also tell you that I'm seeing a trend more and more of CIOs, CTOs, CISOs who either have been around the industry a long time or have been with their specific company a long time and have a lot of political clout, they realize that this is a huge once-in-a-generation opportunity for them to do a huge acceleration and move to modernize the transformation. So they're saying, \"Yes, yes, I got to get everything up and running on Monday morning so the 100,000 employees, they work.\" But now that I'm taking a breath, I'm going, \"Hey, this is the chance where I could really leapfrog, where I can put aside all the legacy stuff I'm going to retire because they're realizing getting into my data centers, accessing my on-prem infrastructure is super hard running. I basically can't do it.\" So they're like, \"Wow, now is a good chance for me to say all those plans that I had, let's fast-forward them.\" I think a great example is e-commerce. Everyone's seen the numbers. The e-commerce as a percentage of commerce in North America over the last 10 years before January of this year had gone from like 5.7%, 5.8% to about 16% of e-commerce. In the last 4 months, it's gone -- e-commerce has gotten 16% to 27% of all cost. So 4 months, we done what we did in 10 years. That's not going back. And those kinds of leapfrog technology moments, this is one of those and smart people know how to take advantage of that.</p><p>KEITH WEISS: Got it. So we're talking a lot about the pace of adoption of these technologies. I want to talk about the market opportunity, particularly the market opportunity in front of Okta. So at your recent Analyst Day, you guys talked about a $55 billion TAM. And that's up pretty significantly from what we were talking about at the time of the IPO about 3 years ago, you're talking about $18 billion. So part of that increase is you stand out from sort of the core Okta, which was focused on B2B, sort of how does the company secure identity and secure access for their employees. And now you have a consumer identity bandwidth that adds a big part to that market opportunity. But even in the core workforce identity management, that core's been expanding a lot. We've gone from like the $18 billion to the $30 billion. Can you talk to us about how you guys calculate that $30 billion? What does that represent? And what's been driving that growth from that $18 billion to $30 billion? What's been the big driver behind that?</p><p>JACQUES FREDERIC KERREST: Yes, absolutely. So yes, so as you said, we went public in April 17, the Okta TAM was about $18 billion. That was largely just workforce. I mean, you've got to remember, workforce has been known as traditional enterprise identity management. It's been around for 30 years. People have been buying this legacy infrastructure from CA, Oracle, IBM, RSA, all the old on-prem stuff, so it was pretty easy for the analysts to say, hey, to call all these CIOs and say, hey, what was their line item budget for identity management. Okay, this is what's going to be in a workforce world. So dynamics are very different, plus identity management, as you mentioned, because it's been a build versus buy. Look, people can put up websites and passwords and reset users and passwords and DMZs all day long, but now it's getting super complicated, it's getting tricky. You got security. No one wants to be on the front page of The Wall Street Journal. You've got a customer identity and access management that is now in the line of business. So it's run by a Chief Revenue Officer, Chief Digital Officer, like time to market is super important. Securities enhanced, I want MFA, I want a password reset flow. I want all these complicated things, and I got to get that going. You're now starting to see how that stacks in.</p><p>As you mentioned, workforce identity alone has gone, in our calculation, from $18 billion to $30 billion. I guess three primary drivers of that growth's just in workforce. The first one is just new advanced product offerings. So if you look at -- since 2017, we've introduced new and enhanced versions of our products and brand-new products, and we're doing that with a very consistent framework. We're doing that annually, we're doing that frequently, included advanced versions of our core products, like single sign-on, MFA, LCM, also advanced products have a lot more functionality in it. And then there's brand-new products. Okta Access Gateway is a great example. Advanced Server Access is a great example. Workflows, which is now part of advanced Lifecycle Management, is a great example. These have all been rolled out in the last year. They are doing very well on being adopted at scale, which is great.</p><p>Secondly, I think we're starting to really have an impact with the world's largest organizations. And we tend to highlight that by the -- both the number of customers who pay us over $100,000 in annual recurring revenue, but also we broke out at Analyst Day a month ago, how many large organizations -- or two months ago now, how many large organizations are actually using all these products. And we expanded considerably into a lot of those large organizations. It's driving really large lands and also a much larger expands. You see the dollar-based net retention number is going up at the same time, which is great.</p><p>And then finally, I think there's just more target customers. As more and more people are moving off the legacy infrastructure and thinking about the modern, there's a lot more opportunity there, whether it's government agencies or other large organizations who might not have been good targets for us even 3 years ago. Everyone's going to mean -- everyone is going to be on cloud today.</p><p>KEITH WEISS: Got it. I want to dig into some of those products that you mentioned. You talked about Gateways, Hooks, Workflows, all solutions that enable more seamless integration of Okta's technology within the customer. Can you talk to us about sort of what's the upsell opportunity like? What type of additional monetization can Okta see when they -- when you push in those solutions? And what's the benefit on the stickiness side of the equation? Like how does this make the Okta solution more ingrained into your customers?</p><p>JACQUES FREDERIC KERREST: Yes. Look, I'm very happy with the results that we've seen so far in the company. If, 12 years ago, I'd run into you in the street, like you said, right next to Madison Square Garden and you're walking into a Ranger game and you said, \"Hey, in 12 years, you guys are going to have this company. It's going to be an $800 million run rate business. You're going to have 2,500-plus employees, 8,400 customers,\" I would have taken that in a heartbeat. But based on where I am right now, the last 3 years since IPO have been great and positive and a lot of great things about it. The next 3, 5, 10 are going to be way more exciting, way more interesting. Where spying is starting to get -- I mean it's still a small business compared to these TAMs. We're starting to get to the point where we can really start to branch out across the platform, and that's what you're talking about. If you look at products like Hooks or Workflows, those are great examples of how we're starting to go from a product company to a true platform company and you can tie all these things together. Companies are now starting to be able to build on top of Okta in terms of embedding our identity infrastructure right inside the core of the products, which is great. Hooks allows you to have these end-to-end, really complex environments where you can drive data in. You're a large company, you have a lot of your own data, it could be risk data, it could be customer data and you want to pump it in at the time of document -- of employee -- or customer registration or device management, you can do all those things. Workflows is another great example. Now you can really do those end-to-end workflows. It allows us to drive not only higher pricing because it goes into an advanced SKU of one of our existing products. But like we said, it's stickiness. This thing's like electricity. Once you're embedded in end-to-end Workflows, no one's ripping it out. And then finally, Access Gateway is one that I'm personally super excited about because for years now, we go, we talk to these large organizations and they say, \"Oh, sorry. Love Okta. It's perfect for the cloud. Your identity cloud is amazing. But I still got to tie it in, like we just said previously, enterprise IT doesn't throw anything away. What they do is buy these things and Google them on the front. So I'm still going to have to, Frederic, unfortunately, tying your identity clouds in my on-prem legacy infrastructure because you're not going end to end. And so in the middle, I'm going to have to keep all this old, brittle software from like Ping Identity or CA Siteminder realm that I don't want to do, but I can't retire it because you're not giving me the show.\" And this is the problem we heard time and time again. And so what are we going to do about this? And that is the Okta Access Gateway product. And the revenues from that product, it's gone well. But as we said, since we launched it on the quarterly earnings, and it's still true today, [the revenue's fine], but it's the related revenues that's a lot bigger because now I can unlock those Global 2000s, they go, boom, now I can unlock the end-to-end solution, you're going to show me the road map to get rid of my Oracle or IBM legacy infrastructure over the next 2 years. And the CIO or the CTO has the credibility to turn around internally to their organization and say, look, Okta can do an end-to-end cloud, hybrid on-prem, and that's a huge driver for us.</p><p>So those are some of the some of the product innovations that we get out the door, we get into the hands of customers, and I'm very proud to say customers are finding very great success with that very quickly.</p><p>KEITH WEISS: Got it. Got it. I want to turn the attention -- look to consumer -- customer identity. It seems to be like, one, like you're talking about earlier, it's a big problem. It's something that's increasingly complex for the end customer, notoriously complex for your customer itself. And it seems like it's going to get worse, right? User privacy issues are ramping in terms of regulation, ramping in terms of like you really don't want to get off in the newspapers by having personal identity fall information come out. And it's getting harder for, I think, for the customer then -- your customers themselves, to understand who their user is. You can't use cookies anymore. You're not going to be able to use cookies on a going-forward basis. That's what's being phased out. It seems to me that Okta could provide an interesting solution in there, right, that they can help to solve some of these problems. Can you tell me how you guys go about that? How the Okta customer identity solution is going to help solve some of these issues for the end customer?</p><p>JACQUES FREDERIC KERREST: Yes, absolutely. By the way, your sales pitch is perfect. So if this doesn't work out, we're always looking to hire [a new sales guy]. Yes, I mean, look, we always believe there was a big opportunity in customer identity management. Like we said, it was a build versus buy, so it wasn't clear. You couldn't buy a report and say, like, how much are people spending on this because it was kind of weird, right? It was like, what are you going to do? You're going to call John Deere and say, \"Hey, John Deere, what percentage of how many of your developers are working on customer-facing identity?\" And they're like, \"I don't know what you're talking about.\" So -- but here's the reality. The reality of it is there's a shortage of 200,000 developers in North America today. Our universities are only printing 30,000 a year. So even if there was no growth in software in the future, it would take 7 years for it to catch up to that pent-up demand. So what does that mean? That means if you're John Deere, you're FedEx, amazing companies, but they have to compete with Google or Facebook or Okta to get the best developers in the world. And they're just not going to get enough of them. At the same time, customer identity management, this is in the line of revenue. We are talking about how you accelerate your business, digital transformation, the most overused term in the world, what it really means though in this case is, how do I have a better interaction with Keith as my customer? How does he have a better experience on his mobile phone? How does he have a better experience on the website? How can I learn more about him? How can I make it more seamless for him to interact with me? I got to do that. It's in the revenue statement. If I don't do that, my competitors going to do that. So the stakes have gone up, the importance has gone up, the urgency has gone up and then at the same time, you don't have the resources to do it. And I think that's where this big opportunity is. So number one.</p><p>Number 2, I would say, look, everyone has -- [I'll take them a test], a Fortune 8 company, great company, customer of ours. Love them. They use everything we do, but they have one workforce, which is great. So they use us end-to-end on all their workforce. We're their workforce identity standard. So if I come out with a new product, I can sell to McKesson, and they'll buy hundreds and thousands of seats of it for their employees, but they only have one workforce. They have end number of customer identity and access management opportunities, right, because they have to do end user portals for end users. They have to do physician portal. They have to do doctor portals. They ship 1/3 of all pills in America every day. They have these giant digital supply chains. They want to make sure the right people have access to it. That's like 20, 30, 40 different customer identity and access management opportunities for me to help them with.</p><p>And when you think about what's going to happen in the world and you think about what just happened with the acceleration that everyone wanted with the e-commerce numbers we talked about, everyone's got to find a better way to interact with it quickly. And so the risk has gone up.</p><p>And then finally, as you said, and that's why you see the numbers, even though CIAM is only 23% of our ACD mix, it's growing at almost 70% year-over-year, right? So it's smaller than our workforce business because we didn't have that side of the market 5 years ago, but it's growing really rapidly.</p><p>Now if you look at, finally, what you said is the complexity and the privacy of the fact, we just put out a report yesterday around data privacy and how folks feel about it. We polled 12,000 people in 6 to 8 countries, including the United States. And basically, they're all saying, I'm super worried about -- my digital identity and privacy is super important, but they really don't understand that everyone's tracking everything they're doing all the time. Now you see when Facebook executives or Google executives or big tech executives get brought up onto the -- in Washington, D.C., and they're asked to talk about these things, it's like they're being put out there and saying they're bad stewards of data. And that's why you end up having things like CCPA in California, which is a protection of consumer information.</p><p>The problem though -- and you have GDPR in Europe -- and Okta, by the way, is compliant with both. The problem though, if you're a company, you are MGM. And you have the MGM brand and the MGM Vegas and you have the M life affinity program, which is how you track Keith. I know what he spends. He would lose a lot of money. [I help him with the buffet], and I give him a credit card. I got to track all these things. While he's in California, I have to comply with CCPA. The problem is there's no federal standard. All the states are going to come out with their own, and they're going to be 50 of those. Now as MGM, you're like, holy smokes, how am I going to be compliant? And by the way, with the speeding tickets for messing that up are expensive. So you're like, wow, holy smokes, how am I going to comply with all these things? And at the same time, it's a mess for you, Keith, because you don't actually know who has access to what data, where your data is and who can do what. Those are huge opportunities. And so you talk about CIAM, we are working a lot on how we can enhance privacy opportunities. Imagine if I can go to MGM and say, \"Hey, I'm going to give you the United States version of CCPA in a box for 50 states, point and click as a CIAM solution.\" People are like, \"Yes, please.\" So we're working a lot on that. We came out with Okta Ventures last year, which is a corporate venture capital firm, a venture capital fund that also runs under my purview. We've made about half a dozen investments. A couple of those have been in data privacy, data governance, just start to get an idea of what's really going on there. But I totally agree. There is a lot that's going to happen in CIAM in the times ahead, and we're very excited to help our customers with that.</p><p>KEITH WEISS: Got it. It sounds awesome. When we think about customer identity, the primary competitor is kind of do-it-yourself and developers. Who else is targeting this opportunity? Is like the ultimate competitive set, like, Facebook just wants you to use the Facebook ID and Apple wants you to use the Apple ID, and you're competing with those guys?</p><p>JACQUES FREDERIC KERREST: No. I mean, right now, it's build versus buy. So Facebook, the Facebook ID, the Google ID, we support all those integrations. That's just very simple open ID standards, so that basically, any of our customers, the M life example, you can go on the M life website, you can log in using Facebook or Google or any of that stuff. But I would also say, just the conversation we just had, are you going to entrust all of your personal data to Google or Facebook? No, because they make money on that business. We don't. We're an enterprise company. Our customers pay us. They get to use the infrastructure. We use the data in aggregate for the reports, but we make no money off the data, and we never will, okay? So that's the first thing. The second thing is when we really think about how we're going to be doing all that, there's a lot of opportunity to build the APIs and the SDKs and the libraries and the toolkits to make it super easy.</p><p>Think about today, you're trying -- you're a developer, you're trying to build a bunch of stuff and you're like, okay, I need communication, I need SMS. Boom. You can think about the Twilio libraries off the shelf, plug and ready to do your thing.</p><p>Okay, now I need to do payments. I want to charge Keith. Boom. I take Stripe off the shelf, I plug it right in my things. We want to do the exact same thing with identity because we just talked about how there's a massive shortage of developers, super important line of business, speed to market is everything. We want you to be able to think, \"Wow, I can go to Okta. And we have a developer.okta.com. We're investing a ton in customer identity and access management, a huge opportunity for us, so that you can just pull that off, plug it in your thing, the libraries are there, the documentation is there, the relationships are there. You can see exactly how it all works. The APIs, SDKs packaged products, we're really spending a lot of time and effort and energy on that, and it's going really well. The results speak for themselves. You see what's happening with the numbers. So I think with these platform type services, we can really help our customers build faster, they can customize more easily, and frankly, they can extend across their technology investments that they've already made, which I think is very exciting.</p><p>KEITH WEISS: Got it. Got it. I wanted to dig into one of the things you talked about. You mentioned MGM. And I remember seeing the press release that they're building out -- basically building out or transitioning their loyalty program to be built on Okta. It's not something I traditionally would have expected to see like built on an Okta platform. Can you help me...</p><p>JACQUES FREDERIC KERREST: Why do you got to be like that? Come on, now.</p><p>KEITH WEISS: I'm looking for you to kind of help me see the light. Can you help me understand like why that makes sense? Like why MGM turns to you guys as...</p><p>JACQUES FREDERIC KERREST: Yes. MGM is -- I could explain that one, but I'm going to take one that's even easier for like everyone to understand because it's something they do every day. Whereas, if you haven't been in Vegas in a while, you probably won't for some time. So I'll take Albertsons as an example, right? Albertsons is a huge food chain. They have about 27 different banners under the Albertsons flag, Safeways, Vons, all these other stores, okay? So essentially, Albertsons a customer of ours. Before Albertsons was a customer of ours, they were in the M&amp;A business. So they rolled up all these different things. And now Keith could be a customer of Albertsons, the brand, of Safeway and a Vons. And maybe you're at the gas station, you're using your Safeway points to get a bunch of Chevron gas for cheaper. You're doing all these things, but you have 9 different numbers across all the different things. None of them were tied together. You get no credit at Safeway that you just bought a bunch of stuff at Albertsons, and so forth and so on. And then on the back end, Albertsons doesn't know who you are. They've got Keith Weiss over here. They've got Kate Weiss over here. They've got Keith W III one, they can't make sense of it. What does that mean? They can't give you any value. They can't help you cross -- they can't help themselves cross-sell and upsell you any products and they can't say, \"Wow, Keith bought these 3 things, we think he might also be interested in this one.\"</p><p>Fast forward, Albertsons is now a customer of ours. We run all their customer identity and access management infrastructure across all the different touch points, which is on the web, on the mobile app, physically in the stores and at all the partner chains like gas stations that I just mentioned.</p><p>So the experience now for you is one username -- and then I'm going to get to, by the way, a cool part of the technology we've added on with FastPass, but I'll get there. One user name for you, one password, one set of credentials, you see all your information. They can be integrated. You can use points in different way, It's your phone number if you want it to be, whatever the identifier is. Do you think I would remember your Vons number, but you know your phone number, you can use it everywhere. Boom. Now Albertsons, on the back end, has got one view of Keith. Oh, look, he's over here. Looks like he's on vacation up in the Adirondacks. But we've got some special partners up there, let me push him a bunch of stuff, and he can go shop where I want him to shop.</p><p>So that's the kind of solutions where multichannel, multi-touch, all the brands, that's where our customer identity and access management is like in the future because otherwise, I don't know who you are. The cool thing that we just announced and as we roll out more and more of these platform services, and if you look at an example like what we're doing with all our devices work, we just released at Oktane20 something called FastPass, which is basically getting rid of passwords in situations where you can. So what do I mean by that? I mean by that if we have stamped your mobile device and we know it's you, and you are now at the gas station trying to get the points discount off of your Albertsons number, maybe I'm just going to say, \"Oh, look, it's Keith. We stamped his device. We know it's his device and all he's trying to do is get some points,\" maybe you just need your username. You don't even need your password anymore. Those are the kinds of things where you can make it more significant. Look, at the end of day, if someone gets your Albertsons points, I mean, it's a bummer, but it's not the end of the world. It's a low-touch day where I want the friction to be 0 on the customer, and I want them to keep coming and be like, \"Wow, that's a magical experience.\" Those are the kinds of things where I get -- really think that we can innovate in the times ahead and help customers considerably with their customer identity and access management opportunities.</p><p>KEITH WEISS: Got it. So I wanted to -- we have a couple of minutes left. A couple of new solutions you guys talked about in Oktane. FastPass is one of them, Lifecycle Management, device platform services. Can you talk to us a little bit through the other 2, the Lifecycle Management and device platform services?</p><p>JACQUES FREDERIC KERREST: Yes, absolutely. So Lifecycle Management, definitely they're both -- I'm juiced about both of them, but Lifecycle Management is one that is about all about workflows, and people really ask us about that. That's when you can really start to have extremely valuable relationships with your customers because now it's not just about, hey, you bought a bunch of products from me. I helped you with some point of problems. Now I'm helping you with end-to-end use cases. Here's a very simple one, everyone will understand, what's known as a JML, joiner, mover, leaver. New employee comes on board, how do I make sure they have access to all this stuff? Change jobs, their entitlements should change, their access applications, maybe devices should change. They leave the company. I need to instantly deprovision them from all these publicly available Internet services that they can -- key mission-critical data, they can go home and log in on their iPad. And that use case alone is super complicated, and especially as the organizations get bigger. Now you've got HRIS-based provisioning things like Workday tools where you can drive downstream, it's the ITSM systems like ServiceNow, they can provision the laptop and send it to your home or your other applications. And then you can close the loop to make sure the demands are approved, that you actually should have Salesforce.com access. That's what you can now do with all of our Workflows stuff, which is -- it's GA now. It's point and click, no code, it's drag and drop, the demos are killer and they work even better in production. And once that stuff is glued in, it is not coming out. You see it in dollar-based net retention. You see it in the upsell and cross-sell numbers in the revenue base with advanced Lifecycle Management because Workflows is part of that. I mean that stuff is doing awesome.</p><p>Then the other one you mentioned is devices, right, and a lot of the device information that we're doing. We announced at Oktane a bunch of really good partnerships with a bunch of the leading endpoint companies. So VMware Carbon Black, CrowdStrike, Tanium, they provide a lot of device risk signal information. So now I can go kind of what's the posture of the device? How does it work? And I can start to make access and authorization decisions much more quickly from more of this data that's coming into me. So here's the example. I know that Keith, he hits our normal systems Monday through Friday, from the East Coast from a bunch of standard IP ranges, no problem. All of a sudden, Keith is on one of his mobile apps -- one of his mobile devices, it looks like he's trying to hit the financial systems to 2:00 in the morning from Eastern Europe. Huh, that's suspect. And I'm getting it off of the devices. I can instantly put Keith in the penalty box, so maybe he can only access a calendar or an e-mail until Monday morning when security actually -- SecOps is going to take care of it.</p><p>B, I can send a note, a bunch of notes to security. See, I can walk down a bunch of other assets that he might have access to, to make sure that nothing else happens. If you can do that in an automated manner, you're now using all that data and all those risk signals to augment what is already a very complex process to like prevent security breaches. I mean, that is like panacea for a lot of these CISOs. So the more and more we can do these things and tie those 2 things together with the Workflows, for example, on the devices, and open up the platform for other people to take advantage, I think customers really start to benefit from a lot of that.</p><p>KEITH WEISS: Got it. Got it. That sounds awesome. Unfortunately, that takes us to the end of our allotted time. Thank you, Frederic, very much for joining us and walking us through this expansive opportunity ahead of Okta.</p><p>For all the clients on the line, thank you for joining us, and please stay tuned. We actually have Carbon Black from VMware up next on our presentation. That's the last presentation of the day.</p><p>So Frederic, once again, thank you very much for joining us. I really appreciate your time.</p><p>JACQUES FREDERIC KERREST: Thanks, Keith. I greatly appreciate it. It's great to see you. We'll talk to you soon. Take care.</p><p>KEITH WEISS: Excellent. Sounds great.</p><p>JACQUES FREDERIC KERREST: Okay.

Remember when it was the young bull, forging new networks around the world with deep political influence, changing and sharpening journalism, knocking over anyone who stood in its way?   News was the future. Then, suddenly, it wasn't. It's become the grumpy old bull, shouting at the clouds of cultural change, ordering a stop to the disruption being wrought by big tech.   How's that been working out these past few days? <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Jameswalks away</emphasis> In a life-imitates-art taster of the next series of HBO drama <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2018/08/succession-finale-review-hbo/566855/\">Succession</url></emphasis>, the younger Murdoch brother, James, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/jul/31/james-murdoch-resigns-board-news-corporation\">resigned</url> from his role in the family company as director of News Corp on Saturday.   This was due, he said, \"to disagreements over certain editorial content published by the company's news outlets and certain other strategic decisions\".  In the Murdoch drama, James has played both the digital-savvy son and family conscience on climate change. Following last summer's bushfires, he <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2020/01/20/news-corp-publications-james-murdoch/\">criticised the company's Australian papers for their climate change denialism</url>.   He's regularly undermined the company, his brother and his father with large public donations to support climate change, anti-racism and Democrat presidential candidate Joe Biden.  James was once the company's future. Now, his vanishing is a reminder that there's little space for nuance in News Corp's fight against the cultural reset on gender, race and climate.  Oder son Lachlan is now the last sibling standing. As News Corp and Fox have become Lachlan's companies, they've increasingly devolved to cultural and political platforms for the right. They are far from the innovative news media they once strived to be. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Old power v new</emphasis> power News Corp is also fighting a war against big tech. It's a battle of old power versus new, and Australia's federal government is backing the former. Why? Contacts, influence and a comfort with the devil you know.   News Corp is attempting to leverage a revenue lifeboat out of Google and Facebook -- one that's being built at arms-length through the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2020/07/31/big-tech-code-practice/\">Australian Competition and Consumer Council</url> (ACCC) as a mandatory code between news media and the tech platforms.   As successive treasurers, Scott Morrison and Josh Frydenberg have had their hands all over it: from the original inquiry ordered by Morrison in 2017, through to Frydenberg's intervention in May for a mandatory code, and on to last Friday with the release of draft legislation for parliament to enable the code.  The submissions to the ACCC over the code (also released Friday) reveal how much of a hand News Corp had in shaping that legislation -- particularly in the process for shaking money out of Google and Facebook through final-offer arbitration if necessary.   It's also reflected in the extensive rights it gives Australia's news media to be consulted over the operation of the platforms' algorithms. This includes what must be the most grumpy-old-man phrase written into Australian law: \"in terms that are readily comprehensible\".  The major contribution of the government? Perhaps the proposed clause which explicitly excludes the ABC and SBS from access to any remuneration, even though the ABC is the major source of online news in Australia.\u00a0  <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The final bellow</emphasis> The content and tone of the News Corp submission (like its submission to the related ACCC inquiry on digital advertising) is infused with a sense of righteous anger.   News Corp says any claims by the platforms are \"extraordinary\" and \"plainly wrong\"; they \"border on the absurd\". The submissions have a strong \"and another thing\" vibe to them. No perceived historic slight is left behind.  Given how central \"news\" has been to the 20th century media business model, traditional media struggles to accept that it is not equally central to Google's search, YouTube's videos or Facebook's feed. Maybe old media is right, but it's not supported by any hard data.  Ultimately, in the power game, money is how we keep score.
