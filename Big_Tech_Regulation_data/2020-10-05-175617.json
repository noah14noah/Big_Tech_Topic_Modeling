Using rights under the General Data Protection Regulation, ORG's email form makes it easy for anyone to submit\u00a0a Subject Access Request (SAR) to every political party that has a sitting elected representative in a national or regional parliament or assembly. Verification comes through uploading a photo ID that shows their identity and current voting address.</p><p>The ORG says that its own requests to political parties have led to the discovery that parties have been buying up commercial data sets and using them\u00a0to profile the political opinions of the electorate. This included\u00a0guessing where people stood on Brexit, taxation, housing and\u00a0austerity, as well as their likelihood of being a swing voter.\u00a0</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FTCOMH-36c9b8f416be11ea9ee411f260415385</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FTCOMH2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XNC-JP21-DXP9-954R-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">408337</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"884\"/><timeReceived>6:06 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Financial Times Limited All Rights Reserved Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web.</copyright><publicationName>FT.com Headlines</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"12\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>December 4, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The takeover is likely to prove contentious, however, with regulators in the United States and Brussels launching inquiries into whether Big Tech's heavyweights are involved in anti-competitive behaviour. Presidential candidates such as Elizabeth Warren have threatened to break up companies such as Google and Facebook if elected, or even to reverse their previous acquisitions. Google said that it was buying Fitbit for $7.35 a share in cash, a 19 per cent premium to the company's closing share price on Thursday. Shares in Fitbit rose by 15.5 per cent to close at $7.14 yesterday and have improved by 40 per cent since rumours first broke on Monday. However, the price represents just over half the $4 billion valuation that Fitbit achieved when it was floated on the stock market four years ago. 'Google is an ideal partner to advance our mission,' James Park, 42, co-founder and chief executive of Fitbit, said. 'With Google's resources and global platform, Fitbit will be able to accelerate innovation in the wearables category, scale faster and make health even more accessible.' The acquisition will be Google's largest in consumer electronics in five years, after it bought Nest, the smart home company, for $3.2 billion in 2014. The deal is expected to close next year, Fitbit said, subject to shareholder and regulatory approval. Rick Osterloh, senior vice-president of devices and services at Google, said: 'Fitbit has been a true pioneer in the industry and has created terrific products, experiences and a vibrant Fcommunity of users.' Fitbit was founded in San Francisco 12 years ago by Mr Park and Eric Friedman, 46, and helped to kick off the wearables devices craze. Its range of watches monitor users' daily steps, calories burnt and distance travelled. Fitbit has sold more than 100 million devices and has more than 28 million active users. Some of its customers may be wary of a company such as Google acquiring huge amounts of personal data, including their weight, calorie count, sleep and menstrual cycles, heart rate and daily exercise. Leo Gebbie, a senior analyst at CCS Insight, a technology-focused analytics firm, said that such information would have 'huge appeal to a data-driven business like Google'. Google has said that it will not use the health and wellness data from Fitbit for its adverts and customers will be able to 'review, move or delete their data'.

Google led the way, spending a record amount, $21 million. Amazon spent $14.2 million and Facebook spent $13 million. </p><p>Every year, tech companies are spending more and more on lobbying in Washington DC, and this is due to the fact that regulators are starting to really scrutinize big tech companies like Google, Amazon[3] and Facebook. Particularly Google and Facebook after the many privacy issues that the two ran into last year. Those three weren't the only ones spending a ton in Washington in 2018. Microsoft and Apple also contributed to the $64.8 million spent by the biggest tech companies in the world. Microsoft spent $9.5 million and Apple spent $6.6 million lobbying last year. The \"big five\" as they are being referred to in Washington, had good reason to spend more, and that was due to the backlash of congress and regulators scrutinizing the companies after the 2016 Presidential Election. Some in Washington believe that these companies have gotten too large and too fast. Many believe that some should be broken up. Though, it's not certain that it would actually fix anything. Those old enough to recall AT...eing split up in the 1980s, will remember that AT...nded up reforming less than 30 years later and became an even bigger juggernaut. So splitting these companies up may not be the best route for the tech industry. Google, in its filing, said that it was lobbying on tons of issues. Which the company says reflects how integral its services are to everyday lives now. Some of the areas that Google lobbied in include privacy, data security, antitrust, taxes, tariffs, trade, the opioid crisis, artificial intelligence, cloud computing and more. Of course, Google was also called in front of Congress, a couple of times though Pichai[4] only made it there once. Congress grilled the CEO on Google's privacy efforts, after the Google+ data breach was made public. Lobbying in Washington, DC is not illegal, though some may feel that it should be. Basically, bigger companies pay lobbyists to argue their side of things to Congress and other regulators in the nation's capital. Lobbyists also make significant donations to politicians when they are running for election or re-election. Which helps the politician run their campaign, but it also influences that politician a bit. This is the main reason why many want to see money being taken out of politics. As Google has grown, it has spent more and more on lobbyists in Washington, as it looks to avoid probes and fines from regulators. After all, it is already paying enough fines in Europe. It just got hit with another record fine of $57 million in Europe earlier this week, in fact. The other big tech companies are doing the same thing, especially Facebook and Amazon, who have been facing more scrutiny in Washington in the past year or so. Apple and Microsoft haven't faced as much, which is why they aren't spending as much.

Republicans expressed concerns about unfair treatment of conservatives, and lawmakers in both parties zeroed in on privacy issues.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">While Google had been under scrutiny before, particularly in Europe, where regulators have fined it, it had not had to address such an array of issues in one go and in such an open forum.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\u201cMr. Pichai, it was necessary to convene this hearing because of the widening gap of distrust between Silicon Valley and the American people,\u201d said Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the Republican House majority leader. He is not a member of the Judiciary Committee but made a point of attending the hearing.</p><p>It was the latest in a series of congressional hearings that have made clear lawmakers\u2019 concerns about the power of big internet companies. Mr. Pichai fielded questions alone, after rejecting a request to testify with executives from Facebook and Twitter three months ago.</p><p>Mr. McCarthy and other Republicans see Silicon Valley as the home of hugely influential companies with liberal executives and work forces that \u2014 intentionally or unintentionally \u2014 are allowing their biases to taint how people receive information on the internet.</p><p>For Google, that means claims that its search results are skewed against conservatives, though academics and industry insiders largely dismiss those concerns. A video showing Google executives bemoaning President Trump\u2019s election victory in 2016 provided further evidence for Republicans when it was leaked this year.</p><p>Representative Robert W. Goodlatte, the Virginia Republican who is chairman of the Judiciary Committee, asked if Google\u2019s employees had made decisions to filter search results contrary to the company\u2019s claims of political neutrality.</p><p>\u201cThis committee is very interested in what justifies filtering,\u201d Mr. Goodlatte said. \u201cGiven the revelation that top executives at Google have discussed how the results of the 2016 elections do not comply with Google\u2019s values, these questions have become all the more important.\u201d</p><p>Without offering evidence, Representative Lamar Smith, Republican of Texas, said Google\u2019s antipathy toward conservatives gave Hillary Clinton a lift in the 2016 presidential election. He pushed Mr. Pichai to allow outside investigators to audit Google\u2019s search technology for indications of bias.</p><p>\u201cGoogle could well elect the next president,\u201d Mr. Smith warned.</p><p>But the company\u2019s search algorithms do not take political sentiment into account, Mr. Pichai said. Results are determined by about 200 factors, including relevance, freshness and the popularity of queries.</p><p>\u201cOur algorithms have no notion of political sentiment,\u201d he said.</p><p>The session offered a hint that when Democrats become the House majority in January, data privacy issues will become a priority.</p><p>\u201cThere are legitimate questions regarding the company\u2019s policies and practices, including with respect to content moderation and the protection of user data privacy,\u201d said Representative Jerrold Nadler, a Democrat from New York.</p><p>Mr. Pichai, who was roundly criticized by lawmakers for not appearing at the hearing three months ago, could not so easily sidestep the privacy issue.</p><p>Republican and Democratic lawmakers focused on whether Google tracks a user\u2019s location without obtaining consent. Some <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/12/10/business/location-data-privacy-apps.html\">cited an article by The New York Times</url>, published on Monday, that showed how easily supposedly anonymous information can be linked to a person.</p><p>The sharpest exchange involved Representative Ted Poe, Republican of Texas, who held up his smartphone and asked Mr. Pichai whether Google was tracking his whereabouts if he walked to the other side of the room.</p><p>\u201cNot by default,\u201d Mr. Pichai said, meaning it depended on the settings on the apps that Mr. Poe had installed on the phone.</p><p>When Mr. Pichai wouldn\u2019t respond with a definitive yes or no, Mr. Poe raised his voice and interrupted.</p><p>\u201cYou make $100 million a year. You should be able to answer that question,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m shocked you don\u2019t know. I think Google obviously does.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Pichai said Google offered users controls for limiting the collection of location data and did not sell user data, though he avoided saying whether the company uses location data when it sells advertising.</p><p>When asked whether Google would support a federal privacy law like Europe\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation, Mr. Pichai seemed open to it. He praised the European policy, which went into effect in May, as a \u201cwell-crafted piece of legislation\u201d and said there was value in consistent global regulation.</p><p>Google and other internet companies <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/26/technology/tech-industry-federal-privacy-law.html\">have lobbied for a federal privacy law</url> through their trade groups and have hastened to support a national law that would nullify state privacy laws, such as the one California passed this year.</p><p>Repeating earlier statements, Mr. Pichai said Google had no current plans to re-enter the Chinese market with a search engine that censored information banned by the government.</p><p>He characterized the initiative, Project Dragonfly, as an \u201cinternal effort.\u201d He said the company had not discussed its plans with Chinese government officials. Mr. Pichai would not commit to scrapping the initiative, however, and said it was \u201cour duty to explore possibilities to give users access to information.\u201d</p><p>Like other Capitol Hill hearings on tech companies this year, the session on Tuesday offered as much theater as policy discussion. Seated a few rows behind Mr. Pichai \u2014 in sight of television cameras \u2014 was a person sporting a top hat, a fake giant mustache and a monocle like the Rich Uncle Pennybags character from the board game Monopoly.</p><p>At one point, the session was interrupted by a protester holding a sign that read \u201cGoogle\u201d across a Chinese flag.</p><p>Outside the hearing room, Alex Jones, the founder of the conspiracy news site Infowars, yelled \u201cGoogle is evil!\u201d until a police officer told him to quiet down. Mr. Jones has been barred from Twitter, Facebook and YouTube, which is owned by Google.</p><p>He was accompanied by Roger J. Stone Jr., the Republican political operative and a longtime acquaintance of President Trump who has drawn attention from the special prosecutor, Robert S. Mueller III, for his potential role in Russian election meddling. Mr. Stone, who was also barred by Twitter, complained that big internet companies were \u201cmonopolistic.\u201d</p><p>Follow Daisuke Wakabayashi and Cecilia Kang on Twitter: @daiwaka and @ceciliakang. </p><p>PHOTO: Sundar Pichai, an engineer who rose through Google\u2019s ranks to become its leader three years ago, faced more than three hours of questions from the House Judiciary Committee.

Employees donated $US1.6 million ($2m) to her campaign, about 80 per cent more than the amount given by workers at any other corporation, and executive chairman Eric Schmidt helped set up companies to analyse political data for the campaign.

Democrats, for their part, are rethinking their attitude toward regulating the company amid -allegations that Russia used -Google and other internet platforms in an attempt to influence the 2016 presidential election.</p><p>For the past two decades, Washington has taken a largely hands-off role in regulating the internet, helping winners such as Google and Facebook grow to spectacular size and influence.</p><p>Today, the rise of populist movements in both parties has forced a reckoning around the concentration of economic power in big businesses. Populist -conservatives are particularly hostile to big tech, given its size and pervasive influence, as well as its support for immigration rights and other causes that clash with their economic nationalism.</p><p>\"For the populist right, this is a major, major issue of the 2018 election,\" Mr Bannon said. \"We're going to make it a big deal. I can already tell it resonates.\" Hearings were being held overnight in congress on the Russia issue, in a rare public grilling of the tech giants that could focus rising concerns. Democratic -senators Mark Warner of Virginia and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota have introduced a bill along with Arizona senator John McCain, a Republican, that would require internet firms to disclose the financial backers of political ads on the internet.</p><p>Google, which commented only on specific policy issues, said in a written statement: \"We -support efforts to improve transparency, enhance disclosures and reduce foreign abuse. We're -evaluating steps we can take on our own platforms and will work closely with politicians, the (Federal Election Commission) and the industry to explore the best solutions.\" Google has found that Russian-linked entities bought tens of thousands of dollars worth of -politically motivated ads on its platform around the presidential election, according to \u00e2\u20ac\u0192sources. But, \"the further they dig, the more they come up with\", said -another \u00e2\u20ac\u0192source.</p><p>Google executives, including general counsel Kent Walker, met with Facebook and other tech firms in northern California earlier this month to map out possible joint strategies to address worries raised by the hearings, -according to a \u00e2\u20ac\u0192source. Tech -executives were particularly -concerned that once-friendly congressional Democrats were suddenly criticising them. No clear solutions emerged from the meeting, the person said.</p><p>Google's rivals in old-line media companies are encouraging this new scrutiny in Washington and have in recent years dubbed their effort \"Project -Goliath\", according to emails among the companies that were hacked and posted online in 2014. Some companies have criticised the way Google surfaces news stories, including News Corp, owner of The Wall Street Journal.</p><p>Telecom AT&amp;T suggested it might accept some legislation that Google opposed, and lobbyists for software company Oracle held a series of briefings behind the scenes for Capitol Hill aides and reporters designed to show how much information Google's Android phones collect. One of the primary reasons for Google's political muscle in Washington has been its ability to forge ties, particularly with Democrats.Overall, Alphabet has spent $US13.6m on lobbying this year as of the end of September, compared with 2016's full-year total of $US15.4m, according to lobbying-disclosure records compiled by the nonpartisan Center for -Responsive Politics. Cumulatively over the past five years, only Boeing has spent more on lobbying in Washington than Google.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THEAUS-TheAustralian20171101Australian22000351149309</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THEAUS2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PVF-16K1-JD3N-52DN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244777</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-10-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"833\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Australian</publicationName><edition>Australian Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"11\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>November 1, 2017 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

If there's one thing that this referendum proves, it's that this just isn't true any more.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">When (or if!) the dust settles on next weekend's vote, one of the big analysis points might be the extent to which online social channels, and search engines were suddenly acknowledged as critical to political outcomes in this country.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Arguably the biggest single campaigning issue in the referendum has been a decision by Google and Facebook to change their advertising policies.</p><p>For those who missed the finer points of it (and I'm not sure many did), the two companies did slightly different things.</p><p>Facebook simply restricted ads to internally placed cash, cutting out any foreign sources of advertising.</p><p>Google, though, made a much more unusual policy change to cease all referendum ads. It was an about-turn that took many by surprise and was greeted as a significant event.</p><p>This decision was described in the Irish Times by its political editor, Pat Leahy, as \"an important moment\" in the campaign.</p><p>Leahy, who I worked with previously at a newspaper, is not known for being dazzled by technology or online fora.</p><p>But it's increasingly clear that platforms such as Facebook and Google (through YouTube) are where large numbers of Irish citizens now spend more time than any other single format, including conventional television.</p><p>This doesn't mean you can win an election on Twitter. But it's starting to look like you can lose one on Facebook and Google.</p><p>And it's not just the big utility platforms such as Facebook, Whatsapp and YouTube where digital media is now penetrative.</p><p>The most talked-about referendum-related issue last week was a confrontation on Eamon Dunphy's 'The Stand' podcast between Dunphy and the veteran journalist and 'No' campaigner, John Waters.</p><p>Having become worked up about a line of questioning he objected to, Waters stormed out of the podcast on Thursday, calling Dunphy a \"f***ing b******s\" as he did so. Dunphy pleaded with Waters not to leave, assuring Waters that he, too, is a 'No' voter.</p><p>It was painful listening, but compulsive and authentic.</p><p>The podcast segment was pre-recorded. But Dunphy released it anyway, saying he wanted his listeners to \"make up their own minds\".</p><p>Within hours, it was the main talking point of that day's campaign coverage.</p><p>(By the time you read this media column, it will likely have surpassed one million streams, putting it ahead of virtually any radio or television segment during the same week.) A freak one-off moment of audio voyeurism? Probably not. Podcasts are now a permanent, under-reported, facet of media consumption.</p><p>The country's most listened-to Irish podcasts pull in over 100,000 streams each and every week. That's more than all but a handful of radio shows.</p><p>(A disclaimer: I host a tech podcast, 'The Big Tech Show'. It's not yet quite at 100,000 streams.) Will the ad moves by Google and Facebook bear further scrutiny when the referendum is over? I think they will, regardless of the outcome.</p><p>It is precisely because of the power that Google wields that its decision, in particular, was an extraordinary one.</p><p>Remember that Google and Facebook, between them, control around half of all online advertising. Google has the bigger share, thanks to the combination of its search words and YouTube video ads.</p><p>The consequences of its decisions around what it will or will not allow now arguably goes beyond the scope of a single private entity.</p><p>The European Commission may probably get around to this, as they are already scoping out the company's dominance in <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.search.No\">www.search.No</url> one in Google was willing to talk on the record about the decision to axe all ads relating to the referendum. But the nervousness around the issue, even from Google staff talking on background, was unusual.</p><p>As for the decision itself, it does look like Google executives took a pre-emptive step to avoid getting embroiled in a blame game should the referendum on the Eighth Amendment be defeated.</p><p>From a commercial and regulatory perspective, that's a smart (if crude) move.</p><p>From a civic standpoint, it throws up altogether different issues to be considered, going forward, about the role and provenance of utility-like platforms such as Google and Facebook in democratic elections.</p><p>Twitter, in case you were wondering, doesn't accept ads around the referendum either.</p><p>But that was a decision it took from the start, rather than a couple of weeks from the actual poll.</p><p>(In any case, Twitter is considered less important - to everyone except journalists - both because it has more partisan public users and because it has a far lower user base than either Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram or YouTube.) The extent to which these platforms have now entered - and, in some cases, overtaken - some mainstream media channels could result in further moments of clarity.</p><p>One of these may be when Facebook releases more (much-awaited) data around advertising penetration for those who spend money on the platform.</p><p>In the meantime, I don't think we've heard the last of the ad policies around the Irish Eighth referendum.</p><p>Five years ago, a decision by any social platform around this would have been seen as peripheral.</p><p>Today, it is undeniably central. We need to start setting out some clearer rules about what the big online platforms can and can't do.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SINDIR-137754799</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SINDIR2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SC8-8MC1-JBVM-Y3WV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">333993</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-05-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"888\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Independent Newspapers Ireland Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Sunday Independent</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"58258\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"05\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>May 20, 2018</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>National Edition</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"99\"><className>Initiative &amp;

Australia announced last month that firms such as Google and Facebook would have to pay news media for content, after 18 months of negotiations ended without agreement.    The landmark measures would include fines worth millions of dollars for non-compliance and force transparency around the closely guarded algorithms firms use to rank content.    Google is now fighting a rearguard action to prevent the measures from entering into force\u2014and been accused by Australia of spreading \u201cmisinformation\u201d in the process.    On Monday it told users in a new homepage pop-up that \u201cthe way Aussies use Google is at risk\u201d and their search experience \u201cwill be hurt\u201d by the changes.    The technology titan linked to an open letter claiming it would be forced to hand over users\u2019 search data to news media companies and give them information that would \u201chelp them artificially inflate their ranking\u201d above other websites.    Google says it already partners with Australian news media by paying them millions of dollars and sending billions of clicks each year, suggesting the changes could put its free services \u201cat risk\u201d.    \u201cBut rather than encouraging these types of partnerships, the law is set up to give big media companies special treatment and to encourage them to make enormous and unreasonable demands that would put our free services at risk,\u201d the letter states.    The legislation will initially focus on Facebook and Google\u2014two of the world\u2019s richest and most powerful companies\u2014but could eventually apply to any digital platform.    Australia\u2019s proposals are being closely watched around the world, as regulators increasingly train their focus on the rapidly changing sector.    News media worldwide have suffered in the digital economy, where big tech firms overwhelmingly capture advertising revenue.    The crisis has been exacerbated by the economic collapse caused by the coronavirus pandemic, with dozens of Australian newspapers closed and hundreds of journalists sacked in recent months.    Unlike other countries\u2019 so-far unsuccessful efforts to force the platforms to pay for news, the Australian initiative relies on competition law rather than copyright regulations.    The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, which is drafting the government\u2019s code of conduct, hit back at Google\u2019s open letter saying it \u201ccontains misinformation\u201d.    The consumer watchdog said the digital behemoth would \u201cnot be required\u201d to share additional user data with the news media or charge Australians to use its free services \u201cunless it chooses to do so\u201d.    \u201cThe draft code will allow Australian news businesses to negotiate for fair payment for their journalists\u2019 work that is included on Google services,\u201d it said in a statement.    It has strong support from local media outlets and is expected to be introduced this year.    Click on Deccan Chronicle Technology and Science for the latest news and reviews .

Google's woes in Europe: The European Commission is expected to announce a major antitrust fine against Google over allegations that it pushed its apps on smartphone users and thwarted competitors.</p><p>The accusations have been under investigation since 2015. An announcement is expected around 7 a.m. ET.</p><p>EU regulators have taken a much more adversarial approach to big tech companies than their US counterparts, especially when it comes to competition, data protection and tax issues.</p><p>2. Elon Musk apologizes: Tesla boss Elon Musk has apologized for calling one of the men involved in the Thai cave rescue mission a \"pedo,\" or pedophile. </p><p>Musk faced an intense backlash over the unfounded claim against Vernon Unsworth, an expert caver who participated in the rescue mission that saved 12 boys and their soccer coach from a flooded cave in Thailand. </p><p>The executive said on Twitter that while Unsworth provoked him, \"his actions against me do not justify my actions against him, and for that I apologize to Mr. Unsworth and to the companies I represent as leader. The fault is mine and mine alone.\" </p><p>Gene Munster, a top tech analyst and the managing partner at Loup Ventures, wrote an open letter to Musk this week urging him to rein in his outbursts and erratic behavior so he might \"regain investor confidence.\"</p><p>3. Market movers -- EasyJet, Texas Instruments: Shares in EasyJet increased 3% in London as investors cheered the latest quarterly update from the low-cost carrier. </p><p>Shares in Texas Instruments could take a hit at the open after its new CEO unexpectedly stepped down.</p><p>Texas Instruments said CEO Brian Crutcher resigned because of personal behavior that violated the company's code of conduct. Crutcher, a 22-year veteran of the company, just took over as CEO last month.</p><p>\"The violations are related to personal behavior that is not consistent with our ethics and core values, but not related to company strategy, operations or financial reporting,\" the company said in a statement Tuesday.</p><p>4. Global market overview: US stock futures were holding steady.</p><p>European markets were mixed in early trading.</p><p>Asian markets were more volatile, with the Hang Seng dropping 1.2%. The Nikkei closed with a 0.4% gain. </p><p>The Dow Jones industrial average gained 0.2% on Tuesday. The S&amp;P 500 increased 0.4% and the Nasdaq jumped 0.6% to hit a new record high.</p><p>The British pound is trading close to its lowest level of the year amid deep concerns over Brexit and the government's strategy for the divorce.</p><p>5. Earnings and economics: Morgan Stanley is releasing earnings before the open. </p><p>Alcoa, American Express, eBay, IBM and Kinder Morgan will follow after the close.</p><p>Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell continues his testimony on Capitol Hill, in front of the House Financial Services Committee. </p><p>The US central bank will release its Beige Book at 2 p.m. ET, giving investors and economists deeper insight into the health of the US economy.</p><p>6.

This is one reason why lawmakers and regulators are asking whether Google has too much power. NPR tech correspondent Shannon Bond is here to explain. Welcome.             </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SHANNON BOND:                 Hi, Audie.             </p><p>AUDIE CORNISH:                 We should disclose right now Google is among NPR's financial supporters. Shannon, I want to talk to you about your reporting because you've actually been speaking with some of the companies that take issue with the search results. What are their concerns?             </p><p>SHANNON BOND:                 Yeah. So I'll give you an example. There's a company called Basecamp, and they sell software. And they say if you Google their name, you may, in search results, not actually see them as the top result. You might see some ads for their competitors.             </p><p>                And so Basecamp says, look; in order to appear at the top of our own search results on our own name, we actually had to buy ads. In fact, they bought an ad that said, we don't want to buy this ad. And they felt like they had to do it in order to be able to be visible to their customers.             </p><p>                So I spoke to Jason Fried, Basecamp's CEO, over Skype, and here's what he had to say about Google.             </p><p>JASON FRIED:                 Now that they own the market, they're using that market power to force brands, especially small businesses, to have to pay up to be found. And I find that to be just totally unfair. And it shouldn't be that way. And I'm glad that attention's being brought to that topic.             </p><p>SHANNON BOND:                 Yeah. And when he says market power, I mean, remember, Audie; Google makes billions of dollars every year selling ads in search results. And those top results are where people are going to click. So this really matters to a company like Basecamp.             </p><p>AUDIE CORNISH:                 Is this just public griping, or are they doing more?             </p><p>SHANNON BOND:                 Well, Basecamp is complaining in public. They've taken to Twitter about this. They say they're not going to pursue any further action. But Google has faced lawsuits about this. There's the company Edible Arrangements. You probably know them. They make fruit baskets and sell chocolate-dipped strawberries. They've actually filed a federal lawsuit over this exact issue about rival ads.             </p><p>                But now there is actually a new outlet for companies that have grievances against Google. There's a bunch of investigations that are going on into the company and its power. So we see the Justice Department looking at this. We see a group of attorneys general. And we see Congress holding hearings. And fundamentally, you know, these investigations show us that the attitudes toward tech's power are really changing. That's what antitrust lawyers and experts that I've been talking to say. And that gives more ears - more receptive ears - for companies like Basecamp and other complainers.             </p><p>AUDIE CORNISH:                 So you have this new wave of scrutiny. How is Google responding?             </p><p>SHANNON BOND:                 So they say on this specific issue of these rival ads and search results, you know, that's something they say is just standard practice in online advertising. Other search engines sell those kinds of ads. And they say, look; you know, a company can buy ads against its competitors or buy its own keyword. And they also point to a 2013 result of an investigation by the Federal Trade Commission that found Google didn't violate any antitrust or competition laws in how it displays search results. And more specifically about the recent investigations, the company says it engages in robust and fair competition and will work with regulators.             </p><p>                But they have come under pressure elsewhere. I mean, we see in Europe they think this is a really big deal. The EU has fined Google $9 billion in total in the past few years over these things of how they treat competitors and other companies.             </p><p>AUDIE CORNISH:                 So that's the EU. What's the next step in all this here?             </p><p>SHANNON BOND:                 Well, if the Justice Department or the state attorneys general feel their case is strong enough, they could take Google to court and, you know, try to force some changes. That's probably not going to happen anytime soon. We're at the early stages of these investigations, and we're heading into an election year next year, which could change things up.             </p><p>                Ultimately, whether they decide to bring those cases will depend on how they want to interpret antitrust law. And antitrust experts I spoke to said, look; you know, it's not illegal to be unfair. You know, there isn't a duty to be fair to your competitors or to your clients. And so they'd have to show some kind of concrete harm to consumers. Google's critics say there is concrete harm that, you know, they may not be showing the best search results. So the question is are you seeing the best results from anywhere on the Web when you search for something, or are you seeing results that benefit Google itself?             </p><p>AUDIE CORNISH:                 That's NPR's Shannon Bond. Shannon, thanks for explaining it.             </p><p>SHANNON BOND:                 Thank you.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF DUCKETT'S \"LOOKING AT MUM OBJECTIVELY\")            </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NPRATC-2019101409</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NPRATC2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X8M-TCX1-DY2S-N35J-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">429236</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"979\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 National Public Radio (R) All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>NPR All Things Considered</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 14, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

That sort of personalization could help with many things that Googledoes, such as improving search results or providing better driving directions.</p><p>Schmidt said he recognized four years ago that Googleneeded to counter Facebookand even wrote memos to that effect.</p><p>\"I did nothing about the memos I wrote,\" Schmidt said. \"The CEO should take responsibility. I screwed up.\"</p><p>Schmidt's comments came during a wide-ranging conversation with Walt Mossberg and Kara Swisher, reporters for The Wall Street Journal's All Things D website, which puts on the D conference. The conversation with Schmidt was the opening session of the conference.</p><p>During his appearance, Schmidt discussed everything from privacy to Google's relationship with Apple and other big tech companies to his fears concerning how governments will try to regulate the Internet.</p><p>Privacy has been a particular sore spot for Google, prompting multiple government inquiries into the data Googlecollects and what it does with it. Most recently, with the revelation of a location-tracking file on Apple's iPhone, questions have been raised by privacy experts, industry insiders and -- as Swisher said, by Apple CEO Steve Jobs -- about the type of location data collected by phones running Google's Android software.</p><p>Schmidt said the company tries to be transparent with users about how it's using their data. It collects users' location data for certain applications, such as GoogleLatitude, which users opt in to using. It also is specifically designed to share location with other consumers. The company also collects anonymized location information but doesn't retain it, he said.</p><p>Regarding Apple, Schmidt acknowledged the relationship could be tense but said Googlehad recently renewed its deals with Apple for search and maps for the iPhone.</p><p>Schmidt recently stepped aside as Google CEO and was replaced by co-founder Larry Page. In his new role as executive chairman, Schmidt spends a lot of his time on the road making sales calls, he said. One sales deal that he wasn't able to complete was with the music companies, he noted.</p><p>Googlerecently launched a cloud-based music service that allows users to store their digital music files on Google's servers. But the company launched the service without the support of the major music labels.</p><p>\"We've been attempting to convince the music industry\" to work with Google. \"We haven't been successful.\"</p><p>Contact Troy Wolverton at 408-920-5021.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>FILE - In this Jan. 19, 2011 file photo, <person><nameText>Google Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt </nameText></person>smiles outside of Googleheadquarters in Mountain View, Calif.

Google's search engine is among, or  maybe, the most powerful machine in - in human history. It's probably the  most influential. Its results shape the way we understand the world.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Most of us assume that on some level it is honest, Google search. But what  if it's not honest? What if Google is secretly corrupting its search  results to influence votes? Tonight we have exclusive evidence that that  may in fact be happening at Google. We'll have the report for you in a  minute. Don't miss that. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We also have a can't-miss championship edition of Final Exams, Shannon  Bream and Katie Pavlich for the belt coming up as well.</p><p>But first tonight, the claim against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh  that he committed some kind of sexual assault, while a student in high  school, has metastasized into something different, something ugly, and  something threatening to all of us.</p><p>We've learned remarkably little about Brett Kavanaugh or Christine Ford in  the past week despite a lot of words on their behalf. The facts of the case  are still sparse and they're murky. </p><p>But we've learned a disturbing amount about the Left and what it's willing  to do in order to maintain control of this country. Watch a clip from today  in which New York Senator, Kirsten Gillibrand, explained why she knows  Brett Kavanaugh is guilty. Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>KIRSTEN ELIZABETH GILLIBRAND, JUNIOR UNITED STATES SENATOR, NEW YORK: I  believe her because she's telling the truth. She's asking the FBI to  investigate her claims. She's asking for that kind of review, that  investigative work, that oversight, that accountability because she's  telling the truth. Someone who is lying does not ask the FBI to investigate  their claims. Who is not asking the FBI to investigate these claims? The  White House. Dr. Kavanaugh - excuse me--</p><p>MAZIE KEIKO HIRONO, JUNIOR UNITED STATES SENATOR, HAWAII: Judge--</p><p>GILLIBRAND: --Judge Kavanaugh has not asked to have the FBI review these  claims. Is that the - is that the reaction of an innocent person? It is  not.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>CARLSON: So try to ignore the yelling there and the theatrics and the pure  demagoguery of the moment and focus instead on Kirsten Gillibrand's  reasoning to the extent that there is any. </p><p>\"I believe her because she's telling the truth.\" Or put it another way,  it's true because it is. </p><p>Now, in logic class, they call this circular reasoning which isn't actually  reasoning at all. Instead, it's simply a demand that you believe something  because someone else is asserting it. Children talk this way. You think you  a U.S. senator would be embarrassed to.</p><p>But it's the second part of Gillibrand's statement that you ought to pay  attention to because it's scary. Kavanaugh hasn't called for yet another  FBI investigation into himself. Therefore, Senator Gillibrand says he did  it. Is that the reaction of an innocent person, she thunders? It is not.</p><p>Well not since the McCarthy era almost 70 years ago have lawmakers talked  like this in this country. Unless you call for an FBI investigation of  yourself, you're guilty of a crime. Even Joe McCarthy himself never said  anything like that. It was too reckless even for him.</p><p>And now, one of the Democratic Party's leading presidential candidates  casually drops the line at a press conference and the media hardly notice.  So, apparently that's the new standard in Washington.</p><p>OK. Well let's start with Kirsten Gillibrand. Gillibrand was a friend of  Harvey Weinstein's. Here's a picture of the two of them together. Weinstein  has been credibly accused of rape. Did Kirsten Gillibrand know about  Weinstein's sexual assaults? Was she an accessory to them?</p><p>We've asked those questions before on this show but we never got an answer.  Why hasn't Gillibrand demanded an FBI investigation into herself to clear  that up? Is that the reaction of an innocent person? By her standards, it's  not.</p><p>So bring on the FBI. Let them interview Kirsten Gillibrand under oath,  maybe surprise her at her home at dawn with a search warrant. </p><p>And while they're at it, they should take a very close look at her  relationship with Bill Clinton, another accused rapist. No doubt the  Senator will beg for an investigation into that too assuming she's  innocent. If she hesitates, press charges.</p><p>This is lunatic. Sober liberals understand that it is. Democrats don't want  Brett Kavanaugh on the court because they disagree with him and that's  understandable, by the way. They're angry that the Republican Senate  refused to vote on Barack Obama's last Supreme Court nominee Merrick  Garland. That's understandable too.</p><p>But what's happening now is dangerous in a way that has nothing to do with  politics. It's a threat to the civil liberties of every American, no matter  who you voted for in 2016. Extremism has exploded on the Left and nobody is  trying to contain it. </p><p>Here's one particularly jarring example of that. This is Congressman John  Garamendi of California. We know him well. He's one of the few House  Democrats willing to come on this show. </p><p>We don't usually agree with Garamendi but we've always found him to be a  decent and reasonable person, always. Here's what he just said about the  Kavanaugh allegations.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOHN RAYMOND GARAMENDI, CALIFORNIA CONGRESSMAN, DEMOCRATIC PARTY  MEMBER:  Women across this nation should be outraged at what these White men  senators are doing to this woman. The senators - the male senators who  control that committee are playing the game as old as an assault. And that  is the woman's the accused. The woman is at fault.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Wait a second. What does the race of specific senators have to do  with any of this? Should we be angry at them because of their skin color?  Should we distrust them more? Are they inherently less fair or less decent  because of the way they look?</p><p>Garamendi is implying exactly that. So, how is that different or better  than anything George Wallace ever said? Well it's not, except that suddenly  this filth is everywhere, so you hardly even notice it. The last thing this  country needs right now is more racial division.</p><p>Democrats are pushing it anyway. They're using allegations that have  literally nothing to do with race at all. But splitting the country into  tiny warring groups is useful to them. It helps them maintain their power  and so they're happy to do it. Men against women, Black against White,  divide and conquer whatever it takes.</p><p>In the end, it's unlikely that we'll ever know conclusively what happened  between Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Ford 36 years ago, if anything at  all. But it's crystal clear what's happening right now. </p><p>This is a power grab. It is hurting the country destroying our centuries'  old traditions of justice and empowering morons and demagogues. We ought to  shut it down right now. </p><p>And yet, and this is late-breaking news, just seconds before airtime we  learned that this may go on and on. Republicans on the Hill tonight are  considering delaying the hearing scheduled for Monday. At this point, Brett  Kavanaugh will be testifying by himself to some future date.</p><p>Because of the rules of the Senate, that would push back the vote on  Kavanaugh by at least a week, if not more, which is, of course, the whole  point, to drag the country through this pointless charade, this circus,  which divides us and hurts us and degrades our standards of justice simply  for political ends. That's where we are.</p><p>Ian Samuel is a Professor at Indiana University Law School and he joins us  tonight. Professor, I'm glad you're here as a law professor. I - I want to  ask you about what Senator Gillibrand said today. </p><p>She's a lawyer as well, I believe. And she said that the new standard is  unless you call for an FBI investigation into yourself you are by  definition guilty. Is that a legal standard that you recognize?</p><p>IAN SAMUEL, ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR OF LAW, INDIANA UNIVERSITY: Well what I  like to think about is if I were, as Brett Kavanaugh says, an innocent man  and if I were falsely accused of something this serious what would I want? </p><p>And as I - and I teach Civil Procedure and I think about Criminal Procedure  and as I think through that question what I would want is a process that  was regarded as so fair even by my audiological adversaries that I would  live the rest of my life being able to point to the process and say, we had  this out and everyone can agree the way we did it was fair and I was  cleared.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>SAMUEL: That's what I would want.</p><p>CARLSON: I would want that too. And I think we would both agree that the  first thing you would want in that process is a full explanation of what  the charges are from the person who's making them. And he hasn't received  that. None of us have.</p><p>But barring that and I'm not attacking her, though I think all of us should  be distressed that she's not explaining herself, but that's not what  Gillibrand said. </p><p>She said if you don't ask for an FBI investigation into yourself that is an  indication that you are guilty. And let me just suggest the obvious which  is that is insane, that is a third world standard, that is an un-American  standard, and it's hard for me to believe that an elected U.S. senator  would say something like that in public. You're not surprised by it though.</p><p>SAMUEL: Well two things actually as to that. So number one, if I were an  innocent man I would actually welcome the FBI investigating. I might not  call for it but I would say \"Sure, investigate.\" You will see that I am an  innocent man.</p><p>But the second thing when I was listening to you talk about this, you said  and you pointed out, I think, quite correctly, many of the senior members  of the Democratic Party are credibly associated with important sexual  predators like Harvey Weinstein--</p><p>CARLSON: Sure.</p><p>SAMUEL: --and I thought what you were going to say was it would be a good  idea to investigate that, which I do agree with. And it seems like you're  kind of going in the opposite--</p><p>CARLSON: No, because - and I am going in the opposite direction--</p><p>SAMUEL: --direction. I don't really think that this is a partisan issue  (ph)--</p><p>CARLSON: --well let me - and it's of course it's not a partisan issue. </p><p>The point that I am making is that guilt by association is a low and  immoral tactic. And we used to revile people who engaged in it like Senator  Joe McCarthy of Wisconsin. And now, it's so commonplace, we don't notice  it. </p><p>And so the idea is if you've had dinner with somebody who has unsavory  views or unpopular views, you can be fired. And we've seen people fired  recently from - for that very thing. Guilt by association is not the same  as guilt.</p><p>And so, to say that because Kirsten Gillibrand was friends with Harvey  Weinstein that she is somehow an accessory to his sexual predation is  totally wrong. And I would never make that claim. I was merely saying that- -</p><p>SAMUEL: That's - that's fine. If that's not what you're suggesting, I - I  appreciate--</p><p>CARLSON: --by the standard that she holds them--</p><p>SAMUEL: --that.</p><p>CARLSON: --it's not. What I'm suggesting is that--</p><p>SAMUEL: Fine.</p><p>CARLSON: --she shouldn't say that innocent people have a moral obligation  to call down upon themselves an FBI investigation. That's insane. Why  doesn't anyone--</p><p>SAMUEL: Oh, I quite - I quite agree--</p><p>CARLSON: --stop her and say--</p><p>SAMUEL: --with that.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>SAMUEL: But if I were an innocent man I wouldn't think of it as my  obligation but rather my privilege--</p><p>CARLSON: Well I mean I--</p><p>SAMUEL: I will insist--</p><p>CARLSON: I don't - I mean (ph)--</p><p>SAMUEL: --if I were Brett Kavanaugh and if I were an innocent man I would  insist on pointing every camera--</p><p>CARLSON: Hold I mean (ph)--</p><p>SAMUEL: --on God's green earth in my face as I denied these allegations if  I were an innocent man--</p><p>CARLSON: But I - I believe he--</p><p>SAMUEL: --truthfully. And I want everyone to see it, wouldn't you?</p><p>CARLSON: --I believe - I believe - I believe he's already done that. I  think he's been the subject of six FBI investigations into his background -  background checks by federal agents. And I believe he's testifying Monday  and he'll likely repeat what he's already said which is \"I don't know what  she's talking about. I didn't do this.\"</p><p>She, by contrast, who is the reason we're having this conversation in the  first place, leveled the charge of felonious behavior against a public  official and then has refused to explain herself. So, where's the onus on  her? </p><p>She's dragged the whole country into this and short-circuited a process the  rest of us are vested in and not bothered to explain herself? I know you're  not supposed to like attack the victim. But at some point, she's not in  charge of this country so why can't we ask her for the full story?</p><p>SAMUEL: Well I do think that the - look, as we say often in the law, the  government is entitled to every person's evidence. And I do think it would  be very useful--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, exactly.</p><p>SAMUEL: --if she would testify. </p><p>But again, just to keep with the frame a little bit, if I were Brett  Kavanaugh and if I were an innocent man I would say look, you don't want to  testify on Monday? Take a week. Take two weeks, take a month because when  this is done, and if I'm confirmed, I will not live my life under a cloud  where people can say \"Well the reason you got through is because we rushed  it.\"</p><p>CARLSON: Uh huh.</p><p>SAMUEL: Take a month. This is my life.</p><p>CARLSON: But - but what - I understand but then--</p><p>SAMUEL: That's what I would do if I were an innocent man.</p><p>CARLSON: --if you are facing opponents who publicly declared that you were  guilty on the basis of no evidence, and used as evidence the fact that you  didn't request an FBI investigation into yourself you would acknowledge  you're dealing with unreasonable people who don't care about justice who  are merely trying to destroy your life for political ends, so maybe you'd  behave differently or am I being crazy here?</p><p>SAMUEL: Well I don't know about that. If I were facing unreasonable people  and if I were an innocent man what I would say is fine, you want to delay  the hearing a month? Delay it. You want the FBI to look into it? Look into  it. You want to interview this witness in closed session, in open session--</p><p>CARLSON: So more people can accuse me anonymously of--</p><p>SAMUEL: --look into it. I am an innocent man.</p><p>CARLSON: --yes, uh huh. Yes, I wish we lived in a country - I'd be happy to  participate in such a system. But when you have people saying what Kirsten  Gillibrand said today or Congressman Garamendi said today, you're dealing  with unreasonable people who don't care about justice and it's scary. And I  know that you believe that his (ph)--</p><p>SAMUEL: Prosecutors often don't and that is why--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, I agree.</p><p>SAMUEL: --it would be important--</p><p>CARLSON: I agree.</p><p>SAMUEL: I would think in his position to position yourself as a person who  says these people are unreasonable and the way I will prove it to you is I  will give them everything they want and they will find nothing.</p><p>CARLSON: I think he's doing that Monday.</p><p>SAMUEL: I am an innocent man--</p><p>CARLSON: Uh all right (ph).</p><p>SAMUEL: --if I were an innocent man.</p><p>CARLSON: I think that's the claim. Professor, thank you very much.</p><p>SAMUEL: Thank you very much for having me.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, our long-term investigation into Google and its behavior and  practices has borne fruit tonight. We have internal documents that show  Google employees plotting to use the company's search engine, the very core  of its business, which has a monopoly on search in this country, to  undermine the Administration's immigration policy without telling you,  secretively and dishonestly. That exclusive is next.</p><p>The news has been overwhelming tonight. A very special break from the  madness are two-time all champ - all-time champions face off in the  ultimate Final Exam. They are, as you know, Shannon Bream and Katie  Pavlich, coming up.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CARLSON: Tonight, we have a development in our ongoing exclusive  investigation into the behavior of Google. There are new emails first  obtained by this show.</p><p>Now Google, as you know, is the most powerful company in the history of the  world. Virtually all human information flows through its software. And for  that reason, Google shapes much of how the world understands reality.</p><p>At the heart of Google's business is its search engine which has a virtual  monopoly on search in this country and others. Google search succeeds  because it is blindingly efficient but also because it is perceived as  honest.</p><p>When you search for a term on Google, the most popular results come to the  top. The process is straightforward and democratic. That's what most people  think. That's how it's perceived and that's why the world trusts Google.</p><p>But what if Google was lying to you? What if the results that you got were  secretly weighted to get you to vote a certain way, to believe a certain  thing? That would affect a lot of people and a lot of votes.</p><p>In fact, it would be impossible to have a real democracy under  circumstances like that. A small number of incredibly rich people would be  in charge of everything including your perceptions. </p><p>Well that is a major concern for all of us because Google is a very  political company. We recently showed you email evidence of the Google  effort to collude with a Left-wing group in support of Hillary Clinton's  presidential campaign.</p><p>Now tonight, we have internal documents that show that Google employees  discussed corrupting the company's search engine to push propaganda on  hundreds of millions of unsuspecting users. Here's what happened.</p><p>Shortly after taking office, President Trump issued his now-famous travel  ban. Almost immediately after that, Google employees began plotting ways to  undermine the President's Executive Order. </p><p>On January 29th, a Google Product Marketing Manager named Mackenzie Thomas  sent an email to a group of fellow employees. \"There is a large brainstorm  going on throughout the marketing org\" she wrote, brainstorming about how  to respond to Trump's order.</p><p>Among Thomas' ideas was \"To actively counter algorithmically biased results  for search terms such as Islam, Iran, Mexico, Latino and so forth.\"</p><p>In other words, Google employees wanted to alter the search results to make  them more positive in certain cases for political reasons. Thomas also  suggested promoting links for making donations to organizations fighting  the travel ban.</p><p>This, of course, would be completely dishonest and unethical behavior. But  Thomas' colleagues at Google seemed to approve of it strongly. Product  Manager Rami Banna (ph), for example, replied this way. \"We're absolutely  in Mackenzie, anything you need. We'll put together a list of orgs with  Meryl (ph) and HL (ph) team.\"</p><p>Another employee named Stacey Chen (ph) added that group she thought Google  should promote included the ACLU, the defect - the Immigration Defense  Project, the Arab-American Anti-Discrimination Committee and the National  Immigration Law Center. All of those groups were at the time agitating  against the President's immigration ban.</p><p>Even at least (ph) one person on the chain seemed to realize how dangerous  and out of the ordinary this conversation was. A Google employee called  Clement Wolf (ph) commented that \"He was very much in favor of Google  stepping up\" but was wondering \"How partisan we want to be on this? To the  extent of my knowledge, we'd be breaching precedent if we only gave  highlights access to organizations that support a certain view.\"</p><p>We contacted Google about these remarkable emails and the reply to us is  here in full. </p><p>\"These emails were just a brainstorm of ideas, none of which were ever  implemented. Google has never manipulated its search results or modified  any of its products to promote a particular political ideology - not in the  current campaign season, not during the 2016 election, and not in the  aftermath of President Trump's Executive Order on immigration. Our  processes and policies would not have allowed for any manipulation of  search results to promote political ideologies.\"</p><p>Left unanswered by Google was why anyone would believe that statement for a  second. Nor did Google say anything about the employees on that email  chain. Presumably, they still work at Google which is remarkable.</p><p>If you ran a bank and caught your tellers brainstorming about how to rob  the vault, would they still work for you? Remember that Google fired an  engineer called James Damore last summer almost instantly.</p><p>The CEO flew back from family vacation to fire him. Why? Because Damore was  caught expressing mildly conservatives ideas in a private memo. Here,  Google employees are plotting to subvert our entire public conversation  secretly. But that's fine with Google. </p><p>It shouldn't be fine with any of us or with the U.S. Congress. Google  executives are scheduled to testify on Capitol Hill next week. The  scheduled topic is privacy. But it would be nice if at least one elected  representative asked about this because it's much scarier than anything  Russia ever attempted.</p><p>Peter Schweizer wrote Clinton Cash. He now has a fantastic new documentary  called the Creepy Line about big tech and he joins us tonight. Are you  surprised by this?</p><p>PETER FRANZ SCHWEIZER, AMERICAN INVESTIGATIVE JOURNALIST, NOVELIST, AUTHOR,  POLITICAL CONSULTANT: Not really. It's just further confirmation that  Google has been cooking the books as it relates to search. </p><p>And you're absolutely right. I mean this would be like a company having a  brainstorming session on how we're going to fiddle with the books in - in -  in accounting. Then you're going to step back and say \"No, we were just  having a brainstorming session.\"</p><p>It - it speaks to the culture of the company. And the culture of the  company is they are prepared to put their thumb on the scale and shift the  debate in favor of the direction that they want to go.</p><p>CARLSON: But this is so corrupt that it's--</p><p>SCHWEIZER: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: --I was stunned by it--</p><p>SCHWEIZER: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: --and I was worried that these emails were not authentic because  it's such a big (ph) so search is the core of Google's business.</p><p>SCHWEIZER: Right (ph).</p><p>CARLSON: It's many different things, Google, but basically, it's a search  engine. It was built on the back of one.</p><p>SCHWEIZER: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: And the promise has always been that they're not lying to you.</p><p>SCHWEIZER: Right.</p><p>CARLSON: But they are.</p><p>SCHWEIZER: That's right. And this is really the third strike as far as I'm  concerned. The first strike, of course, is the commercial search. When  travel websites and - and people like Yelp were complaining that they were,  you know, tilting the algorithm, you know--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>SCHWEIZER: --against them to others, Google said \"Absolutely not. We would  never do that.\" We now know the Federal Trade Commission, the EU, and  others have looked at this and said Google was fiddling with the algorithm.  The second strike as far as I'm concerned was the work done by Dr. Robert  Epstein--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>SCHWEIZER: --which shows clearly in 2016 that search was tilted to favor  Hillary Clinton. This is strike three. It shows that the culture of the  company is such that they're very happy having a free and open conversation  about manipulating the algorithm on a highly political subject.</p><p>CARLSON: But I don't understand. I mean so people go to jail for violating  our campaign finance laws because they put an extra ad on some cable  channel--</p><p>SCHWEIZER: Right.</p><p>CARLSON: --nobody watches.</p><p>SCHWEIZER: Right.</p><p>CARLSON: This is the most powerful company in the world.</p><p>SCHWEIZER: That's right.</p><p>CARLSON: How can we have a democracy in a country where Google can just get  whoever it wants elected by lying to us through the search function?</p><p>SCHWEIZER: It's a great example, Tucker, of regulations and campaign  finance laws not keeping up at all with where we are in technology. Nobody  were to consume (ph) when we pass laws about in-kind contributions to  campaign from companies that something like this would happen. </p><p>But this is the ultimate - the ultimate campaign contribution. This is not  like, you know, Exxon giving gasoline to a political campaign. This is a  company secretly tipping the scales in favor of candidates or causes or  beliefs that they have. It's done in secret. We don't know how it - how--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>SCHWEIZER: --extensive it's happening. And 80 to 90 percent of search in  the world is basically done through Google, so they have complete dominance  in this area.</p><p>CARLSON: And the Congress does nothing. And I can think of at least one  Republican senator who I believe has been bought off by Google. I don't  think he's alone.</p><p>SCHWEIZER: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: At some point it might be worth naming who those people are.  Peter, great to see you.</p><p>SCHWEIZER: Thanks, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: We're not going to stop this investigation into Google or any of  the other tech companies that increasingly seem to determine the direction  of this country. </p><p>Well a Republican Senate candidate is being denounced as a would-be  theocrat for saying that men have a duty to lead. He joins us to rebut his  critics after the break.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CARLSON: Well one of the pivotal facts of modern American life is that the  country and, particularly, its cities are pretty safe. They didn't always -  they weren't always safe. But for about last 20 years, the murder rate has  gone down. Now, sadly, it is rising again. But it's not surprising. </p><p>For years, the Left has been denouncing the cops as bigots, all of them.  Just the other day, Senate Candidate Beto O'Rourke in Texas called police  \"The new Jim Crow,\" and claim they shoot people just because of the color  of their skin.</p><p>So, think to yourself and be honest. Would you want to be a cop right now?  Who would want to be a cop? Why would you want to risk your life to protect  the public for very little pay while some moron like Beto O'Rourke who's  never even met you, knows nothing about you, calls you a bigot? It's  because of the uniform you wear.</p><p>It wouldn't be worth it for you probably. It's not worth it for a lot of  people. For that, among other reasons, American cities are becoming less  safe, much less safe, in some cases.</p><p>Yesterday, Attorney General Jeff Sessions went to Chicago. It's one of the  city's hardest hit by this trend. He laid out very clearly why more  Americans are getting killed in big cities. Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JEFF SESSIONS, UNITED STATES ATTORNEY GENERAL: The professors who studied  Chicago called it the ACLU Effect. Policing went down. Crime when up. So  there's a clear lesson here. If you want more shootings, more death, listen  to the ACLU, Antifa, Black Lives Matter and groups who do not know the  reality of policing.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: The funny thing is that most of these changes have taken place  under the pretext of civil liberties. And yet, the people pushing them  don't care about civil liberties, certainly not your civil liberties, in  case you haven't noticed. </p><p>They're the ones telling you if you don't call an FBI investigation down on  yourself you must be guilty, these civil libertarians. If you're older than  35 you may remember when America's great cities depopulated essentially,  practically destroyed by blight. </p><p>That was definitely true here in Washington, certainly in New York City.  They recovered and real estate boomed and lots of people became happy and  didn't die because they became safer. What happens when they get dangerous  again as they are? The Left doesn't seem to care at all.</p><p>Michigan Republican Senate candidate John James is coming under fire for  expressing an idea that leadership can be a masculine responsibility. Watch  this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOHN JAMES, REPUBLICAN MICHIGAN SENATE CANDIDATE: --men, we have a charge  to lead and we are failing in that because we are afraid to hurt someone's  feelings. The fact of the matter is women want men who've been tested. And  boys need to be tested. And--</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: So women like strong men. Well don't just ask that guy. Ask  anybody who's ever studied the subject. There are reams of social science  on this question. And most Americans think it sounds sensible. But just for  uttering these words, one writer at the Detroit Metro Times has accused  James of seeking a Handmaid's Tale style theocracy. </p><p>John James joins us tonight. Mr. James, thank you very much for coming on.</p><p>JAMES: Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: So before we get to what your critics are saying about you, why  don't you tell us what you were saying when you uttered those words?</p><p>JAMES: Absolutely. I was raised in the church. And I - I know based upon my  priorities which is God and country in that order, I also recognize we  talked a lot about rights in this country but not enough about  responsibilities. </p><p>I believe that we all have to step up. We are all created equal, male and  female, but I truly believe because of how I was raised that men have an  obligation to step up and not abandon their - their family  responsibilities, to step up and be role models and mentors in their  community and when I was talking to a faith-based business organization,  talking to men, talking about stepping up in their communities and holding  themselves accountable to be mentors.</p><p>The reason is right now the Left has very little way to attack me other  than take things out of context or just flat-out lie. I'm not going to fit  in anybody's blue box or anybody's red box. </p><p>I'm a conservative who believes very, very strongly in faith and family,  God and country, and service before itself. That's why I went off to serve  my country in Iraq. That's why I came back to build up my community right  here in Detroit. And that's why I'm going to go to Washington and continue  to serve my state.</p><p>CARLSON: So, just to be clear, you think that men should take care of the  families they create. And for that you're some kind of Ayatollah.</p><p>JAMES: Imagine that. I think that right now, particularly, in the African- American community, I believe that if I can be frank, and I know I can be  on this show that the overwhelming number of - of African-American females  having children are - are doing so and managing the role and responsibility  as a single parent.</p><p>I believe that men need to step up. And that's what I was talking about.  And the Left attacking me for that just proves that their business model is  dependent upon keeping Black folks dependent--</p><p>CARLSON: Exactly.</p><p>JAMES: --and in debt, and keeping them in the situation so they can make  sure that they depend on the Left for their vote. I - I'm not talking about  Left or Right. I'm not talking about Black and White. </p><p>I'm talking about the right thing, a message of economic opportunity where  we focus on early childhood development, K through 12 education, but you  have people here who talk a good game and talk about fixing the school  system here, talk about getting people out of there blight and their socio- economic downtrodden state, but then--</p><p>CARLSON: Exactly.</p><p>JAMES: --you have the ACLU who continues to allow these things to get in  the way. And I'm about creating--</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>JAMES: --freedom and opportunity for everyone, particularly in my - in my  community here in Detroit.</p><p>CARLSON: Good for you. Families are a threat to them. Marrying people vote  Republic and they hate the family as a result. That's the truth and I hope  you'll keep telling it.</p><p>JAMES: Yes (ph).</p><p>CARLSON: Thank you very much for coming on tonight.</p><p>JAMES: Thanks for having me.</p><p>CARLSON: Megyn Kelly had some brave and insightful words about the chaos  surrounding Brett Kavanaugh. We'll show them to you in just a minute. Mark  Steyn here to react to all that.</p><p>But first, the questions have been chosen. The crown is in place. The  champagne is cooling. It is time for the ultimate Final Exam. Shannon Bream  versus Katie Pavlich in a cage match to determine who wears the tiara, up  next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CARLSON: Time now for Final Exam. News has bumped this segment off the air  for the past couple of weeks but not tonight. This is the contest where you  pit news professionals against one another to see who's been paying the  most attention to the news in the last week.</p><p>This week, the biggest show of all this showdown. Last year, Fox News @  Night host Shannon Bream pulled off a full Brady Bunch. She beat nine  opponents in a row.</p><p>Now, Townhall's Katie Pavlich has matched that feat. So naturally, as  Pavlich goes for win number 10, the challenger is Shannon Bream.</p><p>SHANNON BREAM, HOST, FOX NEWS @ NIGHT: Hey (ph).</p><p>KATIE PAVLICH, CO-HOST, THE FIVE: Hey (ph).</p><p>BREAM: I did notice (ph)--</p><p>CARLSON: But when we find (ph) the ultimate Final Exam champion, and by the  way, since this segment has done so well, we've upped our budget, our own--</p><p>BREAM: OK.</p><p>CARLSON: --Vanna White, Emily Lin (ph) joins us to that (ph) with glasses--</p><p>PAVLICH: Oh, my goodness. How classy (ph)?</p><p>BREAM: Oh my good - this is fancy (ph)--</p><p>CARLSON: --of vodka or sparkling cider whatever to toast--</p><p>BREAM: Well, thank you. This is--</p><p>CARLSON: --tonight's contest before we get started.</p><p>BREAM: --very fancy.</p><p>PAVLICH: This is very classy.</p><p>CARLSON: We waited years for the (ph) Final Exam, why (ph) thank you Emily  (ph). These are our Final Exam classes (ph)--</p><p>BREAM: Yes. Toast you (ph)--</p><p>PAVLICH: Thank you, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: --that's right. I'm the Ryan Seacrest. </p><p>BREAM: Have a nice (ph)--</p><p>PAVLICH: I see you (ph).</p><p>CARLSON: OK, are you all ready?</p><p>PAVLICH: I'm ready.</p><p>BREAM: Smell suspicious.</p><p>CARLSON: Ready.</p><p>PAVLICH: OK.</p><p>BREAM: By the way did you notice (ph) we both beat Peter Doocy--</p><p>PAVLICH: Cider.</p><p>BREAM: What a glutton for punishment? </p><p>PAVLICH: Oh, we did?</p><p>BREAM: He was reading a book (ph)--</p><p>PAVLICH: Poor guy. He was a (ph) team player.</p><p>CARLSON: But you know what?</p><p>BREAM: He's a good guy. He's team player.</p><p>CARLSON: No one should be ashamed to lose to either one of you because  you're that--</p><p>BREAM: No, no.</p><p>CARLSON: --good at this game. I've not looked at the questions by the way--</p><p>BREAM: Thanks (ph).</p><p>CARLSON: --sincerely.</p><p>BREAM: They're all on Kavanaugh though, I--</p><p>CARLSON: I want to be a perfect (ph)--</p><p>BREAM: --because if they're not, I - I don't know about anything else  that's happening in the world like (ph) Kavanaugh.</p><p>CARLSON: That's tonight's conspiracy show. All right, you know the rules.</p><p>PAVLICH: I'm ready (ph).</p><p>CARLSON: But I'll (ph) repeat them for audience. Hands on buzzers. I ask  the questions. The first one to buzz in gets to answer the question. You  must wait until I finish asking it in order to answer it. </p><p>You can answer once I acknowledge you by saying your name. Each correct  answer's worth a single point. If you get it all - wrong, you lose a point  from your total. Best of 5 wins. Dim the lights.</p><p>PAVLICH: I'm done (ph)--</p><p>CARLSON: Let's get started. All right.</p><p>BREAM: Where's the theme music?</p><p>CARLSON: Question - it - it's implied. Oh, there--</p><p>BREAM: OK. There it is OK, all right.</p><p>CARLSON: --Boston time (ph). Question one. The Emmys aired on Monday night.  It was the same boring awards show. It always is except with one exception.

Those tests are no good.</p><p>CARLSON: One to one going into question three. The question may offend  vegans, vegetarians, and anyone who works at PETA, so turn off your TV if  you're in those categories. </p><p>Chefs at a seafood restaurant in the State of Maine say they want to show  compassion to the lobsters they're about to boil. Before going into the pot  the lobsters are given what to relax?</p><p>Shannon Bream.</p><p>BREAM: Marijuana smoke.</p><p>CARLSON: No way.</p><p>PAVLICH: What?</p><p>BREAM: I mean I hope it's true but then what happens to the lobster?</p><p>CARLSON: Well lobster (ph)--</p><p>BREAM: If you eat it, are you in trouble?</p><p>CARLSON: OK.</p><p>PAVLICH: It's like (ph) a brownie.</p><p>CARLSON: Is it marijuana - it's Maine.

They're certainly more passive.</p><p>BREAM: Delicious.</p><p>PAVLICH: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: Question four. This one's a multiple choice.</p><p>BREAM: Oh.</p><p>CARLSON: There was a lot of rain in New York City recently and that caused  some subway stations to flood. Now, there's a video on the internet of an  animal protecting itself from rising water on the train platform. The  animal has been given a nickname. Is it rain raccoon, flood rat or puddle  pigeon?</p><p>Shannon Bream.</p><p>BREAM: Flood rat.</p><p>CARLSON: Flood rat?</p><p>BREAM: I think.</p><p>CARLSON: Is it flood rat?</p><p>PAVLICH: Probably.

An Arby's restaurant in the State of  California just announced they will give you a free sandwich for life if  you show your dedication to the restaurant in what very permanent way?</p><p>Katie Pavlich.</p><p>PAVLICH: You get a tattoo.</p><p>CARLSON: An Arby's tattoo?</p><p>PAVLICH: Yes, an Arby's tattoo.</p><p>CARLSON: A high price for a sandwich.</p><p>BREAM: It is.</p><p>CARLSON: Isn't that (ph) Arby's tattoo?</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SETH ADAM MEYERS, HOST, LATE NIGHT WITH SETH MEYERS, NBC: Arby's has  announced they'll be giving out free Arby's tattoos in California this  weekend to their most dedicated fans--</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PAVLICH: Free tattoo?

Absolutely.</p><p>CARLSON: That's true (ph)--</p><p>BREAM: --I mean we combine our forces for that (ph).</p><p>CARLSON: I want to ask our Vanna Whites, this is Louie (ph) and Emily (ph)- -</p><p>PAVLICH: Shannon is the only one worthy of wearing a crown.

She asked  for anonymity. She didn't want her name out there. They leaked her name and  the letter at the last minute for political gain.</p><p>Now, they're trying to dictate the terms for how Washington responds to her  allegations in order to achieve further delays. Megyn Kelly at NBC News  called out that strategy in the clearest possible terms earlier today.  Watch what she said.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MEGYN KELLY, HOST, MEGYN KELLY TODAY, NBC: I think Dr. Ford is running out  of options. I think she needs to show up on Monday and offer her testimony  if she wants to be heard because for better or for worse, she is not in  charge of this. The - the Senate is in charge of this. That committee is in  charge of this.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Imagine saying that on NBC News? That's what bravery looks like.  Author and columnist Mark Steyn joins us tonight. </p><p>So, look, I mean no disrespect to the woman lodging the complaint, making  the allegation. You know, I take her tests (ph) - I think she's sincere. I  guess is what it (ph) - but is she in charge of the process in the country?</p><p>MARK STEYN, AUTHOR, COLUMNIST, STEYNONLINE.COM: No. Nobody has the right to  do this. </p><p>You - you say she's the person making the complaint. She hasn't actually  made a complaint. She's actually the only person in this story now who  hasn't actually made a statement under oath because even these letters that  Kavanaugh's friend Mark Judge sent to the Judiciary Committee, that's made  under penalty of perjury.</p><p>So you can't - if you have a complaint, you have to walk into a police  station and make the complaint and the police interview you. The police  won't investigate somebody if you're not even prepared to come into the  police station and tell your story. And that's how it should be.</p><p>Kirsten Gillibrand, who, as you said, is a lawyer. Half these legislators  are lawyers and the other half all have lawyers on their vast bloated  entourages want us to live in a world where anyone can call down an FBI  investigation on anybody else.</p><p>Well if that's the way we're going to live, I'm pretty certain it was  Kirsten Gillibrand who bust into my car in 1998 and stole my car radio. And  if she is innocent, she'll be calling for an FBI investigation into  herself.</p><p>CARLSON: Let--</p><p>STEYN: Let's bring it on, baby. Let's have it - let's have it for everyone.</p><p>CARLSON: Let me - let me just preemptively counter the attacks you're going  to face from the mindless shrieking dishonest harpies on the Left and the  robotic war - water carriers in the media. \"You're attacking the victim.\" I  just want to be clear. Nobody's attacking the victim here.</p><p>STEYN: No.</p><p>CARLSON: But does this work for any other species of crime? Can I  anonymously accuse you of embezzle - embezzlement or armed robbery and then  not elaborate on the accusation while your reputation is destroyed and you  lose your job, does that work?</p><p>STEYN: No. A - a criminal accusation is a serious thing. A criminal  accusation 36 years on is an even more serious thing.</p><p>CARLSON: OK.</p><p>STEYN: And if you took it seriously you wouldn't, for example, just send  the letter to one political party. You'd have sent it to both Dianne  Feinstein--</p><p>CARLSON: Exactly.</p><p>STEYN: --and to Chuck - and to Chuck Grassley. And but - but this is - this  is actually going, you know, the - the presumption of innocence is at the  bedrock of our judicial system. </p><p>And so, if you're - if you're just prepared to trash someone and we now  have people in the Democrat Party, Cory Booker boasted that he groped  someone--</p><p>CARLSON: Exactly.</p><p>STEYN: --at high school, and we shouldn't - and we shouldn't just be having  one set of rules for one party and for the other side you can trash him and  demean him and degrade him and destroy them at their (ph) - their  reputation--</p><p>CARLSON: You're right.</p><p>STEYN: --and if they don't (ph) want an FBI investigation they're to blame.</p><p>CARLSON: The great Mark Steyn, thank you Mark.</p><p>Richard Painter, up next. He abandoned the Republican Party early this year  to become a Democrat. Now that party is turning against him and you won't  believe why. That's next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CARLSON: We've had Richard Painter on a couple times to talk about dumpster  fires. But that's not the topic tonight. The former Bush Ethics Lawyer  became a Democrat in response to the rise of Donald Trump. </p><p>Now he says he's being threatened by his new party, the Democrats, for  asking questions about Keith Ellison. He's the DNC Deputy Chair accused of  abuse by an ex-girlfriend. Richard Painter joins us tonight.</p><p>Richard, I wish we had more time. We've got completely squeezed by all this  news. But lay out for us this story. You've asked questions about Ellison.  What was the response you got from your party?</p><p>RICHARD WILLIAM PAINTER, AMERICAN LAWYER, PROFESSOR, POLITICAL CANDIDATE:  Well, first, I think they're trying to run the clock to the election  instead of having an investigation. It's been weeks. </p><p>I also complained back in May about the DFL's failure to investigate  harassment of a gay - gay man in the 8th Congressional District. He wrote a  very detailed email describing very explicit harassment in 2016 that was  just swept under the rug. </p><p>And I finally wrote the DFL Chair Ken Martin, and that man went public with  that. And he - of course, Ken Martin's been furious with me. And I  complained about that not being investigated. And then Ken Martin started  sending me emails saying he's got to, you know, starting to (ph) consider  legal action if I keep complaining about this. </p><p>Well, you know, my answer to this is that both political parties need to  focus on cleaning up their own act before they start attacking the other  party. There's a lot of covering up going on and sexual harassment, abuse,  and all of these problems are being covered up by the Democrats as well as  the Republicans.</p><p>And, you know, I find that very, very disappointing what happened here.</p><p>CARLSON: Well it is disappointing.</p><p>PAINTER: I find it (ph) very disappointing what's happening in Washington.</p><p>CARLSON: It's shocking. And I appreciate that. And we're going to follow up  on that story because I think it's - those are probably threads we should  be pulling. Thanks a lot (ph). Richard Painter, joining us tonight all too  briefly, thank you for that.</p><p>PAINTER: Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: Well it's been an unbelievable and action-packed hour because this  is an unbelievable and action-packed moment with an awful lot at stake.  We're following it closely. We know you are too and we are grateful that  you're watching.</p><p>We'll be back tomorrow 8:00 P.M., the show that is the sworn enemy of  lying, pomposity, smugness, and groupthink, all of which are everywhere and  hurting our country.</p><p>Good night from Washington. Hannity live from Las Vegas where the  President's about to speak. Sean?</p><p>SEAN HANNITY, FOX NEWS HOST, HANNITY: Yes sir. </p><p>Tucker, great show.</p><p>CARLSON: Thank you.</p><p>END</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC.

Google's search engine is among, or maybe, the most powerful machine in - in human history. It's probably the most influential. Its results shape the way we understand the world.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Most of us assume that on some level it is honest, Google search. But what if it's not honest? What if Google is secretly corrupting its search results to influence votes? Tonight we have exclusive evidence that that may in fact be happening at Google. We'll have the report for you in a minute. Don't miss that.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We also have a can't-miss championship edition of Final Exams, Shannon Bream and Katie Pavlich for the belt coming up as well.</p><p>But first tonight, the claim against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh that he committed some kind of sexual assault, while a student in high school, has metastasized into something different, something ugly, and something threatening to all of us.</p><p>We've learned remarkably little about Brett Kavanaugh or Christine Ford in the past week despite a lot of words on their behalf. The facts of the case are still sparse and they're murky.</p><p>But we've learned a disturbing amount about the Left and what it's willing to do in order to maintain control of this country. Watch a clip from today in which New York Senator, Kirsten Gillibrand, explained why she knows Brett Kavanaugh is guilty. Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KIRSTEN ELIZABETH GILLIBRAND, JUNIOR UNITED STATES SENATOR, NEW YORK: I believe her because she's telling the truth. She's asking the FBI to investigate her claims. She's asking for that kind of review, that investigative work, that oversight, that accountability because she's telling the truth. Someone who is lying does not ask the FBI to investigate their claims. Who is not asking the FBI to investigate these claims? The White House. Dr. Kavanaugh - excuse me--</p><p>MAZIE KEIKO HIRONO, JUNIOR UNITED STATES SENATOR, HAWAII: Judge--</p><p>GILLIBRAND: --Judge Kavanaugh has not asked to have the FBI review these claims. Is that the - is that the reaction of an innocent person? It is not.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: So try to ignore the yelling there and the theatrics and the pure demagoguery of the moment and focus instead on Kirsten Gillibrand's reasoning to the extent that there is any.</p><p>\"I believe her because she's telling the truth.\" Or put it another way, it's true because it is.</p><p>Now, in logic class, they call this circular reasoning which isn't actually reasoning at all. Instead, it's simply a demand that you believe something because someone else is asserting it. Children talk this way. You think you a U.S. senator would be embarrassed to.</p><p>But it's the second part of Gillibrand's statement that you ought to pay attention to because it's scary. Kavanaugh hasn't called for yet another FBI investigation into himself. Therefore, Senator Gillibrand says he did it. Is that the reaction of an innocent person, she thunders? It is not.</p><p>Well not since the McCarthy era almost 70 years ago have lawmakers talked like this in this country. Unless you call for an FBI investigation of yourself, you're guilty of a crime. Even Joe McCarthy himself never said anything like that. It was too reckless even for him.</p><p>And now, one of the Democratic Party's leading presidential candidates casually drops the line at a press conference and the media hardly notice. So, apparently that's the new standard in Washington.</p><p>OK. Well let's start with Kirsten Gillibrand. Gillibrand was a friend of Harvey Weinstein's. Here's a picture of the two of them together. Weinstein has been credibly accused of rape. Did Kirsten Gillibrand know about Weinstein's sexual assaults? Was she an accessory to them?</p><p>We've asked those questions before on this show but we never got an answer. Why hasn't Gillibrand demanded an FBI investigation into herself to clear that up? Is that the reaction of an innocent person? By her standards, it's not.</p><p>So bring on the FBI. Let them interview Kirsten Gillibrand under oath, maybe surprise her at her home at dawn with a search warrant.</p><p>And while they're at it, they should take a very close look at her relationship with Bill Clinton, another accused rapist. No doubt the Senator will beg for an investigation into that too assuming she's innocent. If she hesitates, press charges.</p><p>This is lunatic. Sober liberals understand that it is. Democrats don't want Brett Kavanaugh on the court because they disagree with him and that's understandable, by the way. They're angry that the Republican Senate refused to vote on Barack Obama's last Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland. That's understandable too.</p><p>But what's happening now is dangerous in a way that has nothing to do with politics. It's a threat to the civil liberties of every American, no matter who you voted for in 2016. Extremism has exploded on the Left and nobody is trying to contain it.</p><p>Here's one particularly jarring example of that. This is Congressman John Garamendi of California. We know him well. He's one of the few House Democrats willing to come on this show.</p><p>We don't usually agree with Garamendi but we've always found him to be a decent and reasonable person, always. Here's what he just said about the Kavanaugh allegations.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOHN RAYMOND GARAMENDI, CALIFORNIA CONGRESSMAN, DEMOCRATIC PARTY MEMBER: Women across this nation should be outraged at what these White men senators are doing to this woman. The senators - the male senators who control that committee are playing the game as old as an assault. And that is the woman's the accused. The woman is at fault.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Wait a second. What does the race of specific senators have to do with any of this? Should we be angry at them because of their skin color? Should we distrust them more? Are they inherently less fair or less decent because of the way they look?</p><p>Garamendi is implying exactly that. So, how is that different or better than anything George Wallace ever said? Well it's not, except that suddenly this filth is everywhere, so you hardly even notice it. The last thing this country needs right now is more racial division.</p><p>Democrats are pushing it anyway. They're using allegations that have literally nothing to do with race at all. But splitting the country into tiny warring groups is useful to them. It helps them maintain their power and so they're happy to do it. Men against women, Black against White, divide and conquer whatever it takes.</p><p>In the end, it's unlikely that we'll ever know conclusively what happened between Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Ford 36 years ago, if anything at all. But it's crystal clear what's happening right now.</p><p>This is a power grab. It is hurting the country destroying our centuries' old traditions of justice and empowering morons and demagogues. We ought to shut it down right now.</p><p>And yet, and this is late-breaking news, just seconds before airtime we learned that this may go on and on. Republicans on the Hill tonight are considering delaying the hearing scheduled for Monday. At this point, Brett Kavanaugh will be testifying by himself to some future date.</p><p>Because of the rules of the Senate, that would push back the vote on Kavanaugh by at least a week, if not more, which is, of course, the whole point, to drag the country through this pointless charade, this circus, which divides us and hurts us and degrades our standards of justice simply for political ends. That's where we are.</p><p>Ian Samuel is a Professor at Indiana University Law School and he joins us tonight. Professor, I'm glad you're here as a law professor. I - I want to ask you about what Senator Gillibrand said today.</p><p>She's a lawyer as well, I believe. And she said that the new standard is unless you call for an FBI investigation into yourself you are by definition guilty. Is that a legal standard that you recognize?</p><p>IAN SAMUEL, ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR OF LAW, INDIANA UNIVERSITY: Well what I like to think about is if I were, as Brett Kavanaugh says, an innocent man and if I were falsely accused of something this serious what would I want?</p><p>And as I - and I teach Civil Procedure and I think about Criminal Procedure and as I think through that question what I would want is a process that was regarded as so fair even by my audiological adversaries that I would live the rest of my life being able to point to the process and say, we had this out and everyone can agree the way we did it was fair and I was cleared.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>SAMUEL: That's what I would want.</p><p>CARLSON: I would want that too. And I think we would both agree that the first thing you would want in that process is a full explanation of what the charges are from the person who's making them. And he hasn't received that. None of us have.</p><p>But barring that and I'm not attacking her, though I think all of us should be distressed that she's not explaining herself, but that's not what Gillibrand said.</p><p>She said if you don't ask for an FBI investigation into yourself that is an indication that you are guilty. And let me just suggest the obvious which is that is insane, that is a third world standard, that is an un-American standard, and it's hard for me to believe that an elected U.S. senator would say something like that in public. You're not surprised by it though.</p><p>SAMUEL: Well two things actually as to that. So number one, if I were an innocent man I would actually welcome the FBI investigating. I might not call for it but I would say \"Sure, investigate.\" You will see that I am an innocent man.</p><p>But the second thing when I was listening to you talk about this, you said and you pointed out, I think, quite correctly, many of the senior members of the Democratic Party are credibly associated with important sexual predators like Harvey Weinstein--</p><p>CARLSON: Sure.</p><p>SAMUEL: --and I thought what you were going to say was it would be a good idea to investigate that, which I do agree with. And it seems like you're kind of going in the opposite--</p><p>CARLSON: No, because - and I am going in the opposite direction--</p><p>SAMUEL: --direction. I don't really think that this is a partisan issue (ph)--</p><p>CARLSON: --well let me - and it's of course it's not a partisan issue.</p><p>The point that I am making is that guilt by association is a low and immoral tactic. And we used to revile people who engaged in it like Senator Joe McCarthy of Wisconsin. And now, it's so commonplace, we don't notice it.</p><p>And so the idea is if you've had dinner with somebody who has unsavory views or unpopular views, you can be fired. And we've seen people fired recently from - for that very thing. Guilt by association is not the same as guilt.</p><p>And so, to say that because Kirsten Gillibrand was friends with Harvey Weinstein that she is somehow an accessory to his sexual predation is totally wrong. And I would never make that claim. I was merely saying that- -</p><p>SAMUEL: That's - that's fine. If that's not what you're suggesting, I - I appreciate--</p><p>CARLSON: --by the standard that she holds them--</p><p>SAMUEL: --that.</p><p>CARLSON: --it's not. What I'm suggesting is that--</p><p>SAMUEL: Fine.</p><p>CARLSON: --she shouldn't say that innocent people have a moral obligation to call down upon themselves an FBI investigation. That's insane. Why doesn't anyone--</p><p>SAMUEL: Oh, I quite - I quite agree--</p><p>CARLSON: --stop her and say--</p><p>SAMUEL: --with that.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>SAMUEL: But if I were an innocent man I wouldn't think of it as my obligation but rather my privilege--</p><p>CARLSON: Well I mean I--</p><p>SAMUEL: I will insist--</p><p>CARLSON: I don't - I mean (ph)--</p><p>SAMUEL: --if I were Brett Kavanaugh and if I were an innocent man I would insist on pointing every camera--</p><p>CARLSON: Hold I mean (ph)--</p><p>SAMUEL: --on God's green earth in my face as I denied these allegations if I were an innocent man--</p><p>CARLSON: But I - I believe he--</p><p>SAMUEL: --truthfully. And I want everyone to see it, wouldn't you?</p><p>CARLSON: --I believe - I believe - I believe he's already done that. I think he's been the subject of six FBI investigations into his background - background checks by federal agents. And I believe he's testifying Monday and he'll likely repeat what he's already said which is \"I don't know what she's talking about. I didn't do this.\"</p><p>She, by contrast, who is the reason we're having this conversation in the first place, leveled the charge of felonious behavior against a public official and then has refused to explain herself. So, where's the onus on her?</p><p>She's dragged the whole country into this and short-circuited a process the rest of us are vested in and not bothered to explain herself? I know you're not supposed to like attack the victim. But at some point, she's not in charge of this country so why can't we ask her for the full story?</p><p>SAMUEL: Well I do think that the - look, as we say often in the law, the government is entitled to every person's evidence. And I do think it would be very useful--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, exactly.</p><p>SAMUEL: --if she would testify.</p><p>But again, just to keep with the frame a little bit, if I were Brett Kavanaugh and if I were an innocent man I would say look, you don't want to testify on Monday? Take a week. Take two weeks, take a month because when this is done, and if I'm confirmed, I will not live my life under a cloud where people can say \"Well the reason you got through is because we rushed it.\"</p><p>CARLSON: Uh huh.</p><p>SAMUEL: Take a month. This is my life.</p><p>CARLSON: But - but what - I understand but then--</p><p>SAMUEL: That's what I would do if I were an innocent man.</p><p>CARLSON: --if you are facing opponents who publicly declared that you were guilty on the basis of no evidence, and used as evidence the fact that you didn't request an FBI investigation into yourself you would acknowledge you're dealing with unreasonable people who don't care about justice who are merely trying to destroy your life for political ends, so maybe you'd behave differently or am I being crazy here?</p><p>SAMUEL: Well I don't know about that. If I were facing unreasonable people and if I were an innocent man what I would say is fine, you want to delay the hearing a month? Delay it. You want the FBI to look into it? Look into it. You want to interview this witness in closed session, in open session--</p><p>CARLSON: So more people can accuse me anonymously of--</p><p>SAMUEL: --look into it. I am an innocent man.</p><p>CARLSON: --yes, uh huh. Yes, I wish we lived in a country - I'd be happy to participate in such a system. But when you have people saying what Kirsten Gillibrand said today or Congressman Garamendi said today, you're dealing with unreasonable people who don't care about justice and it's scary. And I know that you believe that his (ph)--</p><p>SAMUEL: Prosecutors often don't and that is why--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, I agree.</p><p>SAMUEL: --it would be important--</p><p>CARLSON: I agree.</p><p>SAMUEL: I would think in his position to position yourself as a person who says these people are unreasonable and the way I will prove it to you is I will give them everything they want and they will find nothing.</p><p>CARLSON: I think he's doing that Monday.</p><p>SAMUEL: I am an innocent man--</p><p>CARLSON: Uh all right (ph).</p><p>SAMUEL: --if I were an innocent man.</p><p>CARLSON: I think that's the claim. Professor, thank you very much.</p><p>SAMUEL: Thank you very much for having me.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, our long-term investigation into Google and its behavior and practices has borne fruit tonight. We have internal documents that show Google employees plotting to use the company's search engine, the very core of its business, which has a monopoly on search in this country, to undermine the Administration's immigration policy without telling you, secretively and dishonestly. That exclusive is next.</p><p>The news has been overwhelming tonight. A very special break from the madness are two-time all champ - all-time champions face off in the ultimate Final Exam. They are, as you know, Shannon Bream and Katie Pavlich, coming up.</p><p>CARLSON: Tonight, we have a development in our ongoing exclusive investigation into the behavior of Google. There are new emails first obtained by this show.</p><p>Now Google, as you know, is the most powerful company in the history of the world. Virtually all human information flows through its software. And for that reason, Google shapes much of how the world understands reality.</p><p>At the heart of Google's business is its search engine which has a virtual monopoly on search in this country and others. Google search succeeds because it is blindingly efficient but also because it is perceived as honest.</p><p>When you search for a term on Google, the most popular results come to the top. The process is straightforward and democratic. That's what most people think. That's how it's perceived and that's why the world trusts Google.</p><p>But what if Google was lying to you? What if the results that you got were secretly weighted to get you to vote a certain way, to believe a certain thing? That would affect a lot of people and a lot of votes.</p><p>In fact, it would be impossible to have a real democracy under circumstances like that. A small number of incredibly rich people would be in charge of everything including your perceptions.</p><p>Well that is a major concern for all of us because Google is a very political company. We recently showed you email evidence of the Google effort to collude with a Left-wing group in support of Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign.</p><p>Now tonight, we have internal documents that show that Google employees discussed corrupting the company's search engine to push propaganda on hundreds of millions of unsuspecting users. Here's what happened.</p><p>Shortly after taking office, President Trump issued his now-famous travel ban. Almost immediately after that, Google employees began plotting ways to undermine the President's Executive Order.</p><p>On January 29th, a Google Product Marketing Manager named Mackenzie Thomas sent an email to a group of fellow employees. \"There is a large brainstorm going on throughout the marketing org\" she wrote, brainstorming about how to respond to Trump's order.</p><p>Among Thomas' ideas was \"To actively counter algorithmically biased results for search terms such as Islam, Iran, Mexico, Latino and so forth.\"</p><p>In other words, Google employees wanted to alter the search results to make them more positive in certain cases for political reasons. Thomas also suggested promoting links for making donations to organizations fighting the travel ban.</p><p>This, of course, would be completely dishonest and unethical behavior. But Thomas' colleagues at Google seemed to approve of it strongly. Product Manager Rami Banna (ph), for example, replied this way. \"We're absolutely in Mackenzie, anything you need. We'll put together a list of orgs with Meryl (ph) and HL (ph) team.\"</p><p>Another employee named Stacey Chen (ph) added that group she thought Google should promote included the ACLU, the defect - the Immigration Defense Project, the Arab-American Anti-Discrimination Committee and the National Immigration Law Center. All of those groups were at the time agitating against the President's immigration ban.</p><p>Even at least (ph) one person on the chain seemed to realize how dangerous and out of the ordinary this conversation was. A Google employee called Clement Wolf (ph) commented that \"He was very much in favor of Google stepping up\" but was wondering \"How partisan we want to be on this? To the extent of my knowledge, we'd be breaching precedent if we only gave highlights access to organizations that support a certain view.\"</p><p>We contacted Google about these remarkable emails and the reply to us is here in full.</p><p>\"These emails were just a brainstorm of ideas, none of which were ever implemented. Google has never manipulated its search results or modified any of its products to promote a particular political ideology - not in the current campaign season, not during the 2016 election, and not in the aftermath of President Trump's Executive Order on immigration. Our processes and policies would not have allowed for any manipulation of search results to promote political ideologies.\"</p><p>Left unanswered by Google was why anyone would believe that statement for a second. Nor did Google say anything about the employees on that email chain. Presumably, they still work at Google which is remarkable.</p><p>If you ran a bank and caught your tellers brainstorming about how to rob the vault, would they still work for you? Remember that Google fired an engineer called James Damore last summer almost instantly.</p><p>The CEO flew back from family vacation to fire him. Why? Because Damore was caught expressing mildly conservatives ideas in a private memo. Here, Google employees are plotting to subvert our entire public conversation secretly. But that's fine with Google.</p><p>It shouldn't be fine with any of us or with the U.S. Congress. Google executives are scheduled to testify on Capitol Hill next week. The scheduled topic is privacy. But it would be nice if at least one elected representative asked about this because it's much scarier than anything Russia ever attempted.</p><p>Peter Schweizer wrote Clinton Cash. He now has a fantastic new documentary called the Creepy Line about big tech and he joins us tonight. Are you surprised by this?</p><p>PETER FRANZ SCHWEIZER, AMERICAN INVESTIGATIVE JOURNALIST, NOVELIST, AUTHOR, POLITICAL CONSULTANT: Not really. It's just further confirmation that Google has been cooking the books as it relates to search.</p><p>And you're absolutely right. I mean this would be like a company having a brainstorming session on how we're going to fiddle with the books in - in - in accounting. Then you're going to step back and say \"No, we were just having a brainstorming session.\"</p><p>It - it speaks to the culture of the company. And the culture of the company is they are prepared to put their thumb on the scale and shift the debate in favor of the direction that they want to go.</p><p>CARLSON: But this is so corrupt that it's--</p><p>SCHWEIZER: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: --I was stunned by it--</p><p>SCHWEIZER: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: --and I was worried that these emails were not authentic because it's such a big (ph) so search is the core of Google's business.</p><p>SCHWEIZER: Right (ph).</p><p>CARLSON: It's many different things, Google, but basically, it's a search engine. It was built on the back of one.</p><p>SCHWEIZER: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: And the promise has always been that they're not lying to you.</p><p>SCHWEIZER: Right.</p><p>CARLSON: But they are.</p><p>SCHWEIZER: That's right. And this is really the third strike as far as I'm concerned. The first strike, of course, is the commercial search. When travel websites and - and people like Yelp were complaining that they were, you know, tilting the algorithm, you know--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>SCHWEIZER: --against them to others, Google said \"Absolutely not. We would never do that.\" We now know the Federal Trade Commission, the EU, and others have looked at this and said Google was fiddling with the algorithm. The second strike as far as I'm concerned was the work done by Dr. Robert Epstein--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>SCHWEIZER: --which shows clearly in 2016 that search was tilted to favor Hillary Clinton. This is strike three. It shows that the culture of the company is such that they're very happy having a free and open conversation about manipulating the algorithm on a highly political subject.</p><p>CARLSON: But I don't understand. I mean so people go to jail for violating our campaign finance laws because they put an extra ad on some cable channel--</p><p>SCHWEIZER: Right.</p><p>CARLSON: --nobody watches.</p><p>SCHWEIZER: Right.</p><p>CARLSON: This is the most powerful company in the world.</p><p>SCHWEIZER: That's right.</p><p>CARLSON: How can we have a democracy in a country where Google can just get whoever it wants elected by lying to us through the search function?</p><p>SCHWEIZER: It's a great example, Tucker, of regulations and campaign finance laws not keeping up at all with where we are in technology. Nobody were to consume (ph) when we pass laws about in-kind contributions to campaign from companies that something like this would happen.</p><p>But this is the ultimate - the ultimate campaign contribution. This is not like, you know, Exxon giving gasoline to a political campaign. This is a company secretly tipping the scales in favor of candidates or causes or beliefs that they have. It's done in secret. We don't know how it - how--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>SCHWEIZER: --extensive it's happening. And 80 to 90 percent of search in the world is basically done through Google, so they have complete dominance in this area.</p><p>CARLSON: And the Congress does nothing. And I can think of at least one Republican senator who I believe has been bought off by Google. I don't think he's alone.</p><p>SCHWEIZER: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: At some point it might be worth naming who those people are. Peter, great to see you.</p><p>SCHWEIZER: Thanks, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: We're not going to stop this investigation into Google or any of the other tech companies that increasingly seem to determine the direction of this country.</p><p>Well a Republican Senate candidate is being denounced as a would-be theocrat for saying that men have a duty to lead. He joins us to rebut his critics after the break.</p><p>CARLSON: Well one of the pivotal facts of modern American life is that the country and, particularly, its cities are pretty safe. They didn't always - they weren't always safe. But for about last 20 years, the murder rate has gone down. Now, sadly, it is rising again. But it's not surprising.</p><p>For years, the Left has been denouncing the cops as bigots, all of them. Just the other day, Senate Candidate Beto O'Rourke in Texas called police \"The new Jim Crow,\" and claim they shoot people just because of the color of their skin.</p><p>So, think to yourself and be honest. Would you want to be a cop right now? Who would want to be a cop? Why would you want to risk your life to protect the public for very little pay while some moron like Beto O'Rourke who's never even met you, knows nothing about you, calls you a bigot? It's because of the uniform you wear.</p><p>It wouldn't be worth it for you probably. It's not worth it for a lot of people. For that, among other reasons, American cities are becoming less safe, much less safe, in some cases.</p><p>Yesterday, Attorney General Jeff Sessions went to Chicago. It's one of the city's hardest hit by this trend. He laid out very clearly why more Americans are getting killed in big cities. Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JEFF SESSIONS, UNITED STATES ATTORNEY GENERAL: The professors who studied Chicago called it the ACLU Effect. Policing went down. Crime when up. So there's a clear lesson here. If you want more shootings, more death, listen to the ACLU, Antifa, Black Lives Matter and groups who do not know the reality of policing.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: The funny thing is that most of these changes have taken place under the pretext of civil liberties. And yet, the people pushing them don't care about civil liberties, certainly not your civil liberties, in case you haven't noticed.</p><p>They're the ones telling you if you don't call an FBI investigation down on yourself you must be guilty, these civil libertarians. If you're older than 35 you may remember when America's great cities depopulated essentially, practically destroyed by blight.</p><p>That was definitely true here in Washington, certainly in New York City. They recovered and real estate boomed and lots of people became happy and didn't die because they became safer. What happens when they get dangerous again as they are? The Left doesn't seem to care at all.</p><p>Michigan Republican Senate candidate John James is coming under fire for expressing an idea that leadership can be a masculine responsibility. Watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOHN JAMES, REPUBLICAN MICHIGAN SENATE CANDIDATE: --men, we have a charge to lead and we are failing in that because we are afraid to hurt someone's feelings. The fact of the matter is women want men who've been tested. And boys need to be tested. And--</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: So women like strong men. Well don't just ask that guy. Ask anybody who's ever studied the subject. There are reams of social science on this question. And most Americans think it sounds sensible. But just for uttering these words, one writer at the Detroit Metro Times has accused James of seeking a Handmaid's Tale style theocracy.</p><p>John James joins us tonight. Mr. James, thank you very much for coming on.</p><p>JAMES: Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: So before we get to what your critics are saying about you, why don't you tell us what you were saying when you uttered those words?</p><p>JAMES: Absolutely. I was raised in the church. And I - I know based upon my priorities which is God and country in that order, I also recognize we talked a lot about rights in this country but not enough about responsibilities.</p><p>I believe that we all have to step up. We are all created equal, male and female, but I truly believe because of how I was raised that men have an obligation to step up and not abandon their - their family responsibilities, to step up and be role models and mentors in their community and when I was talking to a faith-based business organization, talking to men, talking about stepping up in their communities and holding themselves accountable to be mentors.</p><p>The reason is right now the Left has very little way to attack me other than take things out of context or just flat-out lie. I'm not going to fit in anybody's blue box or anybody's red box.</p><p>I'm a conservative who believes very, very strongly in faith and family, God and country, and service before itself. That's why I went off to serve my country in Iraq. That's why I came back to build up my community right here in Detroit. And that's why I'm going to go to Washington and continue to serve my state.</p><p>CARLSON: So, just to be clear, you think that men should take care of the families they create. And for that you're some kind of Ayatollah.</p><p>JAMES: Imagine that. I think that right now, particularly, in the African- American community, I believe that if I can be frank, and I know I can be on this show that the overwhelming number of - of African-American females having children are - are doing so and managing the role and responsibility as a single parent.</p><p>I believe that men need to step up. And that's what I was talking about. And the Left attacking me for that just proves that their business model is dependent upon keeping Black folks dependent--</p><p>CARLSON: Exactly.</p><p>JAMES: --and in debt, and keeping them in the situation so they can make sure that they depend on the Left for their vote. I - I'm not talking about Left or Right. I'm not talking about Black and White.</p><p>I'm talking about the right thing, a message of economic opportunity where we focus on early childhood development, K through 12 education, but you have people here who talk a good game and talk about fixing the school system here, talk about getting people out of there blight and their socio- economic downtrodden state, but then--</p><p>CARLSON: Exactly.</p><p>JAMES: --you have the ACLU who continues to allow these things to get in the way. And I'm about creating--</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>JAMES: --freedom and opportunity for everyone, particularly in my - in my community here in Detroit.</p><p>CARLSON: Good for you. Families are a threat to them. Marrying people vote Republic and they hate the family as a result. That's the truth and I hope you'll keep telling it.</p><p>JAMES: Yes (ph).</p><p>CARLSON: Thank you very much for coming on tonight.</p><p>JAMES: Thanks for having me.</p><p>CARLSON: Megyn Kelly had some brave and insightful words about the chaos surrounding Brett Kavanaugh. We'll show them to you in just a minute. Mark Steyn here to react to all that.</p><p>But first, the questions have been chosen. The crown is in place. The champagne is cooling. It is time for the ultimate Final Exam. Shannon Bream versus Katie Pavlich in a cage match to determine who wears the tiara, up next.</p><p>CARLSON: Time now for Final Exam. News has bumped this segment off the air for the past couple of weeks but not tonight. This is the contest where you pit news professionals against one another to see who's been paying the most attention to the news in the last week.</p><p>This week, the biggest show of all this showdown. Last year, Fox News @ Night host Shannon Bream pulled off a full Brady Bunch. She beat nine opponents in a row.</p><p>Now, Townhall's Katie Pavlich has matched that feat. So naturally, as Pavlich goes for win number 10, the challenger is Shannon Bream.</p><p>SHANNON BREAM, HOST, FOX NEWS @ NIGHT: Hey (ph).</p><p>KATIE PAVLICH, CO-HOST, THE FIVE: Hey (ph).</p><p>BREAM: I did notice (ph)--</p><p>CARLSON: But when we find (ph) the ultimate Final Exam champion, and by the way, since this segment has done so well, we've upped our budget, our own--</p><p>BREAM: OK.</p><p>CARLSON: --Vanna White, Emily Lin (ph) joins us to that (ph) with glasses--</p><p>PAVLICH: Oh, my goodness.

An Arby's restaurant in the State of California just announced they will give you a free sandwich for life if you show your dedication to the restaurant in what very permanent way?</p><p>Katie Pavlich.</p><p>PAVLICH: You get a tattoo.</p><p>CARLSON: An Arby's tattoo?</p><p>PAVLICH: Yes, an Arby's tattoo.</p><p>CARLSON: A high price for a sandwich.</p><p>BREAM: It is.</p><p>CARLSON: Isn't that (ph) Arby's tattoo?</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SETH ADAM MEYERS, HOST, LATE NIGHT WITH SETH MEYERS, NBC: Arby's has announced they'll be giving out free Arby's tattoos in California this weekend to their most dedicated fans--</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PAVLICH: Free tattoo? Wow.</p><p>BREAM: Wait, they're giving it free (ph)--</p><p>PAVLICH: And free sandwiches (ph).</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MEYERS: --Said one man, \"Oh, no! What did I do last night?\"</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: This nearly (ph) was the battle of champions.</p><p>PAVLICH: Congratulations, Shannon.</p><p>CARLSON: But with (ph) one point - nice game Katie--</p><p>PAVLICH: Good game.</p><p>BREAM: Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: --Shannon Bream, you are now and forever the--</p><p>BREAM: Thank you, my friend.</p><p>CARLSON: --champion--</p><p>BREAM: Listen. No one in this network can beat the two of us--</p><p>PAVLICH: That's true.

She asked for anonymity. She didn't want her name out there. They leaked her name and the letter at the last minute for political gain.</p><p>Now, they're trying to dictate the terms for how Washington responds to her allegations in order to achieve further delays. Megyn Kelly at NBC News called out that strategy in the clearest possible terms earlier today. Watch what she said.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MEGYN KELLY, HOST, MEGYN KELLY TODAY, NBC: I think Dr. Ford is running out of options. I think she needs to show up on Monday and offer her testimony if she wants to be heard because for better or for worse, she is not in charge of this. The - the Senate is in charge of this. That committee is in charge of this.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Imagine saying that on NBC News? That's what bravery looks like. Author and columnist Mark Steyn joins us tonight.</p><p>So, look, I mean no disrespect to the woman lodging the complaint, making the allegation. You know, I take her tests (ph) - I think she's sincere. I guess is what it (ph) - but is she in charge of the process in the country?</p><p>MARK STEYN, AUTHOR, COLUMNIST, STEYNONLINE.COM: No. Nobody has the right to do this.</p><p>You - you say she's the person making the complaint. She hasn't actually made a complaint. She's actually the only person in this story now who hasn't actually made a statement under oath because even these letters that Kavanaugh's friend Mark Judge sent to the Judiciary Committee, that's made under penalty of perjury.</p><p>So you can't - if you have a complaint, you have to walk into a police station and make the complaint and the police interview you. The police won't investigate somebody if you're not even prepared to come into the police station and tell your story. And that's how it should be.</p><p>Kirsten Gillibrand, who, as you said, is a lawyer. Half these legislators are lawyers and the other half all have lawyers on their vast bloated entourages want us to live in a world where anyone can call down an FBI investigation on anybody else.</p><p>Well if that's the way we're going to live, I'm pretty certain it was Kirsten Gillibrand who bust into my car in 1998 and stole my car radio. And if she is innocent, she'll be calling for an FBI investigation into herself.</p><p>CARLSON: Let--</p><p>STEYN: Let's bring it on, baby. Let's have it - let's have it for everyone.</p><p>CARLSON: Let me - let me just preemptively counter the attacks you're going to face from the mindless shrieking dishonest harpies on the Left and the robotic war - water carriers in the media. \"You're attacking the victim.\" I just want to be clear. Nobody's attacking the victim here.</p><p>STEYN: No.</p><p>CARLSON: But does this work for any other species of crime? Can I anonymously accuse you of embezzle - embezzlement or armed robbery and then not elaborate on the accusation while your reputation is destroyed and you lose your job, does that work?</p><p>STEYN: No. A - a criminal accusation is a serious thing. A criminal accusation 36 years on is an even more serious thing.</p><p>CARLSON: OK.</p><p>STEYN: And if you took it seriously you wouldn't, for example, just send the letter to one political party. You'd have sent it to both Dianne Feinstein--</p><p>CARLSON: Exactly.</p><p>STEYN: --and to Chuck - and to Chuck Grassley. And but - but this is - this is actually going, you know, the - the presumption of innocence is at the bedrock of our judicial system.</p><p>And so, if you're - if you're just prepared to trash someone and we now have people in the Democrat Party, Cory Booker boasted that he groped someone--</p><p>CARLSON: Exactly.</p><p>STEYN: --at high school, and we shouldn't - and we shouldn't just be having one set of rules for one party and for the other side you can trash him and demean him and degrade him and destroy them at their (ph) - their reputation--</p><p>CARLSON: You're right.</p><p>STEYN: --and if they don't (ph) want an FBI investigation they're to blame.</p><p>CARLSON: The great Mark Steyn, thank you Mark.</p><p>Richard Painter, up next. He abandoned the Republican Party early this year to become a Democrat. Now that party is turning against him and you won't believe why. That's next.</p><p>CARLSON: We've had Richard Painter on a couple times to talk about dumpster fires. But that's not the topic tonight. The former Bush Ethics Lawyer became a Democrat in response to the rise of Donald Trump.</p><p>Now he says he's being threatened by his new party, the Democrats, for asking questions about Keith Ellison. He's the DNC Deputy Chair accused of abuse by an ex-girlfriend. Richard Painter joins us tonight.</p><p>Richard, I wish we had more time. We've got completely squeezed by all this news. But lay out for us this story. You've asked questions about Ellison. What was the response you got from your party?</p><p>RICHARD WILLIAM PAINTER, AMERICAN LAWYER, PROFESSOR, POLITICAL CANDIDATE: Well, first, I think they're trying to run the clock to the election instead of having an investigation. It's been weeks.</p><p>I also complained back in May about the DFL's failure to investigate harassment of a gay - gay man in the 8th Congressional District. He wrote a very detailed email describing very explicit harassment in 2016 that was just swept under the rug.</p><p>And I finally wrote the DFL Chair Ken Martin, and that man went public with that. And he - of course, Ken Martin's been furious with me. And I complained about that not being investigated. And then Ken Martin started sending me emails saying he's got to, you know, starting to (ph) consider legal action if I keep complaining about this.</p><p>Well, you know, my answer to this is that both political parties need to focus on cleaning up their own act before they start attacking the other party. There's a lot of covering up going on and sexual harassment, abuse, and all of these problems are being covered up by the Democrats as well as the Republicans.</p><p>And, you know, I find that very, very disappointing what happened here.</p><p>CARLSON: Well it is disappointing.</p><p>PAINTER: I find it (ph) very disappointing what's happening in Washington.</p><p>CARLSON: It's shocking. And I appreciate that. And we're going to follow up on that story because I think it's - those are probably threads we should be pulling. Thanks a lot (ph). Richard Painter, joining us tonight all too briefly, thank you for that.</p><p>PAINTER: Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: Well it's been an unbelievable and action-packed hour because this is an unbelievable and action-packed moment with an awful lot at stake. We're following it closely. We know you are too and we are grateful that you're watching.</p><p>We'll be back tomorrow 8:00 P.M., the show that is the sworn enemy of lying, pomposity, smugness, and groupthink, all of which are everywhere and hurting our country.</p><p>Good night from Washington. Hannity live from Las Vegas where the President's about to speak. Sean?</p><p>SEAN HANNITY, FOX NEWS HOST, HANNITY: Yes sir.</p><p>Tucker, great show.</p><p>CARLSON: Thank you.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FOXNWS-2018092001cb260</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXNWS2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5T9P-TDG1-DXH2-64H2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">174179</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-09-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"8258\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Fox News Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>Fox News Network</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"09\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>September 20, 2018 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Google's search engine is among, or  maybe, the most powerful machine in - in human history. It's probably the  most influential. Its results shape the way we understand the world.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Most of us assume that on some level it is honest, Google search. But what  if it's not honest? What if Google is secretly corrupting its search  results to influence votes? Tonight we have exclusive evidence that that  may in fact be happening at Google. We'll have the report for you in a  minute. Don't miss that. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> We also have a can't-miss championship edition of Final Exams, Shannon  Bream and Katie Pavlich for the belt coming up as well.</p><p> But first tonight, the claim against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh  that he committed some kind of sexual assault, while a student in high  school, has metastasized into something different, something ugly, and  something threatening to all of us.</p><p> We've learned remarkably little about Brett Kavanaugh or Christine Ford in  the past week despite a lot of words on their behalf. The facts of the case  are still sparse and they're murky. </p><p> But we've learned a disturbing amount about the Left and what it's willing  to do in order to maintain control of this country. Watch a clip from today  in which New York Senator, Kirsten Gillibrand, explained why she knows  Brett Kavanaugh is guilty. Watch.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> KIRSTEN ELIZABETH GILLIBRAND, JUNIOR UNITED STATES SENATOR, NEW YORK: I  believe her because she's telling the truth. She's asking the FBI to  investigate her claims. She's asking for that kind of review, that  investigative work, that oversight, that accountability because she's  telling the truth. Someone who is lying does not ask the FBI to investigate  their claims. Who is not asking the FBI to investigate these claims? The  White House. Dr. Kavanaugh - excuse me--</p><p> MAZIE KEIKO HIRONO, JUNIOR UNITED STATES SENATOR, HAWAII: Judge--</p><p> GILLIBRAND: --Judge Kavanaugh has not asked to have the FBI review these  claims. Is that the - is that the reaction of an innocent person? It is  not.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> CARLSON: So try to ignore the yelling there and the theatrics and the pure  demagoguery of the moment and focus instead on Kirsten Gillibrand's  reasoning to the extent that there is any. </p><p> \"I believe her because she's telling the truth.\" Or put it another way,  it's true because it is. </p><p> Now, in logic class, they call this circular reasoning which isn't actually  reasoning at all. Instead, it's simply a demand that you believe something  because someone else is asserting it. Children talk this way. You think you  a U.S. senator would be embarrassed to.</p><p> But it's the second part of Gillibrand's statement that you ought to pay  attention to because it's scary. Kavanaugh hasn't called for yet another  FBI investigation into himself. Therefore, Senator Gillibrand says he did  it. Is that the reaction of an innocent person, she thunders? It is not.</p><p> Well not since the McCarthy era almost 70 years ago have lawmakers talked  like this in this country. Unless you call for an FBI investigation of  yourself, you're guilty of a crime. Even Joe McCarthy himself never said  anything like that. It was too reckless even for him.</p><p> And now, one of the Democratic Party's leading presidential candidates  casually drops the line at a press conference and the media hardly notice.  So, apparently that's the new standard in Washington.</p><p> OK. Well let's start with Kirsten Gillibrand. Gillibrand was a friend of  Harvey Weinstein's. Here's a picture of the two of them together. Weinstein  has been credibly accused of rape. Did Kirsten Gillibrand know about  Weinstein's sexual assaults? Was she an accessory to them?</p><p> We've asked those questions before on this show but we never got an answer.  Why hasn't Gillibrand demanded an FBI investigation into herself to clear  that up? Is that the reaction of an innocent person? By her standards, it's  not.</p><p> So bring on the FBI. Let them interview Kirsten Gillibrand under oath,  maybe surprise her at her home at dawn with a search warrant. </p><p> And while they're at it, they should take a very close look at her  relationship with Bill Clinton, another accused rapist. No doubt the  Senator will beg for an investigation into that too assuming she's  innocent. If she hesitates, press charges.</p><p> This is lunatic. Sober liberals understand that it is. Democrats don't want  Brett Kavanaugh on the court because they disagree with him and that's  understandable, by the way. They're angry that the Republican Senate  refused to vote on Barack Obama's last Supreme Court nominee Merrick  Garland. That's understandable too.</p><p> But what's happening now is dangerous in a way that has nothing to do with  politics. It's a threat to the civil liberties of every American, no matter  who you voted for in 2016. Extremism has exploded on the Left and nobody is  trying to contain it. </p><p> Here's one particularly jarring example of that. This is Congressman John  Garamendi of California. We know him well. He's one of the few House  Democrats willing to come on this show. </p><p> We don't usually agree with Garamendi but we've always found him to be a  decent and reasonable person, always. Here's what he just said about the  Kavanaugh allegations.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> JOHN RAYMOND GARAMENDI, CALIFORNIA CONGRESSMAN, DEMOCRATIC PARTY  MEMBER:  Women across this nation should be outraged at what these White men  senators are doing to this woman. The senators - the male senators who  control that committee are playing the game as old as an assault. And that  is the woman's the accused. The woman is at fault.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CARLSON: Wait a second. What does the race of specific senators have to do  with any of this? Should we be angry at them because of their skin color?  Should we distrust them more? Are they inherently less fair or less decent  because of the way they look?</p><p> Garamendi is implying exactly that. So, how is that different or better  than anything George Wallace ever said? Well it's not, except that suddenly  this filth is everywhere, so you hardly even notice it. The last thing this  country needs right now is more racial division.</p><p> Democrats are pushing it anyway. They're using allegations that have  literally nothing to do with race at all. But splitting the country into  tiny warring groups is useful to them. It helps them maintain their power  and so they're happy to do it. Men against women, Black against White,  divide and conquer whatever it takes.</p><p> In the end, it's unlikely that we'll ever know conclusively what happened  between Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Ford 36 years ago, if anything at  all. But it's crystal clear what's happening right now. </p><p> This is a power grab. It is hurting the country destroying our centuries'  old traditions of justice and empowering morons and demagogues. We ought to  shut it down right now. </p><p> And yet, and this is late-breaking news, just seconds before airtime we  learned that this may go on and on. Republicans on the Hill tonight are  considering delaying the hearing scheduled for Monday. At this point, Brett  Kavanaugh will be testifying by himself to some future date.</p><p> Because of the rules of the Senate, that would push back the vote on  Kavanaugh by at least a week, if not more, which is, of course, the whole  point, to drag the country through this pointless charade, this circus,  which divides us and hurts us and degrades our standards of justice simply  for political ends. That's where we are.</p><p> Ian Samuel is a Professor at Indiana University Law School and he joins us  tonight. Professor, I'm glad you're here as a law professor. I - I want to  ask you about what Senator Gillibrand said today. </p><p> She's a lawyer as well, I believe. And she said that the new standard is  unless you call for an FBI investigation into yourself you are by  definition guilty. Is that a legal standard that you recognize?</p><p> IAN SAMUEL, ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR OF LAW, INDIANA UNIVERSITY: Well what I  like to think about is if I were, as Brett Kavanaugh says, an innocent man  and if I were falsely accused of something this serious what would I want? </p><p> And as I - and I teach Civil Procedure and I think about Criminal Procedure  and as I think through that question what I would want is a process that  was regarded as so fair even by my audiological adversaries that I would  live the rest of my life being able to point to the process and say, we had  this out and everyone can agree the way we did it was fair and I was  cleared.</p><p> CARLSON: Yes.</p><p> SAMUEL: That's what I would want.</p><p> CARLSON: I would want that too. And I think we would both agree that the  first thing you would want in that process is a full explanation of what  the charges are from the person who's making them. And he hasn't received  that. None of us have.</p><p> But barring that and I'm not attacking her, though I think all of us should  be distressed that she's not explaining herself, but that's not what  Gillibrand said. </p><p> She said if you don't ask for an FBI investigation into yourself that is an  indication that you are guilty. And let me just suggest the obvious which  is that is insane, that is a third world standard, that is an un-American  standard, and it's hard for me to believe that an elected U.S. senator  would say something like that in public. You're not surprised by it though.</p><p> SAMUEL: Well two things actually as to that. So number one, if I were an  innocent man I would actually welcome the FBI investigating. I might not  call for it but I would say \"Sure, investigate.\" You will see that I am an  innocent man.</p><p> But the second thing when I was listening to you talk about this, you said  and you pointed out, I think, quite correctly, many of the senior members  of the Democratic Party are credibly associated with important sexual  predators like Harvey Weinstein--</p><p> CARLSON: Sure.</p><p> SAMUEL: --and I thought what you were going to say was it would be a good  idea to investigate that, which I do agree with. And it seems like you're  kind of going in the opposite--</p><p> CARLSON: No, because - and I am going in the opposite direction--</p><p> SAMUEL: --direction. I don't really think that this is a partisan issue  (ph)--</p><p> CARLSON: --well let me - and it's of course it's not a partisan issue. </p><p> The point that I am making is that guilt by association is a low and  immoral tactic. And we used to revile people who engaged in it like Senator  Joe McCarthy of Wisconsin. And now, it's so commonplace, we don't notice  it. </p><p> And so the idea is if you've had dinner with somebody who has unsavory  views or unpopular views, you can be fired. And we've seen people fired  recently from - for that very thing. Guilt by association is not the same  as guilt.</p><p> And so, to say that because Kirsten Gillibrand was friends with Harvey  Weinstein that she is somehow an accessory to his sexual predation is  totally wrong. And I would never make that claim. I was merely saying that- -</p><p> SAMUEL: That's - that's fine. If that's not what you're suggesting, I - I  appreciate--</p><p> CARLSON: --by the standard that she holds them--</p><p> SAMUEL: --that.</p><p> CARLSON: --it's not. What I'm suggesting is that--</p><p> SAMUEL: Fine.</p><p> CARLSON: --she shouldn't say that innocent people have a moral obligation  to call down upon themselves an FBI investigation. That's insane. Why  doesn't anyone--</p><p> SAMUEL: Oh, I quite - I quite agree--</p><p> CARLSON: --stop her and say--</p><p> SAMUEL: --with that.</p><p> CARLSON: Yes.</p><p> SAMUEL: But if I were an innocent man I wouldn't think of it as my  obligation but rather my privilege--</p><p> CARLSON: Well I mean I--</p><p> SAMUEL: I will insist--</p><p> CARLSON: I don't - I mean (ph)--</p><p> SAMUEL: --if I were Brett Kavanaugh and if I were an innocent man I would  insist on pointing every camera--</p><p> CARLSON: Hold I mean (ph)--</p><p> SAMUEL: --on God's green earth in my face as I denied these allegations if  I were an innocent man--</p><p> CARLSON: But I - I believe he--</p><p> SAMUEL: --truthfully. And I want everyone to see it, wouldn't you?</p><p> CARLSON: --I believe - I believe - I believe he's already done that. I  think he's been the subject of six FBI investigations into his background -  background checks by federal agents. And I believe he's testifying Monday  and he'll likely repeat what he's already said which is \"I don't know what  she's talking about. I didn't do this.\"</p><p> She, by contrast, who is the reason we're having this conversation in the  first place, leveled the charge of felonious behavior against a public  official and then has refused to explain herself. So, where's the onus on  her? </p><p> She's dragged the whole country into this and short-circuited a process the  rest of us are vested in and not bothered to explain herself? I know you're  not supposed to like attack the victim. But at some point, she's not in  charge of this country so why can't we ask her for the full story?</p><p> SAMUEL: Well I do think that the - look, as we say often in the law, the  government is entitled to every person's evidence. And I do think it would  be very useful--</p><p> CARLSON: Yes, exactly.</p><p> SAMUEL: --if she would testify. </p><p> But again, just to keep with the frame a little bit, if I were Brett  Kavanaugh and if I were an innocent man I would say look, you don't want to  testify on Monday? Take a week. Take two weeks, take a month because when  this is done, and if I'm confirmed, I will not live my life under a cloud  where people can say \"Well the reason you got through is because we rushed  it.\"</p><p> CARLSON: Uh huh.</p><p> SAMUEL: Take a month. This is my life.</p><p> CARLSON: But - but what - I understand but then--</p><p> SAMUEL: That's what I would do if I were an innocent man.</p><p> CARLSON: --if you are facing opponents who publicly declared that you were  guilty on the basis of no evidence, and used as evidence the fact that you  didn't request an FBI investigation into yourself you would acknowledge  you're dealing with unreasonable people who don't care about justice who  are merely trying to destroy your life for political ends, so maybe you'd  behave differently or am I being crazy here?</p><p> SAMUEL: Well I don't know about that. If I were facing unreasonable people  and if I were an innocent man what I would say is fine, you want to delay  the hearing a month? Delay it. You want the FBI to look into it? Look into  it. You want to interview this witness in closed session, in open session--</p><p> CARLSON: So more people can accuse me anonymously of--</p><p> SAMUEL: --look into it. I am an innocent man.</p><p> CARLSON: --yes, uh huh. Yes, I wish we lived in a country - I'd be happy to  participate in such a system. But when you have people saying what Kirsten  Gillibrand said today or Congressman Garamendi said today, you're dealing  with unreasonable people who don't care about justice and it's scary. And I  know that you believe that his (ph)--</p><p> SAMUEL: Prosecutors often don't and that is why--</p><p> CARLSON: Yes, I agree.</p><p> SAMUEL: --it would be important--</p><p> CARLSON: I agree.</p><p> SAMUEL: I would think in his position to position yourself as a person who  says these people are unreasonable and the way I will prove it to you is I  will give them everything they want and they will find nothing.</p><p> CARLSON: I think he's doing that Monday.</p><p> SAMUEL: I am an innocent man--</p><p> CARLSON: Uh all right (ph).</p><p> SAMUEL: --if I were an innocent man.</p><p> CARLSON: I think that's the claim. Professor, thank you very much.</p><p> SAMUEL: Thank you very much for having me.</p><p> CARLSON: Well, our long-term investigation into Google and its behavior and  practices has borne fruit tonight. We have internal documents that show  Google employees plotting to use the company's search engine, the very core  of its business, which has a monopoly on search in this country, to  undermine the Administration's immigration policy without telling you,  secretively and dishonestly. That exclusive is next.</p><p> The news has been overwhelming tonight. A very special break from the  madness are two-time all champ - all-time champions face off in the  ultimate Final Exam. They are, as you know, Shannon Bream and Katie  Pavlich, coming up.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> CARLSON: Tonight, we have a development in our ongoing exclusive  investigation into the behavior of Google. There are new emails first  obtained by this show.</p><p> Now Google, as you know, is the most powerful company in the history of the  world. Virtually all human information flows through its software. And for  that reason, Google shapes much of how the world understands reality.</p><p> At the heart of Google's business is its search engine which has a virtual  monopoly on search in this country and others. Google search succeeds  because it is blindingly efficient but also because it is perceived as  honest.</p><p> When you search for a term on Google, the most popular results come to the  top. The process is straightforward and democratic. That's what most people  think. That's how it's perceived and that's why the world trusts Google.</p><p> But what if Google was lying to you? What if the results that you got were  secretly weighted to get you to vote a certain way, to believe a certain  thing? That would affect a lot of people and a lot of votes.</p><p> In fact, it would be impossible to have a real democracy under  circumstances like that. A small number of incredibly rich people would be  in charge of everything including your perceptions. </p><p> Well that is a major concern for all of us because Google is a very  political company. We recently showed you email evidence of the Google  effort to collude with a Left-wing group in support of Hillary Clinton's  presidential campaign.</p><p> Now tonight, we have internal documents that show that Google employees  discussed corrupting the company's search engine to push propaganda on  hundreds of millions of unsuspecting users. Here's what happened.</p><p> Shortly after taking office, President Trump issued his now-famous travel  ban. Almost immediately after that, Google employees began plotting ways to  undermine the President's Executive Order. </p><p> On January 29th, a Google Product Marketing Manager named Mackenzie Thomas  sent an email to a group of fellow employees. \"There is a large brainstorm  going on throughout the marketing org\" she wrote, brainstorming about how  to respond to Trump's order.</p><p> Among Thomas' ideas was \"To actively counter algorithmically biased results  for search terms such as Islam, Iran, Mexico, Latino and so forth.\"</p><p> In other words, Google employees wanted to alter the search results to make  them more positive in certain cases for political reasons. Thomas also  suggested promoting links for making donations to organizations fighting  the travel ban.</p><p> This, of course, would be completely dishonest and unethical behavior. But  Thomas' colleagues at Google seemed to approve of it strongly. Product  Manager Rami Banna (ph), for example, replied this way. \"We're absolutely  in Mackenzie, anything you need. We'll put together a list of orgs with  Meryl (ph) and HL (ph) team.\"</p><p> Another employee named Stacey Chen (ph) added that group she thought Google  should promote included the ACLU, the defect - the Immigration Defense  Project, the Arab-American Anti-Discrimination Committee and the National  Immigration Law Center. All of those groups were at the time agitating  against the President's immigration ban.</p><p> Even at least (ph) one person on the chain seemed to realize how dangerous  and out of the ordinary this conversation was. A Google employee called  Clement Wolf (ph) commented that \"He was very much in favor of Google  stepping up\" but was wondering \"How partisan we want to be on this? To the  extent of my knowledge, we'd be breaching precedent if we only gave  highlights access to organizations that support a certain view.\"</p><p> We contacted Google about these remarkable emails and the reply to us is  here in full. </p><p> \"These emails were just a brainstorm of ideas, none of which were ever  implemented. Google has never manipulated its search results or modified  any of its products to promote a particular political ideology - not in the  current campaign season, not during the 2016 election, and not in the  aftermath of President Trump's Executive Order on immigration. Our  processes and policies would not have allowed for any manipulation of  search results to promote political ideologies.\"</p><p> Left unanswered by Google was why anyone would believe that statement for a  second. Nor did Google say anything about the employees on that email  chain. Presumably, they still work at Google which is remarkable.</p><p> If you ran a bank and caught your tellers brainstorming about how to rob  the vault, would they still work for you? Remember that Google fired an  engineer called James Damore last summer almost instantly.</p><p> The CEO flew back from family vacation to fire him. Why? Because Damore was  caught expressing mildly conservatives ideas in a private memo. Here,  Google employees are plotting to subvert our entire public conversation  secretly. But that's fine with Google. </p><p> It shouldn't be fine with any of us or with the U.S. Congress. Google  executives are scheduled to testify on Capitol Hill next week. The  scheduled topic is privacy. But it would be nice if at least one elected  representative asked about this because it's much scarier than anything  Russia ever attempted.</p><p> Peter Schweizer wrote Clinton Cash. He now has a fantastic new documentary  called the Creepy Line about big tech and he joins us tonight. Are you  surprised by this?</p><p> PETER FRANZ SCHWEIZER, AMERICAN INVESTIGATIVE JOURNALIST, NOVELIST, AUTHOR,  POLITICAL CONSULTANT: Not really. It's just further confirmation that  Google has been cooking the books as it relates to search. </p><p> And you're absolutely right. I mean this would be like a company having a  brainstorming session on how we're going to fiddle with the books in - in -  in accounting. Then you're going to step back and say \"No, we were just  having a brainstorming session.\"</p><p> It - it speaks to the culture of the company. And the culture of the  company is they are prepared to put their thumb on the scale and shift the  debate in favor of the direction that they want to go.</p><p> CARLSON: But this is so corrupt that it's--</p><p> SCHWEIZER: Yes.</p><p> CARLSON: --I was stunned by it--</p><p> SCHWEIZER: Yes.</p><p> CARLSON: --and I was worried that these emails were not authentic because  it's such a big (ph) so search is the core of Google's business.</p><p> SCHWEIZER: Right (ph).</p><p> CARLSON: It's many different things, Google, but basically, it's a search  engine. It was built on the back of one.</p><p> SCHWEIZER: Yes.</p><p> CARLSON: And the promise has always been that they're not lying to you.</p><p> SCHWEIZER: Right.</p><p> CARLSON: But they are.</p><p> SCHWEIZER: That's right. And this is really the third strike as far as I'm  concerned. The first strike, of course, is the commercial search. When  travel websites and - and people like Yelp were complaining that they were,  you know, tilting the algorithm, you know--</p><p> CARLSON: Yes.</p><p> SCHWEIZER: --against them to others, Google said \"Absolutely not. We would  never do that.\" We now know the Federal Trade Commission, the EU, and  others have looked at this and said Google was fiddling with the algorithm.  The second strike as far as I'm concerned was the work done by Dr. Robert  Epstein--</p><p> CARLSON: Yes.</p><p> SCHWEIZER: --which shows clearly in 2016 that search was tilted to favor  Hillary Clinton. This is strike three. It shows that the culture of the  company is such that they're very happy having a free and open conversation  about manipulating the algorithm on a highly political subject.</p><p> CARLSON: But I don't understand. I mean so people go to jail for violating  our campaign finance laws because they put an extra ad on some cable  channel--</p><p> SCHWEIZER: Right.</p><p> CARLSON: --nobody watches.</p><p> SCHWEIZER: Right.</p><p> CARLSON: This is the most powerful company in the world.</p><p> SCHWEIZER: That's right.</p><p> CARLSON: How can we have a democracy in a country where Google can just get  whoever it wants elected by lying to us through the search function?</p><p> SCHWEIZER: It's a great example, Tucker, of regulations and campaign  finance laws not keeping up at all with where we are in technology. Nobody  were to consume (ph) when we pass laws about in-kind contributions to  campaign from companies that something like this would happen. </p><p> But this is the ultimate - the ultimate campaign contribution. This is not  like, you know, Exxon giving gasoline to a political campaign. This is a  company secretly tipping the scales in favor of candidates or causes or  beliefs that they have. It's done in secret. We don't know how it - how--</p><p> CARLSON: Yes.</p><p> SCHWEIZER: --extensive it's happening. And 80 to 90 percent of search in  the world is basically done through Google, so they have complete dominance  in this area.</p><p> CARLSON: And the Congress does nothing. And I can think of at least one  Republican senator who I believe has been bought off by Google. I don't  think he's alone.</p><p> SCHWEIZER: Yes.</p><p> CARLSON: At some point it might be worth naming who those people are.  Peter, great to see you.</p><p> SCHWEIZER: Thanks, Tucker.</p><p> CARLSON: We're not going to stop this investigation into Google or any of  the other tech companies that increasingly seem to determine the direction  of this country. </p><p> Well a Republican Senate candidate is being denounced as a would-be  theocrat for saying that men have a duty to lead. He joins us to rebut his  critics after the break.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> CARLSON: Well one of the pivotal facts of modern American life is that the  country and, particularly, its cities are pretty safe. They didn't always -  they weren't always safe. But for about last 20 years, the murder rate has  gone down. Now, sadly, it is rising again. But it's not surprising. </p><p> For years, the Left has been denouncing the cops as bigots, all of them.  Just the other day, Senate Candidate Beto O'Rourke in Texas called police  \"The new Jim Crow,\" and claim they shoot people just because of the color  of their skin.</p><p> So, think to yourself and be honest. Would you want to be a cop right now?  Who would want to be a cop? Why would you want to risk your life to protect  the public for very little pay while some moron like Beto O'Rourke who's  never even met you, knows nothing about you, calls you a bigot? It's  because of the uniform you wear.</p><p> It wouldn't be worth it for you probably. It's not worth it for a lot of  people. For that, among other reasons, American cities are becoming less  safe, much less safe, in some cases.</p><p> Yesterday, Attorney General Jeff Sessions went to Chicago. It's one of the  city's hardest hit by this trend. He laid out very clearly why more  Americans are getting killed in big cities. Watch.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> JEFF SESSIONS, UNITED STATES ATTORNEY GENERAL: The professors who studied  Chicago called it the ACLU Effect. Policing went down. Crime when up. So  there's a clear lesson here. If you want more shootings, more death, listen  to the ACLU, Antifa, Black Lives Matter and groups who do not know the  reality of policing.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CARLSON: The funny thing is that most of these changes have taken place  under the pretext of civil liberties. And yet, the people pushing them  don't care about civil liberties, certainly not your civil liberties, in  case you haven't noticed. </p><p> They're the ones telling you if you don't call an FBI investigation down on  yourself you must be guilty, these civil libertarians. If you're older than  35 you may remember when America's great cities depopulated essentially,  practically destroyed by blight. </p><p> That was definitely true here in Washington, certainly in New York City.  They recovered and real estate boomed and lots of people became happy and  didn't die because they became safer. What happens when they get dangerous  again as they are? The Left doesn't seem to care at all.</p><p>Michigan Republican Senate candidate John James is coming under fire for  expressing an idea that leadership can be a masculine responsibility. Watch  this.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> JOHN JAMES, REPUBLICAN MICHIGAN SENATE CANDIDATE: --men, we have a charge  to lead and we are failing in that because we are afraid to hurt someone's  feelings. The fact of the matter is women want men who've been tested. And  boys need to be tested. And--</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CARLSON: So women like strong men. Well don't just ask that guy. Ask  anybody who's ever studied the subject. There are reams of social science  on this question. And most Americans think it sounds sensible. But just for  uttering these words, one writer at the Detroit Metro Times has accused  James of seeking a Handmaid's Tale style theocracy. </p><p> John James joins us tonight. Mr. James, thank you very much for coming on.</p><p> JAMES: Thank you.</p><p> CARLSON: So before we get to what your critics are saying about you, why  don't you tell us what you were saying when you uttered those words?</p><p> JAMES: Absolutely. I was raised in the church. And I - I know based upon my  priorities which is God and country in that order, I also recognize we  talked a lot about rights in this country but not enough about  responsibilities. </p><p> I believe that we all have to step up. We are all created equal, male and  female, but I truly believe because of how I was raised that men have an  obligation to step up and not abandon their - their family  responsibilities, to step up and be role models and mentors in their  community and when I was talking to a faith-based business organization,  talking to men, talking about stepping up in their communities and holding  themselves accountable to be mentors.</p><p> The reason is right now the Left has very little way to attack me other  than take things out of context or just flat-out lie. I'm not going to fit  in anybody's blue box or anybody's red box. </p><p> I'm a conservative who believes very, very strongly in faith and family,  God and country, and service before itself. That's why I went off to serve  my country in Iraq. That's why I came back to build up my community right  here in Detroit. And that's why I'm going to go to Washington and continue  to serve my state.</p><p> CARLSON: So, just to be clear, you think that men should take care of the  families they create. And for that you're some kind of Ayatollah.</p><p> JAMES: Imagine that. I think that right now, particularly, in the African- American community, I believe that if I can be frank, and I know I can be  on this show that the overwhelming number of - of African-American females  having children are - are doing so and managing the role and responsibility  as a single parent.</p><p> I believe that men need to step up. And that's what I was talking about.  And the Left attacking me for that just proves that their business model is  dependent upon keeping Black folks dependent--</p><p> CARLSON: Exactly.</p><p> JAMES: --and in debt, and keeping them in the situation so they can make  sure that they depend on the Left for their vote. I - I'm not talking about  Left or Right. I'm not talking about Black and White. </p><p> I'm talking about the right thing, a message of economic opportunity where  we focus on early childhood development, K through 12 education, but you  have people here who talk a good game and talk about fixing the school  system here, talk about getting people out of there blight and their socio- economic downtrodden state, but then--</p><p> CARLSON: Exactly.</p><p> JAMES: --you have the ACLU who continues to allow these things to get in  the way. And I'm about creating--</p><p> CARLSON: Right.</p><p> JAMES: --freedom and opportunity for everyone, particularly in my - in my  community here in Detroit.</p><p> CARLSON: Good for you. Families are a threat to them. Marrying people vote  Republic and they hate the family as a result. That's the truth and I hope  you'll keep telling it.</p><p> JAMES: Yes (ph).</p><p> CARLSON: Thank you very much for coming on tonight.</p><p> JAMES: Thanks for having me.</p><p> CARLSON: Megyn Kelly had some brave and insightful words about the chaos  surrounding Brett Kavanaugh. We'll show them to you in just a minute. Mark  Steyn here to react to all that.</p><p> But first, the questions have been chosen. The crown is in place. The  champagne is cooling. It is time for the ultimate Final Exam. Shannon Bream  versus Katie Pavlich in a cage match to determine who wears the tiara, up  next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> CARLSON: Time now for Final Exam. News has bumped this segment off the air  for the past couple of weeks but not tonight. This is the contest where you  pit news professionals against one another to see who's been paying the  most attention to the news in the last week.</p><p> This week, the biggest show of all this showdown. Last year, Fox News @  Night host Shannon Bream pulled off a full Brady Bunch. She beat nine  opponents in a row.</p><p> Now, Townhall's Katie Pavlich has matched that feat. So naturally, as  Pavlich goes for win number 10, the challenger is Shannon Bream.</p><p> SHANNON BREAM, HOST, FOX NEWS @ NIGHT: Hey (ph).</p><p> KATIE PAVLICH, CO-HOST, THE FIVE: Hey (ph).</p><p> BREAM: I did notice (ph)--</p><p> CARLSON: But when we find (ph) the ultimate Final Exam champion, and by the  way, since this segment has done so well, we've upped our budget, our own--</p><p> BREAM: OK.</p><p> CARLSON: --Vanna White, Emily Lin (ph) joins us to that (ph) with glasses--</p><p> PAVLICH: Oh, my goodness. How classy (ph)?</p><p> BREAM: Oh my good - this is fancy (ph)--</p><p> CARLSON: --of vodka or sparkling cider whatever to toast--</p><p> BREAM: Well, thank you. This is--</p><p> CARLSON: --tonight's contest before we get started.</p><p> BREAM: --very fancy.</p><p> PAVLICH: This is very classy.</p><p> CARLSON: We waited years for the (ph) Final Exam, why (ph) thank you Emily  (ph). These are our Final Exam classes (ph)--</p><p> BREAM: Yes. Toast you (ph)--</p><p> PAVLICH: Thank you, Tucker.</p><p> CARLSON: --that's right. I'm the Ryan Seacrest. </p><p> BREAM: Have a nice (ph)--</p><p> PAVLICH: I see you (ph).</p><p> CARLSON: OK, are you all ready?</p><p> PAVLICH: I'm ready.</p><p> BREAM: Smell suspicious.</p><p> CARLSON: Ready.</p><p> PAVLICH: OK.</p><p> BREAM: By the way did you notice (ph) we both beat Peter Doocy--</p><p> PAVLICH: Cider.</p><p> BREAM: What a glutton for punishment? </p><p> PAVLICH: Oh, we did?</p><p> BREAM: He was reading a book (ph)--</p><p> PAVLICH: Poor guy. He was a (ph) team player.</p><p> CARLSON: But you know what?</p><p> BREAM: He's a good guy. He's team player.</p><p> CARLSON: No one should be ashamed to lose to either one of you because  you're that--</p><p> BREAM: No, no.</p><p> CARLSON: --good at this game. I've not looked at the questions by the way--</p><p> BREAM: Thanks (ph).</p><p> CARLSON: --sincerely.</p><p> BREAM: They're all on Kavanaugh though, I--</p><p> CARLSON: I want to be a perfect (ph)--</p><p> BREAM: --because if they're not, I - I don't know about anything else  that's happening in the world like (ph) Kavanaugh.</p><p> CARLSON: That's tonight's conspiracy show. All right, you know the rules.</p><p> PAVLICH: I'm ready (ph).</p><p> CARLSON: But I'll (ph) repeat them for audience. Hands on buzzers. I ask  the questions. The first one to buzz in gets to answer the question. You  must wait until I finish asking it in order to answer it. </p><p> You can answer once I acknowledge you by saying your name. Each correct  answer's worth a single point. If you get it all - wrong, you lose a point  from your total. Best of 5 wins. Dim the lights.</p><p> PAVLICH: I'm done (ph)--</p><p> CARLSON: Let's get started. All right.</p><p> BREAM: Where's the theme music?</p><p> CARLSON: Question - it - it's implied. Oh, there--</p><p> BREAM: OK. There it is OK, all right.</p><p> CARLSON: --Boston time (ph). Question one. The Emmys aired on Monday night.  It was the same boring awards show. It always is except with one exception.  Upon accepting his Emmy, Director Glenn Weiss did something unusual on  stage, what was it?</p><p> Shannon Bream.</p><p> BREAM: He proposed to his girlfriend.</p><p> CARLSON: On the air?</p><p> PAVLICH: Mm hmm.</p><p> BREAM: On the TVs.</p><p> CARLSON: Maybe I should have watched. Did he propose to his girlfriend?  Roll tape please.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> GLENN WEISS, PRODUCER, DIRECTOR: You are the sunshine in my life.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BREAM: Mm.</p><p> PAVLICH: That is beautiful (ph).</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> WEISS: You wonder why I don't like to call you my girlfriend.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> PAVLICH: Mm.</p><p> BREAM: How nice?</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> WEISS: Because I want to call you my wife.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BREAM: I mean how beautiful (ph)--</p><p> PAVLICH: Think she says yes (ph).</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> WEISS: Will you marry me?</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BREAM: Yes. We need to know (ph). Tucker--</p><p> CARLSON: Wow. </p><p> BREAM: --even you got tearuped there (ph)--</p><p> CARLSON: I was going to (ph) say I've never watched the Emmys but--</p><p> PAVLICH: It's all there (ph).</p><p> CARLSON: --if I do that, I'm going to watch him because I like that.</p><p> BREAM: OK.</p><p> CARLSON: I like him there (ph). </p><p> Question two. A cyclist in the Commonwealth of Virginia, who did something  very rude to President Trump's motorcade while it passed by her last year,  is now running for office. She lost her job as a result of the original  incident. What did she do to the President's motorcade? </p><p> Something - something - something rude to the President's motorcade.</p><p> Katie.</p><p> PAVLICH: She flipped him off.</p><p> CARLSON: Flipped him off--</p><p> BREAM: I think yes (ph).</p><p> CARLSON: --the bird - the finger, did she flip them off?</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: --made headlines after this photo capturing her giving  the--</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BREAM: Ooh, yes (ph).</p><p> PAVLICH: That's right (ph).</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: --President's motorcade the bird.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> PAVLICH: It does (ph).</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: --that woman now is running for office.</p><p> JULI BRISKMAN, CYCLIST: I got really motivated. The first thing--</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BREAM: I don't believe this (ph).</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BRISKMAN: --I did was sign up to volunteer at the - at the polls--</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BREAM: Oh, that's ability (ph)--</p><p> PAVLICH: Running for office is platform (ph)--</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BRISKMAN: --the next week after 2017 (ph) election.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BREAM: Yes. I thought it was that or Mooney (ph).</p><p> PAVLICH: Yes, I was going to say him (ph)--</p><p> BREAM: I was not sure but--</p><p> PAVLICH: --I almost said Rooney (ph) but--</p><p> CARLSON: You must have gotten double 800s in the SAT because you're the  best guesser I've ever (ph)--</p><p> PAVLICH: Oh, no, I failed SAT yes (ph)--</p><p> CARLSON: Oh, well. Should have been--</p><p> BREAM: Oh, see that proves that (ph)--</p><p> PAVLICH: Yes. Sorry mom and dad.</p><p> BREAM: --that process are (ph) no good. Those tests are no good.</p><p> CARLSON: One to one going into question three. The question may offend  vegans, vegetarians, and anyone who works at PETA, so turn off your TV if  you're in those categories. </p><p> Chefs at a seafood restaurant in the State of Maine say they want to show  compassion to the lobsters they're about to boil. Before going into the pot  the lobsters are given what to relax?</p><p> Shannon Bream.</p><p> BREAM: Marijuana smoke.</p><p> CARLSON: No way.</p><p> PAVLICH: What?</p><p> BREAM: I mean I hope it's true but then what happens to the lobster?</p><p> CARLSON: Well lobster (ph)--</p><p> BREAM: If you eat it, are you in trouble?</p><p> CARLSON: OK.</p><p> PAVLICH: It's like (ph) a brownie.</p><p> CARLSON: Is it marijuana - it's Maine. You never know (ph). Is it marijuana  smoke on the lobsters?</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: A seafood restaurant in Maine is now getting lobsters  stoned--</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> PAVLICH: Oh my god (ph).</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: --to kill them in a more humane way. Yes, instead of  being--</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BREAM: I mean brownie's good here (ph)</p><p> PAVLICH: Yes.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: --freaked out by boiling water, the lobsters now OD on  Chex Party Mix.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CARLSON: Wow.</p><p> BREAM: Oh. Chex Party Mix for the lobsters.</p><p> CARLSON: There's something kind of even sadder about that.</p><p> PAVLICH: How do you eat that (ph)--</p><p> BREAM: I know but--</p><p> CARLSON: It's acknowledging the pain--</p><p> BREAM: --are they happy when they go bye-bye--</p><p> PAVLICH: You know, they don't know what's happening--</p><p> CARLSON: I don't know.</p><p> BREAM: Yes.</p><p> PAVLICH: --it's fine.</p><p> CARLSON: Yes. They're certainly more passive.</p><p> BREAM: Delicious.</p><p> PAVLICH: Yes.</p><p> CARLSON: Question four. This one's a multiple choice.</p><p> BREAM: Oh.</p><p> CARLSON: There was a lot of rain in New York City recently and that caused  some subway stations to flood. Now, there's a video on the internet of an  animal protecting itself from rising water on the train platform. The  animal has been given a nickname. Is it rain raccoon, flood rat or puddle  pigeon?</p><p> Shannon Bream.</p><p> BREAM: Flood rat.</p><p> CARLSON: Flood rat?</p><p> BREAM: I think.</p><p> CARLSON: Is it flood rat?</p><p> PAVLICH: Probably. It's flood rat (ph)--</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE: In New York, a rat has become famous.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BREAM: All right, this maybe sane (ph)--</p><p> PAVLICH: They're rats, yes (ph).</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The rodent has taken the internet by storm.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BREAM: Oh, ho, ho.</p><p> PAVLICH: Yes, rats, pizza rat (ph)--</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Dubbed as (ph) flood rat after he was--</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BREAM: I actually just heard from him (ph)--</p><p> PAVLICH: Stop it that's seems (ph)--</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE: --caught on video shielding himself. He's at the bottom  of the screen (ph) there--</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CARLSON: Yes (ph).</p><p> BREAM: That seems so badass (ph).</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE: --on a subway platform. We just have to show it to you.  You can just make him out like that.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BREAM: Oh.</p><p> PAVLICH: OK.</p><p> BREAM: I feel like he's scared.</p><p> PAVLICH: Really when (ph)--</p><p> BREAM: Don't you (ph) feel like--</p><p> PAVLICH: Shannon, it's a rodent--</p><p> BREAM: I do (ph).</p><p> CARLSON: You're both such nice people but you know I need (ph) to feel  sorry for the rats in the subway.</p><p> BREAM: I do. </p><p> PAVLICH: You can rip the place (ph).</p><p> CARLSON: All right, final question. An Arby's restaurant in the State of  California just announced they will give you a free sandwich for life if  you show your dedication to the restaurant in what very permanent way?</p><p> Katie Pavlich.</p><p> PAVLICH: You get a tattoo.</p><p> CARLSON: An Arby's tattoo?</p><p> PAVLICH: Yes, an Arby's tattoo.</p><p> CARLSON: A high price for a sandwich.</p><p> BREAM: It is.</p><p> CARLSON: Isn't that (ph) Arby's tattoo?</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SETH ADAM MEYERS, HOST, LATE NIGHT WITH SETH MEYERS, NBC: Arby's has  announced they'll be giving out free Arby's tattoos in California this  weekend to their most dedicated fans--</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> PAVLICH: Free tattoo? Wow.</p><p> BREAM: Wait, they're giving it free (ph)--</p><p> PAVLICH: And free sandwiches (ph).</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MEYERS: --Said one man, \"Oh, no! What did I do last night?\"</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CARLSON: This nearly (ph) was the battle of champions.</p><p> PAVLICH: Congratulations, Shannon.</p><p> CARLSON: But with (ph) one point - nice game Katie--</p><p> PAVLICH: Good game.</p><p> BREAM: Thank you.</p><p> CARLSON: --Shannon Bream, you are now and forever the--</p><p> BREAM: Thank you, my friend.</p><p> CARLSON: --champion--</p><p> BREAM: Listen. No one in this network can beat the two of us--</p><p> PAVLICH: That's true. Absolutely.</p><p> CARLSON: That's true (ph)--</p><p> BREAM: --I mean we combine our forces for that (ph).</p><p> CARLSON: I want to ask our Vanna Whites, this is Louie (ph) and Emily (ph)- -</p><p> PAVLICH: Shannon is the only one worthy of wearing a crown. That is for  sure.</p><p> CARLSON: You get the (ph) - oh, and not the first in your life, either.</p><p> PAVLICH: Did you hear that Shannon (ph)--</p><p> BREAM: I'm a professional at this (ph)--</p><p> CARLSON: And there you go, Emily (ph) has the crown.</p><p> BREAM: Oh, no.</p><p> CARLSON: You are our winner, Shannon Bream.</p><p> PAVLICH: We need some music something to wave (ph)--</p><p> CARLSON: Wear that. Wear that with pride.</p><p> PAVLICH: Congratulations.</p><p> BREAM: Thank you.</p><p> CARLSON: And let that be an (ph)--</p><p> BREAM: Thank you.</p><p> PAVLICH: Yes--</p><p> CARLSON: --inspiration to you at home--</p><p> PAVLICH: Yes.</p><p> CARLSON: --to follow the news more closely every week and come back next  week to score as well as Shannon and Katie.</p><p> BREAM: Goodbye.</p><p> CARLSON: We'll be (ph) back next Thursday.</p><p> BREAM: Goodbye.</p><p> CARLSON: See you then.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> CARLSON: Democrats hid Christine Blasey Ford's letter for months. She asked  for anonymity. She didn't want her name out there. They leaked her name and  the letter at the last minute for political gain.</p><p> Now, they're trying to dictate the terms for how Washington responds to her  allegations in order to achieve further delays. Megyn Kelly at NBC News  called out that strategy in the clearest possible terms earlier today.  Watch what she said.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MEGYN KELLY, HOST, MEGYN KELLY TODAY, NBC: I think Dr. Ford is running out  of options. I think she needs to show up on Monday and offer her testimony  if she wants to be heard because for better or for worse, she is not in  charge of this. The - the Senate is in charge of this. That committee is in  charge of this.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CARLSON: Imagine saying that on NBC News? That's what bravery looks like.  Author and columnist Mark Steyn joins us tonight. </p><p> So, look, I mean no disrespect to the woman lodging the complaint, making  the allegation. You know, I take her tests (ph) - I think she's sincere. I  guess is what it (ph) - but is she in charge of the process in the country?</p><p> MARK STEYN, AUTHOR, COLUMNIST, STEYNONLINE.COM: No. Nobody has the right to  do this. </p><p> You - you say she's the person making the complaint. She hasn't actually  made a complaint. She's actually the only person in this story now who  hasn't actually made a statement under oath because even these letters that  Kavanaugh's friend Mark Judge sent to the Judiciary Committee, that's made  under penalty of perjury.</p><p> So you can't - if you have a complaint, you have to walk into a police  station and make the complaint and the police interview you. The police  won't investigate somebody if you're not even prepared to come into the  police station and tell your story. And that's how it should be.</p><p> Kirsten Gillibrand, who, as you said, is a lawyer. Half these legislators  are lawyers and the other half all have lawyers on their vast bloated  entourages want us to live in a world where anyone can call down an FBI  investigation on anybody else.</p><p> Well if that's the way we're going to live, I'm pretty certain it was  Kirsten Gillibrand who bust into my car in 1998 and stole my car radio. And  if she is innocent, she'll be calling for an FBI investigation into  herself.</p><p> CARLSON: Let--</p><p> STEYN: Let's bring it on, baby. Let's have it - let's have it for everyone.</p><p> CARLSON: Let me - let me just preemptively counter the attacks you're going  to face from the mindless shrieking dishonest harpies on the Left and the  robotic war - water carriers in the media. \"You're attacking the victim.\" I  just want to be clear. Nobody's attacking the victim here.</p><p> STEYN: No.</p><p> CARLSON: But does this work for any other species of crime? Can I  anonymously accuse you of embezzle - embezzlement or armed robbery and then  not elaborate on the accusation while your reputation is destroyed and you  lose your job, does that work?</p><p> STEYN: No. A - a criminal accusation is a serious thing. A criminal  accusation 36 years on is an even more serious thing.</p><p> CARLSON: OK.</p><p> STEYN: And if you took it seriously you wouldn't, for example, just send  the letter to one political party. You'd have sent it to both Dianne  Feinstein--</p><p> CARLSON: Exactly.</p><p> STEYN: --and to Chuck - and to Chuck Grassley. And but - but this is - this  is actually going, you know, the - the presumption of innocence is at the  bedrock of our judicial system. </p><p> And so, if you're - if you're just prepared to trash someone and we now  have people in the Democrat Party, Cory Booker boasted that he groped  someone--</p><p> CARLSON: Exactly.</p><p> STEYN: --at high school, and we shouldn't - and we shouldn't just be having  one set of rules for one party and for the other side you can trash him and  demean him and degrade him and destroy them at their (ph) - their  reputation--</p><p> CARLSON: You're right.</p><p> STEYN: --and if they don't (ph) want an FBI investigation they're to blame.</p><p> CARLSON: The great Mark Steyn, thank you Mark.</p><p> Richard Painter, up next. He abandoned the Republican Party early this year  to become a Democrat. Now that party is turning against him and you won't  believe why. That's next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> CARLSON: We've had Richard Painter on a couple times to talk about dumpster  fires. But that's not the topic tonight. The former Bush Ethics Lawyer  became a Democrat in response to the rise of Donald Trump. </p><p> Now he says he's being threatened by his new party, the Democrats, for  asking questions about Keith Ellison. He's the DNC Deputy Chair accused of  abuse by an ex-girlfriend. Richard Painter joins us tonight.</p><p> Richard, I wish we had more time. We've got completely squeezed by all this  news. But lay out for us this story. You've asked questions about Ellison.  What was the response you got from your party?</p><p> RICHARD WILLIAM PAINTER, AMERICAN LAWYER, PROFESSOR, POLITICAL CANDIDATE:  Well, first, I think they're trying to run the clock to the election  instead of having an investigation. It's been weeks. </p><p> I also complained back in May about the DFL's failure to investigate  harassment of a gay - gay man in the 8th Congressional District. He wrote a  very detailed email describing very explicit harassment in 2016 that was  just swept under the rug. </p><p> And I finally wrote the DFL Chair Ken Martin, and that man went public with  that. And he - of course, Ken Martin's been furious with me. And I  complained about that not being investigated. And then Ken Martin started  sending me emails saying he's got to, you know, starting to (ph) consider  legal action if I keep complaining about this. </p><p> Well, you know, my answer to this is that both political parties need to  focus on cleaning up their own act before they start attacking the other  party. There's a lot of covering up going on and sexual harassment, abuse,  and all of these problems are being covered up by the Democrats as well as  the Republicans.</p><p> And, you know, I find that very, very disappointing what happened here.</p><p> CARLSON: Well it is disappointing.</p><p> PAINTER: I find it (ph) very disappointing what's happening in Washington.</p><p> CARLSON: It's shocking. And I appreciate that. And we're going to follow up  on that story because I think it's - those are probably threads we should  be pulling. Thanks a lot (ph). Richard Painter, joining us tonight all too  briefly, thank you for that.</p><p> PAINTER: Thank you.</p><p> CARLSON: Well it's been an unbelievable and action-packed hour because this  is an unbelievable and action-packed moment with an awful lot at stake.  We're following it closely. We know you are too and we are grateful that  you're watching.</p><p> We'll be back tomorrow 8:00 P.M., the show that is the sworn enemy of  lying, pomposity, smugness, and groupthink, all of which are everywhere and  hurting our country.</p><p> Good night from Washington. Hannity live from Las Vegas where the  President's about to speak. Sean?</p><p> SEAN HANNITY, FOX NEWS HOST, HANNITY: Yes sir. </p><p> Tucker, great show.</p><p> CARLSON: Thank you.</p><p> END</p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC.

(Fittingly for the internet age, as well as that of covid-19, the four appeared via video link.) That Congress is fretting about the companies' power is a mark of their success. Consider Alphabet[2]. Its subsidiary Google dominates online search as well as the online 'ad stack', accounting for all of its parent's $34bn in profits. </p><p>Yet, as our American cover story[3] this week argues, at just 21 years of age Google is undergoing a mid-life crisis. Its very dominance limits its growth in search and online ads; ambitious new projects are yet to yield a breakout success. Its freewheeling culture functions less well now it has well over 100,000 employees. And, as this week's hearing reminded the whole industry, politicians and trustbusters are seeking to cut Big Tech down to size. Like many sufferers from middle-age spread, Google may have to slim down and refocus.Technology companies have done nicely during the pandemic: Amazon, Apple and Facebook all reported bumper quarterly profits on July 30th (though Alphabet's declined). But for the commercial-aviation industry, from makers of aeroplane parts to keepers of airport shops, covid-19 has been a catastrophe[4]. At the depths of the crisis, two-thirds of planes were parked; around one-third still are. Although some governments are even bribing[5] tourists to come, visitors are not flooding back[6]. The aviation sector's market capitalisation, around $1.3trn before the coronavirus struck, has dropped by $460bn. Traffic may not rebound to last year's level until 2024. When it does, aviation can return on a more sustainable footing, both environmentally and financially. But government rescues\u2014bail-outs, and suspension of rules to reallocate unused airport slots\u2014have so far been too generous to incumbent flag-carriers[7], even though they come with some green strings attached.For the world's migrants[8] the immobilisation caused by covid-19 has been a blight. Millions face deportation; millions have gone home; millions are stranded, having lost their jobs. Many have lost the chance of a better life abroad. Since the pandemic started governments have imposed more than 65,000 restrictions on travel. As they open up again, they may be less willing to accept migrants, out of fear that they will bring disease or cost natives precious jobs. As we argue in our cover story[9] in Asia and Europe, neither worry is well-founded. Migrants are vastly outnumbered by business travellers and tourists; and by bringing skills, spending wages and paying taxes, they boost prosperity. And the pandemic has made some natives appreciate the benefits of mobility: their doctors, nurses, care-home workers and hospital cleaners are often foreign-born.Having plummeted in the early stages of the pandemic, the prices of emerging-market bonds and shares have rallied remarkably, thanks largely to an ample supply of dollars from the Federal Reserve. China's strong recovery has pushed up commodity prices and helped to pull up the two-thirds of developing countries that export primary products. Fiscal loosening and forgiving financial regulation (eg, India's[10] moratorium on loan repayments) have also helped. Yet worries remain[11]. The immediate danger from the virus, to physical and financial health, has not yet passed. And it may do lasting economic damage, having disrupted global supply chains, made investors wary and interrupted children's schooling. A sign of one country's problems: for the first time since apartheid, this week South Africa[12] agreed to borrow from the IMF. Regional inequality afflicts many countries. Italy[13] may be wise to use money it gets from the EU's covid-19 stimulus plan[14] to lift its poor south. But regional disparities in Britain[15] are unusually wide, and getting wider. The richest bit (in central London) is 30 times better off than the poorest (Ards and North Down, in Northern Ireland). Unusually, too, people are not moving from places that are faring worst to those doing best; and except for London and Edinburgh, thriving cities do not lift the areas around them. As we report in our cover story[16] in Britain this week, the reasons for this are many and complex, including education, infrastructure, planning policy and Britain's (in particular, England's) centralised system of government. Having won a swathe of once solidly Labour seats in last December's election, Boris Johnson wants to redress the balance. Although the prime minister has a grand slogan\u2014'levelling up'\u2014he has no plan. The government has thrown some money at small towns and cities and is promising more cash for public transport in northern England. But devolving more power, including the raising of taxes, to metropolitan governments would be a more important step.

(Fittingly for the internet age, as well as that of covid-19, the four appeared via video link.) That Congress is fretting about the companies' power is a mark of their success. Consider Alphabet. Its subsidiary Google dominates online search as well as the online \"ad stack\", accounting for all of its parent's $34bn in profits. Yet, as our American cover story this week argues, at just 21 years of age Google is undergoing a mid-life crisis. Its very dominance limits its growth in search and online ads; ambitious new projects are yet to yield a breakout success. Its freewheeling culture functions less well now it has well over 100,000 employees. And, as this week's hearing reminded the whole industry, politicians and trustbusters are seeking to cut Big Tech down to size. Like many sufferers from middle-age spread, Google may have to slim down and refocus.</p><p>Technology companies have done nicely during the pandemic: Amazon, Apple and Facebook all reported bumper quarterly profits on July 30th (though Alphabet's declined). But for the commercial-aviation industry, from makers of aeroplane parts to keepers of airport shops, covid-19 has been a catastrophe. At the depths of the crisis, two-thirds of planes were parked; around one-third still are. Although some governments are even bribing tourists to come, visitors are not flooding back. The aviation sector's market capitalisation, around $1.3trn before the coronavirus struck, has dropped by $460bn. Traffic may not rebound to last year's level until 2024. When it does, aviation can return on a more sustainable footing, both environmentally and financially. But government rescues--bail-outs, and suspension of rules to reallocate unused airport slots--have so far been too generous to incumbent flag-carriers, even though they come with some green strings attached.</p><p>For the world's migrants the immobilisation caused by covid-19 has been a blight. Millions face deportation; millions have gone home; millions are stranded, having lost their jobs. Many have lost the chance of a better life abroad. Since the pandemic started governments have imposed more than 65,000 restrictions on travel. As they open up again, they may be less willing to accept migrants, out of fear that they will bring disease or cost natives precious jobs. As we argue in our cover story in Asia and Europe, neither worry is well-founded. Migrants are vastly outnumbered by business travellers and tourists; and by bringing skills, spending wages and paying taxes, they boost prosperity. And the pandemic has made some natives appreciate the benefits of mobility: their doctors, nurses, care-home workers and hospital cleaners are often foreign-born.</p><p>Having plummeted in the early stages of the pandemic, the prices of emerging-market bonds and shares have rallied remarkably, thanks largely to an ample supply of dollars from the Federal Reserve. China's strong recovery has pushed up commodity prices and helped to pull up the two-thirds of developing countries that export primary products. Fiscal loosening and forgiving financial regulation (eg, India's moratorium on loan repayments) have also helped. Yet worries remain. The immediate danger from the virus, to physical and financial health, has not yet passed. And it may do lasting economic damage, having disrupted global supply chains, made investors wary and interrupted children's schooling. A sign of one country's problems: for the first time since apartheid, this week South Africa agreed to borrow from the IMF. </p><p>Regional inequality afflicts many countries. Italy may be wise to use money it gets from the EU's covid-19 stimulus plan to lift its poor south. But regional disparities in Britain are unusually wide, and getting wider. The richest bit (in central London) is 30 times better off than the poorest (Ards and North Down, in Northern Ireland). Unusually, too, people are not moving from places that are faring worst to those doing best; and except for London and Edinburgh, thriving cities do not lift the areas around them. As we report in our cover story in Britain this week, the reasons for this are many and complex, including education, infrastructure, planning policy and Britain's (in particular, England's) centralised system of government. Having won a swathe of once solidly Labour seats in last December's election, Boris Johnson wants to redress the balance. Although the prime minister has a grand slogan--\"levelling up\"--he has no plan. The government has thrown some money at small towns and cities and is promising more cash for public transport in northern England. But devolving more power, including the raising of taxes, to metropolitan governments would be a more important step. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ECOCOM-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ECOCOM2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60GS-47W1-JCM9-30KX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">251202</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"835\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Economist Newspapers, NA, Incorporated All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Economist.Com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"37727\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"31\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 31, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

It missed analysts' estimates for third-quarter profit by about $1.7 billion, though it beat revenue estimates by about $175 million.\u00a0Alphabet shares lost 1.6% after-hours, to $1,268.50, nearly erasing the 1.95% gain notched in regular trading when Reuters, citing sources, reported Google had made an offer to acquire U.S. wearable device maker Fitbit.\u00a0Google has increased spending in recent years on areas including cloud computing and consumer electronics that it views as essential to maintaining its industry leadership in the face of stiff competition from Amazon and Microsoft.\u00a0The new businesses are pushing Google into sales of subscriptions, devices and technology licenses. But it has had to invest in people, facilities and content. Google is on track to hire more than 20,000 people this year, in large part to staff its newer units.\u00a0Nicholas Hyett, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said he was not overly concerned by the spending.\u00a0\"CEO Sundar Pichai can turn off the speculative spending at any time if he suddenly becomes more interested in profitability - but we suspect most investors would rather he stuck to the approach,\" Hyett wrote in a note.\u00a0Alphabet provides limited product-level financial disclosures compared with some peers, leaving investors increasingly uncertain about how pressures including regulatory scrutiny, advertiser boycotts and global trade tensions are affecting operations.\u00a0For instance, Alphabet reported $1.5 billion in unrealized losses in the third quarter from shares held in other companies, helping negate about $1 billion in profit. </p><p>But an Alphabet spokeswoman declined to disclose which investments lost money.\u00a0Profit also was hurt by a $554 million charge from a settlement with French tax authorities in September.\u00a0Alphabet's chief financial officer, Ruth Porat, told financial analysts that the company's revenue growth rates underscored \"the strength and vibrancy\" of the company.\u00a0\"In the last 12 months, we're generating over $150 billion in total revenues, that's about $25 billion of growth in the last year,\" she said.\u00a0Costly pursuits\u00a0Google has tried to demonstrate that its cloud-computing business is roaring, disclosing last quarter about $2 billion in revenue and saying that plans continued to hire thousands to stoke the unit's growth.\u00a0In hardware, Google's debut in May of the Pixel 3a, its most affordable smartphone yet, went well, according to technology analysts. It boosted Google's overall smartphone sales this summer in a typically slow quarter.\u00a0Google also has tried to reassure investors that there is no weakness in its YouTube video unit, while expressing confidence in its business overall through share buybacks.\u00a0But spending has not been held back and higher costs loom as Google deals with clashes with regulators.

For instance, Alphabet reported US$1.5 billion in unrealized losses in the third quarter from shares held in other companies, helping negate about US$1 billion in profit. But an Alphabet spokeswoman declined to disclose which investments lost money. Profit also was hurt by a US$554 million charge from a settlement with French tax authorities in September. Alphabet's chief financial officer, Ruth Porat, told financial analysts that the company's revenue growth rates underscored \"the strength and vibrancy\" of the company. \"In the last 12 months, we're generating over US$150 billion in total revenues, that's about US$25 billion of growth in the last year,\" she said. COSTLY PURSUITS Google has tried to demonstrate that its cloud-computing business is roaring, disclosing last quarter about US$2 billion in revenue and saying that plans continued to hire thousands to stoke the unit's growth. In hardware, Google's debut in May of the Pixel 3a, its most affordable smartphone yet, went well, according to technology analysts. It boosted Google's overall smartphone sales this summer in a typically slow quarter. Google also has tried to reassure investors that there is no weakness in its YouTube video unit, while expressing confidence in its business overall through share buybacks. But spending has not been held back and higher costs loom as Google deals with clashes with regulators. Total quarterly expenses grew 25per cent compared to a year ago - a similar rate to recent periods - to US$31.3 billion. It topped the previous high of US$31.1 billion in the 2018 fourth quarter.

The operating margin was 23per cent, down from 24per cent in the second quarter. Google in the third quarter acknowledged investigations by the U.S. Congress, Department of Justice and 48 states into the company's competitive practices. It settled a privacy investigation by the Federal Trade Commission. It also got an additional 90-day reprieve from an export ban that would restrict its relationship with Chinese smartphone maker Huawei, one of its top partners in distributing mobile apps.

Even, apparently, when you have explicitly told it not to. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/aug/13/google-location-tracking-android-iphone-mobile\">A recent investigation by the Associated Press</url> has revealed that Google records your movements regardless of whether you have disabled the \"location history\" setting. This is egregious, especially considering       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/aug/13/google-location-tracking-android-iphone-mobile\">Google's support page on the issue</url> states: \"With location history off, the places you go are no longer stored.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">While it is possible to prevent Google from time-stamping your every digital footstep, it is not exactly intuitive. You must log in to your Google account, go to the \"manage your Google activity\" section, open \"activity controls\" and disable the permissions there, which are enabled by default. This stops apps such as Google Maps and browsers from recording your location. However, it doesn't wipe your past location data; more steps are needed to delete that.</p><p>Going through the above is a hassle with which most people won't bother - as I imagine Google knows well. Who cares about privacy these days, after all? It seems big tech has realised it can afford constant <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/aug/13/google-location-tracking-android-iphone-mobile\">data-based scandals</url>, because not enough people care that the minutiae of their daily existence is being relentlessly mined and monetised without their informed consent. This apathy is, in part, attributable to the fact we are told we shouldn't care about privacy if we have nothing to hide. Google has helped propagate this notion. The company's former CEO Eric Schmidt once said: \"       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/aug/13/google-location-tracking-android-iphone-mobile\">If you have something that you don't want anyone to know, maybe you shouldn't be doing it in the first place</url>.\"</p><p>Is there anything more illustrative of late capitalism than the idea that being opposed to selling our souls is a sign of deviant behaviour? Wandering and wondering is an intimate part of who we are. It doesn't matter if you have nothing to hide. You should object to moments you thought were yours alone being captured, analysed and monetised. You should resist being commodified.</p><p>Wandering and wondering is an intimate part of who we are. It doesn't matter if you?? have nothing to hide</p><p>Even if you can't be persuaded to care about privacy, you should worry about the tech industry's growing power and hubris. Not only have Google, Facebook and Amazon become too big to fail, but they have also seemingly become too big to feel shame. Take Facebook, for example. When <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/aug/13/google-location-tracking-android-iphone-mobile\">the Cambridge Analytica furore</url> hit earlier this year,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/aug/13/google-location-tracking-android-iphone-mobile\">it made a lot of apologetic noises</url> and launched a       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/aug/13/google-location-tracking-android-iphone-mobile\">huge ad campaign</url> detailing how it was committed to connecting people and wiping out fake news. It has become clear, however, that Facebook's only concern is Facebook. Despite its PR proclamations, it expects everyone to fall into line with its worldview. Indeed, it was reported this week that Facebook's head of news partnerships told a gathering of publishers that, if media companies don't cooperate with Facebook, \"       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/aug/13/google-location-tracking-android-iphone-mobile\">I'll be holding hands with your dying business like in a hospice</url>.\"</p><p>There was a time when Google operated under the motto \"Don't be evil\". It has watered down this message as it has grown. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/aug/13/google-location-tracking-android-iphone-mobile\">Earlier this year</url>, it removed the phrase from its code of conduct. The news that Google is recording everything you do, even if you have signalled that you don't want it to, is yet another indicator that the tech company, like many of its peers, doesn't seem to care much for ethics.</p><p>Unless governments start regulating tech giants, it seems unlikely that they will start to take our privacy, or their power, seriously. Left to their own devices, their God complex will only get worse.</p><p>                                        Orange is the new white: how pumpkin spice took over                                      </p><p>It is already the middle of August. You know what that means. Soon it will be September. And then it will be winter. And then it will be 2019. Time will march forward relentlessly until we are all on our deathbeds, our lives having passed like a flash before our eyes.</p><p>Wait. I got way ahead of myself there. What I meant to say was far more cheery. I have wonderful news for readers inclined to measure out their lives with coffee spoons. Starbucks's pumpkin spice latte, the official beverage of \"basicness\", is returning early this year. According to a leaked Starbucks document, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/aug/13/google-location-tracking-android-iphone-mobile\">the PSL will hit stores on 28 August</url>. The disgusting drink doesn't normally become available until September.</p><p>Why does this matter? Because - believe it or not - people care. They really care. Since it launched in 2003, the PSL has become a cultural phenomenon. For some, this sickly-sweet beverage has come to symbolise unoriginal white women. There is even, I kid you not, an academic article in the journal GeoHumanities titled <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/aug/13/google-location-tracking-android-iphone-mobile\">The Perilous Whiteness of Pumpkins</url> that analyses how the PSL's \"lack of substance, and triviality, regardless of attempts to dismiss them as 'basic', make them ultimate luxuries and hence markers of distinction and white privilege\".</p><p>If you are wondering how a caffeinated drink catalysed academic analysis, the answer is basically \"advertising\". By ensuring that PSLs are only available during a certain season, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/aug/13/google-location-tracking-android-iphone-mobile\">Starbucks made the drink synonymous with autumn</url> and created an artificial sense of scarcity. In the US, it has also       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/aug/13/google-location-tracking-android-iphone-mobile\">profited from nostalgia</url>, invoking memories of Thanksgivings gone by. I would continue this analysis, but, good gourd, I think I have had my fill of pumpkin content.</p><p>                                        Cat-sitting in paradise? You have got to be kitten me                                      </p><p>Hate your office? Love cats? Well, have I got a career move for you! <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/aug/13/google-location-tracking-android-iphone-mobile\">There is a job going for a cat caretaker</url> on Syros, a Greek island in the Cyclades. Idyllic views of the Aegean sea will surround you ... as will scores of feral felines. I am not a cat person and this sounds pawsitively hellish to me, but plenty of people appear to disagree. The all-expenses-paid position, which was posted on Facebook last week, has gone viral. One imagines, cattily, that the internet's all-seeing algorithms will have kicked into effect and that anyone who peruses the position will be doomed to a lifetime supply of targeted ads for Whiskas.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GUARDN-46419033</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GUARDN2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5T1K-YNM1-F021-64FM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">138620</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-08-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1027\"/><timeReceived>12:31 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Guardian, a division of Transcontinental Media Group Inc.

But his pitch injects a suggestive undercurrent that puffs up the risk for humanity of not letting technologists get on with business as usual and apply AI at population-scale - with the Google chief claiming: \"AI has the potential to improve billions of lives, and the biggest risk may be failing to do so\" - thereby seeking to frame 'no hard limits' as actually the safest option for humanity.<br/>Simultaneously the pitch downplays any negatives that might cloud the greater good that Pichai implies AI will unlock - presenting \"potential negative consequences\" as simply the inevitable and necessary price of technological progress.<br/>It's all about managing the level of risk, is the leading suggestion, rather than questioning outright whether the use of a hugely risk-laden technology such as facial recognition should actually be viable in a democratic society.<br/>\"Internal combustion engines allowed people to travel beyond their own areas but also caused more accidents,\" Pichai writes, raiding history for a self-serving example while ignoring the vast climate costs of combustion engines (and the resulting threat now posed to the survival of countless species on Earth).<br/>\"The internet made it possible to connect with anyone and get information from anywhere, but also easier for misinformation to spread,\" he goes on.\u00a0\"These lessons teach us that we need to be clear-eyed about what could go wrong.\"<br/>For \"clear-eyed\" read: Accepting of the technology-industry's interpretation of 'collateral damage'. (Which, in the case of misinformation and Facebook, appears to run to feeding democracy itself into the ad-targeting meat-grinder.)<br/>Meanwhile, not at all mentioned in Pichai's discussion of AI risks: The concentration of monopoly power that artificial intelligence appears to be very good at supercharging.<br/>Funny that.<br/>Of course it's hardly surprising a tech giant that, in recent years, rebranded an entire research division to 'Google AI' - and has previously been called out by some of its own workforce over a project involving applying AI to military weapons technology - should be lobbying lawmakers to set AI 'limits' that are as dilute and abstract as possible.<br/>The only thing that's better than zero regulation are laws made by useful idiots who've fallen hook, line and sinker for industry-expounded false dichotomies - such as those claiming it's 'innovation or privacy'.<br/>Pichai's intervention also comes at a strategic moment, with US lawmakers eyeing AI regulation and the White House seemingly throwing itself into alignment with tech giants' desires for 'innovation-friendly' rules which make their business easier. (To wit: This month White House CTO Michael Kratsios warned in a Bloomberg op-ed\u00a0against \"preemptive, burdensome or duplicative rules that would needlessly hamper AI innovation and growth\".)<br/>The new European Commission, meanwhile, has been sounding a firmer line on both AI and big tech.<br/>It\u00a0has made tech-driven change a key policy priority, with president Ursula von der Leyen making public noises about reining in tech giants. She has also committed to publish \"a coordinated European approach on the human and ethical implications of Artificial Intelligence\" within her first 100 days in office. (She took up the post on December 1, 2019 so the clock is ticking.)<br/>Last week a leaked draft of the Commission proposals for pan-EU AI regulation suggest it's leaning towards a relatively light touch approach (albeit, the European version of light touch is considerably more involved and interventionist than anything born in a Trump White House, clearly) - although the paper does float the idea of a temporary ban on the use of facial recognition technology in public places.<br/>The paper notes that such a ban would \"safeguard the rights of individuals, in particular against any possible abuse of the technology\" - before arguing against such a \"far-reaching measure that might hamper the development and uptake of this technology\", in favor of relying on provisions in existing EU law (such as the EU data protection framework, GDPR), in addition to relevant tweaks to current product safety and liability laws.<br/>While it's not yet clear which way the Commission will jump on regulating AI, even the lightish-touch version its considering would likely be a lot more onerous than Pichai would like.<br/>In the op-ed he calls for what he couches as \"sensible regulation\" - aka taking a \"proportionate approach, balancing potential harms, especially in high-risk areas, with social opportunities\".<br/>For \"social opportunities\" read: The plentiful 'business opportunities' Google is spying - assuming the hoped for vast additional revenue scale it can get by supercharging expansion of AI-powered services into all sorts of industries and sectors (from health to transportation to everywhere else in between) isn't derailed by hard legal limits on where AI can actually be applied.<br/>\"Regulation can provide broad guidance while allowing for tailored implementation in different sectors,\" Pichai urges, setting out a preference for enabling \"principles\" and post-application \"reviews\", to keep the AI spice flowing.<br/>The op-ed only touches very briefly on facial recognition - despite the FT editors choosing to illustrate it with an image of the tech. Here Pichai again seeks to reframe the debate around what is, by nature, an extremely rights-hostile technology - talking only in passing of \"nefarious uses\" of facial recognition.<br/>Of course this wilfully obfuscates the inherent risks of letting blackbox machines make algorithmic guesses at identity every time a face happens to pass through a public space.<br/>You can't hope to protect people's privacy in such a scenario. Many other rights are also at risk, depending on what else the technology is being used for. So, really, any use of facial recognition is laden with individual and societal risk.<br/>But Pichai is seeking to put blinkers on lawmakers. He doesn't want them to see inherent risks baked into such a potent and powerful technology - pushing them towards only a narrow, ill-intended subset of \"nefarious\" and \"negative\" AI uses and \"consequences\" as being worthy of \"real concerns\".\u00a0<br/>And so he returns to banging the drum for \"a principled and regulated approach to applying AI\" [emphasis ours] - putting the emphasis on regulation that, above all, gives the green light for AI to be applied.<br/>What technologists fear most here is rules that tell them when artificial intelligence absolutely cannot apply.<br/>Ethics and principles are, to a degree, mutable concepts - and ones which the tech giants have become very practiced at claiming as their own, for PR purposes, including by attaching self-styled 'guard-rails' to their own AI operations. (But of course there's no actual legal binds there.)<br/>At the same time data-mining giants like Google are very smooth operators when it comes to gaming existing EU rules around data protection, such as by infesting their user-interfaces with confusing dark patterns that push people to click or swipe their rights away.<br/>But a ban on applying certain types of AI would change the rules of the game. Because it would put society in the driving seat.<br/>Laws that contained at least a moratorium on certain \"dangerous\" applications of AI - such as facial recognition technology, or autonomous weapons like the drone-based system Google was previously working on - have been called for by some far-sighted regulators.<br/>And a ban would be far harder for platform giants to simply bend to their will.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GREENT-M-542848</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GREENT2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y1K-02X1-JBYT-H49S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">422724</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1318\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 FFC Information Solution Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Greentechlead.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20189\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 21, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"97\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"97\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Pichai says Google's approach is to make privacy more democratic. He also called on the US to introduce new legislation protecting users' data.</p><p>In the op-ed, Pichai contrasted Google's approach to privacy with Apple's. In a thinly veiled snipe at the iPhone-maker, Pichai said that  privacy cannot be a luxury good  that's only available to  people who can afford to buy premium products and services. </p><p>Apple's Tim Cook has taken aim at Google in the past, notably telling attendees of a privacy conference in 2018 that modern technology has created a  data-industrial complex  where personal and private information is abused by platform-holders in pursuit of profit. Meanwhile, Apple has framed itself and its products as protectors of user privacy in its latest marketing blitz. The company is in a unique position to do so, since its business model is still overwhelmingly focused around selling premium devices. Even its cheapest phones, like the $749 iPhone XR, have an equivalent price to flagship handsets from other manufacturers.</p><p>Kevin Roose</p><p>@kevinroose  </p><p>The Valley-wide scramble to redefine privacy as  we take your data and don't give it to anyone else  instead of  we don't take your data in the first place  is fascinating to watch. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/07/opinion/google-sundar-pichai-privacy.html\">https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/07/opinion/google-sundar-pichai-privacy.html</url> ...</p><p>1,7936:53 AM   May 8, 2019Twitter Ads info and privacyOpinion | Google's Sundar Pichai: Privacy Should Not Be a Luxury Good</p><p>Yes, we use data to make products more helpful for everyone. But we also protect your information.</p><p>nytimes.com 914 people are talking about this   </p><p>In an attempt to reframe Google's privacy credentials, Pichai emphasizes how the company collects and uses customer data responsibly. For example, he outlines how the data Google collects makes its services more useful. On an individual basis this means a service like Photos knows to group your vacation photos together into a single album. Collectively, anonymized data is aggregated and sent to Google to improve its products for everyone. Pichai claims that responsible data collection means Google can protect privacy, even as it has access to mountains of personal information.</p><p>Crucially, the CEO minimizes the ad-targeting aspects of the data Google collects, even though advertising is at the core of Google's business model. Pichai calls it a  small subset of data  that helps to serve  relevant  ads which can be turned off, and he assures users that it doesn't include personal data from apps like Docs or Gmail.</p><p>Google has to work a lot harder than Apple to assure everyone that it takes user privacy seriously. While Apple abandoned its push into advertising in 2011 in favor of making its money from selling hardware and, increasingly, services, most of Google's core services are free in exchange for the user data needed to sell targeted advertising. Pichai might claim that only a  small subset of data  is used for its ad targeting, but it's easy to be skeptical when looking at the hundreds of billions the company earns in ad revenue each year.</p><p>Big Tech is trying to define the terms and prescribe the path forward</p><p>It's an important time for Google to promote what it sees as the privacy-aspects of its products. The tech industry as a whole has been hit with numerous privacy scandals over the past two years, and there are increasing calls for the tech giants to be broken up, more tightly regulated, or both. Last year, Democratic senators proposed new rules about how companies can collect and use personal information, and Democratic nominee hopeful Elizabeth Warren has said she wants to break up Amazon, Google, Facebook, and Apple if elected as president in 2020.</p><p>This shift has put tech companies on the defensive, with Big Tech trying to define the terms and prescribe the path forward.

Not only have industry executives admitted these limits aren't technically necessary[2], they've increasingly been abused to hamstring competitors. AT...for example, doesn't impose the limits on its broadband customers who use its streaming video service (DirecTV Now), but will impose the added charges if you use a competitor like Netflix[3]. For more than a decade ISPs have slowly but surely imposed such limits hoping that consumers wouldn't notice (think of the frog in the pot of boiling water metaphor with you as the frog). But as video streaming services have increasingly embraced high-bandwidth 4K streaming, consumer usage has started to collide with this arbitrary restrictions. </p><p>On the other hand, the rise of game streaming services like Google Stadia[4] is going to blow right past these caps, finally highlighting the problem in stark detail. Services like Stadia eliminate the need for local gaming hardware, with all of the processing occurring in the cloud. The bandwidth consumption of these services will be fairly incredible[5]:\"Google says that users who stream games at 720p, 1080p, or full 4K will eat through bandwidth at a rate of 4.5 GB, 9 GB, or 15.75 GB per hour, respectively. Were you to stream Stadia games at full 4K, you'll easily burn through a terabyte of data in less than three days. In the usage cap era, that's a fairly obvious problem. Presumably, users would be looking at similar data usage for other upcoming streaming services.Comcast, for example, imposes a 1 terabyte monthly cap on its users, who have the option of either buying buckets of additional data at $10 per 50 GB, or paying a flat fee of $50 (on top of their already high broadband bill) to remove the cap entirely. Using Google Stadia at full 4K resolution will blow through that cap in less than three days. And Comcast's 1 terabyte cap is among the more generous. Many DSL providers (like AT...impose usage caps as low as 150 GB a month. Many other rural ISPs have caps as low as 10 to 50 GB per month. In the wake of the launch of Google Stadia (and other similar products from the likes of Microsoft) there's going to be a lot of surprised consumers with sore wallets. And that anger is only going to rejuvenate questions as to why these arbitrary and unnecessary limits exist (to make the telecom industry more money, duh) and why regulators have done absolutely nothing about what's a fairly obvious cash grab (regulatory capture and corruption, duh). The other problem that we're going to face is on the net neutrality front. Many ISPs are developing their own cloud gaming platforms[6]. Given the abuse of zero rating and usage caps in streaming video[7], it's very likely that ISPs will apply usage caps to customers who use competing gaming services but not their own, distorting the playing field, and harming innovation and competition. All told, it's going to be a crash course in why net neutrality is important, and why the recent tech policy fixation on \"big tech\" exclusively views the problems in tech through too narrow of a peephole.Permalink[8] | Comments[9] | Email This Story[10] [ 1]: <url

But it also raises questions about privacy and Google's dominance in the tech industry. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The company's announcement Friday came with a promise that it won't sell ads using the intimate health data that Fitbit devices collect. </p><p>Fitbit is a pioneer in wearable fitness technology, making a range of devices that have become pop-culture accessories, from basic trackers that count how many steps you take each day to smartwatches that display messages and notifications from phones. </p><p>They can track activities such as running, cycling and swimming and record heart rates and sleep patterns. Fitbit typically asks for date of birth, gender, height and weight to help with such things as estimating calories burned.  </p><p>Some people use Fitbit's app to record what they eat and how much water they drink. Women can track their periods. </p><p>Fitbit has 28 million active users worldwide and has sold more than 100 million devices. </p><p>Google, meanwhile, makes software for use in other manufacturers' wearable devices, but those products haven't gained much traction in the face of competition from Fitbit, Apple, Samsung and others. And Google doesn't sell a device of its own. </p><p>The deal to buy Fitbit could give Google a needed boost. </p><p>\"Google doesn't want to be left out of the party,\" said analyst Daniel Ives of Wedbush Securities. \"If you look at what Apple has done with wearables, it's a missing piece of the puzzle for Google.\" </p><p>Google's pledge that it won't sell ads using Fitbit health data is a continuation of promises previously made by Fitbit. </p><p>Privacy experts, though, are skeptical. </p><p>Consumer Reports health privacy expert Dena Mendelsohn said she is concerned that people enrolled in wellness programs through their employers that use Fitbit devices could lose control over their data. </p><p>\"While a person may not have had concerns about Fitbit holding their data, they may have concerns over Google holding their data,\" Mendelsohn said. </p><p>Google's promise is also unlikely to stop it from gathering other information from Fitbit devices. </p><p>For example, Fitbit has GPS models that could track users' locations. That could help Google know that a runner stopped at a coffee shop on the way home. Google could then display ads for rival coffee shops. </p><p>More important, having a Google device on the wrist could drive wearers to use Google services even more, giving the company more ways to sell ads. </p><p>The deal is likely to face scrutiny from state and U.S. Department of Justice antitrust authorities, who are already investigating Google and other big tech companies over whether they have abused their market power. </p><p>\"Why should Google be permitted to acquire even more companies while they're under DOJ antitrust investigation?\" Sen. Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican, tweeted. </p><p>Still, analysts at equity research firm Cowen said they believe regulators are unlikely to block the deal because of Fitbit's relatively small size and its focus on hardware. </p><p>While Fitbit all but created the field, it has been shredded by the competition. It was worth nearly $10 billion after it went public in 2015. But its value this week is well below $2 billion. </p><p>When rumors of a potential buyout by Google surfaced this week, Fitbit stock soared almost 30%. It jumped nearly 16% more in afternoon trading Friday. </p><p>Google's corporate parent, Alphabet, will pay $7.35 per share. Alphabet stock gained less than 1%. </p><p>\"With Google's resources and global platform, Fitbit will be able to accelerate innovation in the wearables category, scale faster, and make health even more accessible to everyone,\" Fitbit co-founder and CEO James Park said in a statement. </p><p>Fitbit has been expanding its partnerships with major health care companies such as Humana to encourage healthier living. </p><p>John Hancock announced incentives last year on its insurance policies for people willing share data gathered by health-monitoring devices. It offers free Fitbits to participants. </p><p>Last year, Fitbit acquired a health coaching business that helps people manage conditions such as diabetes and high blood pressure. </p><p>Fitbit ranks fourth in global shipments of digital watches, fitness trackers and other wrist-worn devices, according to research firm IDC. Chinese companies Xiaomi and Huawei were No. 1 and No. 3, Apple was No. 2, and Samsung came in fifth. </p><p>------ </p><p>AP Business Writer Michelle Chapman and Technology Writers Tali Arbel, Frank Bajak and Rachel Lerman contributed to this report. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TRBREV-1888133</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TRBREV2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XDN-DYR1-DYCW-C2JN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">279169</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"793\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Tribune Review Publishing Company All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Tribune-Review (Greensburg, PA)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"11\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>November 1, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"97\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"97\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Google's parent company is buying wearable device maker Fitbit for about $2.1 billion. Alphabet said Friday, Nov. </p><p>1, 2019, that it will pay $7.35 per share. (AP Photo/Mark Lennihan, File)Google, the company that helped make it fun to just sit around surfing the web, is jumping into the fitness-tracker business with both feet, buying Fitbit for about $2.1 billion. The deal could put Google in direct competition with Apple and Samsung in the highly competitive market for smartwatches and other wearable electronics. But it also raises questions about privacy and Google's dominance in the tech industry. The company's announcement Friday came with a promise that it won't sell ads using the intimate health data that Fitbit devices collect. Fitbit is a pioneer in wearable fitness technology, making a range of devices that have become pop-culture accessories, from basic trackers that count how many steps you take each day to smartwatches that display messages and notifications from phones. They can track activities such as running, cycling and swimming and record heart rates and sleep patterns. Fitbit typically asks for date of birth, gender, height and weight to help with such things as estimating calories burned. Some people use Fitbit's app to record what they eat and drink. Women can track their periods. Fitbit has 28 million active users worldwide and has sold more than 100 million devices. Google, meanwhile, makes software for use in other manufacturers' wearable devices, but those products haven't gained much traction in the face of competition from Fitbit, Apple, Samsung and others. And Google doesn't sell a device of its own. The deal to buy Fitbit could give Google a needed boost. \"Google doesn't want to be left out of the party,\" said analyst Daniel Ives of Wedbush Securities. \"If you look at what Apple has done with wearables, it's a missing piece of the puzzle for Google.\" Google's pledge that it won't sell ads using Fitbit health data is a continuation of promises previously made by Fitbit. Privacy experts, though, were skeptical. Consumer Reports health privacy expert Dena Mendelsohn said she is concerned that people enrolled in wellness programs through their employers that use Fitbit devices could lose control over their data. \"While a person may not have had concerns about Fitbit holding their data, they may have concerns over Google holding their data,\" Mendelsohn said. Google's promise is also unlikely to stop it from gathering up other information from Fitbit devices. For example, Fitbit has GPS models that could track users' locations. That could help Google know that a runner stopped at a coffee shop on the way home. Google could then display ads for rival coffee shops. More important, having a Google device on the wrist could drive wearers to use Google services even more, giving the company more ways to sell ads. The deal is likely to face scrutiny from state and U.S. Department of Justice antitrust authorities, who are already investigating Google and other big tech companies over whether they have abused their market power. \"Why should Google be permitted to acquire even more companies while they're under DOJ antitrust investigation?\" Sen. Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican, tweeted. Still, analysts at equity research firm Cowen said they believe regulators are unlikely to block the deal because of Fitbit's relatively small size and its focus on hardware. While Fitbit all but created the field, it has been shredded by the competition. It was worth nearly $10 billion after it went public in 2015. But its value this week is well below $2 billion. When rumors of a potential buyout by Google surfaced earlier this week, Fitbit stock soared almost 30%. It jumped nearly 16% more in afternoon trading Friday. Google's corporate parent, Alphabet, will pay $7.35 per share. Alphabet stock gained less than 1%. \"With Google's resources and global platform, Fitbit will be able to accelerate innovation in the wearables category, scale faster, and make health even more accessible to everyone,\" Fitbit co-founder and CEO James Park said in a statement. Fitbit has been expanding its partnerships with major health care companies such as Humana to encourage healthier living. John Hancock announced incentives last year on its insurance policies for people willing share data gathered by health-monitoring devices. It offers free Fitbits to participants. Last year, Fitbit acquired a health coaching business that helps people manage conditions such as diabetes and high blood pressure. Fitbit ranks fourth in global shipments of digital watches, fitness trackers and other wrist-worn devices, according to research firm IDC. Chinese companies Xiaomi and Huawei were No. 1 and No. 3, Apple was No. 2, and Samsung came in fifth. ___ AP Business Writer Michelle Chapman and Technology Writers Tali Arbel, Frank Bajak and Rachel Lerman contributed to this report.

But it also raises questions about privacy and Google's dominance in the tech industry.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> The company's announcement Friday came with a promise that it won't sell ads using the intimate health data that Fitbit devices collect.</p><p>Fitbit is a pioneer in wearable fitness technology, making a range of devices that have become pop-culture accessories, from basic trackers that count how many steps you take each day to smartwatches that display messages and notifications from phones.</p><p> They can track activities such as running, cycling and swimming and record heart rates and sleep patterns. Fitbit typically asks for date of birth, gender, height and weight to help with such things as estimating calories burned. Some people use Fitbit's app to record what they eat and how much water they drink. Women can track their periods.</p><p>Fitbit has 28 million active users worldwide and has sold more than 100 million devices.</p><p>Google, meanwhile, makes software for use in other manufacturers' wearable devices, but those products haven't gained much traction in the face of competition from Fitbit, Apple, Samsung and others. And Google doesn't sell a device of its own.</p><p> The deal to buy Fitbit could give Google a needed boost.</p><p> \"Google doesn't want to be left out of the party,\" said analyst Daniel Ives of Wedbush Securities. \"If you look at what Apple has done with wearables, it's a missing piece of the puzzle for Google.\"</p><p>Google's pledge that it won't sell ads using Fitbit health data is a continuation of promises previously made by Fitbit.</p><p> Privacy experts, though, were skeptical.</p><p> Consumer Reports health privacy expert Dena Mendelsohn said she is concerned that people enrolled in wellness programs through their employers that use Fitbit devices could lose control over their data.</p><p> \"While a person may not have had concerns about Fitbit holding their data, they may have concerns over Google holding their data,\" Mendelsohn said.</p><p>Google's promise is also unlikely to stop it from gathering other information from Fitbit devices.</p><p> For example, Fitbit has GPS models that could track users' locations. That could help Google know that a runner stopped at a coffee shop on the way home. Google could then display ads for rival coffee shops.</p><p> More important, having a Google device on the wrist could drive wearers to use Google services even more, giving the company more ways to sell ads.</p><p> The deal is likely to face scrutiny from state and U.S. Department of Justice antitrust authorities, who are already investigating Google and other big tech companies over whether they have abused their market power.</p><p> \"Why should Google be permitted to acquire even more companies while they're under DOJ antitrust investigation?\" Sen. Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican, tweeted.</p><p> Still, analysts at equity research firm Cowen said they believe regulators are unlikely to block the deal because of Fitbit's relatively small size and its focus on hardware.</p><p> While Fitbit all but created the field, it has been shredded by the competition. It was worth nearly $10 billion after it went public in 2015. But its value this week is well below $2 billion.</p><p> When rumors of a potential buyout by Google surfaced earlier this week, Fitbit stock soared almost 30%. It jumped nearly 16% more Friday.</p><p>Google's corporate parent, Alphabet, will pay $7.35 per share. Alphabet stock gained about 1%.</p><p> \"With Google's resources and global platform, Fitbit will be able to accelerate innovation in the wearables category, scale faster, and make health even more accessible to everyone,\" Fitbit co-founder and CEO James Park said in a statement.</p><p>Fitbit has been expanding its partnerships with major health care companies such as Humana to encourage healthier living.</p><p> Copyright 2019 The Associated Press.

Until now Google has largely remained behind the scenes and used surrogates to oppose amending the Internet law.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">On Friday, a group of more than 60 individuals and organizations committed to the protection of trafficking victims issued a statement expressing deep concern over the pervasive misinformation Big Tech supporters were offering. Among those criticizing Google for its hypocrisy was the National Center on Sexual Exploitation.</p><p>\"You would think a company whose motto is 'don't be evil' would think twice before choosing the side of sex traffickers,\" said Patrick Trueman, president of the National Center on Sexual Exploitation. \"Google lobbyists are bombarding members of Congress with emails against passage of the only legislation that will dramatically decrease sex trafficking of girls, boys, and adults online. This is a case of Big Tech caring more about its bottom line than the victims of serial rape for profit.\"</p><p>Nacole S., the mother of a teenager trafficked on Backpage said:</p><p>\"Google is using its billions to prevent families like ours from holding websites like Backpage accountable. Once again, the bottom dollar means more than the lives left in the wake of Backpage. This just shows how other companies would rather back them and save their 'precious' Section 230, than to see a safer Internet.\"</p><p>She said she is asking Google and other tech companies to act in good faith to deal with the sex-trafficking issue.</p><p>E. Stewart Jeffries, Google Public Policy Council, blasted out the email last week in opposition to S. 1693, the Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act of 2017 and H.R. 1865, the Allow States and Victims to Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act of 2017. Linked to the email were statements from groups opposing it based on myths about the reform effort.</p><p>Read Jeffries' email here: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.consumerwatchdog.org/resources/googlecongressemail080317.pdf\">http://www.consumerwatchdog.org/resources/googlecongressemail080317.pdf</url></p><p>Virtually all of the groups voicing opposition to amending Sec. 230 after S. 1693 was introduced last week have received funding from Google. Groups include the Internet Association, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, the Center for Democracy and Technology, and the Computer and Communications Industry Association, the R Street Institute, and the Software and Information Industry Association.</p><p>The anti-trafficking groups expressing concern over the pervasive misinformation Big Tech supporters were offering listed six \"myths\" Big Tech cites in opposing an amendment to Section 230:</p><p>Myth # 1: This is just about going after Backpage. Fact: If Backpage shuts down, other companies will quickly fill this space. The business model, not Backpage, is the reason that amending Section 230 is so essential.</p><p>Myth # 2: Section 230 should not be amended because bad actors can be prosecuted under federal criminal law. Fact: There is an urgent need to amend Section 230 because the 1st Circuit, in Doe v. Backpage, recently found that even if Backpage had participated in criminal activity, its conduct was protected from the claims of children who had been sold on its site. Indeed, the court advised the children to seek a legislative remedy because Section 230 was in conflict with the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act</p><p>Myth # 3: This legislation is an attack on free speech on the Internet. Fact: The primary purpose of Section 230 was to protect a fledgling Internet industry from legal fees related to defamation claims based on third party content. Courts have consistently interpreted and expanded Section 230 far beyond its original intent, to protect not only \"irrational free speech\" (e.g. revenge porn, snuff film sites, and other types of malicious speech) but actual criminal conduct.</p><p>Myth # 4: Section 230 is the bedrock of the Internet. Fact: courts have interpreted the statute to protect not only good faith filtering, but all third-party content (whether or not filtering occurs). This was never the intent. Technology has outpaced our legal framework with harm never contemplated when the law was enacted. Thus, Section 230 must be calibrated in light of decisions by courts to protect \"Bad Samaritans\" (hosting of illegal commercial sex; revenge porn; and the like) as well as actual criminal conduct.</p><p>Myth # 5: The Internet will break if Section 230 protection is clarified. Fact: Civil liability for all online entities that knowingly facilitate sex trafficking will have no impact on self-regulating, good faith actors.</p><p>Myth # 6: Amending Section 230 will discourage self-policing. Fact: Most legitimate tech companies have embraced self-policing and will continue to do so. However, for bad actors like Backpage, Section 230 has allowed the Wild West of the Internet to proliferate with no incentive to keep the dark side of technology at bay.</p><p>\"We call on Members of Congress and legitimate technology companies to join us in our efforts to end the horrific practice of sex trafficking and to join in an honest dialogue based on the facts,\" the statement said.</p><p>Read the statement here: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.iamjanedoefilm.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Section-230-Sta\">http://www.iamjanedoefilm.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Section-230-Sta</url>...</p><p>Google's Jeffries wrongly claimed that the Senate bill is \"trying to go after a single bad actor, Backpage\".</p><p>\"Backpage is the prime example of how Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act allows websites to escape accountability for enabling child sex-trafficking,\" said John M.

Reuters is reporting that Google has shut down its Mobile Network Insights service[1] over concerns that 'sharing data from users of its Android phone system might attract the scrutiny of users and regulators.' The service \u2014 which is offered to wireless carriers across the world \u2014 was essentially a map of signal strengths and connection speeds, and was meant to identify weak spots in their network coverage.Google's privacy dilemmaThe search giant launched the service in March 2017, but is said to have shut it down earlier this April. </p><p>The data for Mobile Network Insights came from users of Android phones, who had agreed to share their 'location history and usage and diagnostics with Google.' While this data was anonymized and aggregated, the company pulled the plug citing data privacy concerns. Google's shutting down of the service has 'disappointed wireless carriers that used the data as part of their decision-making process on where to extend or upgrade their coverage,' the report adds. The development comes as big tech companies are increasingly under regulatory spotlight for their data collection and sharing practices. It could also have been necessitated in part by stringent EU GDPR regulations, which mandate that companies seek explicit users' consent before processing their data.The need for transparencyThe fact that Google has preemptively decided to end a practice is a consequence of a string of privacy missteps and data scandals that have plagued big tech in recent years. In the past few months, Amazon, Apple, Google, Microsoft, and Facebook[2] were all found to use human contractors to quietly listen to conversations recorded by their products with an intent to improve software quality. While there is inherently nothing wrong with the practice, none of the companies clearly disclosed this was indeed happening. Viewed through this lens, the data minimization effort is only a start. Because if there is one thing behavioural research has repeatedly shown, it's that consumers rarely change their default settings[3]. Whether be it phones or laptops, or any online service, the truth is that 95 percent of people don't change a thing[4] \u2014 meaning what Google decides to turn on or off will have huge privacy ramifications. Which is why the company's decision to end the service is a step in the right direction. It's high time we deserve a platform that takes privacy seriously and encodes it into their design in a manner that instills transparency and trust.

The data for Mobile Network Insights came from users of Android phones, who had agreed to share their \"location history and usage and diagnostics with Google.\"<br/>While this data was anonymized and aggregated, the company pulled the plug citing data privacy concerns.<br/>Google's shutting down of the service has \"disappointed wireless carriers that used the data as part of their decision-making process on where to extend or upgrade their coverage,\" the report adds.<br/>It's not immediately clear if Google has alternative plans in place, but the company said, \"We remain committed to improving network performance across our apps and services for users.\"<br/>The development comes as Silicon Valley tech majors are increasingly under regulatory spotlight for their data collection and sharing practices. It could also have been necessitated in part by stringent EU GDPR regulations, which mandate that companies seek explicit users' consent before processing their data.<br/>The need for transparencyThe fact that Google has preemptively decided to end a practice is a consequence of a string of privacy missteps and data scandals that have plagued big tech in recent years.<br/>Over the past few months, Amazon, Apple, Google, Microsoft, and Facebook were all found to use human contractors to quietly listen to conversations recorded by their products with an intent to improve software quality. While there is inherently nothing wrong with the approach, none of the companies clearly disclosed this was indeed happening.<br/>Viewed through this lens, the data minimization effort is only a start. Because if there is one thing behavioural research has repeatedly shown, it's that consumers rarely change their default settings.<br/>Whether be it phones or laptops, or any online service, the truth is that 95 percent of people don't change a thing - meaning what Google decides to turn on or off will have huge privacy ramifications.<br/>Which is why the company's decision to end the service is a step in the right direction. It's high time we deserve a platform that takes privacy seriously and encodes it into their design in a manner that instills transparency and trust.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ITNEXT-M-55435</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ITNEXT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WVR-9241-JBYT-H07N-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">410719</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-08-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"469\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 FFC Information Solution Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>IT Next</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20189\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"08\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>August 20, 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

They may be the most innovative company in the world, but that doesn't mean they're above the law.\"The Arizona Attorney General wants Google to pay back the residents profits the company might have earned from monetizing their data.\"The Attorney General and the contingency fee lawyers filing this lawsuit appear to have mischaracterized our services,\" a Google spokesperson told The Verge.\"We have always built privacy features into our products and provided robust controls for location data. </p><p>We look forward to setting the record straight,\" the spokesperson added.Technology giants, including Google, have faced allegations of user privacy violations on many occasions, prompting politicians in the US to talk of stricter regulations and even breaking up \"Big Tech\".--IANSgb/naMENAFN2805202002310000ID1100234734</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GLOENG-1100234734</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GLOENG2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:600V-J1V1-F04Y-T36W-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">300986</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"268\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 MENAFN.COM All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Global English (Middle East and North Africa Financial Network)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"38987\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"05\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>May 28, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;
