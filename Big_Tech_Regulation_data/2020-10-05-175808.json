The big five US tech stocks have delivered 35% year to date, compared with the 5% increase in the S&amp; P 500 index. Amazon is up 63%, Apple 43%, Facebook 25%, Microsoft 27% and Google's parent company, Alphabet, 10%. Together, these companies are now worth nearly $7-trillion and represent more than 20% of the value of the S&amp; P 500 index. While they do not dominate the US index to the same extent as Naspers does the JSE, the market cap of these five stocks is about seven times the value of the entire JSE.</p><p>Before the pandemic hit, the services delivered by big tech were already ubiquitous. For instance, 82% of US households are Amazon Prime members, which gives them unlimited free delivery for $119 a year, compared with only 53% of US adults who voted in their 2018 House of Representatives election.

The big five US tech stocks have delivered 35% year to date, compared with the 5% increase in the S&amp; P 500 index. Amazon is up 63%, Apple 43%, Facebook 25%, Microsoft 27% and Google's parent company, Alphabet, 10%. Together, these companies are now worth nearly $7-trillion and represent more than 20% of the value of the S&amp; P 500 index. While they do not dominate the US index to the same extent as Naspers does the JSE, the market cap of these five stocks is about seven times the value of the entire JSE.</p><p>Before the pandemic hit, the services delivered by big tech were already ubiquitous. For instance, 82% of US households are Amazon Prime members, which gives them unlimited free delivery for $119 a year, compared with only 53% of US adults who voted in their 2018 House of Representatives election. Consumer demand for their products and services has taken off because these online giants meet everyone's basic needs more cost-effectively than their rivals, the physical providers of the same services.</p><p>The lockdowns, remote working and social distancing required by the pandemic have significantly accelerated the adoption of digital solutions.

It's the latest in a trove of conservative literature trying to dance around the fact that high-tax, highly regulated, bureaucratic states can be economic powerhouses. The writers deal with the \"problem\" by burying reality under a pile of \"buts\" and \"howevers.\"</p><p>In recent years, California has indeed suffered from gridlocked government, punishing pension obligations and debt --plus the housing meltdown. It's been addressing these challenges. And though one cannot vouch for the wisdom of every regulation, the state's environmental ethic is a big reason smart people put up with the warts.</p><p> But only Silicon Valley is doing well, The Economist says. Manufacturing stinks. \"IPhones are 'designed by Apple in California,'\" the article notes, \"but made in Shenzhen.\"</p><p> Apple nonetheless employs 16, 000 Californians in and around Cupertino and plans to expand that number to 24, 000. The Apple workers reportedly earn an average of $125, 000. There must be something going for Apple in California.</p><p> There's this fantasy that if our environmental regulations just went lax, America would have some renaissance in factory employment. Thing is, manufacturing output in this country has actually tripled in the last 60 years, Bloomberg Businessweek reports.</p><p>U.S. factories are simply being run with fewer, well-trained people operating computers. The lowskilled, low-wage, labor-intensive factory jobs are not coming back, and why should we want them?</p><p> The Economist seems vexed that Gov. Jerry Brown would sign a bill raising the minimum wage to $10 an hour in 2016 --as though Wendy's could sell burgers in Bakersfield from a store in Nevada. By the way, in 1968, the national minimum wage was $10.77 in today's dollars.</p><p> Only Silicon Valley?! Check out The Wall Street Journal's new \"Billion-Dollar Startup Club.\" These are companies valued at $1 billion or more by venture capital firms.</p><p> Of the 37 billion-dollar startups, 26 are based in the U.S. --22 of them in California. Of the four U.S. startups not located in California, three are in New York City --not exactly your low-tax haven and, at the moment, freezing cold. The other one is in Jacksonville, Fla.</p><p> Those who strike it rich will do tax planning, and that may include buying homes in low-tax places. But the big tech innovators are still building their companies where their brainiacs want to be. Kings of the creative class demand the stimulation found in great urban neighborhoods.

It's been addressing these challenges. And though one cannot vouch for the wisdom of every regulation, the state's environmental ethic is a big reason smart people put up with the warts.</p><p> But only Silicon Valley is doing well, The Economist says. Manufacturing stinks. \"IPhones are \u2018designed by Apple in California,'\" the article notes, \"but made in Shenzhen.\"</p><p>Apple nonetheless employs 16,000 Californians in and around Cupertino and plans to expand that number to 24,000. The Apple workers reportedly earn an average of $125,000. There must be something going for Apple in California.</p><p> There's this fantasy that if our environmental regulations just went lax, America would have some renaissance in factory employment. Thing is, manufacturing output in this country has actually tripled in the last 60 years, Bloomberg Businessweek reports.</p><p>U.S. factories are simply being run with fewer, well-trained people operating computers. The low-skilled, low-wage, labor-intensive factory jobs are not coming back, and why should we want them?</p><p> The Economist seems vexed that Gov. Jerry Brown would sign a bill raising the minimum wage to $10 an hour in 2016 - as though Wendy's could sell burgers in Bakersfield from a store in Nevada. By the way, in 1968, the national minimum wage was $10.77 in today's dollars.</p><p> Only Silicon Valley?! Check out The Wall Street Journal's new \"Billion-Dollar Startup</p><p> Club.\" These are companies valued at $1 billion or more by venture capital firms.</p><p> Of the 37 billion-dollar startups, 25 are based in the U.S.</p><p> - 23 of them in California. Of the three U.S. startups not located in California, two are in New York City - not exactly your low-tax haven and, at the moment, freezing cold. The other one is in Jacksonville, Fla.</p><p> Those who strike it rich will do tax planning, and that may include buying homes in low-tax places. But the big tech innovators are still building their companies where their brainiacs want to be. Kings of the creative class demand the stimulation found in great urban neighborhoods. And they want a nice countryside to hike in.</p><p> Two years ago, The Wall Street Journal published an emotional essay titled \"California Declares War on Suburbia.\" The writer was especially upset that the Association of Bay Area Governments had proposed limiting new housing beyond the San Francisco and San Jose \"urban fringe\" to 3 percent of the total. Most new buildings would be multifamily homes.</p><p> Boy, do they hate San Francisco. But the strict building rules have kept San Francisco - and its environs - a beautiful place. That's why tech people working in surrounding areas insist on making their nests in San Francisco when they could live cheaper, bigger and closer to work.</p><p> Universities are another magnet and incubator for new companies. They tend to spawn the liberal, active-government cultures in which innovation thrives. There's some irony that the premier tech center of Texas is progressive Austin, thanks in great part to the University of Texas, a creature of state government.</p><p> To the states with good education, an open-minded community and an attractive environment go the tech spoils. Taxation does matter, and there's such a thing as dumb regulations. But for the knowledge economy, that's not everything or even, it seems, the big thing. California shows how.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKOH-14BEF7B1CCD7CEC6</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F289A8F17588718 NWBKOH2014</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5BNN-XMR1-F0NV-F3NC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">401973</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-11-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"644\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2014 The Logan Daily News<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

It's the latest in a trove of conservative literature trying to dance around the fact that high-tax, highly regulated, bureaucratic states can be economic powerhouses. The writers deal with the \"problem\" by burying reality under a pile of \"buts\" and \"howevers.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In recent years, California has indeed suffered from gridlocked government, punishing pension obligations and debt -- plus the housing meltdown. It's been addressing these challenges. And though one cannot vouch for the wisdom of every regulation, the state's environmental ethic is a big reason smart people put up with the warts.</p><p>But only Silicon Valley is doing well, The Economist says. Manufacturing stinks. \"IPhones are 'designed by Apple in California,'\" the article notes, \"but made in Shenzhen.\"</p><p>Apple nonetheless employs 16,000 Californians in and around Cupertino and plans to expand that number to 24,000. The Apple workers reportedly earn an average of $125,000. There must be something going for Apple in California.</p><p>There's this fantasy that if our environmental regulations just went lax, America would have some renaissance in factory employment. Thing is, manufacturing output in this country has actually tripled in the last 60 years, Bloomberg Businessweek reports.</p><p>U.S. factories are simply being run with fewer, well-trained people operating computers. The low-skilled, low-wage, labor-intensive factory jobs are not coming back, and why should we want them?</p><p>The Economist seems vexed that Gov. Jerry Brown would sign a bill raising the minimum wage to $10 an hour in 2016 -- as though Wendy's could sell burgers in Bakersfield from a store in Nevada. By the way, in 1968, the national minimum wage was $10.77 in today's dollars.</p><p>Only Silicon Valley? Check out The Wall Street Journal's new \"Billion-Dollar Startup Club.\" These are companies valued at $1 billion or more by venture capital firms.</p><p>Of the 37 billion-dollar startups, 26 are based in the U.S. -- 22 of them in California. Of the four U.S. startups not located in California, three are in New York City -- not exactly your low-tax haven and, at the moment, freezing cold. The other one is in Jacksonville, Fla.</p><p>Those who strike it rich will do tax planning, and that may include buying homes in low-tax places. But the big tech innovators are still building their companies where their brainiacs want to be. Kings of the creative class demand the stimulation found in great urban neighborhoods. And they want a nice countryside to hike in.</p><p>Two years ago, The Wall Street Journal published an emotional essay titled \"California Declares War on Suburbia.\" The writer was especially upset that the Association of Bay Area Governments had proposed limiting new housing beyond the San Francisco and San Jose \"urban fringe\" to 3 percent of the total.

It's the latest in a trove of conservative literature trying to dance around the fact that high-tax, highly regulated, bureaucratic states can be economic powerhouses. The writers deal with the \"problem\" by burying reality under a pile of \"buts.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In recent years, California has indeed suffered from gridlocked government, punishing pension obligations and debt \u2014 plus the housing meltdown. It's been addressing these challenges. And though one cannot vouch for the wisdom of every regulation, the state's environmental ethic is a big reason smart people put up with the warts.</p><p>But only Silicon Valley is doing well, The Economist says. Manufacturing stinks. \"IPhones are \u2018designed by Apple in California,'\" the article notes, \"but made in Shenzhen.\"</p><p>Apple nonetheless employs 16,000 Californians in and around Cupertino and plans to expand that number to 24,000. The Apple workers reportedly earn an average of $125,000. There must be something going for Apple in California.</p><p>There's this fantasy that if our environmental regulations just went lax, America would have some renaissance in factory employment. Thing is, manufacturing output in this country has actually tripled in the last 60 years, BusinessWeek reports.</p><p>U.S. factories are simply being run with fewer, well-trained people operating computers. The low-skilled, low-wage, labor-intensive factory jobs are not coming back, and why should we want them?</p><p>The Economist seems vexed that Gov. Jerry Brown would sign a bill raising the minimum wage to $10 an hour in 2016 \u2014 as though Wendy's could sell burgers in Bakersfield from a store in Nevada. By the way, in 1968, the national minimum wage was $10.77 in today's dollars.</p><p>Only Silicon Valley?! Check out The Wall Street Journal's new \"Billion-Dollar Startup Club.\" These are companies valued at $1 billion or more by venture capital firms.</p><p>Of the 37 billion-dollar startups, 26 are based in the U.S. \u2014 22 of them in California. Of the four U.S. startups not located in California, three are in New York City \u2014 not exactly your low-tax haven and, at the moment, freezing cold. The other one is in Jacksonville, Fla.</p><p>Those who strike it rich will do tax planning, and that may include buying homes in low-tax places. But the big tech innovators are still building their companies where their brainiacs want to be. Kings of the creative class demand the stimulation found in urban neighborhoods. And they want a nice countryside to hike in.</p><p>Two years ago, The Wall Street Journal published an emotional essay titled \"California Declares War on Suburbia.\" The writer was especially upset that the Association of Bay Area Governments had proposed limiting new housing beyond the San Francisco and San Jose \"urban fringe\" to 3 percent of the total. Most new building would be multifamily homes.</p><p>Boy, do they hate San Francisco. But the strict building rules have kept San Francisco \u2014 and its environs \u2014 a beautiful place. That's why tech people working in surrounding areas insist on making their nests in San Francisco when they could live cheaper, bigger and closer to work.</p><p>Universities are another magnet and incubator for new companies. There's some irony that the premier tech center of Texas is progressive Austin, thanks in great part to the University of Texas, a creature of state government.</p><p>To the states with good education, an open-minded community and an attractive environment go the tech spoils. Taxation does matter, and there's such a thing as dumb regulations. But for the knowledge economy, that's not everything or even, it seems, the big thing. California shows how.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CHDLY-000461143</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CHDLY2014</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5BDD-7BF1-DY6F-J3K7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">163823</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2016-01-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"615\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2014 Paddock Publications, Inc.</copyright><publicationName>Chicago Daily Herald</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"01\" year=\"2014\"><dateText>January 30, 2014 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0004CEB</classCode><className>WALL STREET JOURNAL</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>NAICS423430 COMPUTER &amp;

It's the latest in a trove of conservative literature trying to dance around the fact that high-tax, highly regulated, bureaucratic states can be economic powerhouses. The writers deal with the \"problem\" by burying reality under a pile of \"buts\" and \"howevers.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In recent years, California has indeed suffered from gridlocked government, punishing pension obligations and debt - plus the housing meltdown. It's been addressing these challenges. And though one cannot vouch for the wisdom of every regulation, the state's environmental ethic is a big reason smart people put up with the warts.</p><p> But only Silicon Valley is doing well, The Economist says. Manufacturing stinks. \"IPhones are 'designed by Apple in California,'\" the article notes, \"but made in Shenzhen.\"</p><p>Apple nonetheless employs 16,000 Californians in and around Cupertino and plans to expand that number to 24,000. The Apple workers reportedly earn an average of $125,000. There must be something going for Apple in California.</p><p> There's this fantasy that if our environmental regulations just went lax, America would have some renaissance in factory employment. Thing is, manufacturing output in this country has actually tripled in the last 60 years, Bloomberg Businessweek reports.</p><p>U.S. factories are simply being run with fewer, well-trained people operating computers. The low-skilled, low-wage, labor-intensive factory jobs are not coming back, and why should we want them?</p><p> The Economist seems vexed that Gov. Jerry Brown would sign a bill raising the minimum wage to $10 an hour in 2016 - as though Wendy's could sell burgers in Bakersfield from a store in Nevada. By the way, in 1968, the national minimum wage was $10.77 in today's dollars.</p><p> Only Silicon Valley?! Check out The Wall Street Journal's new \"Billion-Dollar Startup Club.\" These are companies valued at $1 billion or more by venture capital firms.</p><p> Of the 37 billion-dollar startups, 25 are based in the U.S. - 22 of them in California. Of the three U.S. startups not located in California, two are in New York City - not exactly your low-tax haven and, at the moment, freezing cold. The other one is in Jacksonville, Fla.</p><p> Those who strike it rich will do tax planning, and that may include buying homes in low-tax places. But the big tech innovators are still building their companies where their brainiacs want to be. Kings of the creative class demand the stimulation found in great urban neighborhoods. And they want a nice countryside to hike in.</p><p> Two years ago, The Wall Street Journal published an emotional essay titled \"California Declares War on Suburbia.\" The writer was especially upset that the Association of Bay Area Governments had proposed limiting new housing beyond the San Francisco and San Jose \"urban fringe\" to 3 percent of the total. Most new building would be multifamily homes.</p><p> Boy, do they hate San Francisco. But the strict building rules have kept San Francisco - and its environs - a beautiful place. That's why tech people working in surrounding areas insist on making their nests in San Francisco when they could live cheaper, bigger and closer to work.</p><p> Universities are another magnet and incubator for new companies. They tend to spawn the liberal, active-government cultures in which innovation thrives. There's some irony that the premier tech center of Texas is progressive Austin, thanks in great part to the University of Texas, a creature of state government.</p><p> To the states with good education, an open-minded community and an attractive environment go the tech spoils. Taxation does matter, and there's such a thing as dumb regulations. But for the knowledge economy, that's not everything or even, it seems, the big thing. California shows how.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKIN-020672edf366cb275d8611e64e3b2bea2f6a242</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F28976488ADD5A6 NWBKIN2014</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5BDH-J6B1-F0NV-F0W3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">401917</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-12-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"637\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2014 Vincennes Sun Commercial<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

Should be easy to figure out what education you'll need, right?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Just contact the recruitment experts and ask them what employers will be looking for down the road. In short, what will be hot in high tech?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Well, don't expect useful answers. No one's done the research necessary to tackle the question. And, says one Ottawa-area expert, it might not even be answerable.</p><p>\"It's a very complex topic that's of great concern to a number of groups, but no one's been able to pull the trigger on it,\" says Keith Carter, vice-president of the recruitment firm Procom Consultants Group.</p><p>The task confounds tech giants, which find it hard to predict the future for their companies alone, Carter said.</p><p>And there's some truth to the fact that predicting the next big tech trend is like predicting the next toy craze. Hula hoops? T.M.X. Elmos? Who would have guessed?</p><p>Other groups that would like to get a handle on the future of technology include the Ottawa Centre for Research and Innovation, the Information and Communications Technology Council and the Canadian Advanced Technology Alliance.</p><p>The ICTC estimates tech jobs across the country will increase by 2.3 per cent annually through 2010. That translates to 58,000 jobs over the next three to five years. Replacing those who leave the sector will account for another 31,000 jobs.</p><p>The report notes about half of Canada's IT workers don't actually work for high-tech companies but rather in IT departments.</p><p>But determining the nature of future jobs is more difficult.</p><p>\"We have a huge people-supply problem in technology and now the unemployment rate is about two per cent so it's very very thin,\" Carter says. \"Governmental organizations and associations want the answer so they can start to promote through education and immigration -- to bring in more people.\"</p><p>Adding to the confusion is the difference in job markets across Canada. Ottawa, for example, is focused on telecommunications, but Toronto has no time for telecom and Montreal is different again.</p><p>\"The problem is it's difficult to meet a demand when we don't know what that demand is and it varies so significantly from company to company,\" Carter said.</p><p>Others in the tech field ventured some opinions on what could be hot in information technology.</p><p>Kevin Dee, CEO of Eagle Professional Resources, deals largely with \"business solutions\" recruiting. He sees potential for those with experience in packaged business systems such as Siebel, SAP and PeopleSoft. The jobs for those with human resource experience and functional knowledge will be in project management, but there will also be plenty of work for those in technical support.</p><p>\"The big demand is going to come in the implementation of packaged software,\" Dee says.</p><p>At Ajilon Consulting, Michel Plouffe, vice-president of IT services, pin-points a handful of places he expects to see job growth. His list includes positions for technical architects, Java and .Net Web developers, usability design and testing experts, telecom specialists (Cisco-CCIE and IP), business analysts, security specialists (C4ISR) and database specialists (ERP, CRM). In most cases, Plouffe said, employers will want three years' experience.</p><p>Life sciences are also expected to grow. Ken Lawless, president and CEO of the Ottawa Life Sciences Council, sees promise in clean or environmental technology, a field that should have much potential as India and China increase their power consumption.</p><p>But the growth will come \"in twos and fours and 10s, not in hundreds,\" Lawless explains.

The fact is, farmers across the globe are embracing high-tech products in droves as part of a mad dash to keep pace with accelerating food demand.</p><p><br/>The Factors Driving Food Demand<br/>Today, there are about 7 billion people in the world. That's a lot of mouths to feed. But consider that by 2050 there will be 2 billion additional mouths, as the world's population is projected to surge to over 9 billion.<br/><url normalizedValue=\"http://d1w116sruyx1mf.cloudfront.net/ee-assets/channels/cdd_default/WorldPopulation.png\">http://d1w116sruyx1mf.cloudfront.net/ee-assets/channels/cdd_default/WorldPopulation.png</url><br/> On the basis of population growth alone, world food demand will increase by over 30%. But in addition to the increase in the number of people on the planet, growing affluence will also have a significant impact on global food demand.<br/> Today, there are about 2 billion people worldwide who are considered to be in the middle class; within 20 years, the number is expected to expand to 5 billion, with almost all of the increase coming from emerging markets. As these people enter the middle class, they will be able to afford to consume more food. Furthermore, they will be able to consume\u2014and will demand\u2014higher protein diets,\u00a0i.e., more meat and dairy products. The livestock that are the source of the meat and dairy products will, in turn, be consuming enormous amounts of feed crops, such as corn and wheat.<br/> All this will put agriculture (the industry responsible for meeting the world's growing food demand) under the gun. To keep up with the demands of an increasing population and an expanding middle class, it is estimated that global food production must increase a whopping 70% between now and 2050.<br/>From Shovels to Sensors and Software<br/>The challenge is daunting, but it is nothing new. Ever since the beginning of time, mankind has been perpetually engaged in a desperate race to keep food production a step ahead of growing demand. And to the extent we have succeeded, it has been primarily because of innovation and technology.<br/> In ancient times, this included the plow, irrigation, and crop rotation; and more recently, reapers, threshers, combines, chemical fertilizers, hybrid seeds, herbicides, and gasoline-powered tractors.<br/> Technology's impact on agriculture efficiency and yield, especially in the last 150 years, has been dramatic. For instance, in 1850, American farmers produced an average of 40 bushels of corn per acre; today the average is close to 160 bushels per acre. And since 1940, the number of people that one American farmer feeds has steadily risen from 19 to 155.<br/>       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://d1w116sruyx1mf.cloudfront.net/ee-assets/channels/cdd_default/NumberofPeopleFedAnnuallyByOneUSFarmer.png\">http://d1w116sruyx1mf.cloudfront.net/ee-assets/channels/cdd_default/NumberofPeopleFedAnnuallyByOneUSFarmer.png</url><br/> To the casual observer, the age of discovery and innovation in farming may appear to be nearing an end. Other than making things like tractors, planters, and cultivators bigger and more powerful, what's happening in agriculture that's of any technological significance?<br/> Well, as it turns out, plenty. Though driven by things not as visible as bright green tractors, there is a powerful movement under way in agriculture, driven by things such as software, global positioning systems, and electronic sensors. This movement is called \"precision agriculture,\" and it is the driving force behind the next leap in farm productivity.<br/>What Is Precision Agriculture?<br/>Precision agriculture is a vague term without a formal definition. Broadly speaking, it's about information-based farming, and more specifically, it's about getting near real-time and location-specific data, then reacting to those data in ways that will lower cost and increase yield.<br/> The best way to explain the precision agriculture concept is by way of example, and the best example we've seen comes from David Herring, who wrote this way back in 2001:<br/> \"Imagine you are a farmer riding along in your 50,000 acre wheat field early in the growing season. You push a button on your tractor to turn on its Global Positioning System (GPS) monitor, which pinpoints your exact location to within one meter. Touching another button, you display a series of Geographical Information System (GIS) maps that show where the soil in your field is moist, where the soil eroded over the winter, and where there are factors within the soil that limit crop growth. Next, you upload remote sensing data, collected just yesterday, that shows where your budding new crop is already thriving and areas where it isn't. You hit SEND to upload these data into an onboard machine that automatically regulates the application of fertilizer and pesticides\u2014just the right amount and exactly where the chemicals are needed. You sit back and enjoy the ride, saving money as the machines do most of the work. Congratulations, you are among a new generation of growers called 'precision farmers.'\"<br/> If you stop and think about this for a minute, it becomes clear that precision agriculture is primarily about customization. Traditionally, farmers have farmed land uniformly, applying seed, fertilizer, water, and herbicides\u00a0en masse\u00a0and indiscriminately. But land always has variation: in soil type, in moisture content, and in nutrient content. Uniform application of inputs inevitably results in under-application in some areas (resulting in decreasing yields) and over-application in others (resulting in wasted inputs). Armed with relevant data and software- and sensor-driven equipment, precision farmers can customize applications to allow for field variations, thereby increasing yields while reducing costs.<br/> A USDA study published in 2011 found that corn growers who had adopted various precision-farming technologies achieved crop yields that were about 15% higher than non-adopters. Those kinds of productivity improvements are important not only to the farmer and his profitability, but also to the agriculture industry's ability to meet future demand. According to the National Intelligence Council, \"The world is already farming its most productive land, so improving crop efficiency will become especially important to meeting global food needs.\"<br/> Providers of precision-farming technologies are bound to benefit from demographic trends and the pressure those trends will put on food production. Several companies participate in the space in varying degrees, but\u00a0theBIG TECH\u00a0team discovered a company[1]\u00a0that we think is best positioned to serve, grow, and profit from this blossoming market. This company's grand vision is to achieve the connected farm. As an analogy, it is beginning to do for agriculture what Oracle[2] did for the manufacturing industry with increasingly broad-scope enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems in the 1990s. We all know what's happened to that stock since.<br/> At\u00a0BIG TECH, we routinely unearth growth companies like this. With realized annualized portfolio gains of 77.1% over the past 12 months (equally weighted, of course), our performance record speaks for itself. For the record, you would be hard pressed to find a hedge fund manager that can fetch that type of return\u2014and we work for a fraction of their cost.

Big tech names set to report this week include Intel and Yahoo on Tuesday; eBay on Wednesday and Google on Thursday. </p><p>The tech sector has the highest projected earnings growth rate among the 10 Samp;P sectors for the second quarter at 12.3 per cent its best quarter since the first quarter of 2012. This forecast marks a sharp rebound from a drop of 3.2 per cent just a year ago according to a Thomson Reuters poll. Goldman Sachs analysts wrote in a note that the information technology sector \u201cappears to be the most undervalued sector\u201d giving investors more reasons to be bullish on tech stocks. The implied earnings-per-share growth for the tech sector has been 5.4 percentage points above the Samp;P 500 on average over the past 10 years but it is now just one percentage point above the benchmark index according to the Goldman Sachs note. While the Dow Jones industrial average and the Samp;P 500 have hit record highs recently the tech-heavy Nasdaq is still more than 700 points away from its all-time intraday high on March 10 2000 suggesting to some investors that the sector may have more room to the upside. The tech sector\u2019s earnings are \u201cgoing to certainly be important because the market started to gain momentum as economic data got better\u201d said Quincy Krosby market strategist at Prudential Financial which is based in NewarkNew Jersey. \u201cWe want to hear good solid numbers and if we get that from tech names it will help.\u201d Nine of the 13 sub-industries in the tech sector are expected to report higher earnings than a year ago with semiconductors and semiconductor equipment having the highest growth rates within the sector according to Thomson Reuters data. The Nasdaq is up 5.7 per cent for the year while the semiconductor index is up 20.3 per cent. Big banks on the spotlight Among the 10 Samp;P 500 sectors financials have the worst earnings forecast with a decline of 3.5 per cent from a year ago according to Thomson Reuters data. Nine of the sector\u2019s 21 sub-industries are expected to post a drop in earnings. Earnings from some of major banks this week will include JPMorgan Chase amp; Co and Goldman Sachs Group on Tuesday; Bank of America on Wednesday and Morgan Stanley on Thursday. Analysts are expecting subdued results because a slowdown in revenue from mortgage refinancing and trading is offsetting gains from other areas like investment banking and money management. Higher legal regulatory and compliance costs are also weighing on results. Wells Fargo amp; Co on Friday underscored some of those problems as the largest US mortgage lender reported a 39 per cent decline in revenue from that business. In addition to keeping a close watch on earnings Wall Street will also tune in this week to what Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen says when she makes a couple of trips to Capitol Hill. She is scheduled to testify on the US central bank\u2019s monetary policy in a semi-annual appearance before the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday and the House Financial Services Committee on Wednesday. \u2014 Reuters</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GLOENG-1094275691</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GLOENG2015</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5GD6-K5R1-JCNX-3133-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">300986</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"551\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2015 MENAFN.COM All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Global English (Middle East and North Africa Financial Network)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"38987\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"07\" year=\"2015\"><dateText>July 8, 2015 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC0001RKX</classCode><className>GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"81\"><classCode>CC00027NH</classCode><className>JPMORGAN CHASE &amp;

Plus, Warren Buffett this weekend released his annual letter to shareholders, concluding that 1999 was the worst performance of his Berkshire Hathaway tenure.

The Nasdaq fared the worst.  The opening index fell more than 169 points, tumbling below 5000.  Fifteen minutes later the index sank even lower, down more than 209 points to 4839, its lowest level of the session.  But bargain hunters came in and for a moment it appeared like the Nasdaq could break out of the red.  At 1:00 p.m. it was down just 20 points, but it didn't last.  By 3:00 the index fell again, posting a triple-digit loss.  The selling picked up and at the close the Nasdaq was off 141 points to 4907.</p><p>As for the Dow, the sell-off also began early.  The blue-chip index down more than 193 points in the first half hour of trading, but an hour later the Dow turned positive and closed up 18 points to 9,947.</p><p>With our market coverage at the Nasdaq, we go to Charles Molineaux -- Charles.</p><p>CHARLES MOLINEAUX, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, Willow, we saw the Nasdaq's fourth worst one-day point loss today, 121 points, and this selling was broad.  Almost two stocks went down for every one that went up.</p><p>Market watchers are divided over whether this was concern over Japan's economy, but it certainly started with today's sell-off in the Asia Pacific markets.  Technology investors tried buying on the dips and the Nasdaq Composite went through several attempts at a rally before it fell in the last hour.</p><p>Yes, the battered biotechnology stocks led this market down and lost almost 7 1/2 percent.  Advanced Tissue Sciences sagged and Chiron had a coronary on news its coronary drug bombed out in clinical testing.  Telecoms got their wires crossed, Adaptive Broadband and Qualcomm both faded on the day.</p><p>Chip stocks like KLA Tencor and Linear Technology also fell more than 1 percent as a group.  But the biggest of the group, big-cap Intel actually went up to a new all-time high after bullish analyst comments.  So did Dell Computer after a series of analyst upgrades predicting a return to its renowned strong growth.  Although, Apple was more typical, as computers fell 2 percent as a group.</p><p>Internet stocks took their lumps, too, down 2 percent. RealNetworks withdrew.  PSINet lost, too.  But eBay enjoyed a new round of investor enthusiasm over its business model and gained 8 1/2 percent.</p><p>How serious was what happened today?  Well, strategists say this market will try to rally out of the slump and back up over 5000 probably several times this week.  The question will be if it can hold there between now and Friday.  If not, this could be something much more substantial than a one-day dip.  Once again, we're waiting to see if those bargain hunters come in and save the day.</p><p>Reporting live from the Nasdaq market site, Charles Molineaux, CNN.</p><p>VARNEY: Well, turbulent tech stocks clearly hurt the Nasdaq, but some of the tech leaders on the Dow industrials pushed that index into the plus column today.</p><p>Rhonda Schaffler has now -- more now on today's winners and losers.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>RHONDA SCHAFFLER, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Blue chips managed to recover from a nasty early fall, but today's advance was only modest and akin to a handful of stocks.  Intel hit an all-time high on an analyst upgrade.  Bottom fishers picked up Procter &amp; Gamble shares.  IBM advanced.  And J.P. Morgan soared on an upbeat forecast. But the house of Morgan was more the exception than the rule.</p><p>Some banks did move slightly higher today, but most brokerages did not fare as well.  In fact, there were several weak sectors today, drug stocks in particular trounced again.  But the bulls say the day's advance for the Dow, timid as it was, could be a positive sign of what's to come. CHRISTINE CALLIES, CREDIT SUISSE FIRST BOSTON: It's clear this is still a very favorable time of the year for stock rebounds. Investors are going to keep contributing funds to their 401(k)s and their IRAs up until April 15th, and this does tend to allow the stock market a fairly large margin of error.</p><p>SCHAFFLER: But even as investors continue pumping money into the market, they're still selective.  The much touted rotation out of the old economy stocks or traditional Dow issues into the new economy, tech related shares was evident at the NYSE: Merck, G.E., and ExxonMobil all lost ground, while Micron Technology soared more than 11 and AOL picked up 2.</p><p>CLARK YINGST, PRUDENTIAL SECURITIES: I think that this divergence, which is of some concern to us, is likely to be corrected at some point in the not too distant future.  I was always taught that divergences by definition ultimately get corrected.  The bigger questions to which no one has an answer and about which we can only speculate are exactly when under what conditions.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SCHAFFLER: One possible factor, a raft of economic reports coming out this week that could give investors clues about the Federal Reserve's next move on interest rates.  A report on retail sales is due tomorrow and later in the week readings on both producer and consumer prices -- Stuart.</p><p>VARNEY: Rhonda Schaffler at the big board.</p><p>Now, the catalyst behind today's meltdown, a huge sell-off in Tokyo following some rather grim news about the world's second biggest economy.  The Nikkei stock average plunged nearly 3 percent, though the index is still up nearly 24 percent over the past year.  Today's sharp sell-off came after new economic distress signals.  Japan's GDP last quarter fell at an annualized rate of 5 1/2 percent, far more than expected.  It is the second straight decline and that's what many consider to be a recession.</p><p>BAY: And the sell-off wasn't confined to just Tokyo and Wall Street.  Stocks tumbled across the globe, with the benchmark indexes in Taiwan, Hong Kong, Germany, and Brazil all falling 3 1/2 percent or more.</p><p>Joining us now with more, Bob Hormats, he is the vice chairman of Goldman Sachs International.  Bob, welcome back.</p><p>ROBERT HORMATS, VICE CHMN., GOLDMAN SACHS INTERNATIONAL: Good to be with you.</p><p>BAY: What happened in Japan?  Is the worst over or do we continue to see falling GDP?</p><p>HORMATS: Well, the economy is in trouble, but I think we're going to see better times ahead largely because there is an old economy and the new economy.  The new economy is still very weak.  The new economy is beginning to pick up largely through information technology and computer-related investment.</p><p>BAY: Before we talk about the new economy, when do you think we'll see a significant improvement?</p><p>HORMATS: I think the first quarter numbers and second quarter numbers will be better than the numbers we have seen, not dramatically better, but better.</p><p>BAY: So you describe the new economy as weak, so is it likely, then, at some point that new economy will gain in strength enough to help lead Japan out of this recession?</p><p>HORMATS: I think the new economy will actually lead Japan out of the recession for two reasons: one, because already there is a lot of investment in telecommunications, in the Internet, cell systems, a whole range of very positive things, and as old companies begin to utilize the new technology they themselves will become more productive.</p><p>BAY: That may happen of course in the future, but what's really kept Japan from rebounding in any significant way?</p><p>HORMATS: Well, the old economy is still the largest portion of the overall economy, and it is not an economy which has been deregulated like the American economy.  They also have a lot of overhang of real estate as a result of the bubble.  They have a lot of excess industrial capacity.  Until they work those off or work them down and improve the banking system, which is overloaded with a lot of this bad debt, they're going to have a hard time strengthening their economy.</p><p>BAY: Banking and Japan's corporation primarily there.  What about the rest of Asia, is the picture quite different?</p><p>HORMATS: The picture in the rest of Asia is a little bit better. They have benefited from selling to the United States.  A lot of restructuring is going on, the banking systems have been improved, still a lot of debt overhang, still a lot of excess capacity, but they're looking better.  All of Asia has very high savings rate and they're beginning to use that to help stimulate growth.</p><p>BAY: How closely at this point is Japan's economy tied to the U.S.?</p><p>HORMATS: It's really not that close.  I mean, we have been doing very well over the last 10 years with a relatively weak Japanese economy.  It should not bring our economy down.  It would be better if they were to grow more rapidly, but a weak Japan\u2026</p><p>BAY: But it should not bring our economy down?</p><p>HORMATS: A weak Japan should not be bad for the United States, not good, but certainly not a bad problem.</p><p>BAY: Bob Hormats, as always, thanks for joining us.</p><p>HORMATS: Good to be with you, thanks.</p><p>VARNEY: Next on MONEYLINE, a very different kind of scoop rocks the newspaper business.</p><p>BAY: We'll look at how readers and investors are responding with Tribune buying the company behind the \"L.A. Times.\"</p><p>VARNEY: And then there's Aetna, out to divide itself to prevent being conquered, why Wall Street was less than impressed with a drastic takeover defense.</p><p>Those stories are coming up next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>VARNEY: The Tribune Company today expanded its newspaper empire from Chicago to Los Angeles and beyond, agreeing to buy Times Mirror, publisher of the \"L.A. Times,\" \"Baltimore Sun\" and \"Newsday.\" It's paying about $6 1/2 billion.  The deal will create the country's third-largest newspaper company and a force in broadcasting as well.</p><p>Times Mirror stock surged more than 37 1/2 points, but Tribune slumped about 6 1/2.  Casey Wian has the story from Los Angeles.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CASEY WIAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The \"Los Angeles Times\" has been owned by the Otis and Chandler families for more than a century.  Now the paper's parent company, Times Mirror, has agreed to be acquired by the Tribune company of Chicago in a deal that will put 11 newspapers, 17 magazines, 22 TV stations and the Chicago Cubs under one corporate roof.</p><p>LELAND WESTERFIELD, PRUDENTIAL SECURITIES: The new Tribune company is a multitiered diversified media company with real strength in local media.  By bringing together, Times Mirror and Tribune you create cross-ownership, that is TV and newspapers, in three of the biggest cities in the country -- Los Angeles, Chicago and New York -- and that's a terrific value.</p><p>WIAN: Together the companies will have 3.6 million newspaper readers and reach 75 percent of the nation's TV households.  Tribune agreed to pay $95 a share for Times Mirror, about double its Friday close.  Despite assurances that the combination will result in cost savings and produce higher earnings in the first year, investors are skeptical.  Tribune shares lost nearly 20 percent on news of the deal.</p><p>Tribune Chairman John Madigan says he did not overpay.</p><p>JOHN MADIGAN, CEO, TRIBUNE CO.: Right now, the market's not real happy with major transactions.  It's very nervous today, as you know, and I think eventually they'll see through this and realize that we paid a reasonable price to get these assets.</p><p>WIAN: The Chandler family, which owns most of Times Mirror's stock, will also get four seats on Tribune's board.  Left out is controversial Times Mirror Chairman Mark Willes, who has angered \"L.A. Times\" staffers by blurring the lines between advertising and news gathering.</p><p>(on camera): The deal would also continue the exodus of major corporations from Los Angeles.  If BP Amoco's purchase of Arco and the Times Mirror-Tribune deal both go through, Los Angeles would be left without a single Fortune 500 corporate headquarters.</p><p>Casey Wian, CNN Financial News, Los Angeles.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BAY: Checking some other movers: Starmedia Network sank 17 1/4. SalomonSmith Barney and Merrill Lynch both downgraded the Latin American Web portal.  The CEO of Starmedia called today's sell-off a huge overreaction to the downgrades.</p><p>Excite@Home gained more than 1 1/4. It launched a new broadband portal for high-speed Internet access, and Bank of America Securities called the company's stock compelling at these levels. </p><p>Infineon Technologies jumped more than 34 on its first day of trading.  The chip maker is a unit of the German electronics giant Siemens.</p><p>And Superconductor Technologies soared nearly 21 on a supply agreement with ALLTEL Communications.  Superconductor makes products for wireless communications and Internet access.</p><p>VARNEY: Aetna had very little luck convincing investors that it could boost its sagging stock by staving off a buyout offer.  One day after the country's biggest health care and insurance giant said it would remain independent by dividing itself in two, Aetna stock dropped 5 1/4.</p><p>More on that from Allan Dodds Frank.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ALLAN DODDS FRANK, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Aetna's turndown of a tentative takeover offer in favor of its own plan to split the company turned off Wall Street.  Aetna's new chairman, Wall Street veteran William Donaldson, rejected out of hand a tentative $70 a share offer from WellPoint Health Systems and ING America Financial Services.</p><p>DAVID SHOVE, PRUDENTIAL SECURITIES: I'm not sure that if it had been a solid offer, that they would have rejected it or that they wouldn't have at least moved ahead to do a little more investigation. But this was simply a letter to go fishing, and I think that Bill Donaldson didn't want to be the fish.</p><p>FRANK: Aetna's break-up plan would create separate companies in managed health care and in financial services.  The company's managed care business has 21 million customers and accounts for more than $20 billion in revenue but less than $1/2 billion in operating income. But Aetna's financial services unit, which sells mutual funds and annuities, accounted for only $1.6 billion in revenue and more than $200 million, or nearly 30 percent, of operating income.</p><p>Most of the international business, which brought in revenues of $2.8 billion with a mix of health care, financial services and insurance, will be put up for sale.</p><p>Some analysts say a break-up may not help.</p><p>WILLIAM MCKEEVER, SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT, PAINEWEBBER: I think they've made too many acquisitions over the last few years.  They, frankly, have paid too much.  They've executed poorly.  They've made some efforts in Medicare that haven't worked.  You can see it's a whole litany of things that they haven't done well.</p><p>FRANK (on camera): WellPoint and ING could still make a firmer offer, but Aetna, despite investor discontent, seems to want to make a go of it alone, at least for now.</p><p>Allan Dodds Frank, CNN Financial News, New York.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BAY: Coming up on MONEYLINE, we'll take you live to a gathering of the Internet elite.</p><p>VARNEY: Where the talk is about stock bubbles and the search for the new new thing.  That's next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BAY: Checking some of the stocks that hit 52-week lows today: Cigna, Coca-Cola, EToys, Royal Caribbean Cruises and VISX.</p><p>VARNEY: The deal is off for CDNow and Columbia House, the mail- order music business owned by Sony and Time Warner, the parent of CNN. Columbia House last year agreed to buy CDNow as an online music retailer.  But today, they announced the deal was dead, saying it no longer made financial sense.</p><p>CDNow has hired Allen &amp; Company and is now exploring other strategic possibilities.  CDNow stock dropped today more than a point and a quarter.</p><p>BAY: It's been called the Sundance Film Festival of the Internet: PC Forum, now run by Esther Dyson, is a gathering of some of the brightest lights of the emerging Internet economy.  From venture capitalists to start-up CEOs, the hot topics at this year's forum in Scottsdale, Arizona are dot.com market valuations, and the quest for the new new thing.</p><p>For tonight's \"Tech Watch,\" we're joined by MONEYLINE's Bruce Francis.</p><p>Bruce, what was there much talk today about the sell-off on the Nasdaq? BRUCE FRANCIS, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): There was some concern earlier.  First thing, really, just as the market was down 200 points.  You have to remember, if there's a group of believers anywhere, Willow, this is it.  These are the venture capitalists and entrepreneurs who got a lot of this round going.  Well Esther Dyson asked the crowd, how many people think these stocks, specifically the B2B companies, are overvalued?  Not a single hand stayed by their side.  All the hands in the room went up.  So certainly thee is, even within this industry, a concern about the valuations that we certainly see out there.</p><p>There's also the never-ending quest for the new new thing.  And if there's any new new thing that's getting all the buzz this year, it's Terabeam.  And I'm joined right now by Terabeam's CEO Dan Hesse.</p><p>Dan, thank you very much for being with us.</p><p>DANIEL HESSE, CO, TERABEAM: My pleasure, Bruce.</p><p>FRANCIS: Give our audience a sense of what you're doing.  We don't want to get into the arcania of networking, but this is a breakthrough.</p><p>HESSE: Absolutely.  Think of it as fiberless optics, everything you can do on a fiber-optic cable but doing it through the air, just shooting light through the window so you can get gigabit speeds to the desktops.</p><p>FRANCIS: So we're talking about hundreds of times faster than current businesses get but without the wires in the last mile?</p><p>HESSE: That's absolutely right.  You can provision it very, very quickly.  And from an economic perspective, because it's point to multipoint, we can serve many users.  You don't have to buy an expensive spectrum, expensive roof rights, difficult rights of way. It's truly a breakthrough in the last mile.</p><p>FRANCIS: Now this is just the kind of business that the big networking companies like Nortel, Lucent, certainly Cisco, are very interested in snapping up these days.  Are you going to stay independent?</p><p>HESSE: That's our plan.  Greg Amadon, the founder, and I have very big ambitions for this company.  So I don't think anybody can afford us.</p><p>FRANCIS: Do your big ambitions include an IPO?</p><p>HESSE: Probably sometime in the future.  It's too early to say when that might be.</p><p>FRANCIS: Who might be threatened by this?  It seems you can't offer such a big shift, a big disruptive shift, without some companies being at risk here.</p><p>HESSE: The CLECs, competitive local exchange carriers as well as the regional Bell carriers will clearly see us as competitors.</p><p>FRANCIS: You left a huge amount of money on the table.  You were the head of AT&amp;T's wireless unit.  Any -- how did you get to making that decision where you could leave literally millions on the table?</p><p>HESSE: Well, you've seen here at the conference, when anybody walks into the Terabeam showroom and they see it, and they see it working, they're believers.  That's what it took for me.  They put a bag over my head, stuck me in the roof of a car, drove me to this super-secret place -- because actually the company's been in stealth mode for two and a half years in Seattle.</p><p>When I saw it working -- because I've been in the business 23 years.  I didn't think it was possible.  I've been on the equipment side, in the service side, the Internet side, the wireless side, I've been everywhere.  And what they've done is something that's absolutely revolutionary.  And it was an opportunity to be part of it.</p><p>FRANCIS: Dan, we're going to leave it there.  Thank you very much for joining us.</p><p>HESSE: Thank you, Bruce.</p><p>FRANCIS: Dan Hesse, the new CEO of Terabeam.</p><p>Stuart, Willow, back to you.</p><p>BAY: Thanks, Bruce.</p><p>VARNEY: Still ahead on MONEYLINE, predictions of another summer of drought.</p><p>BAY: That warning from Washington and other stories just ahead in our \"News Digest.\"</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>VARNEY: It was a volatile session on Wall Street, but despite that we have a few stocks hitting new 52-week highs, and they include About.com.  We also have Dell Computer hitting a new high and Intel, along with Rambus, yet again, and Seagate Technology.</p><p>Time now for our look at the day's top stories outside the world of business.  And for that, Wolf Blitzer with the \"MONEYLINE News Digest\" -- Wolf?</p><p>WOLF BLITZER, CNN ANCHOR: Thanks, Stuart.</p><p>The Clinton White House may have felt as if it were under siege today, responding angrily to an attack by the National Rifle Association and facing another possible fight with the independent counsel.</p><p>The president denounced as smear tactics NRA charges that he accepts a certain level of violence to promote his political aims. And CNN has learned independent counsel bob ray is actively exploring whether to seek an indictment against Mr. Clinton after he leaves the White House in January.  That as the investigation into the Monica Lewinsky and Paula Jones cases continues.</p><p>Campaign news now: On the eve of primaries in six Southern states, Vice President Al Gore accused George W. Bush of lacking a health care agenda because he's loyal to campaign donors who just want a tax cut.  Bush countered that it's Gore who's compromised himself for campaign money.  The Texas governor predicts a tough campaign ahead.</p><p>Also today, Washington is warning that half of the U.S. states will probably suffer drought this summer, with the Midwest hit especially hard.  Government forecasters say that could mean higher food prices, less water for recreation and more fires.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOHN KELLY, DIR., NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE: The outlook is bleak.  Large portions of this country are going to experience continued shortages of rain.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BLITZER: And the NFL's Dan Marino retired today after 17 years as quarterback for the Miami Dolphins.

Here again, Stuart Varney and Willow Bay.</p><p>BAY: In tonight's headlines, a white-knuckle ride for the technology faithful, as the Nasdaq slides nearly three percent.</p><p>The pressure on techs coming from an unlikely source: Japan.  Its economy shrinks for the second straight quarter.</p><p>And a MONEYLINE special report on a recycling program that could open a can of worms for the steel industry.</p><p>VARNEY: But first, more on our top story: Stocks swoon from Tokyo to Seoul to Frankfurt, and the reaction on Wall Street is quick and painful.  The first global sell-off of 2000 left the Dow unscathed, but it did cut deeply into the Nasdaq.  That index suffered its fourth-biggest point loss ever, after tech stocks were slammed across the globe.</p><p>The Nasdaq tumbled 141 points -- that's nearly 3 percent.  It had been down as many as 209 points, retreating from the record that it reached on Friday.  Two big-cap stocks weighed on the Nasdaq: Oracle and Sun Microsystems.  But some, in fact, bucked the trend, like Dell and Intel, which were both upgraded today.  And then there's eBay, which surged 16 1/2.</p><p>The Dow industrials, they tumbled nearly 200 points at the opening bell.  They staged, though, an impressive rebound.  The blue chips ended the day up 18, at 9947.</p><p>Now it wasn't a profit warning or even Alan Greenspan that caused this morning's market mayhem -- oh, no.  It was a sell-off that echoed across Asia on troubling news about the world's second-largest economy.  Japan's gross domestic product shrank at an annualized rate of 5.5 percent last quarter, pitching the economy back into recession.</p><p>And as Greg Clarkin reports, the one sector that seems to ignore economic conditions was indeed hit hard all across the globe.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GREG CLARKIN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Technology stocks tumbled worldwide after Japan reported its economy shrank late last year for the second quarter in a row.  Technically, that's a recession.  Nervous investors bailed out of tech stocks, fearing even a hint of weakness in Asia.</p><p>DAWN SIMON, MERRILL LYNCH GLOBAL TECH FYND: The revisions in the gross domestic product in that nation, in that area, has caused some investors a little bit of concern about whether a global recovery economically is sustainable.</p><p>CLARKIN: That little bit of worry translated into a lot of selling.  Stocks in Japan fell almost 3 percent.  Hong Kong shares lost more than 4 percent, and stocks in Taiwan plunged 6 1/2 percent. The selling continued in Europe, where stocks in the U.K. lost more than 1 1/2 percent, and 3 1/2 percent in Germany.</p><p>Sony typified the widespread selling.  A slide that started last week turned into a 7 percent tumble in Tokyo and the U.S., and analysts say investors are jittery, looking for the first sign of trouble to sell their high-flying high-tech stocks.</p><p>ART RUSSELL, EDWARD JONES: It's hard to predict the next catalyst that's going to create, you know, the negative sentiment. But, you know, at some point there's going to be some type of shock to the system, and a little bit of bad news is going to send people scurrying out of these stocks.  And there's the potential that it gets ugly real quick.</p><p>CLARKIN: And it was ugly early on for the Nasdaq.  Telecoms, techs and Internets were battered.  The Nasdaq was down more than 4 percent before regaining some ground.  Analysts say many so-called \"new economy stocks\" are priced for unattainable perfection, but investors are still flocking to them.</p><p>MARK KELLER, A.G. EDWARDS: This is clearly the most vibrant, fastest-growing portion of our economy.  It's just simply a matter of how much is an appropriate amount to pay for that growth?</p><p>CLARKIN (on camera): The news out of Japan unnerved investors worldwide, and analysts say now more than ever analysts need to be acutely aware of how much exposure their holdings have to events around the globe.</p><p>Greg Clarkin, CNN Financial News, New York.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BAY: Adding to the Nasdaq's volatility: a record-breaking merger in an industry that didn't even exist a few years ago.  Business to business software maker I2 Technologies is buying Aspect Development and Supplybase for $9.3 billion.  That is the biggest software merger in history.  I2 is offering a 35 percent premium for Aspect.  That drove the stock up nearly 12.  I2 shares slumped more than 16 3/4, though the stock has been on an incredible run.</p><p>Steve Young has more.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>STEVE YOUNG, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): A business-to- business gorilla has been forged out of three companies many investors scarcely knew until recently.  I2 says it's acquiring Aspect Development and Supplybase in a stock deal it values at $9 1/3 billion, the biggest software deal in history.  The companies help suppliers and their customers do business more efficiently over the Internet.</p><p>SANJIV SIDHU, CEO, I2 TECHNOLOGIES: Business-to-business solutions can transform the world.  It's what we call the next industrial revolution.</p><p>YOUNG: I2 and Aspect's common clients include Compaq, Motorola, Ford and Sun.</p><p>ANDREW ROSKILL, WARBURG DILLON READ: I2's strength is in the back-end applications.  That is, providing decision support, supply chain management, order fulfillment and logistics functionality. Aspect Development, on the other hand, provides a great product for direct product procurement.  So the two products are extremely complimentary to one another, and they're already well on their way to being integrated.</p><p>YOUNG: Analysts say the bulked up I2 is now a one-stop shop hard to match in the industry.  But Commerce One, Ariba and Oracle aren't far behind.  Last week, IBM formed a three-way alliance with I2 and Ariba.  Big Blue will sell their software and also use it to streamline its own manufacturing.</p><p>Some analysts caution that while business-to-business e-commerce stocks are now in vogue, Wall Street sentiment could swing back to business-to-consumer issues, which were hot last year.</p><p>ANTHONY NOTO, GOLDMAN SACHS: I think we'll see the same thing this year, where B2B is very hot right now, and by late summer, early fall people are going to swing back to the forgotten B2C sector to the leaders.</p><p>YOUNG: But business-to-business bulls disagree.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>YOUNG: They say business-to-consumer e-commerce gets just razor- thin profit margins, while the business-to-business market is bigger, less cyclical, and the profit potential is huge -- Willow.</p><p>BAY: Steven, we'll find that out when those profits start to come in.  Steve Young reporting -- thank you.</p><p>VARNEY: All right, let's turn now to another deal, one that could give General Motors an even bigger share of the global car market.  GM and Italy's Fiat are buying stakes in one another.  It's a bid to cut costs and expand.  Fiat shares jumped about a point and a quarter on that news.  No change for General Motors, though.  There had been speculation that DaimlerChrysler would buy Fiat, but now if Fiat sells to anyone it will have to be GM.</p><p>Fred Katayama has more on that.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>FRED KATAYAMA, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The Italian automaker known for its economic sports cars and the Ferrari's first cousin is tying up with the maker of the rugged Suburban.  General Motors is swapping 5 percent of its stock worth $2.4 billion for a 20 percent stake of Fiat's auto business.  Analysts say GM had to pay a big premium for the weak automaker because there are a few independents left.</p><p>High price aside, GM says this deal will help it slash costs in Europe and Latin America.</p><p>JOHN SMITH, CEO, GENERAL MOTORS: We see significant opportunities to reduce costs, and we believe that that's absolutely necessary in order to compete in this global arena.</p><p>KATAYAMA: The companies will set up two joint ventures focusing on those two regions.  They'll combine their engine and transmission plants that employ 40,000 people and buy parts together.  They expect that'll produce annual savings of $1.2 billion by the third year.</p><p>EFRAIM LEVY, STANDARD &amp; POOR'S: Today's transaction with General Motors and Fiat is a good deal.  There are several benefits that they get from having a joint venture compared to having an outright merger. They get to have immediate savings and purchasing by their volume.</p><p>KATAYAMA (on camera): Fiat, the world's seventh-largest carmaker, needed GM's investment to stay independent.  But GM has first dibs to buy the remaining 80 percent of its Italian partner should Fiat decide to sell.</p><p>(voice-over): For now, suddenly cost-conscience Fiat isn't about to sell GM on the idea of joining them on the racing circuit.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: If I can give you a suggestion, stay out of the formula one.  It's an expensive toy.</p><p>Fred Katayama, CNN Financial News, New York.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BAY: A high-profile departure, that could hurt a major profit machine at Merrill Lynch: Jack Levy, who helped build Merrill's merger business, is leaving after 22 years at the investment bank. Merrill says Levy has resigned to pursue other career opportunities. Levy is the second powerful banker to leave Merrill this year. Merrill's head of technology investment banking, Mark Shafir, resigned last month.</p><p>VARNEY: The contentious search for a new leader for the International Monetary Fund may have come to an end.  The White House this afternoon said it would support -- it would support the German candidate Horst Koehler.  This capped a four-month struggle to fill the post, during which time the Clinton administration had rejected another German official.  The job, by the way, traditionally does go to a European.</p><p>BAY: Next on MONEYLINE, if it's not working for Warren Buffett, what hope is there for his investment philosophy?</p><p>VARNEY: A special look at the future of value investing.  That story's coming up next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BAY: In tonight's \"MONEYLINE Focus\": hard times for the world's greatest investor.  Warren Buffett this weekend released his annual letter to shareholders, concluding that 1999 was the worst performance of his Berkshire Hathaway tenure.  Buffett is just the best-known victim of a broader market trend: the all-out rejection of so-called \"value investing,\" the search for solid companies with bargain basement stocks.</p><p>Peter Viles reports.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) WARREN BUFFETT, BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY: The Internet's a passing fad.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>PETER VILES, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Give Warren Buffett credit: He hasn't lost his sense of humor.  But in the past year, the most famous value investor in America has lost $50 billion: on paper at least.  Berkshire Hathaway shares are down 44 percent.</p><p>BUFFETT: To tell the truth, value investing hasn't been working very well for me lately.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>VILES: At least Buffett has company.  Hedge fund manager Julian Robertson has also taken a beating.  His Tiger Funds are off 13 percent so far this year.</p><p>Big value funds -- such as Putnam's Growth and Income, Fidelity's Equity Income, and Windsor Vanguard -- have all lost more than 11 percent this year.  By contrast, the average performance for big tech funds is a gain of 38 percent, which is why investors are pulling money out of value funds and piling into technology.</p><p>SCOTT BLEIER, PRIME CHARTER LTD.: The real world companies get the double-whammy of no new money flows and money actually coming out to chase the performers.</p><p>VILES: On Wall Street, the debate is whether value investing is poised for a comeback or at risk of going the way of the rotary dial telephone and the milkman.</p><p>TONY DWYER, KIRLIN HOLDINGS: Typically, when people talk about the end of value investing as we know it, it's a good signal that we're near a bottom, and I think in the old economy stocks we are.</p><p>VILES: That sounds logical, but not everyone agrees.  Jeff Applegate of Lehman Brothers argues that cheap old-economy stocks may not be good buys at current levels.  His logic is that higher rates and an economic slowdown threaten their profits, and the Internet is creating a separate deflationary tornado that squeezes pricing power and profits.</p><p>In years past, investors would be hanging on every word Buffett had to say in this debate.  This year his credibility, however, has been hurt by his continued reluctance to invest in technology and by numbers like these: Washington Post, down 12 percent; Wells-Fargo, 18 percent; and Coke, Freddie Mac and Gillette, all off 30 percent or more.  That's a list of some of Berkshire's biggest holdings.</p><p>One company absent from the list: Walt Disney.  Sometime last year Buffett sold at least half of Berkshire Hathaway's 51 million Disney shares.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE) VILES: So what is Buffett saying about his battered portfolio? This weekend he wrote to his shareholders: He still likes the companies he's invested in, but he says the stocks in those companies have not become cheap enough to tempt him to buy more -- Willow.</p><p>BAY: So no change in strategy?</p><p>VILES: None whatsoever.</p><p>BAY: Thank you, Peter.</p><p>VARNEY: All right.  When we come back, we're going to continue this tech versus value debate.  We'll talk with Douglas Cliggott.</p><p>BAY: That's next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>VARNEY: Here's the question of the day: Did today's technology sell-off create a buying opportunity or a wake-up call?  My next guest says now is not the time to be chasing tech.  Instead, he sees opportunities in energy and consumer stocks.</p><p>Joining us now is Douglas Cliggott.  He is U.S. equity strategist at J.P. Morgan.</p><p>Douglas, welcome back.</p><p>DOUGLAS CLIGGOTT, J.P. MORGAN: Thanks for being here.</p><p>VARNEY: Let's clear this up: You would not at this point put any fresh money into the technology sector, correct?</p><p>CLIGGOTT: That's correct.  We have no problem with the fundamentals.  There's very strong revenue growth.  That's very strong earnings growth.  But when we look and see that over the past 12 months the Nasdaq has increased by more than 100 percent, over the past three months it's increased by over 50 percent, it's very difficult to make a judgment call that the risk-return profile is one that you want to embrace.</p><p>VARNEY: On this program, on Friday night, Professor Jeremy Siegel at the Wharton School of Business suggested there was a very sharp and sudden correction coming for tech stocks.  Do you agree with that?  Would you go as far as that?</p><p>CLIGGOTT: I think the risk of a correction is high and the reason for thinking that is, in our view, we've broken away from those fundamentals now.  It's all about money flows and momentum.</p><p>Often when stocks break, they fall, as we saw with Procter &amp; Gamble, but then underlying earnings gives you a floor where a lot of technology stocks are trading right now.  Should the momentum break, they could easily fall 50, 60, 70 percent before you get any kind of valuation floor. VARNEY: Those are frightening words indeed, but your position would be start looking for real value in those oldline companies, those consumer stocks, for example -- Procter &amp; Gamble, you mentioned that -- you'd be buying them at this price.</p><p>CLIGGOTT: We would, and we wouldn't say avoid tech, but I think so many portfolios are more than half technology now\u2026</p><p>VARNEY: Yes.</p><p>CLIGGOTT: \u2026 we would say 25 to 30 percent in tech.  Buy energy.  That's where the earnings momentum is.  And as a lot of these big global-branded consumer goods companies, their share of prices break down, we think that's where the interesting buying opportunities are.</p><p>VARNEY: And you think that is the trend in the marketplace in the immediate future: some money coming out of those high-flying techs and going in back into the -- I was going to say lower grade; I don't mean that -- but the beaten-down, ordinary, everyday, old-economy stocks.</p><p>CLIGGOTT: That's what higher interest rates usually do.</p><p>VARNEY: They'll do it this time: We shall see, however.</p><p>Douglas Cliggott, J.P. Morgan, thanks very much for joining us.</p><p>CLIGGOTT: Thank you, Stuart.</p><p>VARNEY: OK.</p><p>BAY: A bit of a reality check for one sector today.  After weeks of sizeable gains, biotech stocks came back down to Earth, along with other sectors, the group led lower by shares of Chiron, which lost more than 23 percent.  Today, the biotech firm reported disappointing results in a human test of its treatment for coronary artery disease. CS First Boston also downgraded the stock, based on its recent price gains.</p><p>Shares of Chiron ended the day off more than 13.  Other biotech firms also lower: Immunex sank 27 1/4, MedImmune down nearly 21 1/2, Biogen lost almost four, and King Pharmaceuticals off 8 1/2.</p><p>VARNEY: Ouch.</p><p>When MONEYLINE returns, a plan to decontaminate thousand of tons of heavy metal draws the ire of the industry that helped make it.</p><p>BAY: A MONEYLINE special report, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BAY: The Department of Energy is in the process of shutting down the plants that helped build America's nuclear arsenal and win the Cold War, 113 sites, most of them nuclear weapons-related.  But a decade after the Berlin Wall came down, America faces lingering fallout from its 45-year standoff with Russia: what to do with hundreds of thousands of tons of contaminated metal.</p><p>The federal government has a plan to recycle it, but as Louise Schiavone explains in this special report, there is one industry that says radioactive steel will ruin its reputation and its profits.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>LOUISE SCHIAVONE, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): LTV Steel in Cleveland, Ohio is a typical steel-producing operation where scrap is mixed with iron ore and the final product emerges in consumer goods from soup cans and cars to construction materials.  About two-thirds of all steel made in the United States is derived from recycled materials.</p><p>TERENCE CIVIC, LTV STEEL: Steel and metal products are highly recyclable.</p><p>SCHIAVONE: But this plant is typical in another way, it's constantly on the lookout for radioactively contaminated metals.</p><p>CIVIC: As this material continues to be released, we expect that the amount of radiation will continue to build up, and as we continue to recycle, the levels will increase.</p><p>SCHIAVONE: Put simply, steel mills don't want materials exposed at any stage to radioactivity, because continued exposure even at low levels can increase the risks of cancer or genetic defects to workers and the general public.  The problem is radioactive scrap metal can and has been recycled into shovels, table legs, protective lead aprons and more.</p><p>PETER HERNANDEZ, AMERICAN IRON AND STEEL INST.: We're concerned the public will not accept any radioactive-contaminated material in consumer goods.</p><p>SCHIAVONE: Over the next few years, 126,000 tons of radioactive scrap metal will be emerging from this nuclear weapons plant in Oak Ridge, Tennessee.  It's the old K-25 plant which supplied enriched uranium for generations of nuclear weapons, including the bomb dropped on Hiroshima.</p><p>JAMES MCANALLY, BRITISH NUCLEAR FUELS LTD.: We're moving about 150 tons a week right now that is being decontaminated and released into general consumption.</p><p>SCHIAVONE: A company called British Nuclear Fuels is under U.S. government contract to dismantle and recycle metal from an Oak Ridge building equal in space to 66 football fields.</p><p>STEVEN RICHARDSON, DEPT. OF ENERGY: It's a multi-year contract and they're in the several early years, but to this point in time I think we're satisfied, yes.</p><p>SCHIAVONE (on camera): There are natural and allowable levels of radiation in the everyday environment from rocks to radio waves. British Nuclear Fuels asserts the final product of their processing meets these levels.</p><p>MCANALLY: Then we survey it and check every square inch of it to make sure that it is totally clean, and then we put our name on it so that if anybody has any question on it, they know where the metal came from.</p><p>SCHIAVONE (voice-over): Most of the radioactive metal coming out of Oak Ridge is surface-contaminated carbon steel.  Six thousand tons of some of the most contaminated material, nickel, has been ruled off- limits pending a review by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, but that's not good enough for the steel industry.  They don't want any metal from any of the DOE sites in the general stream of commerce.</p><p>TOM DANJCZEK, STEEL MANUFACTURERS ASSN.: The government has a responsibility here not to contaminate the scrap supply stream with the nation's larger recycler.</p><p>SCHIAVONE (on camera): One major U.S. steel recycler, which asked not to be identified, tells MONEYLINE that it shut the door on scrap deliveries from Oak Ridge three years ago after two truckloads set off their radiation alarms.</p><p>(voice-over): While there are established radiation limits for liquids and gases, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission has not established limits for solids like steel.  In fact, DOE Secretary Bill Richardson has asked the NRC to address this issue, and in a recent memorandum established \"a Re-use and Recycling Task Force which will conduct a review of department policies regarding the release of all materials.\"</p><p>LTV in Cleveland hasn't taken scrap from Oak Ridge, but is well acquainted with the general problem, because radioactively contaminated scrap comes from a variety of sources such as hospitals and research labs.</p><p>CIVIC: There are no standards right now for cleaning.  There are no standards now for monitoring.  Until that -- those standards are developed, material that shouldn't be released can be released.</p><p>SCHIAVONE: The steel industry and consumers agree it's best to keep radioactively-contaminated metals out of the general recycling stream.  And with $40-$60 billion in annual sales, the steel industry says even a 1 percent loss in confidence of steel would translate into a yearly business loss of half a billion dollars.</p><p>Louise Schiavone for CNN Financial News, Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BAY: Up next, \"Ahead Of The Curve.\"</p><p>VARNEY: Some of what you need to know tonight before those markets open up again tomorrow.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>VARNEY: Disappointing economic news from Japan sparked today's sell-off.  Tomorrow, Wall Street will be focused on the U.S. economy. At 8:30 a.m. Eastern, the latest figures on retail sales are due out.</p><p>Also, you might want to keep an eye on the share price of Dell Computer and Ariba, because after the bell the two companies announced a B2B e-commerce alliance.</p><p>Also watch AT&amp;T, tomorrow its shareholders will vote on whether to create a tracking stock for its wireless operations.</p><p>And then on the earnings front: Oracle, Martha Stewart Living, AnnTaylor and Saks all expected to report.  And we'll be talking to the CEO's from two of those companies tomorrow: Oracle's chief Larry Ellison, he's going to join us, and Martha Stewart.  That is tomorrow on MONEYLINE.</p><p>BAY: Well, that is MONEYLINE for this Monday.

Estimates suggest there are more than 1.3m of the company's cameras installed throughout the UK, thought to make up as much as a quarter of all CCTV cameras in the country.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">According to freedom of information requests, councils in Nottingham and Hertfordshire, police forces, airports, and NHS Trusts such as the Royal Cornwall Hospitals and the North East Ambulance Service, have all deployed the tech around their sites.</p><p>Reports suggested earlier this year the cameras had been used in parliamentary buildings, although the House of Commons says this was not the case.</p><p>Questions over whether the company should be allowed a foothold in the market ramped up on Wednesday, after reports emerged that Washington was considering banning Hikvision from doing business with US firms.</p><p>One reason for the move was said to be claims it is supplying technology to the Chinese state used to detain and track Uighur Muslims in the western region of Xinjiang. According to a recent report from \u00adindependent think tank the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2019/04/17/chinese-tech-giants-deeply-implicated-persecution-human-rights/\">Hikvision is \"deeply implicated\" in the oppression of Muslims,</url> and has won contracts \u00adincluding one to implement       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2019/04/17/chinese-tech-giants-deeply-implicated-persecution-human-rights/\">facial recognition surveillance</url> on mosques.</p><p>The company was specifically named in a letter to President Donald Trump's top advisers last month from a group of lawyers urging action to be taken over the treatment of the Muslim community in China.</p><p>Mr Trump was said to be considering blacklisting Hikvision, together with four other Chinese surveillance companies, and fears around espionage was one reported reason why he may take the decision to implement the further restrictions.</p><p>The move, if taken, would be seen as an escalation of the trade war between the US and China. Mr Trump has \u00adalready taken steps to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2019/04/17/chinese-tech-giants-deeply-implicated-persecution-human-rights/\">clamp down on Chinese titan Huawei.</url></p><p>Speaking to\u00a0The Daily Telegraph, Norman Lamb MP said: \"We have to take these human rights abuses incredibly seriously, and I think we have to ask ourselves quite a profound question about whether we should be doing business with companies that are implicated in human rights abuses within China or indeed any other country.</p><p>\"It does suggest in itself a close relationship between the company and the state, which is the very point that is causing so much concern over <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2019/04/17/chinese-tech-giants-deeply-implicated-persecution-human-rights/\">whether we should be involving Huawei in the 5G rollout.</url></p><p>\"If you want evidence of a close relationship, working with the Chinese government on the incarceration and control of its citizens, breaching their human rights, appears to me to be some important evidence.\"</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2019/04/17/chinese-tech-giants-deeply-implicated-persecution-human-rights/\">Five years after Snowden's leaks: Big Tech ousts Big Brother in surveillance debate</url></p><p>Alistair Carmichael MP, who this year chaired a Westminster debate titled 'Human rights in Xinjiang', said: \"We know from what we have seen in China that the technology developed and manufactured by Hikvision is capable of being used for massively intrusive surveillance.</p><p>\"Hikvision must be accountable for what they have done in China before they can be allowed to grow a business in the UK. America looks to be acting to blacklist the company. The British government must look carefully now at the evidence and decide whether they should take the same steps.\"</p><p>A spokesman for Hikvision says the company \"takes these concerns very seriously and has engaged with the US\u00a0government regarding all of this since last October\".</p><p>\"In light of them, it has already retained human rights expert and former US Ambassador Pierre-Richard Prosper to advise the company regarding human rights compliance,\" the spokesman said.\u00a0</p><p>\"Separately, Hikvision takes cybersecurity very seriously as a company and follows all applicable laws and regulations in the markets we operate.

I was a big fan of the broad street bullies and Bobby Clark and Reggie leach and Hound Dog Kelly and Dave Schultz. That's what I grew up (inaudible).</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">INGRAHAM: Oh my god. That's why people love you Hannity. Awesome show tonight.</p><p>HANNITY: Bobby Clark was my favorite. He had no teeth, none.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Oh no, that's like Gordie Howe on those guys. They're just like (inaudible).</p><p>HANNITY: Yes. They played (inaudible). It's like, did you ride a bicycle? When you rode a bicycle, did you wear a helmet?</p><p>INGRAHAM: Never. Are you kidding?

(Inaudible).</p><p>HANNITY: Helicopter parents.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Great show tonight. Thanks so much.</p><p>HANNITY: All right. Have a good show.</p><p>INGRAHAM: All right. I'm Laura Ingraham. This is THE INGRAHAM ANGLE from Washington. What a show we have for you tonight. The case of Hillary Clinton's private server just will not go away. Now, there are reports -- and this doesn't surprise me in the slightest -- that China was hacking her e-mails in real-time. Peter Schweizer, best person we could have to break it down is here tonight.</p><p>Plus, primary voters hit the polls in three states across the country tonight and at this hour, polls have now closed in Arizona where candidates from both parties are vying for the chance to succeed retiring Republican Senator Jeff Flake. It's too early for Fox News to project a winner on both sides, but we will have a live report on the ground at all the pivotal races for this November's midterms.</p><p>Plus, we'll talk to one of tonight's big winners -- we already know. And that president is also taking aim at some tech giants who he believes and many of us do, are unfairly targeting unfairly targeting conservatives. That will be a spirited debate later in the hour.</p><p>But first, the press, prosecutors and partisans and their incestuous relationship. That is the focus of tonight's \"Angle. OK, last month, CNN ran with a bombshell of a story.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JIM SCIUTTO, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Sources with knowledge tell, myself and Karl, that Michael Cohen claims that then candidate Donald Trump knew in advance about the June 2016 meeting in Trump Tower in which Russians were expected to offer his campaign dirt on Hillary Clinton. Crucially, these sources tell us that Cohen is willing to make that assertion to the special counsel, Robert Mueller.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM: Why is Chris Cuomo's head so much bigger than the other two heads? I don't know why I focused on that. OK. Well, the accompanying article on their website revealed that \"contacted by CNN, one of Cohen's attorneys, Lanny Davis, declined to comment.\" And just a week ago, Lanny Davis, Michael Cohen's attorney, doubled down again on CNN.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LANNY DAVIS, MICHAEL COHEN'S ATTORNEY: I think that the reporting of this story got mixed up in the course of a criminal investigation. We were not the source of this story.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM: OK, a little problem there. He was lying! Lanny Davis was actually the major source for the entire story. He was also the anonymous source that confirmed its other outlets. Now this week he came clean telling \"The Washington Post\" that he is not certain the claim is accurate and that he could not independently verify it.</p><p>And yesterday, he tells \"BuzzFeed News\" that he regrets his whole role as an independent source in a subsequent denial of his involvement in the story, if you can follow that. Davis merely saying he \"made a mistake.\" But he actually didn't. Lanny Davis is an old Clinton fixer who has been spinning information and using the press to do his bidding for decades.</p><p>Now, this was deliberate, and the folks at CNN were only too happy to join him in this misinformation charade. Why? Because they have a common enemy. It's Donald J. Trump. So Davis floats a malicious and salacious story to target a political adversary and the media gleefully disseminate it.</p><p>Now CNN's Sciutto and Bernstein delighted in this tale of Trump's misdeeds because it fits the pathetic Russian narrative that they have been trying to substantiate for a year now. They used to call CNN, remember, the Clinton News Network in the day. Well, with Lanny Davis as an unpaid contributor, it is more fitting than ever. Forget 1998. It's fact.</p><p>But this reminds me of the disgraced FBI Director Jim Comey. We call him James \"Too Tall\" Comey, OK, fine -- who's planted more stories than Martha Stewart has planted hydrangeas. OK? Comey passed his memos of classified conversations between himself and the president to a friend. Remember that memo to the file? And he did it for media consumption.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JAMES COMEY, FORMER FBI DIRECTOR: I understood this to be my recollection recorded of my conversation with the president. As a private citizen, I felt free to share that. I felt it very important to get it out.</p><p>SEN. ROY BLUNT (R), MISSOURI: So why didn't you do give those to somebody yourself rather than get them through a third-party?</p><p>COMEY: Because I was buried the media was camping at the end of my driveway at that point and I was actually going out of town with my wife to hide and I worried it would be like feeding seagulls at the beach.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM: Oh my god, I had forgotten he said that. So, we are led to believe that he really doesn't like the press, Comey, while he is throwing them life sustaining chum, oh, to the seagulls. And remember these greatest hits from the WikiLeaks Podesta inbox? CNBC's John Harwood sent e-mails to Hillary Clinton.</p><p>Campaign chairman John Podesta shamelessly sucking up to him offering campaign advice and praising the candidate. He was with her while he was covering the campaign. Then there was Juliet Eilperin of \"The Washington Post.\" She dropped Podesta a line to give him a heads up on a story she was going to publish, and she included a little preview, so helpful.</p><p>And \"The New York Times\" unbiased Glenn Thrush, he put an appearance as well. He wrote to Podesta a story in progress to make sure \"I'm not effing anything up.\" He said. Like Lanny Davis, Podesta was apparently kind of like a freelance editor for both \"The Washington Post\" and \"The New York Times.\"</p><p>Now, these are just a few examples of collusion that we know about only thanks to WikiLeaks. But today we learn from Congress and Mark Meadows the danger of this kind of politicization of the media and partisan story planting. He tweeted in part, \"We've learned new information suggesting our suspicions are true. FBI/DOJ have previously leaked info to the press and then used those same press stories as a separate source to justify FISA\" -- Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act -- and Meadows then spoke to \"America's Newsroom\" following closed door hearings with FBI officials.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. MARK MEADOWS (R), NORTH CAROLINA: We know that some people like the Department Of Justice and FBI actually gave information to the media, then the stories were reported, then they used those reports to justify further investigation.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM: Now, it should be noted that the FBI tonight is pushing back hard on this story. A source clarified the agent testified that the FBI routinely uses media materials to corroborate their work product including FISA materials, but \"never said directly that we utilize FBI leaks for FISAs.\" Boy, that was a carefully worded statement. Got to really parse that one.</p><p>But with partisans using the media too bait prosecutors are justify bogus investigations, don't we need to be more careful and ask more questions? I think America needs journalists that we can trust. But as it stands now, we not only have to worry about the objectivity of our news sources, we have to worry about their sources as well. And that is \"The Angle.\"</p><p>Joining us now with reaction, the Washington Examiner's correspondent, Byron York, along with attorney and RNC committeewoman Harmeet Dhillon. All right, Byron, what do we need to know here? This has been a wild day. Let's start with a Lanny Davis and CNN saga, which is both stunning on his part and I think even -- we are kind of used to that from the Clintons and the Clinton spokesman surrogates, but CNN?</p><p>BYRON YORK, CORRESPONDENT, WASHINGTON EXAMINER: CNN's reaction is really baffling here. Why are they -- they are sticking with the story and --</p><p>INGRAHAM: The story being?</p><p>YORK: Their original story, saying that Michael Cohen was prepared to tell Robert Mueller that Donald Trump knew about the Trump Tower meeting in advance. It was a huge, huge story. Now \"The New York Post\" had reported this. They went back, re-reported it after Davis confessed that he had not told them the truth, and told their readers what was going on.</p><p>So did \"The Washington Post.\" Now, what's going on with CNN? It seems to be that their position is a source gave us inaccurate information. We pass that onto you, the listener, but we told you what he said. Now we found out that it's not true, but we stand by the story. It doesn't make any sense. You should do with \"The Post\" did and what \"New York\" and \"Washington Post\" did, which is go back, re-report it, and tell the readers what happened.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Harmeet, Kellyanne Conway was on with Chris Cuomo at CNN just recently and it was this unbelievable exchange where he was up on his, you know, high horse about morality and truth seeking and how hard CNN works, and I want to play this for you now because in light of what we have discovered with this Lanny Davis phony sourcing, I think it is more important than ever to watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHRIS CUOMO, CNN HOST: But I will tell you this now and I make it to you as a promise, all right? As you know, nobody works harder than we do to do this job.</p><p>KELLANNE CONWAY, COUNSEL TO PRESIDENT TRUMP: Who, you?</p><p>CUOMO: In this place, on my team, in this shop of CNN. We work very hard to tell people what is true.</p><p>CONWAY: Any pause (ph) for humility. But Chris, let me just have a word about that.</p><p>CUOMO: Nobody outworks us everyday. I'm telling you this.</p><p>CONWAY: OK, but let me just have a word about that.</p><p>CUOMO: All I wanted to tell you was that you need to own the truth.</p><p>CONWAY: Well you sound like a scold most of the time.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM: Harmeet, you need to own the truth. What you think about that tonight?</p><p>HARMEET DHILLON, RNC COMMITTEEWOMAN: I mean, you know, what's there to say. As a lawyer, I have to say I'm temporarily happy to know that the lawyers are not the most despicable people here in the eyes of the public I think today based on these lies and their failure to admit what went on here.</p><p>You know, everybody who was a reporter -- I'm a former reporter before I became a lawyer and occasionally a source will burn you and, you know, I mean, OK. You got corrected, move on. I mean, that's what they do. Its part of their job and it happens.</p><p>But to not own it I think is really showing that we all have reason to doubt the sincerity of other stories that they've had out there if this is their corporate attitude towards, you know, grossly misleading the public.</p><p>I think it is really bad news for the media to black (inaudible) for CNN and, you know, I think the public expects better, the viewers expect to deserve better from them.</p><p>INGRAHAM: And we wonder why the press' numbers, real numbers are in the toilet. And this comes after Sunday's \"Meet The Press\" where Chuck Todd -- I'm going toplay the sound byte -- laid blame on this network for causing the problems for credibility. Let's watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DAVID BRODY, CHRISTIAN BROADCASTING NETWORK: I hate to say it, I know I'm sitting on a \"Meet the Press\" round table, but the truth of the matter is, 62 percent think the media's bias. So in other words, if you look at the approval rating of Donald Trump versus the approval rating of the media --</p><p>CHUCK TODD, MSNBC HOST: Well, the conservative echo chamber created that environment. It's not -- no, no, no, I mean, it has been a tactic and a tool of the Roger Ailes created echo chamber.</p><p>BRODY: Yes.</p><p>TODD: So, let's not pretend it's not anything other than that.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM: OK, I think the press' credibility has been pretty low before -- even before 20 years ago if Fox News started.</p><p>YORK: Also, can I say something about the larger agenda here? I mean, Lanny Davis is doing what he's doing, he's telling CNN what he's telling them for a reason. And we seem to have the situation in which Michael Cohen, the client here, the president's former lawyer, is kind of jumping up and down and waving his hands at Robert Mueller saying, hey, notice me, notice me, I've got something.</p><p>Now, we've never gotten a story out of the Robert Mueller shop that -- we've never found out a story about this that Mueller didn't know about six months ago. He's been way ahead of the reporting on this. So, we have to figure out that there is no -- that he has no particular interest in Cohen right now because he farmed his case out to prosecutors in New York. So you have to wonder, what are they doing here? I don't really know the answer, but this Lanny Davis stuff didn't just come out of nowhere.</p><p>INGRAHAM: The Bruce Ohr -- you've been doing a reporting on this -- Bruce Ohr saga for months and months and months. What do we take from today's developments?</p><p>YORK: Well, the big question had been with Bruce Ohr, how high and how far did knowledge about the dossier go? The Steele Trump dossier, go inside the FBI and inside the Justice Department, because we did know that after Christopher Steele was terminated as a source because he was dying to get bad information about Trump out into the public before the election, right?</p><p>So we talked to the press, which was against the rules, so the FBI terminated him. And then they used Bruce Ohr as the go-between. So Ohr would go talk to Christopher Steele and then he'd go to the FBI and tell them what Steele had told him.</p><p>So now, I think what they learned today was who else was who else was Ohr briefing on this? Who else was being kept up on this? Not just at the FBI but at the Obama Justice Department.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Doesn't he have an obligation, Harmeet, to divulge his connection to the firm that was producing the dossier that then led to the FISA warrant and the surveilling of the Trump campaign? I mean, isn't there some basic sense at the Justice Department that you have to reveal these types of obvious conflicts? I mean, he was promoting his wife. He was promoting her firm and at the same time, added bonus, get the president, or get the candidate.</p><p>DHILLON: Right. Well, he was creating demand for his wife's consulting services, so that's an obvious conflict of interest. It's also a violation of the, you know, government's rules to not disclose that. But more importantly for me as a civil libertarian, the fact that this was not disclosed to the FISA court is shocking and I think it's obstruction of justice, quite frankly.</p><p>Laura, I ran the numbers as of last year, 21 warrants had been denied by the FISA court out of over 40,000. That is 99.999, OK? 99.999 are granted.</p><p>INGRAHAM: That's despicable.</p><p>DHILLON: So, the people at the DOJ and FBI say, hey, don't worry about this, there are safeguards in place. Not only does a high level of the FBI have to sign off but also high levels of the DOJ have to probe this and sign off. In fact, it appears that no oversight was done and they didn't ask -- didn't ask the obvious questions about this.</p><p>So, I think this does go higher. We don't know (inaudible) exactly in the testimony but there are a lot of questions that need to be asked, and it isn't just what happened to Carter Page. This seems to be a systematic issue with the DOJ and the FBI and, you know, creating stories.</p><p>INGRAHAM: All right. Great segment, guys. And by the way, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's private e-mail server was reportedly hacked by another foreign entity. That issue had been raised before but now it looks like we have some confirmation. It was a Chinese owned company. They inserted code that forwarded Clinton's e-mails to them in real time. That, according to \"The Daily Caller\" news foundation.</p><p>Even worse, the FBI was reportedly warned about this by the intel community's inspector general, but did nothing in response. Here with his reaction is investigative journalist Peter Schweizer. Peter, this doesn't come as any surprise to any of us who had followed this issue.</p><p>There is no security on this private e-mail server. Classified information clearly on it. What is your take away? Apparently no Russia but yes, China.</p><p>PETER SCHWEIZER, INESTIGATIVE JOURNALIST: Yes, Laura, this is a huge a story and I'll tell you why. Think about this for a second. If the story is true and the reporter that broke the story, Mr. Pollock, is an excellent reporter. If the story is true, it means that the only set of all of Hillary Clinton's e-mails as Secretary of State resides in Beijing, China.</p><p>Because remember, she deleted 30,000 e-mails and never turned them over to the FBI. If you think about the Steele dossier, the concern that was always raised about that fake dossier was that it would lead to blackmail on Donald Trump, these e-mails would be a massive blackmail too for the Chinese against Hillary Clinton.</p><p>Those 30,000 deleted e-mails were personal e-mails, they were probably very sensitive, that's why they were deleted in the first place. You have the existing set of the other 30,000. This is a huge story, and the fact that this information was discovered, then turned over to the FBI and the FBI counterintelligence office, including Mr. Peter Strzok, apparently took no interest in it, is shocking.</p><p>You know, China is the big threat here. They are the rising power challenging United States. Russia is the declining power. If I were looking at an intelligence threat, the number one threat would be China. That is what this FBI director today is saying. China is the one we are worried about. But there was no interest in this apparently by Mr. Stzrok and others. It's a shocking story.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Peter, I think you reported on this at the time, I believe. When this e-mail server was discovered, it also came out, I believe, that the person in charge of Hillary's security on her system was told, we might've had some intrusion in the system, and kind of blew off the concern.</p><p>I had to go back and get the actual language so I get it verbatim. But that was reported. I guess through investigators, he said that there was a concern raised, but basically he was shot down when he raised that concern. Period.</p><p>SCHWEIZER: Yes, that's exactly -- that's exactly right. The service that was taking care of the servers raised this with the Clinton people and it was dismissed because they didn't want attention focused on even existence of the server. So the way they tried to cope with this was pretending that the server wasn't there.</p><p>This is a massive breach. And look, we were told in the 2016 campaign that Hillary Clinton was the adult. She is the professional. She's the diplomat that knows how to get things done and to do things in an orderly way. This thing was a massive failure.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Yes. Well, she knows how to get things done to cover up for the Clinton's and Clinton Foundation I guess, but get things done for the American people, she got a lot done for China. And I say thank god Hillary Clinton wasn't elected given the fact that if the story is true, China has a treasure trove of information, which I don't think is just about her daughter's wedding or her grandkids or whatever or yoga class. I don't think the Chinese care about, you know, the down dog in Hillary. I think they are interested in some other issues.</p><p>SCHWEIZER: Yes, you know, that is exactly right. And the bottom line here is I think if you gave any counterintelligence official a choice between being concerned about a discredited dossier or being concerned that your president of the United States has 60,000 e-mails in the possession of an enemy power and you don't even know what's in 30,000 of them.</p><p>I think they would view that is a much larger counterintelligence threat than anything that is raised by the dossier. That is why this issue needs to be re-investigated and looked at. It's a counterintelligence issue and problem going forward.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Yes. Jeff Sessions should convene an investigation, a real serious investigation just into this issue alone, frankly. Peter, great to have you on tonight. Thank you so much.</p><p>And by the way, as I said earlier, it is election night for primary voters in Florida and Arizona. We've got live reports for you on the ground next and we'll speak with Congressman Ron DeSantis, who tonight just became the Republican nominee for Florida's governor. He just got a surprising opponent this fall, we'll tell you about that, next.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Voters hit the polls in primaries across three states today but two particular states will greatly impact November's midterms. For more on what we go to now is in Florida, Ed Henry, standing by live in Miami. Ed?</p><p>ED HENRY, FOX NEWS CHIEF NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Laura, great to see you. Big developments tonight here, breaking this hour. In Florida, the governor's race is going to come down to a dramatic clash between a key ally of President Trump, Ron DeSantis, against a Democrat backed socialist Bernie Sanders, Andrew Gillam. It's going to be interesting as we see the Democratic Party in swing states like this tilt even further left.</p><p>On the Republican side as I mentioned, Ron DeSantis tonight easily beat the state agriculture commissioner Adam Putnam, where the deciding factor, very clearly was the coattails of the president. The president a short time ago tweeting this out there about the race \"such a fantastic win for a Ron DeSantis and the people of the great state of Florida. Ron will be a fantastic governor onto November.\" That from the president.</p><p>Now look at how dramatic, how pivotal the president' support was. In mid- June polling had Putnam beating DeSantis by 15 points, mid-June. A week later, June 22nd, the president tweeted an endorsement of DeSantis. By late July, DeSantis was up by 12 points, a 27-point swing.</p><p>Now tonight here, DeSantis running to replace retiring Republican governor Rick Scott, who easily beat -- easily won the GOP nomination for a senate seat against incumbent Bill Nelson. They will face off in November. That is expected to be a very tight race.</p><p>I mentioned Andrew Gillum on the Democratic side. He beat back a challenge from a more moderate candidate. He's the Tallahassee mayor. He won after key endorsements from Bernie Sanders and after an infusion of $650,000 from liberals George Soros and Tom Steyer, who's been pushing for impeachment for a long time so watch that.</p><p>Meanwhile, another important Trump factor in Arizona tonight, Republican Senator Jeff Flake retired because he's at odds with the Trump agenda, unlikely that he would get re-elected, he decided to retire. He endorsed Congresswoman Martha McSally. She said she doesn't want the endorsement because she is competing with Dr. Kelli Ward and Sergio Arpaio over who is more pro-Trump.</p><p>The winner of the GOP primary likely to face Congresswoman Kyrtsen Sinema in a pickup opportunity for Democrats. Interesting, we have not been able to call this race in Arizona just yet. The polls just closed a short time ago, Laura, but that race is very significant as well.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Ed, Steyer and Soros, a huge infusion of money in Florida, that I understand is going to be happening in other races, including in even statewide initiatives in places like Arizona, Colorado, Ohio, and beyond. So this is just the beginning of what we are seeing.</p><p>HENRY: It is, and what could be significant is in a battleground like Florida, which is typically tight, and presidential races and midterms, whether it's governor or this big senate race here. You have Andrew Gillum, who has been polled very far left because as you say, he's got Tom Steyer and George Soros money behind him. He's a Tallahassee mayor, a relatively unknown.</p><p>This was a surprise win, a shocker really, and he beat back the daughter of Bob Graham, the former senator and governor, beat back a challenge from here. She's a more moderate Democrat, former congresswoman, someone who is seen sort of middle-of-the-road, might've been a tougher challenge or against Ron DeSantis. Now you got the party pulled to the left. It will be fascinating how it plays out in November.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Ed, thanks so much. And joining me now is one of the men who just won one of these important races. Congressman Ron DeSantis is now the Republican nominee for Florida governor. He is here now and his first interview since his primary victory. Congressman DeSantis, congratulations. You must be feeling pretty good tonight.</p><p>RON DESANTIS, FLORIDA GOP GUBERNATORIAL CANDIDATE: Yes, Laura. And I remember you and I talking after we did the debate on Fox News, and you were like, \"you are not going to be behind much longer after this.\" And sure enough, I mean, we really pulled ahead. We had the president come at the end of July with a huge event for us.</p><p>And we really just had unstoppable momentum. And the good thing is, we are going to carry this all the way through November and post a strong victory so we can continue on Florida's path to success and make it even better.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Are you surprised that Gillum wins on the Democrat side? So he'll be your challenger, endorsed by Bernie Sanders, as you just heard us talk about. Soros and Tom Steyer both pitched in a total of about $650,000. It seemed to make a difference down the home stretch. So you are going to be running against a hard left former Tallahassee mayor.</p><p>DESANTIS: He is the most liberal candidate that the Democratic Party has ever nominated in the state of Florida by a country mile in a governor's race. He wants to abolish ICE. He wants a billion dollar tax increase. He wants a single-payer health care system in Florida, which would bankrupt the state.</p><p>I'm trying to make Florida even better. He wants to make FloridaVenezuela. But he also combines the far left ideology with managerial incompetence. As mayor of Tallahassee, his tenure has been absolutely disastrous. Tallahassee is one of, if not, the most crime-ridden city in all of Florida, year after year, rising crime, he is embroiled in a lot of corruption scandals. This is not -- the guy who can't even run the city of Tallahassee. There is no way Florida voters can entrust him with our entire state.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Now, Congressman DeSantis, in your jubilation and your celebration, you may have missed that Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez tweeted out congratulations not to you, but to your challenger, Andrew Gillum, saying, \"the progressive movement is transforming the country and he proved that again tonight. Gillum ran on Medicare for all, legalizing marijuana, abolish ICE and more. Thank you Florida voters! On to November. I'd wear that as a badge of honor tonight, Congressman.</p><p>DESANTIS: Well look, we have people who in Florida who have fled socialist countries like Cuba and Venezuela. They don't want that imported into Florida. We also have people who flee from left-wing policies in states like New York and Connecticut and they don't want that imported into Florida. So, I think we want to keep Florida great. We want to keep it going in a good direction. And going in the direction of an Ocasio-Cortez is just untenable and it will not happen in Florida.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Congressman, some of your critics will throw out this, they'll say, well, you won on Trump's coattails, but you are short on your own policy initiatives on a statewide level. How do you answer your critics?</p><p>DESANTIS: That's not true at all. We have a solid vision for how to create high-paying jobs in Florida. I've been very strong on our environmental problems and solving our water crisis that we have in different parts of the state, and then only one of the few people have stood up against some of the entrenched interests. Laura, you know they were spending millions of dollars to stop me in the race and yet we did that. We've been very strong on illegal immigration, saying we need E- Verify in Florida, we can't have sanctuary cities. I've been somebody that's been a wholesale supporter of education reform, from parental choice to vocational education in the classrooms, to more civics education. So we've been talking about these key issues time and time again, and we're going to continue to do that and spread the message far and wide.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Did you hear from Putnam tonight? Did he give you a call?</p><p>DESANTIS: Yes. Look, he's a class guy. He worked very hard. He was a tough competitor. People say you won big, but this guy built a huge organization, he raised a boatload of money, and he ran a very tough race. He tried to knock me around a lot, that's politics. But he's supportive of where we are going. He knows we've got to keep Florida in Republican hands, and he's going to help me. So that's just how these things go. I would've supported him if he had beaten me, and you got to move forward as a team.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Absolutely. And the president, I don't care what anybody -- he's very popular in Florida. The endorsement did help a lot, but he also did a great job on the on the hustings. Congressman, congratulations, thanks so much.</p><p>And big tech is once again showing their true colors when it comes to conservative speech online. President Trump is now calling them out. That debate, don't miss it, ahead.</p><p>INGRAHAM: It got hot today. President Trump taking aim at big tech and their alleged bias against conservatives. The president first took to Twitter singling out Google for what he calls rigged news search results against him. He even went further this afternoon.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I think Google is really taking advantage of a lot of people, and I think that's a very serious thing and it's a very serious charge. I think what Google and what others are doing, if you look at what is going on at Twitter, if you look at what is going on at Facebook, they better be careful because you can't do that to people.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM: Joining me now wit reaction, former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski and Jason Nichols, a Democratic strategist. All right, Jason, let's start with you. What about the president's thoughts here? A lot of conservatives that I talked to think, wait a second, my impressions on Twitter are way down with no real clue as to why, search results seem to kind of speak to themselves when you put in \"Trump and news,\" it's all negative. What do you think?</p><p>JASON NICHOLS, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: First of all, when we look at the search results on Google, just like when you do a Google scholar search, what you get are the sources that received the most citations, the ones that are cited the most, the ones that actually have the most news bureaus. So this has nothing to do with politics. If he wants better stories, then create better news is what he needs to do.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Like consumer confidence at an 18 year high?</p><p>NICHOLS: Or 2,500 kids being traumatized by being separated, being accused in court under oath of committing a crime, there's a lot of things that he has done that actually show he doesn't have a whole lot of good news to talk about. So --</p><p>INGRAHAM: Jason, the fact that 41 percent of Americans now say the country is going in the right direction, the last year of Obama, do you know where that number was? Twenty to mid-twenties. The country sees things going the right track. They might not like everything Trump tweets, but I'm saying, and I want Corey to get in on this, because it is true that when conservatives say bias, bias, bias, Dorsey and Sergey Brin, all of these guys will come out and say this is just the way the searches go. This is the way the technology rolls. Sometimes conservatives will get the short end of the stick and sometimes liberals will, too. Everybody complains all the time, that is where we need to be. That's what they will say.</p><p>COREY LEWANDOWSKI, FORMER TRUMP CAMPAIGN MANAGER: Yes, but look, Eric Schmidt was a supporter of the Clinton campaign, and that is perfectly fine for him to be able to do that, no one is questioning that.</p><p>INGRAHAM: It doesn't mean he's biased, though, right?</p><p>LEWANDOWSKI: It doesn't mean he's biased. But look, Dorsey has said that the company tends to be more left-leaning than conservative. And again, that is the way he wants to run his company. But what we have at Google specifically is they fired one of their engineers, and he said they did that because they were mistreating individuals who were conservatives there. That is what he was fired for. Now he is suing Google for his job back.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Harmeet Dhillon's client.</p><p>LEWANDOWSKI: And so the reason is, look, you can run a company anyway you want to, but it is such a monopoly. Between Google and Facebook, it reaches 1.8 billion people on a daily basis. These are massive numbers. And I'm not in favor of government overzealous regulation, but you can't have a company that is going after people based on their conservative thought and shadow banning them or banning them in an unfair manner. And we have to look at this because it is a problem that's only going to grow.</p><p>INGRAHAM: NRA spokeswoman Dana Loesch spoke about what happened to her on Twitter. Let's watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DANA LOESCH, NRA SPOKESWOMAN: We have to deal with situations where you have crazy people running amok on Twitter, and Twitter having inconsistent applications of terms of service. And that's what this comes down to. I'm simply asking for these -- for people like Jack Dorsey and Mark Zuckerberg and these individuals who own these platforms to maybe rein and their employees' biases and evenly and consistently apply and enforce terms of service.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM: And the thing that got her really upset is a tweet that has since been deleted about, well, if Dana Loesch has to have her children murdered before she'll understand, I guess that's what needs to happen. And the individual, Milan Legius, whatever his name is, has not been permanently banned from Twitter. I guess he was temporarily banned. That is the kind of stuff -- that is not political speech. That is -- that's terrifying actually.</p><p>NICHOLS: I agree. And as somebody who comes on conservative media and gets death threats --</p><p>INGRAHAM: And we love you coming on. I adore you.</p><p>NICHOLS: Thank you.</p><p>INGRAHAM: May be even more than Corey.</p><p>NICHOLS: Those people sending me threats right now, I want you to know I'm certainly not afraid of you and I'm not backing down. But I will tell you that I absolutely deplore that. I think that she has an argument in terms of trying to get those people to be banned from those platforms. I think that Twitter is a large universe and there are some things that Twitter sometimes misses.</p><p>But the idea that they are targeting conservatives, and I think what Corey said, while it may have some validity that this person has a claim, it has nothing to do with the algorithm in which Google works. That's not what this is about. This is one guy feeling that he was discriminated against at work.</p><p>LEWANDOWSKI: Laura, when you look at Twitter, and you look at what they did to Candace Owens, and she took a tweet that was written actually originally by the op-ed writer of \"The New York Times\" and she changed one word in that tweet, and all of a sudden her account was suspended. Not for doing anything other than literally changing one word. She changed the word from \"white\" to \"black.\" It was against a conservative African- American woman who was literally reposting something that had already been posted. The original post was never considered derogatory or exculpatory or anything else for that person. But as soon as Candace Owens put that out, she immediately was notified by Twitter that her account had been suspended. I don't think that's right.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Do liberals complain about getting banned?</p><p>LEWANDOWSKI: I've never seen one get banned.</p><p>INGRAHAM: I always say, if the shoe was on the other foot -- I try to do this to myself, too. But if the shoe were on the other foot, and it was a company this big in this powerful run by the Koch brothers or some other conservative group of people, and the left felt like their views were not - - it's an interesting conversation. Oh, this is just an algorithm. I hear that algorithm thing all the time. It doesn't seem to give me much comfort. Close it out.</p><p>NICHOLS: I think that people on the left absolutely get banned from some of these --</p><p>INGRAHAM: Who? Some of the most horrible hateful things said about Ivanka Trump. I didn't see a lot of things banned. Was it Chelsea Handler, it might not be her, but they are all the same person to me.</p><p>LEWANDOWSKI: And I think there is the difference between saying something vulgar and saying something that is threatening. I think what was said about Dana Loesch, that was a borderline threat and I think that she has every right to complain about that. But what we've seen, and I'm telling you as someone who gets a lot of threats, probably getting them right now, I think of that is despicable, but I think that it needs to be applied on both sides and I think usually does.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Great conversation, guys.</p><p>An immigration controversy that doesn't get enough attention, visa overstays in the hundreds of thousands. Details on that crisis in just a moment. And later, the Jacksonville shooter this past weekend shared some telling traits with other violent colors. A psychotherapist is here to tell us what they are. So stay there.</p><p>INGRAHAM: OK, there might finally be a solution to one of the biggest problems plaguing U.S. immigration which is visa overstays. We don't talk about it enough, but in 2017, approximately 700,000 travelers to the United States overstayed their visas. That according to Homeland Security. But Congressman Steve King is introducing new legislation that would require nonimmigrants to post bonds before visiting the United States. So would this help to finally get illegal immigration, these visa overstays, under control?</p><p>Joining us now with reaction is Tom Homan, the former acting direct of ICE, along with Allen Orr who is an immigration attorney. Allen?</p><p>ALLEN ORR, IMMIGRATION ATTORNEY: So this is a problem. Not that big of a problem, --</p><p>INGRAHAM: Wait a second, 700,000 -- Allen, I adore you. You know that. But 700,000 people is not a big problem?</p><p>ORR: So that is a reporting problem from the government. So right now, the way that the government relates to people who leave through land ports isn't properly recorded, and sometimes when students change their status, that isn't also properly reported. So I don't really trust the facts that are presented --</p><p>INGRAHAM: You don't trust the numbers from Homeland Security.</p><p>ORR: There actually have been other reports from Robert Warren who used to work for the government and also now works for the Center for Immigration Studies that debunks most of this study, saying this is just an exaggeration and another way to push more restrictive policies down at immigration.</p><p>INGRAHAM: So you don't think there really is any problem with these overstays?</p><p>ORR: I think visa overstays is an issue, but I don't think bonds are a solution, because what that will do is make getting visas a class issue, so therefore people who have the money to post a bond will then get a visa, and then if they wanted will still overstay because money would not be an issue for them.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Tom?</p><p>TOM HOMAN: First of all, I disagree with my friend here. I think it is a huge problem. Maybe a few years ago I wouldn't trust the numbers, but the recent methodology used by CBP now is about 90 percent accurate, so you're talking about several hundred thousand dollars a year. Bond is a good idea as long as it's high enough so it's a deterrent so they are not willing just to forfeit and stay illegally.</p><p>Also what I think part of this legislation should is criminalize those overstayed visa. Again, most of those who overstay a visa come to this country with a full intent of never leaving. That's just like illegal entry. So if you criminalize it, that's another consequence, another deterrence to stop this from happening.</p><p>INGRAHAM: OK, so five countries with overstay rates of over 30 percent, Chad, Djibouti, Eritrea, Liberia, and the Solomon Islands. So when folks from Chad or these other countries come command, there's a pretty good chance they are not leaving. Something has to be done. We know this is what's happening, and it's like, stamp the visa, come on in, and then they don't leave. I can't blame them for not leaving. No one's really hunting them down.</p><p>HOMAN: This bond issue has been a law for decades. They just need to finally implement it. We've been asking for that for years. But I also think equally to the bond, again, they need to be high enough where it's going to be more than what they could pay.</p><p>INGRAHAM: How would it work? How would it work? Before they leave their country, their home country, they would post, let's say, $1,000, $5,000? What about Allen's point that this is a class issue. Now people that have no money, they can never come to the United States. Is that fair?</p><p>HOMAN: What Allen is forgetting is this is a sovereign country. We have the right to decide who comes in and out of this country. We have the right to maintain a legal immigration system. I can tell you, there are hundreds and thousands every year. And you are right, the population is not a priority, hasn't been a priority. When I was acting director, I made it a priority, but we certainly don't have the resources for overstays, not when we are kicked out of jails, we've got to walk the streets looking for criminals. So by adding this bond requirements, and make it a criminal act to overstay a visa, I think you would see a drastic change in overstays.</p><p>INGRAHAM: There a lot of countries, Allen, where you don't have to have a visa. They are called visa waiver countries. So you have Greece, Hungary, and Portugal have the highest overstays for countries where you don't need a visa at all. But we are categorizing, so we know who the high risk people are. Greece, we know they're having a lot of problems, Hungary, Portugal, I guess people -- everyone wants to come to United States. But we have to be able to control this.</p><p>And didn't the 9/11 commission say we should do fingerprint entry and exit? Am I remembering this correctly? But we don't implement that. This is the 9/11 commission, bipartisan groups of experts who spent, what, years of studying this after 9/11? Why don't we have this?</p><p>ORR: I think we do have entry-exit systems, there is just not modernized yet and they're not talking--</p><p>INGRAHAM: Modernized? After 9/11 they're still not modernized?</p><p>ORR: It's the U.S. government and our systems are a little bit antiquated.</p><p>But also remember reciprocity. So if we start charging bonds to people that come here, bonds are going to be charged to U.S. citizens that go to these countries, and maybe some students won't be able to make those bonds because of their classifications or just their funding won't be able to go to other countries. So that's a limiting restriction on U.S. nationals who want to travel.</p><p>INGRAHAM: If we are talking about losing a few backpackers in the summer versus keeping our country, our integrity of our immigration secure and sound, I think we can lose of your backpackers.</p><p>ORR: This has been an issue for years. And addressing it is the same way we address all of our other immigration problems. We modernize our immigration system. The problem is, if more people were able to stay here illegally, we wouldn't have the problem with overstays. Things like ending TPS, ending DACA is going to only to increase the amount of overstays that are here because we know --</p><p>INGRAHAM: So you really don't want to put any limits. You want no limits on people who can come to the country on visas, you really want to know limits, correct?</p><p>ORR: It's not about no limits. It's about appropriate limits. If we are able to absorb 700,000 people a year or whatever the numbers may be into our society and they are able to stay and they're working at places and they're here productively, then something says --</p><p>INGRAHAM: They're not all here. We have a list of how many --</p><p>HOMAN: We are the most more welcoming country of the world.</p><p>INGRAHAM: They are also committing crimes here.</p><p>HOMAN: -- than all other countries combined.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Guys, we are out of time. But ahead, how the media's skews facts about gun violence with the goal of ignoring some truly disturbing trends. That next.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ALI VELSHI, MSNBC ANCHOR: It's worth taking another look at gun laws in Florida. Florida does not require a permit to buy rifles or handguns. It doesn't require firearms to be registered, and it does not require gun owners to be licensed. Florida does not require a permit to carry a rifle. It does require a permit to carry a handgun. And if a gun is purchased in Florida, there is a three day waiting period, but this doesn't apply if you trade in your old gun for a new gun.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM: Those are some nifty graphics that Ali Velshi was using there. What an insightful report that would be if it wasn't totally wrong. The gun used in Sunday's horrific Jacksonville shooting was actually obtained in Maryland and the shooter purchased it legally.</p><p>We've heard this type of deflection from the antigun rights people time and again. And it's often used I think to obscure some other contributing factors in these mass shootings. Mental illness, things like video games obsession, and antidepressant dependencies.</p><p>Joining us now with more is Dr. Carole Lieberman, a forensic psychiatrist. Dr. Lieberman, there is no study saying that indicate if you are on antidepressants, there is necessarily a causal relationship to going out and shooting someone, but the list of the mass shooters and how many of them or taking antidepressants, just go through some of them, David Katz, the Jacksonville shooter we just mentioned, Eric Harris, Columbine, James Holmes, Aurora, Colorado, Adam Lanza, Sandy Hook, Nikolas Cruz, all of them are on some SSIR drugs, antidepressants. What should we think?</p><p>DR. CAROLE LIEBERMAN, FORENSIC PSYCHIATRIST: Well, it is not really the antidepressants fault. But this isn't a gun-control problem either. It's mainly a video game control problem and access to good mental health treatment problem. With antidepressants, the problem is that instead of treating people who, if they need antidepressants, instead of seeing them every week for therapy and monitoring their antidepressants, and the dose and so on, and if they need that or something else, that isn't happening. The psychiatrists are giving people prescriptions and sending them away for months or two or three. That is the problem. It's not the antidepressants themselves.</p><p>But I will tell you what the problem is. There is a pattern here with all of the school shooters. David Katz is just the latest one. And that is, first of all, there is some kind of mental illness. David Katz seems like he might be on the autism spectrum.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Look at him.</p><p>LIEBERMAN: Depression certainly. If you look at -- all you have to do is look at him.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Look at his eyes.</p><p>LIEBERMAN: His high school yearbooks.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Yes, Adam Lanza's eyes. There's something dead in their eyes. The eyes are the giveaway.</p><p>LIEBERMAN: Absolutely. And in David's high school yearbook, I don't know if you saw that, but it's the same eyes, the same depressed eyes. And so he was born with some kind of predilection for some kind of mental illness. But what really happened, and this is what happens in most of these families, broken families. Now for David Katz, his parents got divorced when he was around 11. They went through a 10-year divorce and custody battle.</p><p>INGRAHAM: So family breakdown, doctor, family breakdown, depression. We're going to have you on radio and do this for, like, an hour because it's so big. Thank you so much. We'll be right back.</p><p>INGRAHAM: That mini-discussion we just had with Dr. Lieberman is extremely important, and we are sorry we didn't have more time, but we're going to stay on this. We'll do a longer segment this week, next week, and a course on radio. So tune in tomorrow.</p><p>But we do want to hear what you have to say about tonight's show, so be sure to tweet me @IngrahamAngle. And the great Shannon Bream and the \"FOX NEWS @ NIGHT\" team are up next.

It was -- </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">HANNITY:  I got in trouble. I played ice hockey. I spent a lot of time in  the penalty box. I was a big fan of the broad street bullies and Bobby  Clark and Reggie leach and Hound Dog Kelly and Dave Schultz. That's what I  grew up (inaudible).</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">INGRAHAM:  Oh my god. That's why people love you Hannity. Awesome show  tonight. </p><p>HANNITY:  Bobby Clark was my favorite. He had no teeth, none. </p><p>INGRAHAM:  Oh no, that's like Gordie Howe on those guys. They're just like  (inaudible).</p><p>HANNITY:  Yes. They played (inaudible). It's like, did you ride a bicycle?  When you rode a bicycle, did you wear a helmet? </p><p>INGRAHAM:  Never.

(Inaudible). </p><p>HANNITY:  Helicopter parents. </p><p>INGRAHAM:  Great show tonight. Thanks so much.</p><p>HANNITY:  All right. Have a good show.</p><p>INGRAHAM:  All right. I'm Laura Ingraham. This is THE INGRAHAM ANGLE from  Washington. What a show we have for you tonight. The case of Hillary  Clinton's private server just will not go away. Now, there are reports --  and this doesn't surprise me in the slightest -- that China was hacking her  e-mails in real-time. Peter Schweizer, best person we could have to break  it down is here tonight. </p><p>Plus, primary voters hit the polls in three states across the country  tonight and at this hour, polls have now closed in Arizona where candidates  from both parties are vying for the chance to succeed retiring Republican  Senator Jeff Flake. It's too early for Fox News to project a winner on both  sides, but we will have a live report on the ground at all the pivotal  races for this November's midterms.</p><p>Plus, we'll talk to one of tonight's big winners -- we already know. And  that president is also taking aim at some tech giants who he believes and  many of us do, are unfairly targeting unfairly targeting conservatives.  That will be a spirited debate later in the hour. </p><p>But first, the press, prosecutors and partisans and their incestuous  relationship. That is the focus of tonight's \"Angle. OK, last month, CNN  ran with a bombshell of a story. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JIM SCIUTTO, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Sources with knowledge tell, myself and  Karl, that Michael Cohen claims that then candidate Donald Trump knew in  advance about the June 2016 meeting in Trump Tower in which Russians were  expected to offer his campaign dirt on Hillary Clinton. Crucially, these  sources tell us that Cohen is willing to make that assertion to the special  counsel, Robert Mueller. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM:  Why is Chris Cuomo's head so much bigger than the other two  heads? I don't know why I focused on that. OK. Well, the accompanying  article on their website revealed that \"contacted by CNN, one of Cohen's  attorneys, Lanny Davis, declined to comment.\" And just a week ago, Lanny  Davis, Michael Cohen's attorney, doubled down again on CNN.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>LANNY DAVIS, MICHAEL COHEN'S ATTORNEY:  I think that the reporting of this  story got mixed up in the course of a criminal investigation. We were not  the source of this story. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM:  OK, a little problem there. He was lying! Lanny Davis was  actually the major source for the entire story. He was also the anonymous  source that confirmed its other outlets. Now this week he came clean  telling \"The Washington Post\" that he is not certain the claim is accurate  and that he could not independently verify it. </p><p>And yesterday, he tells \"BuzzFeed News\" that he regrets his whole role as  an independent source in a subsequent denial of his involvement in the  story, if you can follow that. Davis merely saying he \"made a mistake.\" But  he actually didn't. Lanny Davis is an old Clinton fixer who has been  spinning information and using the press to do his bidding for decades. </p><p>Now, this was deliberate, and the folks at CNN were only too happy to join  him in this misinformation charade. Why? Because they have a common enemy.  It's Donald J. Trump. So Davis floats a malicious and salacious story to  target a political adversary and the media gleefully disseminate it. </p><p>Now CNN's Sciutto and Bernstein delighted in this tale of Trump's misdeeds  because it fits the pathetic Russian narrative that they have been trying  to substantiate for a year now. They used to call CNN, remember, the  Clinton News Network in the day. Well, with Lanny Davis as an unpaid  contributor, it is more fitting than ever. Forget 1998. It's fact. </p><p>But this reminds me of the disgraced FBI Director Jim Comey. We call him  James \"Too Tall\" Comey, OK, fine -- who's planted more stories than Martha  Stewart has planted hydrangeas. OK? Comey passed his memos of classified  conversations between himself and the president to a friend. Remember that  memo to the file? And he did it for media consumption. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JAMES COMEY, FORMER FBI DIRECTOR:  I understood this to be my recollection  recorded of my conversation with the president. As a private citizen, I  felt free to share that. I felt it very important to get it out. </p><p>SEN. ROY BLUNT (R), MISSOURI:  So why didn't you do give those to somebody  yourself rather than get them through a third-party? </p><p>COMEY:  Because I was buried the media was camping at the end of my  driveway at that point and I was actually going out of town with my wife to  hide and I worried it would be like feeding seagulls at the beach.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>INGRAHAM:  Oh my god, I had forgotten he said that. So, we are led to  believe that he really doesn't like the press, Comey, while he is throwing  them life sustaining chum, oh, to the seagulls. And remember these greatest  hits from the WikiLeaks Podesta inbox? CNBC's John Harwood sent e-mails to  Hillary Clinton. </p><p>Campaign chairman John Podesta shamelessly sucking up to him offering  campaign advice and praising the candidate. He was with her while he was  covering the campaign. Then there was Juliet Eilperin of \"The Washington  Post.\" She dropped Podesta a line to give him a heads up on a story she was  going to publish, and she included a little preview, so helpful. </p><p>And \"The New York Times\" unbiased Glenn Thrush, he put an appearance as  well. He wrote to Podesta a story in progress to make sure \"I'm not effing  anything up.\" He said. Like Lanny Davis, Podesta was apparently kind of  like a freelance editor for both \"The Washington Post\" and \"The New York  Times.\" </p><p>Now, these are just a few examples of collusion that we know about only  thanks to WikiLeaks. But today we learn from Congress and Mark Meadows the  danger of this kind of politicization of the media and partisan story  planting. He tweeted in part, \"We've learned new information suggesting our  suspicions are true. FBI/DOJ have previously leaked info to the press and  then used those same press stories as a separate source to justify FISA\" --  Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act -- and Meadows then spoke to  \"America's Newsroom\" following closed door hearings with FBI officials. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. MARK MEADOWS (R), NORTH CAROLINA:  We know that some people like the  Department Of Justice and FBI actually gave information to the media, then  the stories were reported, then they used those reports to justify further  investigation.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>INGRAHAM:  Now, it should be noted that the FBI tonight is pushing back  hard on this story. A source clarified the agent testified that the FBI  routinely uses media materials to corroborate their work product including  FISA materials, but \"never said directly that we utilize FBI leaks for  FISAs.\" Boy, that was a carefully worded statement. Got to really parse  that one. </p><p>But with partisans using the media too bait prosecutors are justify bogus  investigations, don't we need to be more careful and ask more questions? I  think America needs journalists that we can trust. But as it stands now, we  not only have to worry about the objectivity of our news sources, we have  to worry about their sources as well. And that is \"The Angle.\" </p><p>Joining us now with reaction, the Washington Examiner's correspondent,  Byron York, along with attorney and RNC committeewoman Harmeet Dhillon. All  right, Byron, what do we need to know here? This has been a wild day. Let's  start with a Lanny Davis and CNN saga, which is both stunning on his part  and I think even -- we are kind of used to that from the Clintons and the  Clinton spokesman surrogates, but CNN? </p><p>BYRON YORK, CORRESPONDENT, WASHINGTON EXAMINER:  CNN's reaction is really  baffling here. Why are they -- they are sticking with the story and -- </p><p>INGRAHAM:  The story being?</p><p>YORK:  Their original story, saying that Michael Cohen was prepared to tell  Robert Mueller that Donald Trump knew about the Trump Tower meeting in  advance. It was a huge, huge story. Now \"The New York Post\" had reported  this. They went back, re-reported it after Davis confessed that he had not  told them the truth, and told their readers what was going on.</p><p>So did \"The Washington Post.\" Now, what's going on with CNN? It seems to be  that their position is a source gave us inaccurate information. We pass  that onto you, the listener, but we told you what he said. Now we found out  that it's not true, but we stand by the story. It doesn't make any sense.  You should do with \"The Post\" did and what \"New York\" and \"Washington Post\"  did, which is go back, re-report it, and tell the readers what happened. </p><p>INGRAHAM:  Harmeet, Kellyanne Conway was on with Chris Cuomo at CNN just  recently and it was this unbelievable exchange where he was up on his, you  know, high horse about morality and truth seeking and how hard CNN works,  and I want to play this for you now because in light of what we have  discovered with this Lanny Davis phony sourcing, I think it is more  important than ever to watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>CHRIS CUOMO, CNN HOST:  But I will tell you this now and I make it to you  as a promise, all right? As you know, nobody works harder than we do to do  this job. </p><p>KELLANNE CONWAY, COUNSEL TO PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Who, you? </p><p>CUOMO:  In this place, on my team, in this shop of CNN. We work very hard  to tell people what is true. </p><p>CONWAY:  Any pause (ph) for humility. But Chris, let me just have a word  about that. </p><p>CUOMO:  Nobody outworks us everyday. I'm telling you this. </p><p>CONWAY:  OK, but let me just have a word about that.</p><p>CUOMO:  All I wanted to tell you was that you need to own the truth.</p><p>CONWAY:  Well you sound like a scold most of the time.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM:  Harmeet, you need to own the truth. What you think about that  tonight? </p><p>HARMEET DHILLON, RNC COMMITTEEWOMAN:  I mean, you know, what's there to  say. As a lawyer, I have to say I'm temporarily happy to know that the  lawyers are not the most despicable people here in the eyes of the public I  think today based on these lies and their failure to admit what went on  here. </p><p>You know, everybody who was a reporter -- I'm a former reporter before I  became a lawyer and occasionally a source will burn you and, you know, I  mean, OK. You got corrected, move on. I mean, that's what they do. Its part  of their job and it happens. </p><p>But to not own it I think is really showing that we all have reason to  doubt the sincerity of other stories that they've had out there if this is  their corporate attitude towards, you know, grossly misleading the public. </p><p>I think it is really bad news for the media to black (inaudible) for CNN  and, you know, I think the public expects better, the viewers expect to  deserve better from them. </p><p>INGRAHAM:  And we wonder why the press' numbers, real numbers are in the  toilet. And this comes after Sunday's \"Meet The Press\" where Chuck Todd --  I'm going toplay the sound byte -- laid blame on this network for causing  the problems for credibility. Let's watch. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DAVID BRODY, CHRISTIAN BROADCASTING NETWORK:  I hate to say it, I know I'm  sitting on a \"Meet the Press\" round table, but the truth of the matter is,  62 percent think the media's bias. So in other words, if you look at the  approval rating of Donald Trump versus the approval rating of the media -- </p><p>CHUCK TODD, MSNBC HOST:  Well, the conservative echo chamber created that  environment. It's not -- no, no, no, I mean, it has been a tactic and a  tool of the Roger Ailes created echo chamber. </p><p>BRODY:  Yes.</p><p>TODD:  So, let's not pretend it's not anything other than that.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>INGRAHAM:  OK, I think the press' credibility has been pretty low before --  even before 20 years ago if Fox News started. </p><p>YORK:  Also, can I say something about the larger agenda here? I mean,  Lanny Davis is doing what he's doing, he's telling CNN what he's telling  them for a reason. And we seem to have the situation in which Michael  Cohen, the client here, the president's former lawyer, is kind of jumping  up and down and waving his hands at Robert Mueller saying, hey, notice me,  notice me, I've got something. </p><p>Now, we've never gotten a story out of the Robert Mueller shop that --  we've never found out a story about this that Mueller didn't know about six  months ago. He's been way ahead of the reporting on this. So, we have to  figure out that there is no -- that he has no particular interest in Cohen  right now because he farmed his case out to prosecutors in New York. So you  have to wonder, what are they doing here? I don't really know the answer,  but this Lanny Davis stuff didn't just come out of nowhere. </p><p>INGRAHAM:  The Bruce Ohr -- you've been doing a reporting on this -- Bruce  Ohr saga for months and months and months. What do we take from today's  developments?</p><p>YORK:  Well, the big question had been with Bruce Ohr, how high and how far  did knowledge about the dossier go? The Steele Trump dossier, go inside the  FBI and inside the Justice Department, because we did know that after  Christopher Steele was terminated as a source because he was dying to get  bad information about Trump out into the public before the election, right? </p><p>So we talked to the press, which was against the rules, so the FBI  terminated him. And then they used Bruce Ohr as the go-between. So Ohr  would go talk to Christopher Steele and then he'd go to the FBI and tell  them what Steele had told him. </p><p>So now, I think what they learned today was who else was who else was Ohr  briefing on this? Who else was being kept up on this? Not just at the FBI  but at the Obama Justice Department. </p><p>INGRAHAM:  Doesn't he have an obligation, Harmeet, to divulge his  connection to the firm that was producing the dossier that then led to the  FISA warrant and the surveilling of the Trump campaign? I mean, isn't there  some basic sense at the Justice Department that you have to reveal these  types of obvious conflicts? I mean, he was promoting his wife. He was  promoting her firm and at the same time, added bonus, get the president, or  get the candidate. </p><p>DHILLON:  Right. Well, he was creating demand for his wife's consulting  services, so that's an obvious conflict of interest. It's also a violation  of the, you know, government's rules to not disclose that. But more  importantly for me as a civil libertarian, the fact that this was not  disclosed to the FISA court is shocking and I think it's obstruction of  justice, quite frankly. </p><p>Laura, I ran the numbers as of last year, 21 warrants had been denied by  the FISA court out of over 40,000. That is 99.999, OK? 99.999 are granted. </p><p>INGRAHAM:  That's despicable. </p><p>DHILLON:  So, the people at the DOJ and FBI say, hey, don't worry about  this, there are safeguards in place. Not only does a high level of the FBI  have to sign off but also high levels of the DOJ have to probe this and  sign off. In fact, it appears that no oversight was done and they didn't  ask -- didn't ask the obvious questions about this. </p><p>So, I think this does go higher. We don't know (inaudible) exactly in the  testimony but there are a lot of questions that need to be asked, and it  isn't just what happened to Carter Page. This seems to be a systematic  issue with the DOJ and the FBI and, you know, creating stories. </p><p>INGRAHAM:  All right. Great segment, guys. And by the way, former Secretary  of State Hillary Clinton's private e-mail server was reportedly hacked by  another foreign entity. That issue had been raised before but now it looks  like we have some confirmation. It was a Chinese owned company. They  inserted code that forwarded Clinton's e-mails to them in real time. That,  according to \"The Daily Caller\" news foundation. </p><p>Even worse, the FBI was reportedly warned about this by the intel  community's inspector general, but did nothing in response. Here with his  reaction is investigative journalist Peter Schweizer. Peter, this doesn't  come as any surprise to any of us who had followed this issue. </p><p>There is no security on this private e-mail server. Classified information  clearly on it. What is your take away? Apparently no Russia but yes, China. </p><p>PETER SCHWEIZER, INESTIGATIVE JOURNALIST:  Yes, Laura, this is a huge a  story and I'll tell you why. Think about this for a second. If the story is  true and the reporter that broke the story, Mr. Pollock, is an excellent  reporter. If the story is true, it means that the only set of all of  Hillary Clinton's e-mails as Secretary of State resides in Beijing, China. </p><p>Because remember, she deleted 30,000 e-mails and never turned them over to  the FBI. If you think about the Steele dossier, the concern that was always  raised about that fake dossier was that it would lead to blackmail on  Donald Trump, these e-mails would be a massive blackmail too for the  Chinese against Hillary Clinton. </p><p>Those 30,000 deleted e-mails were personal e-mails, they were probably very  sensitive, that's why they were deleted in the first place. You have the  existing set of the other 30,000. This is a huge story, and the fact that  this information was discovered, then turned over to the FBI and the FBI  counterintelligence office, including Mr. Peter Strzok, apparently took no  interest in it, is shocking. </p><p>You know, China is the big threat here. They are the rising power  challenging United States. Russia is the declining power. If I were looking  at an intelligence threat, the number one threat would be China. That is  what this FBI director today is saying. China is the one we are worried  about. But there was no interest in this apparently by Mr. Stzrok and  others. It's a shocking story. </p><p>INGRAHAM:  Peter, I think you reported on this at the time, I believe. When  this e-mail server was discovered, it also came out, I believe, that the  person in charge of Hillary's security on her system was told, we might've  had some intrusion in the system, and kind of blew off the concern. </p><p>I had to go back and get the actual language so I get it verbatim. But that  was reported. I guess through investigators, he said that there was a  concern raised, but basically he was shot down when he raised that concern.  Period. </p><p>SCHWEIZER:  Yes, that's exactly -- that's exactly right. The service that  was taking care of the servers raised this with the Clinton people and it  was dismissed because they didn't want attention focused on even existence  of the server. So the way they tried to cope with this was pretending that  the server wasn't there. </p><p>This is a massive breach. And look, we were told in the 2016 campaign that  Hillary Clinton was the adult. She is the professional. She's the diplomat  that knows how to get things done and to do things in an orderly way. This  thing was a massive failure. </p><p>INGRAHAM:  Yes. Well, she knows how to get things done to cover up for the  Clinton's and Clinton Foundation I guess, but get things done for the  American people, she got a lot done for China. And I say thank god Hillary  Clinton wasn't elected given the fact that if the story is true, China has  a treasure trove of information, which I don't think is just about her  daughter's wedding or her grandkids or whatever or yoga class. I don't  think the Chinese care about, you know, the down dog in Hillary. I think  they are interested in some other issues. </p><p>SCHWEIZER:  Yes, you know, that is exactly right. And the bottom line here  is I think if you gave any counterintelligence official a choice between  being concerned about a discredited dossier or being concerned that your  president of the United States has 60,000 e-mails in the possession of an  enemy power and you don't even know what's in 30,000 of them. </p><p>I think they would view that is a much larger counterintelligence threat  than anything that is raised by the dossier. That is why this issue needs  to be re-investigated and looked at. It's a counterintelligence issue and  problem going forward. </p><p>INGRAHAM:  Yes. Jeff Sessions should convene an investigation, a real  serious investigation just into this issue alone, frankly. Peter, great to  have you on tonight. Thank you so much. </p><p>And by the way, as I said earlier, it is election night for primary voters  in Florida and Arizona. We've got live reports for you on the ground next  and we'll speak with Congressman Ron DeSantis, who tonight just became the  Republican nominee for Florida's governor. He just got a surprising  opponent this fall, we'll tell you about that, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>INGRAHAM:  Voters hit the polls in primaries across three states today but  two particular states will greatly impact November's midterms. For more on  what we go to now is in Florida, Ed Henry, standing by live in Miami. Ed? </p><p>ED HENRY, FOX NEWS CHIEF NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Laura, great to see you.  Big developments tonight here, breaking this hour. In Florida, the  governor's race is going to come down to a dramatic clash between a key  ally of President Trump, Ron DeSantis, against a Democrat backed socialist  Bernie Sanders, Andrew Gillam. It's going to be interesting as we see the  Democratic Party in swing states like this tilt even further left. </p><p>On the Republican side as I mentioned, Ron DeSantis tonight easily beat the  state agriculture commissioner Adam Putnam, where the deciding factor, very  clearly was the coattails of the president. The president a short time ago  tweeting this out there about the race \"such a fantastic win for a Ron  DeSantis and the people of the great state of Florida. Ron will be a  fantastic governor onto November.\" That from the president.</p><p>Now look at how dramatic, how pivotal the president' support was. In mid- June polling had Putnam beating DeSantis by 15 points, mid-June. A week  later, June 22nd, the president tweeted an endorsement of DeSantis. By late  July, DeSantis was up by 12 points, a 27-point swing. </p><p>Now tonight here, DeSantis running to replace retiring Republican governor  Rick Scott, who easily beat -- easily won the GOP nomination for a senate  seat against incumbent Bill Nelson. They will face off in November. That is  expected to be a very tight race. </p><p>I mentioned Andrew Gillum on the Democratic side. He beat back a challenge  from a more moderate candidate. He's the Tallahassee mayor. He won after  key endorsements from Bernie Sanders and after an infusion of $650,000 from  liberals George Soros and Tom Steyer, who's been pushing for impeachment  for a long time so watch that. </p><p>Meanwhile, another important Trump factor in Arizona tonight, Republican  Senator Jeff Flake retired because he's at odds with the Trump agenda,  unlikely that he would get re-elected, he decided to retire. He endorsed  Congresswoman Martha McSally. She said she doesn't want the endorsement  because she is competing with Dr. Kelli Ward and Sergio Arpaio over who is  more pro-Trump. </p><p>The winner of the GOP primary likely to face Congresswoman Kyrtsen Sinema  in a pickup opportunity for Democrats. Interesting, we have not been able  to call this race in Arizona just yet. The polls just closed a short time  ago, Laura, but that race is very significant as well. </p><p>INGRAHAM:  Ed, Steyer and Soros, a huge infusion of money in Florida, that  I understand is going to be happening in other races, including in even  statewide initiatives in places like Arizona, Colorado, Ohio, and beyond.  So this is just the beginning of what we are seeing. </p><p>HENRY:  It is, and what could be significant is in a battleground like  Florida, which is typically tight, and presidential races and midterms,  whether it's governor or this big senate race here. You have Andrew Gillum,  who has been polled very far left because as you say, he's got Tom Steyer  and George Soros money behind him. He's a Tallahassee mayor, a relatively  unknown. </p><p>This was a surprise win, a shocker really, and he beat back the daughter of  Bob Graham, the former senator and governor, beat back a challenge from  here. She's a more moderate Democrat, former congresswoman, someone who is  seen sort of middle-of-the-road, might've been a tougher challenge or  against Ron DeSantis. Now you got the party pulled to the left. It will be  fascinating how it plays out in November. </p><p>INGRAHAM:  Ed, thanks so much. And joining me now is one of the men who  just won one of these important races. Congressman Ron DeSantis is now the  Republican nominee for Florida governor. He is here now and his first  interview since his primary victory. Congressman DeSantis, congratulations.  You must be feeling pretty good tonight. </p><p>RON DESANTIS, FLORIDA GOP GUBERNATORIAL CANDIDATE:  Yes, Laura. And I  remember you and I talking after we did the debate on Fox News, and you  were like, \"you are not going to be behind much longer after this.\" And  sure enough, I mean, we really pulled ahead. We had the president come at  the end of July with a huge event for us. </p><p>And we really just had unstoppable momentum. And the good thing is, we are  going to carry this all the way through November and post a strong victory  so we can continue on Florida's path to success and make it even better. </p><p>INGRAHAM:  Are you surprised that Gillum wins on the Democrat side? So  he'll be your challenger, endorsed by Bernie Sanders, as you just heard us  talk about. Soros and Tom Steyer both pitched in a total of about $650,000.  It seemed to make a difference down the home stretch. So you are going to  be running against a hard left former Tallahassee mayor. </p><p>DESANTIS:  He is the most liberal candidate that the Democratic Party has  ever nominated in the state of Florida by a country mile in a governor's  race. He wants to abolish ICE. He wants a billion dollar tax increase. He  wants a single-payer health care system in Florida, which would bankrupt  the state.  </p><p>I'm trying to make Florida even better. He wants to make FloridaVenezuela.  But he also combines the far left ideology with managerial incompetence. As  mayor of Tallahassee, his tenure has been absolutely disastrous.  Tallahassee is one of, if not, the most crime-ridden city in all of  Florida, year after year, rising crime, he is embroiled in a lot of  corruption scandals. This is not -- the guy who can't even run the city of  Tallahassee. There is no way Florida voters can entrust him with our entire  state. </p><p>INGRAHAM:  Now, Congressman DeSantis, in your jubilation and your  celebration, you may have missed that Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez tweeted out  congratulations not to you, but to your challenger, Andrew Gillum, saying,  \"the progressive movement is transforming the country and he proved that  again tonight. Gillum ran on Medicare for all, legalizing marijuana,  abolish ICE and more. Thank you Florida voters! On to November. I'd wear  that as a badge of honor tonight, Congressman.</p><p>DESANTIS:  Well look, we have people who in Florida who have fled socialist  countries like Cuba and Venezuela. They don't want that imported into  Florida. We also have people who flee from left-wing policies in states  like New York and Connecticut and they don't want that imported into  Florida. So, I think we want to keep Florida great. We want to keep it  going in a good direction. And going in the direction of an Ocasio-Cortez  is just untenable and it will not happen in Florida.  </p><p>INGRAHAM:  Congressman, some of your critics will throw out this, they'll  say, well, you won on Trump's coattails, but you are short on your own  policy initiatives on a statewide level.  How do you answer your critics?  </p><p>DESANTIS:  That's not true at all.  We have a solid vision for how to  create high-paying jobs in Florida.  I've been very strong on our  environmental problems and solving our water crisis that we have in  different parts of the state, and then only one of the few people have  stood up against some of the entrenched interests.  Laura, you know they  were spending millions of dollars to stop me in the race and yet we did  that.  We've been very strong on illegal immigration, saying we need E- Verify in Florida, we can't have sanctuary cities.  I've been somebody  that's been a wholesale supporter of education reform, from parental choice  to vocational education in the classrooms, to more civics education.  So  we've been talking about these key issues time and time again, and we're  going to continue to do that and spread the message far and wide.  </p><p>INGRAHAM:  Did you hear from Putnam tonight?  Did he give you a call?  </p><p>DESANTIS:  Yes.  Look, he's a class guy.  He worked very hard.  He was a  tough competitor.  People say you won big, but this guy built a huge  organization, he raised a boatload of money, and he ran a very tough race.   He tried to knock me around a lot, that's politics.  But he's supportive of  where we are going.  He knows we've got to keep Florida in Republican  hands, and he's going to help me.  So that's just how these things go.  I  would've supported him if he had beaten me, and you got to move forward as  a team.  </p><p>INGRAHAM:  Absolutely.  And the president, I don't care what anybody --  he's very popular in Florida.  The endorsement did help a lot, but he also  did a great job on the on the hustings.  Congressman, congratulations,  thanks so much. </p><p>And big tech is once again showing their true colors when it comes to  conservative speech online.  President Trump is now calling them out.  That  debate, don't miss it, ahead.   </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>INGRAHAM:  It got hot today.  President Trump taking aim at big tech and  their alleged bias against conservatives.  The president first took to  Twitter singling out Google for what he calls rigged news search results  against him.  He even went further this afternoon.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I think Google is really  taking advantage of a lot of people, and I think that's a very serious  thing and it's a very serious charge.  I think what Google and what others  are doing, if you look at what is going on at Twitter, if you look at what  is going on at Facebook, they better be careful because you can't do that  to people.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM:  Joining me now wit reaction, former Trump campaign manager Corey  Lewandowski and Jason Nichols, a Democratic strategist.  All right, Jason,  let's start with you.  What about the president's thoughts here?  A lot of  conservatives that I talked to think, wait a second, my impressions on  Twitter are way down with no real clue as to why, search results seem to  kind of speak to themselves when you put in \"Trump and news,\" it's all  negative.  What do you think?  </p><p>JASON NICHOLS, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST:  First of all, when we look at the  search results on Google, just like when you do a Google scholar search,  what you get are the sources that received the most citations, the ones  that are cited the most, the ones that actually have the most news bureaus.   So this has nothing to do with politics.  If he wants better stories, then  create better news is what he needs to do. </p><p>INGRAHAM:  Like consumer confidence at an 18 year high?  </p><p>NICHOLS:  Or 2,500 kids being traumatized by being separated, being accused  in court under oath of committing a crime, there's a lot of things that he  has done that actually show he doesn't have a whole lot of good news to  talk about.  So --</p><p>INGRAHAM:  Jason, the fact that 41 percent of Americans now say the country  is going in the right direction, the last year of Obama, do you know where  that number was?  Twenty to mid-twenties.  The country sees things going  the right track.  They might not like everything Trump tweets, but I'm  saying, and I want Corey to get in on this, because it is true that when  conservatives say bias, bias, bias, Dorsey and Sergey Brin, all of these  guys will come out and say this is just the way the searches go.  This is  the way the technology rolls.  Sometimes conservatives will get the short  end of the stick and sometimes liberals will, too.  Everybody complains all  the time, that is where we need to be.  That's what they will say.</p><p>COREY LEWANDOWSKI, FORMER TRUMP CAMPAIGN MANAGER:  Yes, but look, Eric  Schmidt was a supporter of the Clinton campaign, and that is perfectly fine  for him to be able to do that, no one is questioning that.  </p><p>INGRAHAM:  It doesn't mean he's biased, though, right?  </p><p>LEWANDOWSKI:  It doesn't mean he's biased.  But look, Dorsey has said that  the company tends to be more left-leaning than conservative.  And again,  that is the way he wants to run his company.  But what we have at Google  specifically is they fired one of their engineers, and he said they did  that because they were mistreating individuals who were conservatives  there.  That is what he was fired for.  Now he is suing Google for his job  back.  </p><p>INGRAHAM:  Harmeet Dhillon's client.  </p><p>LEWANDOWSKI:  And so the reason is, look, you can run a company anyway you  want to, but it is such a monopoly.  Between Google and Facebook, it  reaches 1.8 billion people on a daily basis.  These are massive numbers.   And I'm not in favor of government overzealous regulation, but you can't  have a company that is going after people based on their conservative  thought and shadow banning them or banning them in an unfair manner.  And  we have to look at this because it is a problem that's only going to grow.  </p><p>INGRAHAM:  NRA spokeswoman Dana Loesch spoke about what happened to her on  Twitter.  Let's watch.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DANA LOESCH, NRA SPOKESWOMAN:  We have to deal with situations where you  have crazy people running amok on Twitter, and Twitter having inconsistent  applications of terms of service.  And that's what this comes down to.  I'm  simply asking for these -- for people like Jack Dorsey and Mark Zuckerberg  and these individuals who own these platforms to maybe rein and their  employees' biases and evenly and consistently apply and enforce terms of  service.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM:  And the thing that got her really upset is a tweet that has  since been deleted about, well, if Dana Loesch has to have her children  murdered before she'll understand, I guess that's what needs to happen.   And the individual, Milan Legius, whatever his name is, has not been  permanently banned from Twitter.  I guess he was temporarily banned.  That  is the kind of stuff -- that is not political speech.  That is -- that's  terrifying actually.  </p><p>NICHOLS:  I agree.  And as somebody who comes on conservative media and  gets death threats -- </p><p>INGRAHAM:  And we love you coming on.  I adore you.  </p><p>NICHOLS:  Thank you.  </p><p>INGRAHAM:  May be even more than Corey.  </p><p>NICHOLS:  Those people sending me threats right now, I want you to know I'm  certainly not afraid of you and I'm not backing down.  But I will tell you  that I absolutely deplore that.  I think that she has an argument in terms  of trying to get those people to be banned from those platforms.  I think  that Twitter is a large universe and there are some things that Twitter  sometimes misses.  </p><p>But the idea that they are targeting conservatives, and I think what Corey  said, while it may have some validity that this person has a claim, it has  nothing to do with the algorithm in which Google works.  That's not what  this is about.  This is one guy feeling that he was discriminated against  at work.  </p><p>LEWANDOWSKI:  Laura, when you look at Twitter, and you look at what they  did to Candace Owens, and she took a tweet that was written actually  originally by the op-ed writer of \"The New York Times\" and she changed one  word in that tweet, and all of a sudden her account was suspended.  Not for  doing anything other than literally changing one word.  She changed the  word from \"white\" to \"black.\" It was against a conservative African- American woman who was literally reposting something that had already been  posted.  The original post was never considered derogatory or exculpatory  or anything else for that person.  But as soon as Candace Owens put that  out, she immediately was notified by Twitter that her account had been  suspended.  I don't think that's right.  </p><p>INGRAHAM:  Do liberals complain about getting banned?  </p><p>LEWANDOWSKI:  I've never seen one get banned.  </p><p>INGRAHAM:  I always say, if the shoe was on the other foot -- I try to do  this to myself, too.  But if the shoe were on the other foot, and it was a  company this big in this powerful run by the Koch brothers or some other  conservative group of people, and the left felt like their views were not - - it's an interesting conversation.  Oh, this is just an algorithm.  I hear  that algorithm thing all the time.  It doesn't seem to give me much  comfort.  Close it out.  </p><p>NICHOLS:  I think that people on the left absolutely get banned from some  of these -- </p><p>INGRAHAM:  Who?  Some of the most horrible hateful things said about Ivanka  Trump.  I didn't see a lot of things banned.  Was it Chelsea Handler, it  might not be her, but they are all the same person to me.  </p><p>LEWANDOWSKI:  And I think there is the difference between saying something  vulgar and saying something that is threatening.  I think what was said  about Dana Loesch, that was a borderline threat and I think that she has  every right to complain about that.  But what we've seen, and I'm telling  you as someone who gets a lot of threats, probably getting them right now,  I think of that is despicable, but I think that it needs to be applied on  both sides and I think usually does.  </p><p>INGRAHAM:  Great conversation, guys.  </p><p>An immigration controversy that doesn't get enough attention, visa  overstays in the hundreds of thousands.  Details on that crisis in just a  moment.  And later, the Jacksonville shooter this past weekend shared some  telling traits with other violent colors.  A psychotherapist is here to  tell us what they are.  So stay there.     </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>INGRAHAM:  OK, there might finally be a solution to one of the biggest  problems plaguing U.S. immigration which is visa overstays.  We don't talk  about it enough, but in 2017, approximately 700,000 travelers to the United  States overstayed their visas.  That according to Homeland Security.  But  Congressman Steve King is introducing new legislation that would require  nonimmigrants to post bonds before visiting the United States.  So would  this help to finally get illegal immigration, these visa overstays, under  control?  </p><p>Joining us now with reaction is Tom Homan, the former acting direct of ICE,  along with Allen Orr who is an immigration attorney.  Allen?  </p><p>ALLEN ORR, IMMIGRATION ATTORNEY:  So this is a problem.  Not that big of a  problem, -- </p><p>INGRAHAM:  Wait a second, 700,000 -- Allen, I adore you.  You know that.   But 700,000 people is not a big problem?  </p><p>ORR:  So that is a reporting problem from the government.  So right now,  the way that the government relates to people who leave through land ports  isn't properly recorded, and sometimes when students change their status,  that isn't also properly reported.  So I don't really trust the facts that  are presented -- </p><p>INGRAHAM:  You don't trust the numbers from Homeland Security.</p><p>ORR:  There actually have been other reports from Robert Warren who used to  work for the government and also now works for the Center for Immigration  Studies that debunks most of this study, saying this is just an  exaggeration and another way to push more restrictive policies down at  immigration.  </p><p>INGRAHAM:  So you don't think there really is any problem with these  overstays?  </p><p>ORR:  I think visa overstays is an issue, but I don't think bonds are a  solution, because what that will do is make getting visas a class issue, so  therefore people who have the money to post a bond will then get a visa,  and then if they wanted will still overstay because money would not be an  issue for them.  </p><p>INGRAHAM:  Tom?  </p><p>TOM HOMAN:  First of all, I disagree with my friend here.  I think it is a  huge problem.  Maybe a few years ago I wouldn't trust the numbers, but the  recent methodology used by CBP now is about 90 percent accurate, so you're  talking about several hundred thousand dollars a year.  Bond is a good idea  as long as it's high enough so it's a deterrent so they are not willing  just to forfeit and stay illegally.  </p><p>Also what I think part of this legislation should is criminalize those  overstayed visa.  Again, most of those who overstay a visa come to this  country with a full intent of never leaving.  That's just like illegal  entry.  So if you criminalize it, that's another consequence, another  deterrence to stop this from happening.  </p><p>INGRAHAM:  OK, so five countries with overstay rates of over 30 percent,  Chad, Djibouti, Eritrea, Liberia, and the Solomon Islands.  So when folks  from Chad or these other countries come command, there's a pretty good  chance they are not leaving.  Something has to be done.  We know this is  what's happening, and it's like, stamp the visa, come on in, and then they  don't leave.  I can't blame them for not leaving.  No one's really hunting  them down.  </p><p>HOMAN:  This bond issue has been a law for decades.  They just need to  finally implement it.  We've been asking for that for years.  But I also  think equally to the bond, again, they need to be high enough where it's  going to be more than what they could pay. </p><p>INGRAHAM:  How would it work?  How would it work?  Before they leave their  country, their home country, they would post, let's say, $1,000, $5,000?   What about Allen's point that this is a class issue.  Now people that have  no money, they can never come to the United States.  Is that fair? </p><p>HOMAN:  What Allen is forgetting is this is a sovereign country.  We have  the right to decide who comes in and out of this country.  We have the  right to maintain a legal immigration system.  I can tell you, there are  hundreds and thousands every year.  And you are right, the population is  not a priority, hasn't been a priority.  When I was acting director, I made  it a priority, but we certainly don't have the resources for overstays, not  when we are kicked out of jails, we've got to walk the streets looking for  criminals.  So by adding this bond requirements, and make it a criminal act  to overstay a visa, I think you would see a drastic change in overstays.  </p><p>INGRAHAM:  There a lot of countries, Allen, where you don't have to have a  visa.  They are called visa waiver countries.  So you have Greece, Hungary,  and Portugal have the highest overstays for countries where you don't need  a visa at all.  But we are categorizing, so we know who the high risk  people are.  Greece, we know they're having a lot of problems, Hungary,  Portugal, I guess people -- everyone wants to come to United States.  But  we have to be able to control this.  </p><p>And didn't the 9/11 commission say we should do fingerprint entry and exit?   Am I remembering this correctly?  But we don't implement that.  This is the  9/11 commission, bipartisan groups of experts who spent, what, years of  studying this after 9/11?  Why don't we have this?  </p><p>ORR:  I think we do have entry-exit systems, there is just not modernized  yet and they're not talking-- </p><p>INGRAHAM:  Modernized?  After 9/11 they're still not modernized?  </p><p>ORR:  It's the U.S. government and our systems are a little bit antiquated.  </p><p>But also remember reciprocity.  So if we start charging bonds to people  that come here, bonds are going to be charged to U.S. citizens that go to  these countries, and maybe some students won't be able to make those bonds  because of their classifications or just their funding won't be able to go  to other countries.  So that's a limiting restriction on U.S. nationals who  want to travel.  </p><p>INGRAHAM:  If we are talking about losing a few backpackers in the summer  versus keeping our country, our integrity of our immigration secure and  sound, I think we can lose of your backpackers.  </p><p>ORR:  This has been an issue for years.  And addressing it is the same way  we address all of our other immigration problems.  We modernize our  immigration system.  The problem is, if more people were able to stay here  illegally, we wouldn't have the problem with overstays.  Things like ending  TPS, ending DACA is going to only to increase the amount of overstays that  are here because we know --  </p><p>INGRAHAM:  So you really don't want to put any limits.  You want no limits  on people who can come to the country on visas, you really want to know  limits, correct?  </p><p>ORR:  It's not about no limits.  It's about appropriate limits.  If we are  able to absorb 700,000 people a year or whatever the numbers may be into  our society and they are able to stay and they're working at places and  they're here productively, then something says -- </p><p>INGRAHAM:  They're not all here.  We have a list of how many -- </p><p>HOMAN:  We are the most more welcoming country of the world.  </p><p>INGRAHAM:  They are also committing crimes here.  </p><p>HOMAN:  -- than all other countries combined.</p><p>INGRAHAM:  Guys, we are out of time.  But ahead, how the media's skews  facts about gun violence with the goal of ignoring some truly disturbing  trends.  That next.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ALI VELSHI, MSNBC ANCHOR:  It's worth taking another look at gun laws in  Florida.  Florida does not require a permit to buy rifles or handguns.  It  doesn't require firearms to be registered, and it does not require gun  owners to be licensed.  Florida does not require a permit to carry a rifle.   It does require a permit to carry a handgun.  And if a gun is purchased in  Florida, there is a three day waiting period, but this doesn't apply if you  trade in your old gun for a new gun.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM:  Those are some nifty graphics that Ali Velshi was using there.   What an insightful report that would be if it wasn't totally wrong.  The  gun used in Sunday's horrific Jacksonville shooting was actually obtained  in Maryland and the shooter purchased it legally.  </p><p>We've heard this type of deflection from the antigun rights people time and  again.  And it's often used I think to obscure some other contributing  factors in these mass shootings.  Mental illness, things like video games  obsession, and antidepressant dependencies.  </p><p>Joining us now with more is Dr. Carole Lieberman, a forensic psychiatrist.   Dr. Lieberman, there is no study saying that indicate if you are on  antidepressants, there is necessarily a causal relationship to going out  and shooting someone, but the list of the mass shooters and how many of  them or taking antidepressants, just go through some of them, David Katz,  the Jacksonville shooter we just mentioned, Eric Harris, Columbine, James  Holmes, Aurora, Colorado, Adam Lanza, Sandy Hook, Nikolas Cruz, all of them  are on some SSIR drugs, antidepressants.  What should we think?  </p><p>DR. CAROLE LIEBERMAN, FORENSIC PSYCHIATRIST:  Well, it is not really the  antidepressants fault.  But this isn't a gun-control problem either.  It's  mainly a video game control problem and access to good mental health  treatment problem.  With antidepressants, the problem is that instead of  treating people who, if they need antidepressants, instead of seeing them  every week for therapy and monitoring their antidepressants, and the dose  and so on, and if they need that or something else, that isn't happening.   The psychiatrists are giving people prescriptions and sending them away for  months or two or three.  That is the problem.  It's not the antidepressants  themselves.  </p><p>But I will tell you what the problem is.  There is a pattern here with all  of the school shooters.  David Katz is just the latest one.  And that is,  first of all, there is some kind of mental illness.  David Katz seems like  he might be on the autism spectrum.  </p><p>INGRAHAM:  Look at him.  </p><p>LIEBERMAN:  Depression certainly.  If you look at -- all you have to do is  look at him.  </p><p>INGRAHAM:  Look at his eyes.  </p><p>LIEBERMAN:  His high school yearbooks.  </p><p>INGRAHAM:  Yes, Adam Lanza's eyes.  There's something dead in their eyes.   The eyes are the giveaway.  </p><p>LIEBERMAN:  Absolutely.  And in David's high school yearbook, I don't know  if you saw that, but it's the same eyes, the same depressed eyes.  And so  he was born with some kind of predilection for some kind of mental illness.   But what really happened, and this is what happens in most of these  families, broken families.  Now for David Katz, his parents got divorced  when he was around 11.  They went through a 10-year divorce and custody  battle.  </p><p>INGRAHAM:  So family breakdown, doctor, family breakdown, depression.   We're going to have you on radio and do this for, like, an hour because  it's so big.  Thank you so much.  We'll be right back.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>INGRAHAM:  That mini-discussion we just had with Dr. Lieberman is extremely  important, and we are sorry we didn't have more time, but we're going to  stay on this.  We'll do a longer segment this week, next week, and a course  on radio.  So tune in tomorrow.  </p><p>But we do want to hear what you have to say about tonight's show, so be  sure to tweet me @IngrahamAngle.  And the great Shannon Bream and the \"FOX  NEWS @ NIGHT\" team are up next.  Shannon?  </p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

SUBPOENA THREAT ACTIVATED: The Senate Commerce Committee voted Thursday to subpoena the CEOs of Twitter, Facebook and Alphabet, Google's parent company.   Committee Chairman Roger Wicker (R-Miss.) had threatened to subpoena Twitter's Jack Dorsey, Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg and Alphabet's Sundar Pichai last week but was required to hold a vote after ranking member Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.) opposed the plan.   The unanimous vote will compel the CEOs to appear for a hearing on Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which is considered the bedrock of the modern internet.   The 1996 law, which has come under increased scrutiny since President Trump targeted it in an executive order in May, gives internet companies immunity from lawsuits for content posted on their sites by third parties and allows them to make \"good faith\" efforts to moderate content.   Wicker made it clear during Thursday\u2019s executive business meeting that the hearing is required because of allegations of anti-conservative bias on their platforms.   Conservative voices actually dominate many platforms on social media including Facebook, the most powerful of them all.   Read more here.   AMAZON WORKERS HIT HARD BY COVID: More than 19,000 Amazon workers contracted COVID-19 during the pandemic, the company revealed in an update on testing released Thursday.   It is the first time Amazon has publicly shared case numbers among its more than 1.3 million Amazon and Whole Foods Market front-line employees across the U.S.   The company said in a press release that the 19,816 positive tests means the rate of infection among employees was 42 percent lower than expected, compared to the \u201cgeneral population rate\u201d in the U.S.   Amazon also offered updates on its testing capacity, sharing a goal of 50,000 tests per day across 650 facilities by November.   The release of the data comes a day after an NBC News report detailed a lack of transparency in Amazon's coronavirus response and after employees criticized the company's handling of the virus.   Warehouse workers have gone on strike at multiple facilities to protest implementation of safety measures. The company has fired several of those employees, as well as ones on the technology side of the operation who have spoken up.   Read more here.   DEMOCRATS DEMAND MORE PUBLIC TRANSPARENCY: A group of key Senate Democrats on Thursday demanded that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) publicly release a bulletin that said a foreign actor is working to undermine faith in voting by mail this fall.   The senators, who included Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.), said acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf should release the \"widely distributed\" Sept. 3 analysis compiled by the agency\u2019s Office of Intelligence and Analysis (I&amp;A).   \u201cThis document demonstrates that a foreign actor is attempting to undermine faith in the US electoral system, particularly vote-by-mail systems, in a manner that is consistent with the rhetoric being used by President Trump , Attorney General [William] Barr, and others,\u201d the senators wrote in a letter to Wolf.   \u201cThe document has been marked \u2018Unclassified/For Official Use Only,\u2019 meaning that its release would not pose a risk to sources and methods and that it has already been widely distributed around the country through unclassified channels,\u201d the senators added. \u201cIt is now critical and urgent that the American people have access to this document so that they can understand the context of Trump\u2019s statements and actions.\u201d   Other lawmakers who signed the letter include Sen. Mark Warner (Va.), the vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee; Sen. Gary Peters (Mich.), the top Democrat on the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee; Senate Rules Committee ranking member Amy Klobuchar (Minn.); and Sen. Ron Wyden (Ore.), the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee.   DHS did not immediately respond to The Hill\u2019s request for comment on the letter.   The document the senators were referring to was likely the assessment, first reported by ABC News last month, where I&amp;A determined that Russian media and other groups were intentionally \u201camplifying\u201d concerns around mail-in voting to undermine U.S. elections.

Abigail Spanberger (D-Va.) and John Katko (R-N.Y.) on Thursday introduced legislation intended to cut down on foreign disinformation on social media ahead of the election.   The Foreign Agent Disclaimer Enhancement (FADE) Act targets influence campaigns by requiring political content on social media to include a disclaimer if it is produced or sponsored by foreign groups, with the disclaimers remaining if the post is shared.    The legislation would also expand language in the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA) to clarify that political ads and other content funded by a foreign source posted to social media that is meant to influence U.S. citizens must also be reported to the Department of Justice. FARA currently generally does not extend to social media posts.    The Department of Justice would also be required to notify social media platforms if posts that fall under the bill do not have disclaimers, with the agency then directing the social media groups to remove the posts.    Spanberger, a former CIA officer, said Thursday that \u201cour nation is always under siege from foreign adversaries who seek to sow division and spread false information. However, social media networks remain especially vulnerable to foreign campaigns.\u201d    \u201cDisclaimers on social media posts are often non-existent, particularly when content is shared or linked,\u201d Spanberger said in a statement. \u201cThis means that social media can serve as an ideal rumor mill for disinformation, as nefarious actors are able to leverage the rapid transfer of information from person to person.\u201d    Read more here.   DON\u2019T PAY UP: The Treasury Department on Thursday issued two advisories highlighting the dangers of ransomware cyberattacks and warning against paying ransoms demanded by hackers.    Both the agency\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) and Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCIN) issued alerts around ransomware attacks, which have been increasingly widespread over the past two years and have ramped up during the COVID-19 crisis.    \u201cCybercriminals have deployed ransomware attacks against our schools, hospitals, and businesses of all sizes,\u201d Deputy Treasury Secretary Justin Muzinich said in a statement. \u201cTreasury will continue to use its powerful tools to counter these malicious cyber actors and their facilitators.\u201d   OFAC warned that paying a ransom demanded by hackers in order to gain back access to encrypted systems could lead to federal repercussions.    \u201cDemand for ransomware payments has increased during the COVID-19 pandemic as cyber actors target online systems that U.S. persons rely on to continue conducting business,\u201d OFAC wrote in its advisory . \u201cCompanies that facilitate ransomware payments to cyber actors on behalf of victims, including financial institutions, cyber insurance firms, and companies involved in digital forensics and incident response, not only encourage future ransomware payment demands but also may risk violating OFAC regulations.\u201d   FinCEN issued a second advisory to provide information on various types of ransomware attacks, red flag indicators of attack, and how to report and share information if attacked.

TWITTER TAKEDOWN: Twitter removed approximately 130 accounts linked to Iran that were attempting to disrupt the public conversation during the first presidential debate, the company said Wednesday.    The social media network said it removed the accounts \u201cbased on intel\u201d provided by The FBI.    \u201cWe identified these accounts quickly, removed them from Twitter, and shared full details with our peers, as standard,\u201d the company tweeted.    Twitter said the posts from the removed accounts had \u201cvery low engagement and did not make an impact on the public conversation.\u201d    Read more here.   FACEBOOK CRACKS DOWN ON QANON: Facebook is taking steps to hide content from groups affiliated with QAnon, a conspiracy theory that revolves around President Trump fighting a group of highly connected public figures including a secret global cabal of child traffickers.   The company announced in a blog post on Thursday that it will ban all advertising that expresses \"praise, support or represent militarized social movements and QAnon.\"   It also announced that users who follow groups restricted under the company's past policies aimed at tamping down on conspiracy groups will see posts from restricted pages far lower down their news feed than before.   \"On September 16, we started down-ranking content in the Pages and Groups that have been restricted but not removed. Now, people who are members of Groups that have been restricted and follow Pages that have been restricted, will see content from these Groups and Pages further down in their News Feed,\" said Facebook.   \"We are taking steps to address evidence that QAnon adherents are increasingly using the issue of child safety and hashtags like #savethechildren to recruit and organize. Starting today, we will direct people to credible child safety resources when they search for certain child safety hashtags,\" the company continued.   Read more here.   FACEBOOK CHANGES AD POLICY, TOO: A Facebook official on Wednesday announced changes to the platform's ad policy, pledging that the site would remove political ads that baselessly link certain kinds of voting to allegations of widespread voting fraud, such as false claims about mail-in voting.   The move comes as President Trump  has regularly made claims without evidence that the practice of mail-in voting leads to widespread election fraud, and goes into effect immediately, according to the company's director of project management, Rob Leathern.   \"As we get closer to Election Day we want to provide further clarity on policies we recently announced. Last week we said we\u2019d prohibit ads that make premature declarations of victory. We also won\u2019t allow ads with content that seeks to delegitimize the outcome of an election,\" he tweeted.   \"For example, this would include calling a method of voting inherently fraudulent or corrupt, or using isolated incidents of voter fraud to delegitimize the result of an election,\" Leathern added.

DIFFERENCE OF OPINION ON 5G: A group of 19 senators is calling on President Trump to bolster private-sector deployment of 5G, expressing concerns about a request for information from the administration that they felt contradicted a free-market strategy.   Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.), chairman of the Senate Commerce Subcommittee on Communications, Technology, Innovation and the Internet, led a letter to Trump on Wednesday following a recent request for information (RFI) released by the Pentagon regarding 5G.    \u201cRather than rely on private industry and market forces to foster multiple, facilities-based 5G networks, the RFI seeks information on a government-managed process for 5G networks,\u201d the senators wrote. \u201cNationalizing 5G and experimenting with untested models for 5G deployment is not the way the United States will win the 5G race.\u201d   GOP Sens. John Barrasso (Wyo.), Shelley Moore Capito (W.Va.), John Cornyn (Texas), Ron Johnson (Wis.), and Marco Rubio (Fla.), among others, also signed the letter.   The Defense Department issued the RFI on Sept. 18 from industry, seeking insight into accelerating spectrum sharing and 5G deployment.   Read more here.   GOOD NEWS FOR TIKTOK (FOR ONCE): TikTok was again the highest earning social media app in the last three months, despite uncertainty over the fate of the popular video sharing platform in the U.S. due to challenges posed by the Trump administration.    It was the second consecutive quarter TikTok ranked above other non-game apps, according to data released by marketing intelligence group Sensor Tower on Thursday.   YouTube, Tinder, Tencent Video and Disney+ round out the top five grossing non-game apps in the last three months, according to the data, which does not include revenue from in-app advertising.    TikTok was also the most downloaded nongame app in the third quarter, followed by Facebook, Zoom, WhatsApp and Instagram.    President Trump has pushed to overhaul how the Chinese-owned platform operates in the U.S., due to potential national security concerns. The administration's concerns around TikTok are related to the Trump administration\u2019s larger efforts to clamp down on Chinese tech companies amid increasing tensions between China and the U.S.   Read more here.   SNAPCHAT GETS OUT THE VOTE: More than 1 million people have registered to vote this year through the Snapchat app, the company said Thursday.    The number of voters who registered through Snapchat\u2019s in-app tool, in partnership with TurboVote, is already more than double the approximately 450,000 voters that registered through the app during the 2018 midterm elections.    More than half of the 1 million people who registered to vote on Snapchat did so in less than a month. The company said 400,000 had registered to vote as of mid-September.    Fifty-six percent of people who registered to vote through Snapchat this year are first-time voters, and about 65 percent are aged 18 to 24, a Snapchat spokesperson estimated according to data from TurboVote.

AMAZON PULLS 'STAND BY' MERCHANDISE: Amazon and other online stores on Wednesday reportedly stopped the sale of shirts and other products displaying \u201cstand back\u201d and \u201cstand by,\u201d as well as the logo for the far-right extremist group Proud Boys.    Groups started selling the products after President Trump said the two phrases during Tuesday night\u2019s presidential debate.   Trump's comments came after moderator Chris Wallace  asked if Trump would be willing to condemn white supremacists .   The president responded, \u201csure,\u201d although he never explicitly condemned the group after this.    \u201cAlmost everything I see is from the left wing, not from the right wing,\u201d Trump responded.    Trump asked Fox News\u2019s Wallace to \u201cgive me a name,\u201d then Biden chimed in and noted the Proud Boys, a group that the Southern Poverty Law Center has labeled a hate group.   \u201cProud Boys \u2014 stand back and stand by,\u201d Trump said.   Following the debate, T-shirts, tank tops and other products with the verbiage and the Proud Boys insignia appeared on Amazon and Teespring, a website that allows users to create and sell their own merchandise.

TECH CEO-PALOOZA: The CEOs of Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google will testify before Congress on Wednesday in what will be a crucial hearing for the future of both antitrust law and Big Tech\u2019s relationship with Washington.   It will be the first time that Jeff Bezos , Tim Cook, Mark Zuckerberg and Sundar Pichai appear for questioning together and comes as the congressional panel hosting the hearing enters the final stretch of its investigation into digital marketplace competition.   For Democrats on the House Judiciary antitrust subcommittee, led by Rep. David Cicilline (D-R.I.), Wednesday\u2019s testimony will be one of the last major components of that exhaustive process, which started in June 2019 and included hundreds of hours of calls, meetings and briefings, as well as the review of 1.3 million documents. No release date has been announced for the panel's report.   A few Republicans on the subcommittee have signaled they will use the hearing to grill the nation\u2019s top tech CEOs on content moderation, pursuing persistent yet unsubstantiated allegations that social media platforms discriminate against conservatives.   Amazon: Bezos will likely face questioning about Amazon\u2019s dual role as the operator of an online marketplace and a seller of goods on that market.   A bipartisan group of members from the House Judiciary Committee has wanted Bezos to testify ever since The Wall Street Journal reported earlier this year that the company used information from other sellers on the platform to make decisions regarding its private label business, which includes more than 243,000 products.   The article directly contradicted testimony last year from Amazon associate general counsel Nate Sutton, who told the committee that \u201cwe do not use any seller data to compete with them.\u201d   Apple : Cicilline has indicated his questioning of Cook will focus on Apple\u2019s App Store and allegations that the company buries apps that could displace its own products.   \u201cBecause of the market power that Apple has, it is charging exorbitant rents \u2014 highway robbery, basically \u2014 bullying people to pay 30 percent or denying access to their market,\u201d the Rhode Island lawmaker said on a podcast with The Verge last month.   Facebook: The company\u2019s acquisitions of Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014 are likely to feature heavily in Wednesday\u2019s testimony.   The company claims that concerns about dominating social media because of those purchases are overblown, emphasizing that the two platforms were not that big before being purchased by Facebook and that it still has to compete with apps like TikTok. Zuckerberg will likely point out that his company\u2019s purchase of Instagram and WhatsApp were approved by federal regulators at the time.   Another concern is how Facebook treats data collected by its different apps. Germany\u2019s top court ruled last month that the social media giant illegally combined data it collected about users across different platforms it owns.   Google: The biggest competition concerns with Google are tied to its dominance in search and the ad tech market.   The company has been accused of self-preferencing in search results, burying vertical search competitors far down the page. The European Commission fined Google $2.7 billion in 2017 for boosting its own shopping results over competing services.   Google has strengthened its position in the ad tech space in recent years with acquisitions of companies like DoubleClick and AdMob that give it dominance in nearly every step of the online advertising chain.   Read more about the historic hearing .   ZUCKERBERG PREVIEW:   Facebook CEO  Mark Zuckerberg  will describe his company as being \"proudly American\" while warning about China's model for the internet during his testimony before Congress, according to a copy of his opening remarks reviewed by The Hill Tuesday.   Zuckerberg, along with the chief executives of Amazon, Apple and Google, are set to testify before the House Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust Wednesday as part of the group's investigation into competition in the digital marketplace.   In his opening remarks, Facebook's CEO will emphasize that the company continues to grow because of competition. He will also argue that the platform is founded on American values.   \u201cAlthough people around the world use our products, Facebook is a proudly American company. We believe in values \u2014 democracy, competition, inclusion and free expression \u2014 that the American economy was built on,\" Zuckerberg is set to say.   \"Many other tech companies share these values, but there\u2019s no guarantee our values will win out.\"   Read more about Zuckerberg's testimony here .   ELECTION FUNDS A NO SHOW: Senate Republicans left out funding for mail-in and early voting during the COVID-19 pandemic in their stimulus bill rolled out Monday, prompting backlash from Democrats, election officials and advocacy groups.    With less than 100 days to go before Election Day, these officials are concerned that without a new injection of federal funds, state and local officials facing budget shortfalls may struggle to carry out safe and secure elections that ensure every American can vote.    The concerns come as the pandemic has upended the primary process, leading most states to postpone their contests, while results in a handful, including New York, have been delayed by a surge in mailed-in ballots.   \u201cThis isn\u2019t in anyone\u2019s budget, no one budgeted for a pandemic, and you can see state and local budgets are cratering, they don\u2019t have funding to put into this, and certainly it\u2019s going to be a challenge,\u201d Election Assistance Commission (EAC) Chairman Benjamin Hovland, who was nominated by President Trump , told The Hill Tuesday.    The roughly $1 trillion stimulus proposal, announced by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and other top Republicans, did not include election funds for states, despite months of strong advocacy for the inclusion of these funds.    McConnell said during a press conference that he was concerned that including the funds would \u201cfederalize\u201d elections, adding that Congress had previously appropriated election funds to states in other funding bills.    Congress appropriated $400 million to states as part of the CARES Act stimulus bill signed into law by President Trump in March. These funds were in addition to over $800 million sent to states to boost election security as part of appropriations packages since 2018.    Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.), the chairman of the elections-focused Senate Rules Committee, told The Hill Tuesday that he was \u201copen\u201d to additional election funds being sent to states in the future, but also wanted to examine ways \u201cto increase flexibility for states to use the current funding they have available.\u201d     Read more about the backlash here .   DON JR. SHADOWBANNED?: Twitter temporarily limited Donald Trump Jr.'s account after the president's son shared a video that broke the platform's coronavirus misinformation policies, a spokesperson confirmed to The Hill on Tuesday.   Some functionality \u2014 like being able to tweet or retweet \u2014 will be limited for 12 hours. Trump Jr.  is not suspended from the platform, although his spokesperson claimed otherwise in a statement.   \"Twitter suspending Don Jr. for sharing a viral video of medical professionals discussing their views on Hydroxychloroquine is further proof that Big Tech is intent on killing free expression online and is another instance of them committing election interference to stifle Republican voices,\" Andy Surabian said.   Surabian also said in a tweet that Twitter is playing \"BS word games\" and the limits still amount to a suspension.   The video in question has been taken down for violating Twitter rules.  The video spread like wildfire on social media platforms Monday, racking up millions of views before being taken down.   Read more here .     MORE CONCERNS WITH TIKTOK: A group of Republican senators led by Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) on Tuesday raised concerns that popular social media app TikTok could be used by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) to spread disinformation around U.S. elections.   The GOP lawmakers  wrote to the FBI, the Department of Homeland Security and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence raising concerns that the app could be used by China to interfere in American elections.    \u201cTikTok has become a popular forum for Americans\u2014particularly younger Americans\u2014to engage in political conversations,\u201d Cotton and his colleagues wrote. \u201cI\u2019m greatly concerned that the CCP could use its control over TikTok to distort or manipulate these conversations to sow discord among Americans and to achieve its preferred political outcomes.\u201d   TikTok is owned by Chinese company ByteDance, which is subject to Chinese intelligence laws, an issue that has increasingly led to questions over the security and privacy of American data stored by the app. The company has taken steps to separate itself from China, including hiring an American CEO and moving the storage of American data to the U.S.    But the senators still warned that the CCP could use the app for its purposes, noting that TikTok temporarily locked a teen\u2019s account last year after the individual posted a video critical of the CCP\u2019s treatment of Uighur Muslims.    They asked that the agencies respond to questions around whether TikTok could be subject to sanctions if disinformation efforts are found on its platform, and whether the app could serve as a tool for the CCP to interfere in U.S. elections.    Biden campaign also takes action: Staffers on the presidential campaign of former Vice President Joe Biden were told Tuesday to either delete TikTok from their phones and to not download the app in the future.

Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) introduced legislation Tuesday that would condition legal protections for online platforms that utilize behavioral advertising, the use of browsing habits to serve tailored ads to users.   The Behavioral Advertising Decisions Are Downgrading Services (BAD ADS) Act would take Section 230 protections away from the biggest tech companies that use the advertising method.   Section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act, which has come under increased scrutiny since President Trump targeted it in an executive order in May, gives internet companies immunity from lawsuits for content posted on their sites by third parties and allows them to make \"good faith\" efforts to moderate content.   The law is considered foundational for online companies, and the threat of having it revoked has increasingly been proposed as a cudgel to compel platforms to make changes by lawmakers.   Only companies with either 30 million users in the U.S. or 300 million worldwide and $1.5 billion in global revenue would be affected by Hawley's bill.   \u201cBig Tech\u2019s manipulative advertising regime comes with a massive hidden price tag for consumers while providing almost no return to anyone but themselves,\" Hawley said in a statement.

CYBERSECURITY GETS A BOOST: The coronavirus relief package rolled out by Senate Republicans on Monday includes $53 million for the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) to defend coronavirus vaccine development against malicious hackers.   According to a summary of the roughly $1 trillion bill from the Senate Appropriations Committee, the funds for CISA were included in an effort to \u201cremediate vulnerabilities and enhance Federal network security as a result of increased attacks targeting Federal networks for agencies involved in coronavirus vaccine development.\u201d   The $53 million is a marked increase from the $9.1 million given to CISA in the CARES Act stimulus bill signed into law by President Trump in March, reflecting the increase in concerns around criminals stepping up cyberattacks during the pandemic.

TRUMP COMMENTS ON Q: President Trump on Wednesday offered measured praise for followers of the QAnon conspiracy theory, saying he's not very familiar with the movement but that he believes its subscribers \"love our country.\"   In his most extensive comments about the conspiracy theory to date, Trump repeatedly said he was not well versed in QAnon, but painted its supporters in a positive light.   \"I don\u2019t know much about the movement other than I understand they like me very much, which I appreciate. But I don\u2019t know much about the movement,\" he said at a press briefing.   \"These are people that don\u2019t like seeing what\u2019s going on in places like Portland and places like Chicago and other cities and states,\" Trump said, mischaracterizing what the conspiracy theory focuses on. \"I\u2019ve heard these are people that love our country and they just don't like seeing it. I don\u2019t know really anything about it other than they do supposedly like me. And they also would like to see problems in these areas \u2026 go away.\"   A reporter attempted to explain to the president that QAnon is a conspiracy theory that posits that Trump and his allies are working together to expose and arrest an underground cabal of global elites who control the government and run child sex trafficking rings.   \"Well, I haven't heard that, but is that supposed to be a bad thing or a good thing?\" Trump replied. \"If I can help save the world from problems, I'm willing to do it. I'm willing to put myself out there.\"   The conspiracy theory has been blamed for violent incidents, and social media platforms such as Twitter and Facebook have taken action in recent weeks to suspend groups and accounts associated with it.   Trump was also asked whether he supported the conspiracy last week but dodged the question. White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany told reporters earlier Wednesday that she'd never heard Trump discuss QAnon.   The once-fringe movement has grown dramatically in the last few years, with estimates putting its adherents in the hundreds of thousands.   That expansion has been enough to have the FBI label the loose community of believers as a domestic terror threat last year.   The theory has also entered the mainstream political space, with multiple Republican congressional candidates expressing support for it before winning GOP primaries this year.   One in particular \u2014 Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia \u2014 has been praised effusively by Trump despite her support of QAnon and history of racist and anti-Semitic comments. Greene is favored to win her general election in the fall.   Although Trump has never offered a full-throated endorsement of the theory, he has not condemned it either, despite opportunities to do so, and has boosted many of its followers.   Trump has retweeted QAnon-affiliated accounts dozens of times, while former members of his administration, such as ex-national security adviser Michael Flynn, have publicly embraced the theory.

SO DOES Liz Cheney : House Republican Conference Chairwoman Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) denounced the far-right QAnon conspiracy theory as a \u201cdangerous lunacy,\u201d becoming the highest-ranking GOP lawmaker to condemn it.   \u201cQAnon is a dangerous lunacy that should have no place in American politics,\u201d Cheney said in a statement on Thursday.   Cheney\u2019s comment came one day after President Trump told reporters that he doesn\u2019t \u201cknow much about the movement other than I understand they like me very much, which I appreciate.\u201d   Cheney, the No. 3 Republican in the House, has previously clashed with Trump on a host of issues, causing high-profile public breaks with the president.

UBER, LYFT GET TEMPORARY WIN: An appeals court on Thursday granted Uber and Lyft's requests to delay an injunction requiring the ride-hailing giants to classify their drivers as employees while the case is being considered.   The decision to grant the emergency stay comes the same day that both companies were set to be required to comply with Assembly Bill 5, a landmark law that establishes a test for determining whether workers can be classified as independent contractors rather than employees.   As full employees, drivers would get basic worker protections like a minimum wage and the right to organize.   Lyft announced before the appeals court decision that it would be suspending service in California at midnight. It reversed its decision to suspend operations shortly after the stay was granted.   \u201cWhile we won\u2019t have to suspend operations tonight, we do need to continue fighting for independence plus benefits for drivers,\" a spokesperson for the company told The Hill.   Uber's CEO Dara Khosrowshahi had also threatened to suspend ride-hailing operations in the state, but no official announcement has been made.    A spokesperson for the company confirmed that service will no longer be cut off after the decision.   \u201cWe are glad that the Court of Appeals recognized the important questions raised in this case, and that access to these critical services won\u2019t be cut off while we continue to advocate for drivers\u2019 ability to work with the freedom they want,\" they told The Hill.   San Francisco Superior Court Judge Ethan Schulman had ruled last week that Uber and Lyft must classify their drivers as full employees under the new bill, giving the companies 10 days to file an appeal.   That injunction will now be put on hold until the case is resolved in the appellate court, granted both companies agree to the conditions of the case.   Read more.   FORMER UBER EXEC INDICTED: The Justice Department (DOJ) has filed charges against Uber\u2019s former security chief for allegedly attempting to conceal a 2016 hack that exposed the email addresses and phone numbers of 57 million drivers and passengers.   Prosecutors accuse Joseph Sullivan, who was Uber\u2019s chief security officer from April 2015-November 2017, of not disclosing the 2016 hacking incident to federal investigators who were looking into another data breach that had occurred two years earlier.   In 2016 hackers obtained access to Uber\u2019s user data and asked for a six-figure ransom. Sullivan and other Uber executives allegedly negotiated a $100,000 bitcoin payment in December 2016 and asked the hackers to sign nondisclosure agreements.   The complaint claims Sullivan took deliberate steps to conceal, deflect and mislead the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) about the breach while they were investigating the earlier data breach. He allegedly lied to prosecutors and other top Uber employees tasked with communicating with the FTC as well.    \u201cSilicon Valley is not the Wild West,\u201d said U.S. Attorney David Anderson in a statement. \u201cWe expect good corporate citizenship. We expect prompt reporting of criminal conduct. We expect cooperation with our investigations. We will not tolerate corporate cover-ups. We will not tolerate illegal hush money payments.\u201d   If found guilty, Sullivan faces up to eight years in prison, as well as potential fines of up to $500,000.   In a statement to The Hill, Sullivan\u2019s attorney, Bradford Williams, denied any wrongdoing.   Read more.   SUSAN RICE CRIES RUSSIA: Former national security adviser Susan Rice said Thursday that she is \u201c100 percent convinced\u201d that Russian adversaries will seek to interfere in U.S. elections this year.    \u201cI almost never say this, but [I am] 100 percent convinced that Russia is doing much of what it did in 2016 and certainly more,\u201d Rice, who also previously served as the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, said during a virtual event hosted by The Washington Post.    Rice pointed to recent statements by a top official at the Office of the Director of National Intelligence that acknowledged efforts by Russia, China and Iran to interfere in U.S. elections this year, with Russia\u2019s efforts meant to promote President Trump, and China's and Iran\u2019s efforts aimed at defeating Trump.    Rice emphasized that Russia\u2019s election interference activities were at \u201ca completely different scale\u201d than China's or Iran\u2019s efforts, and described a previous national intelligence statement on election security concerns as being \u201cmuddled\u201d and trying to \u201cconflate what China and Iran might be doing\u201d with Russian interference efforts.   \u201cWe need to be worried not only about Russian disinformation \u2014 its activity on social media which is constant, aimed at misleading and dividing and instilling fear and hatred between and among Americans \u2014 but we need to be concerned also about what efforts it might make again to infiltrate our voting systems, and corrupt either our voting rolls or even potentially the voting count itself,\u201d Rice said.    \u201cThat\u2019s very hard to do, and hopefully in the intervening years, even more steps have been taken to harden our system, I believe in many cases that\u2019s the case, but I also think the Russians aren\u2019t going to stop trying,\u201d Rice added.

The company said in a press release that it decided to implement the changes to provide a level of cohesion for rental properties amid varying COVID-19 health and safety measures depending on the state and city.   \"[I]n many large jurisdictions, public health mandates on gatherings have changed \u2013 and in some places swung back and forth in response to the changing rates of COVID cases \u2013 as have regulations on bars, clubs and pubs,\" the company said in the statement.   \"Some have chosen to take bar and club behavior to homes, sometimes rented through our platform,\" the statement continued. \"We think such conduct is incredibly irresponsible \u2013 we do not want that type of business, and anyone engaged in or allowing that behavior does not belong on our platform.\"   Airbnb noted that it previously changed company policy regarding parties and gatherings last year when it started a global ban on \"party houses,\" citing residences that were leased out specifically for hosting events.   \"We've historically allowed hosts to use their best judgment and authorize small parties \u2013 such as baby showers or birthday parties \u2013 if they're appropriate for their home and their neighborhood,\" the statement said.

Since that bandwidth is currently used by cable operators and broadcasters to get networks from programmers to their viewers and content from remote locations to studios, it must also do so while protecting that programming from interference.</p><p>One big issue is whether to have the FCC auction the spectrum, or to let the international satellite services companies that control the licenses strike marketplace deals with wireless carriers.</p><p>The first would put more money into the Treasury, money that could go for deploying rural broadband. Backers of that approach say that should be a priority if one of the avowed goals of freeing up spectrum for 5G (and it is) is closing the rural digital divide. The second could possibly speed the spectrum to market.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Big Tech Backs Auction</emphasis></p><p>High-tech companies, public-interest groups and others favor an FCC auction over private-market deals for the spectrum, valued at between $10 billion and $30 billion, they noted.</p><p>The tech-backed Open Technology Institute (OTI) has said the FCC doesn't have the authority to approve a private auction of the spectrum anyway, so the point should be moot.</p><p>\"The FCC lacks legal authority to allow a private auction and windfall to satellite companies that never paid for spectrum,\" said Michael Calabrese, director of the Wireless Future Program at OTI, part of a coalition pushing for the FCC auction.</p><p>But supporters of a marketplace approach, including the C-Band Alliance of satellite carriers that would strike those deals, have said the FCC can and should let the marketplace decide, as it were. They argue an auction would take years to get the spectrum to wireless carriers, while they could get the process going within months.</p><p>Rep. Doris Matsui (D-Calif.), co-chair of the Congressional Spectrum Caucus, has released a draft bill that would have the FCC auction the spectrum, but with tweaks to try and please both sides.</p><p>There has been some hesitancy to engage the issue on the Hill and Matsui is hoping to change that with a discussion draft that she hopes could gain some industry traction and then more Hill support.</p><p>Broadcasters could be a harder group to publicly get on board. They are happy with the possibility of their own payout and the bill's language about doing no harm to incumbents, but to the degree that it incen-tivizes more spectrum to be cleared more quickly, that raises fears about interference - always a big issue with stations.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Matsui Floats a Compromise</emphasis></p><p>Matsui's Wireless Investment Now in (WIN) 5G Act would have the FCC auction the spectrum, but put it on the clock.</p><p>Satellite operators would receive an escalating cut of the auction proceeds based on how much of the spectrum could be freed up. (See box.)</p><p>The plan would cover the transition costs of incumbent cable operators and broadcasters, plus at least potentially give them a cut of the auction proceeds above those transition costs, with the remainder of the auction proceeds going to a new rural broadband fund.</p><p>The bill tries to incentivize freeing up as much spectrum as possible. Not only does it not cap the amount of spectrum freed up at 200 MHz, as satellite carriers have proposed, it requires the parties to free up as much spectrum as practicable, including all if that were possible. But it also says that the amount cleared is limited to what will do no harm to incumbent users.</p><p>Satellite operators' cut of the auction proceeds would increase as the more spectrum that could be freed up.</p><p>The bill would also free up more funds for R&amp;D into federal spectrum repurposing, including agencies operating on the 3.45-3.55 GHz band. If that band can be repurposed, the bill directs the FCC to auction it by 2025 and reallocate it for commercial use by 2026.</p><p>Instead, smaller, independent cable operators (ACA Connects) and competitive carriers (the Competitive Carriers Association) have joined with Charter Communications to offer up their own proposal for clearing a bunch - 370 MHz at least - of C-band spectrum.</p><p>The proposal:</p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>\"Frees up at least 370 MHz (and likely more) of the C-band spectrum on a nationwide basis and on an expedited time frame;</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>\"Makes whole all incumbents - including the satellite industry, its customers, and earth station users - and provides all of these stakeholders with long-term certain protection for existing services;</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>\"Contributes to the goal of building fiber to provide highspeed broadband in unserved or underserved rural areas;</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>\"Ensures a transparent FCC-led auction that will ensure the public receives all spectrum sale proceeds (expected to be in the billions) beyond what is required to reimburse costs and incentivize current users;

A couple of months ago, the big consumer tech company launched what seemed to be a very clever marketing gimmick - an Apple-branded credit card that could be used only in conjunction with its iPhones and its Apple Pay service.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It seemed a foolproof way to beef up purchases of iPhones and enrollment in Apple Pay.</p><p>But now comes the backfire. Several Apple Card customers - including, most embarrassingly, Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak - have complained publicly that the credit limits set for the card seem to discriminate against women, even when their finances are jointly held with their spouses.</p><p>And there seems to be no one to talk to for an appeal. Not at Apple, nor at Goldman Sachs, the giant investment bank that is actually running the card for Apple.</p><p>Wozniak, who is no longer associated with Apple management, tweeted that he was granted a credit limit 10 times the size of his wife's. \"We have no separate bank or credit card accounts or any separate assets,\" he stated. \"Hard to get to a human for a correction though. It's big tech in 2019.\"</p><p>New York State financial regulators are now looking into the situation. Linda Lacewell, superintendent of the state's Department of Financial Services, dismissed out of hand Goldman Sachs's defense that the credit limits are scored by an algorithm that scores individual creditworthiness.</p><p>\"New York law prohibits discrimination against protected classes of individuals, which means an algorithm, as with any other method of determining creditworthiness, cannot result in disparate treatment for individuals based on age, creed, race, color, sex, sexual orientation, national origin, or other protected characteristics,\" Lacewell stated in a post on Medium.</p><p>The controversy over the card took flight last Thursday, when a software entrepreneur named David Hanson tweeted that the card was a \"sexist program.\" He described its rather more profanely, which is why his tweet can't be published here. But it went on to specify that \"my wife and I filed joint tax returns, live in a community-property state, and have been married for a long time. Yet Apple's black box algorithm thinks I deserve 20x the credit limit she does. No appeals work.\"</p><p>Others chimed in on Hanson's Twitter thread, notably Wozniak.</p><p>What may be worst for Apple is that the blowup has exposed the truth about the Apple Card: First and foremost, this isn't an \"Apple\" card. Under the hood, it's a Goldman Sachs card, with Apple branding. Goldman Sachs is responsible for establishing the credit lines for individual applicants and provides the \"credit platform\" backing the card - in other words, it's backed by Goldman's money.</p><p>The product has a couple of tweaks, though not all are entirely novel.</p><p>There's no annual fee, which is hardly unique in the credit card world. It offers rebates on purchases - 3% on Apple products and those at merchants such as T-Mobile that have made deals with Apple, 2% on anything bought with Apple Pay, 1% on everything else. That's also not novel.</p><p>If you miss a payment, Apple won't charge a late fee, though interest will still accrue. That's good, but the interest on unpaid balances ranges from 12.74% to 23.74%, based on users' credit history, which is no particular bargain. Apple Card also comes with privacy and security enhancements tied to your iPhone.</p><p>Indeed, the requirement that each Apple Card user have an individual iPhone and therefore an individual account is what's gotten Apple into trouble. Most traditional credit card accounts allow for multiple \"authorized users,\" typically family members, to share an account and piggyback on each other's credit ratings.</p><p>Not the Apple Card.</p><p>Apple refers all questions about these issues to Goldman, which told me by email: \"We look at ... factors like personal credit scores, how much debt you have, and how that debt has been managed.

A couple of months ago, the big consumer tech company launched what seemed to be a very clever marketing gimmick - an Apple-branded credit card that could be used only in conjunction with its iPhones and its Apple Pay service.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It seemed a foolproof way to beef up purchases of iPhones and enrollment in Apple Pay.</p><p>But now comes the backfire. Several Apple Card customers - including, most embarrassingly, Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak - have complained publicly that the credit limits set for the card seem to discriminate against women, even when their finances are jointly held with their spouses.</p><p>And there seems to be no one to talk to for an appeal. Not at Apple, nor at Goldman Sachs, the giant investment bank that is actually running the card for Apple.</p><p>Wozniak, who is no longer associated with Apple management, tweeted that he was granted a credit limit 10 times the size of his wife's. \"We have no separate bank or credit card accounts or any separate assets,\" he stated. \"Hard to get to a human for a correction though. It's big tech in 2019.\"</p><p>New York State financial regulators are now looking into the situation. Linda Lacewell, superintendent of the state's Department of Financial Services, dismissed out of hand Goldman Sachs's defense that the credit limits are scored by an algorithm that scores individual creditworthiness.</p><p>\"New York law prohibits discrimination against protected classes of individuals, which means an algorithm, as with any other method of determining creditworthiness, cannot result in disparate treatment for individuals based on age, creed, race, color, sex, sexual orientation, national origin, or other protected characteristics,\" Lacewell stated in a post on Medium.</p><p>The controversy over the card took flight last Thursday, when a software entrepreneur named David Hanson tweeted that the card was a \"sexist program.\" He described its rather more profanely, which is why his tweet can't be published here. But it went on to specify that \"my wife and I filed joint tax returns, live in a community-property state, and have been married for a long time. Yet Apple's black box algorithm thinks I deserve 20x the credit limit she does. No appeals work.\"</p><p>Others chimed in on Hanson's Twitter thread, notably Wozniak.</p><p>What may be worst for Apple is that the blowup has exposed the truth about the Apple Card: First and foremost, this isn't an \"Apple\" card. Under the hood, it's a Goldman Sachs card, with Apple branding. Goldman Sachs is responsible for establishing the credit lines for individual applicants and provides the \"credit platform\" backing the card - in other words, it's backed by Goldman's money.</p><p>The product has a couple of tweaks, though not all are entirely novel.</p><p>There's no annual fee, which is hardly unique in the credit card world. It offers rebates on purchases - 3% on Apple products and those at merchants such as T-Mobile that have made deals with Apple, 2% on anything bought with Apple Pay, 1% on everything else. That's also not novel.</p><p>If you miss a payment, Apple won't charge a late fee, though interest will still accrue. That's good, but the interest on unpaid balances ranges from 12.74% to 23.74%, based on users' credit history, which is no particular bargain. Apple Card also comes with privacy and security enhancements tied to your iPhone.</p><p>Indeed, the requirement that each Apple Card user have an individual iPhone and therefore an individual account is what's gotten Apple into trouble. Most traditional credit card accounts allow for multiple \"authorized users,\" typically family members, to share an account and piggyback on each other's credit ratings.</p><p>Not the Apple Card.</p><p>Apple refers all questions about these issues to Goldman, which told me by email: \"We look at ... factors like personal credit scores, how much debt you have, and how that debt has been managed. Based on these factors, it is possible for two family members to receive significantly different credit decisions.\"</p><p>Goldman specifically says \"in all cases, we have not and will not make decisions based on factors like gender.\"</p><p>Yet applicants really have no clue to what factors Goldman actually uses to assess their creditworthiness or how it weighs those factors. The weighing is placed in the hands of the all-powerful algorithm, which doesn't seem amenable to appeal.</p><p>Outsourcing potentially discriminatory judgments to a machine won't excuse its human developers, Lacewell warned. \"Financial service companies are responsible for ensuring the algorithms they use do not even unintentionally discriminate against protected groups.\"</p><p>In other words, Apple and Goldman Sachs may have just discovered the limits of technology.</p><p>Michael A.

Looming over the tech industry is the possibility of government regulation intended to protect people's data and a deeper look into whether gigantic companies like Google, Amazon and Facebook need to be broken up.</p><p>Pichai's appearance comes after he angered members of a Senate panel in September by declining their invitation to testify about election manipulation. Pichai's no-show at that hearing was marked by an empty chair for Google alongside the Facebook and Twitter executives who did appear.</p><p>Pichai went to Washington later in September to mend fences, meeting with some two dozen Republicans and indicating he also planned to meet with Democrats. He took part in last week's White House meeting with other tech executives on getting government and businesses working more closely on accelerating emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence.</p><p>Pichai reiterated Google's position that it has no plans \"right now\" to reenter China with a search engine generating censored results to comply with the demands of that country's Communist government. If that changes, Pichai promised to be \"fully transparent\" about the move. Pichai has said that he wants Google to be in China serving Chinese users.</p><p>The CEO also insisted that Google's search engine is not biased against any political viewpoint. U.S. President Donald Trump has accused Google of rigging search results to suppress conservative viewpoints and highlight coverage from media that he says distribute \"fake news.\" The company has denied any such bias, and while the question has dogged tech companies for years, there's no evidence of an anti-conservative or any other political tilt.</p><p>Nadler called the notion of bias a \"delusion\" and a \"right-wing conspiracy theory.\" The New York Democrat said Tuesday's hearing was the committee's fourth to address the topic - and he suggested he'd move on to other topics as Democrats take control.</p><p>House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., kicked off the hearing by noting a \"widening gap of distrust\" between tech companies and the American people.</p><p>Asked for yes-or-no answers on what information the company collects, Pichai demurred and attempted to convey that things are more complicated, with varying degrees of success.</p><p>Momentum is building in Congress for legislation to put stricter limits and privacy protections around the big tech companies'collection of data. Rep. Ted Poe, R-Texas, tried to pin down Pichai concretely on privacy. \"I've got an iPhone,\" Poe said, waving his device. \"Can Google track me when I move?\" If he moved to the left toward his Democratic colleagues on the panel, would Google know? \"Not by default,\" Pichai answered.</p><p>Poe demanded a yes or no answer, but Pichai indicated it was complicated.</p><p>Trump and some lawmakers have raised the possibility of asking regulators to investigate whether Google -which handles nearly two of every three online searches in the U.S.- has abused its clout as a major gateway to the internet to stifle competition.</p><p>Responding to a question about Google's search dominance, Pichai pointed to Amazon's dominance in online shopping.</p><p>Pichai, a former engineer, took the helm of Google in 2015 in a major restructuring that made Google a division of conglomerate Alphabet Inc. - whose businesses include Waymo, a self-driving technology development company. Bolstering the dominance of its search engine, Google's Android operating system runs most of the world's smartphones, and its other services - including Gmail, YouTube, online ads and the Chrome web browser - are widely used. !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2018 Osprey Media Group Inc.

Looming over the tech industry is the possibility of government regulation intended to protect people's data and a deeper look into whether gigantic companies like Google, Amazon and Facebook need to be broken up.</p><p>Pichai's appearance comes after he angered members of a Senate panel in September by declining their invitation to testify about election manipulation. Pichai's no-show at that hearing was marked by an empty chair for Google alongside the Facebook and Twitter executives who did appear.</p><p>Pichai went to Washington later in September to mend fences, meeting with some two dozen Republicans and indicating he also planned to meet with Democrats. He took part in last week's White House meeting with other tech executives on getting government and businesses working more closely on accelerating emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence.</p><p>Pichai reiterated Google's position that it has no plans \"right now\" to re-enter China with a search engine generating censored results to comply with the demands of that country's Communist government. If that changes, Pichai promised to be \"fully transparent\" about the move. Pichai has said that he wants Google to be in China serving Chinese users.</p><p>The CEO also insisted that Google's search engine is not biased against any political viewpoint. U.S. President Donald Trump has accused Google of rigging search results to suppress conservative viewpoints and highlight coverage from media that he says distribute \"fake news.\" The company has denied any such bias, and while the question has dogged tech companies for years, there's no evidence of an anti-conservative or any other political tilt.</p><p>Nadler called the notion of bias a \"delusion\" and a \"right-wing conspiracy theory.\" The New York Democrat said Tuesday's hearing was the committee's fourth to address the topic - and he suggested he'd move on to other topics as Democrats take control.</p><p>House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., kicked off the hearing by noting a \"widening gap of distrust\" between tech companies and the American people.</p><p>Asked for yes-or-no answers on what information the company collects, Pichai demurred and attempted to convey that things are more complicated, with varying degrees of success.</p><p>Momentum is building in Congress for legislation to put stricter limits and privacy protections around the big tech companies'collection of data. Rep. Ted Poe, R-Texas, tried to pin down Pichai concretely on privacy. \"I've got an iPhone,\" Poe said, waving his device. \"Can Google track me when I move?\" If he moved to the left toward his Democratic colleagues on the panel, would Google know? \"Not by default,\" Pichai answered.</p><p>Poe demanded a yes or no answer, but Pichai indicated it was complicated.</p><p>Trump and some lawmakers have raised the possibility of asking regulators to investigate whether Google -which handles nearly two of every three online searches in the U.S.- has abused its clout as a major gateway to the internet to stifle competition.</p><p>Responding to a question about Google's search dominance, Pichai pointed to Amazon's dominance in online shopping.</p><p>Pichai, a former engineer, took the helm of Google in 2015 in a major restructuring that made Google a division of conglomerate Alphabet Inc. - whose businesses include Waymo, a self-driving technology development company. Bolstering the dominance of its search engine, Google's Android operating system runs most of the world's smartphones, and its other services - including Gmail, YouTube, online ads and the Chrome web browser - are widely used. !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2018 Osprey Media Group Inc.

Looming over the tech industry is the possibility of government regulation intended to protect people's data and a deeper look into whether gigantic companies like Google, Amazon and Facebook need to be broken up.</p><p>Pichai's first appearance ever before Congress comes after he angered members of a Senate panel in September by declining their invitation to testify about election manipulation. Pichai's no-show at that hearing was marked by an empty chair for Google alongside the Facebook and Twitter executives who did appear. Lawmakers declined Google's offer to send lower-level executives.</p><p>Pichai went to Washington later in September to mend fences, meeting with some two dozen Republicans and indicating he also planned to meet with Democrats. He took part in last week's White House meeting with other tech executives on getting government and businesses working more closely on accelerating emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence.</p><p>Pichai reiterated Google's position that it has no plans \"right now\" to re-enter China with a search engine generating censored results to comply with the demands of that country's Communist government. If that changes, Pichai promised to be \"fully transparent\" about the move. Pichai has said that he wants Google to be in China serving Chinese users.</p><p>The CEO also insisted that Google's search engine is not biased against any political viewpoint.</p><p>President Donald Trump has accused Google of rigging search results to suppress conservative viewpoints and highlight coverage from media that he says distribute \"fake news.\" The company has denied any such bias, and while the question has dogged tech companies for years, there's no evidence of an anti-conservative or any other political tilt.</p><p>Nadler called the notion of bias a \"delusion\" and a \"right-wing conspiracy theory.\" The New York Democrat said Tuesday's hearing was the committee's fourth to address the topic - and he suggested he'd move on to other topics as Democrats take control.</p><p>House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., kicked off the hearing by noting a \"widening gap of distrust\" between tech companies and the American people.</p><p>Asked for yes-or-no answers on what information the company collects, Pichai demurred and attempted to convey that things are more complicated, with varying degrees of success.</p><p>Momentum is building in Congress for legislation to put stricter limits and privacy protections around the big tech companies' collection of data.</p><p>Rep. Ted Poe, R-Texas, tried to pin down Pichai concretely on privacy. \"I've got an iPhone,\" Poe said, waving his device. \"Can Google track me when I move?\" If he moved to the left toward his Democratic colleagues on the panel, would Google know?</p><p>\"Not by default,\" Pichai answered. Poe demanded a yes or no answer, but Pichai indicated it was complicated.</p><p>Trump and some lawmakers have raised the possibility of asking regulators to investigate whether Google -which handles nearly two of every three online searches in the U.S.- has abused its clout as a major gateway to the internet to stifle competition.</p><p>Responding to a question about Google's search dominance, Pichai pointed to Amazon's dominance in online shopping.</p><p>Pichai, a former engineer, took the helm of Google in 2015 in a major restructuring that made Google a division of conglomerate Alphabet Inc. - whose businesses include Waymo, a self-driving technology development company. Bolstering the dominance of its search engine, Google's Android operating system runs most of the world's smartphones, and its other services - including Gmail, YouTube, online ads and the Chrome web browser - are widely used.</p><p>__</p><p>Ortutay reported from New York.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">APSTE-2cbcfb81ace444ef9f4f5480793d299d</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">APST2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TY5-41J1-JC65-53F0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">304481</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-12-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"706\"/><timeReceived>9:23 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Associated Press State &amp;

Looming over the tech industry is the possibility of government regulation intended to protect people's data and a deeper look into whether gigantic companies like Google, Amazon and Facebook need to be broken up.</p><p>Pichai's first appearance ever before Congress comes after he angered members of a Senate panel in September by declining their invitation to testify about election manipulation. Pichai's no-show at that hearing was marked by an empty chair for Google alongside the Facebook and Twitter executives who did appear. Lawmakers declined Google's offer to send lower-level executives.</p><p>Pichai went to Washington later in September to mend fences, meeting with some two dozen Republicans and indicating he also planned to meet with Democrats. He took part in last week's White House meeting with other tech executives on getting government and businesses working more closely on accelerating emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence.</p><p>Pichai reiterated Google's position that it has no plans \"right now\" to re-enter China with a search engine generating censored results to comply with the demands of that country's Communist government. If that changes, Pichai promised to be \"fully transparent\" about the move. Pichai has said that he wants Google to be in China serving Chinese users.</p><p>The CEO also insisted that Google's search engine is not biased against any political viewpoint.</p><p>President Donald Trump has accused Google of rigging search results to suppress conservative viewpoints and highlight coverage from media that he says distribute \"fake news.\" The company has denied any such bias, and while the question has dogged tech companies for years, there's no evidence of an anti-conservative or any other political tilt.</p><p>Nadler called the notion of bias a \"delusion\" and a \"right-wing conspiracy theory.\" The New York Democrat said Tuesday's hearing was the committee's fourth to address the topic - and he suggested he'd move on to other topics as Democrats take control.</p><p>House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., kicked off the hearing by noting a \"widening gap of distrust\" between tech companies and the American people.</p><p>Asked for yes-or-no answers on what information the company collects, Pichai demurred and attempted to convey that things are more complicated, with varying degrees of success.</p><p>Momentum is building in Congress for legislation to put stricter limits and privacy protections around the big tech companies' collection of data.</p><p>Rep. Ted Poe, R-Texas, tried to pin down Pichai concretely on privacy. \"I've got an iPhone,\" Poe said, waving his device. \"Can Google track me when I move?\" If he moved to the left toward his Democratic colleagues on the panel, would Google know?</p><p>\"Not by default,\" Pichai answered. Poe demanded a yes or no answer, but Pichai indicated it was complicated.</p><p>Trump and some lawmakers have raised the possibility of asking regulators to investigate whether Google -which handles nearly two of every three online searches in the U.S.- has abused its clout as a major gateway to the internet to stifle competition.</p><p>Responding to a question about Google's search dominance, Pichai pointed to Amazon's dominance in online shopping.</p><p>Pichai, a former engineer, took the helm of Google in 2015 in a major restructuring that made Google a division of conglomerate Alphabet Inc. - whose businesses include Waymo, a self-driving technology development company. Bolstering the dominance of its search engine, Google's Android operating system runs most of the world's smartphones, and its other services - including Gmail, YouTube, online ads and the Chrome web browser - are widely used.</p><p>__</p><p>Ortutay reported from New York.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">APE-2cbcfb81ace444ef9f4f5480793d299d</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AP2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TY5-3X21-DYN6-W4P0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">304478</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"706\"/><timeReceived>9:23 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Associated Press</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"12\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>December 11, 2018 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

This hearing had its genesis in a 2017 Yale Law Journal article[1] by Lina Khan, which gave rise to what became known informally as the 'hipster antitrust' movement.(Not coincidentally, Khan is advising Rep. David Cicilline, the chairman of the Antitrust Subcommittee, and she sat near him during the hearing.)Since the Reagan administration, the development of antitrust law has focused on consumer welfare - typically indicated by low prices - to determine whether competition had been harmed unlawfully.This development was based on then-professor (and later judge) Robert Bork's influential book, The Antitrust Paradox[2], and the libertarian 'Chicago school' of economics. </p><p>If prices stay low and customers are happy, then courts are typically reluctant to find any antitrust violation.If the complaining party was a competitor whose business was harmed, it is often met with the response that the antitrust laws exist to protect competition, not individual competitors.More recently, scholars such as Khan have argued that this historical view is too narrow, and they advocate for a broader focus on market structure and the power and influence large tech companies wield.They argue that, rather than merely analyzing whether corporate actions result in lower consumer prices, the law should recognize that the excessive concentration of economic power in a handful of large companies is inherently bad, because it exacerbates other ills, such as income inequality and labor abuses, and gives undue political influence to too few people. Khan's article was specifically about Amazon, a company that famously offers low prices on a wide variety of consumer goods and that has for the most part been well-liked by customers, but which, she argued, exerts a dangerous amount of power to effectively control the online retail economy.The view that companies should not be too big or too powerful is not new; the 'hipster' label is a pejorative term based on the movement's embrace of the views of older scholars, most notably Justice Louis Brandeis, who wrote in the 1930s about the 'curse of bigness.' However, this view is not currently the law. No major antitrust opinions or government enforcement actions this century have been based on the notion that antitrust law prohibits mere 'bigness.'At this point it is impossible to tell whether Congress will actually take any meaningful action to change the law, and the upcoming elections could impact political appetites to make such a change.At various points the 'Big Tech' hearing devolved into political venting and grandstanding, with several representatives routinely interrupting the CEOs' answers to make their own scripted pronouncements. But the hearing was nonetheless a shot across the bow of those firms, signaling that they are being scrutinized more closely than they previously realized.(This may or may not cause those firms to voluntarily alter their practices.) There does appear to be considerable sentiment among both liberals and conservatives that something should be done to check the power of these large companies, and representatives on both sides of the aisle remarked that this was an issue that had unusually high bipartisan support.It is unlikely that companies such as Google or Facebook would be 'broken up' entirely, in part because, despite their faults, they are so popular among their users.But it is possible that certain aspects of their businesses could be spun off or regulated.Congressional action, if any, could take several forms.One possibility is legislation to supplement or amend the existing federal antitrust laws.For example, prior to 2004, some courts recognized 'monopoly leveraging' - i.e., using lawfully obtained monopoly power in one market to confer a competitive leg up to gain market share in another market - as a basis to establish liability under Section 2 of the Sherman Act, which prohibits unlawful monopolization and attempts to monopolize.The U.S. Supreme Court effectively foreclosed that theory in Verizon Communications v. Trinko[3], and although there is respected economic scholarship to support the court's reasoning, not everyone agrees. Congress theoretically could pass legislation to resurrect the monopoly leveraging theory.This may conceivably prevent a large tech company with a monopoly in one market (say online retail sales or social messaging or mobile phones or online search engines) to obtain significant market power in another market (say consumer data). We could also see legislation aimed at political censorship on social media platforms such as Facebook. These are just a couple of examples that Congress could target with specific legislation.Alternatively, proposed legislation could be vague and generalized, such as providing that courts should consider other indicia of economic power and market dominance besides the ability and willingness to raise consumer prices. In other words, Congress could mandate that courts reject the Bork view and adopt the Brandeis/'hipster' view. This would effectively require courts to start over and figure things out on their own, much as they have done historically based on the rather spare language of the Sherman Act and developments in economic scholarship.Rather than new legislation, there could simply be heightened pressure to enforce existing law to punish perceived violations.Certain alleged practices, such as pricing below cost to drive out a competitor or force it to merge, are covered by existing antitrust law, and the Department of Justice already has the tools to bring legal action to prevent those practices.In sum, it remains to be seen whether anything meaningful comes from the hearing.But it did at least demonstrate the bipartisan support for the so-called 'hipster antitrust' concerns that certain tech companies have gotten too big and too powerful, and that existing antitrust law may not be sufficiently equipped to address those concerns.

The CEOs, Sundar Pichai for Google, Tim Cook from Apple, Jeff Bezos from Amazon and Mark Zuckerberg from Facebook, fielded a wide range of questions from the antitrust bodies.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Representative David N. Cicilline kicked off the hearing saying the panel had conducted a year-long investigation and found that these companies have \"wielded their power in disruptive, harmful ways\", which risk competition and the country's democracy.</p><p>The panel, consisting of representatives from both Republican and Democrat parties, questioned the CEOs on matters ranging from privacy, killing competing startups by either stealing their technology or acquiring them, welding control on the market by abusing the gatekeeper status that some of these platforms hold, and more.</p><p>Internal emails haunted Zuckerberg again when he didn't answer a question about whether Facebook copied its competitors. Representative Pramila Jayapal cited an internal email where Zuckerberg himself told Instagram's co-founder Kevin Systrom that Facebook would build a copycat camera app, during the negotiations with Instagram. Emails were also unearthed where Zuckerberg was found to have aspired to buy Google.</p><p>Amazon was accused of similar behaviour, along with using data about third party sellers from its platform to kill small businesses. In addition, Representative Hank Johnson cited the widespread availability of counterfeit products on Amazon's e-commerce platform, asking Bezos why the company isn't responsible for it.</p><p>Bezos, in turn, said that Congress itself should address this issue, adding that the company itself also takes measures to avoid counterfeit products. \"I would encourage this body to pass stricter penalties for counterfeiters and to increase law enforcement resources to go after counterfeiters,\" he said.</p><p>Further, facing questioning from representative Jamie Raskin, Bezos acknowledged that Amazon does use its platform to promote its own products over rivals that don't have the same features.</p><p>\"I'm sure there are cases where we do promote our own products,\" said Bezos, adding that it's a common practice in business. \"And so it wouldn't surprise me if Alexa sometimes does promote our own products,\" he said, answering a question about its voice assistant recommending Amazon Basics batteries over others.</p><p>Bezos also said that Amazon has policies to prevent the users of seller data to kill sellers, but couldn't confirm that the policies have never been violated. Representative Lucy McBath even played a recording of a bookseller on Amazon, who claimed that Amazon's practices had all but killed her business.</p><p>On the other hand, Apple's Tim Cook was questioned on the 30% commission it charges developers on the App Store for payments. Cook argued that the entry doors to the App Store are wide open and that the 30% commission is much lesser than what developers would pay before the App Store came into being.</p><p>Asked whether he would increase commissions ever, Cook pointed out that the company had never increased commissions since the App Store's launch. He also claimed that competition would keep Apple from doing so in future too.</p><p>For Google, most questions were targeted around its overall dominance over the Internet. The politicians asked Pichai questions about Google's dominance on news and cited data suggesting it has been unfair to news publishers, how it uses user data, and whether it steals data from competing companies and websites.</p><p>Pichai also admitted, during the hearing, that while Google Search is automated, there is a manual component to how the company blacklists a website.</p><p>Additionally, the four CEOs were asked whether they believed that the Chinese government steals tech from US companies. To this, both Pichai and Cook said their companies' data has never been stolen, to their first hand knowledge. However, Zuckerberg said it's \"well documented\" that China steals tech from the US, while Bezos said he has heard reports of it, but hasn't personally seen it. Pichai later added that in 2009 the company had suffered a cyber attack from the country.</p><p>In perhaps the easiest question in the hearing, all four CEOs pledged not to work with companies that use slave labour.</p><p>The four hour long hearing grilled all four companies, and showed that lawmakers were much more ready this time than in earlier hearings with such companies. While the outcome of this hearing will take time to materialise, the questions show a willingness by lawmakers to regulate these platforms. Several representatives on the panel also asked the companies why they shouldn't be broken up, because they're too big.</p><p>\"Today we had the opportunity to hear from four of the most powerful companies in the world. This hearing has made one fact clear to me, these companies as they exist today have monopoly power. Some need to be broken up, all need to be properly regulated and held accountable. We need to ensure that the antitrust laws first written more than a century ago work in the digital age. When these laws were written the monopolists were men named Rockefeller and Carnegie. Their controls of the marketplace allows them to do whatever it took to crush independent businesses and expand their own power. The names have changed, the stories are the same. Today the names are Zuckerberg, Cook, Pichai and Bezos. Once again their control of the marketplace allows them to do whatever it takes to crush independent business and expand their own power. This must end,\" concluded Chairman Cicilline.</p><p>The subcommittee will next publish a report on its findings and suggest solutions to the problems before it, at a later date.</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from MINT.

Good Monday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I'm Maria Bartiromo. And it is Monday, April 13th.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Your top stories right now at 7:00 a.m. on the East Coast on the button.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And historic oil deal has been reached. The United States stepping in to broker a deal resulting in 23 countries, including Saudi Arabia and Russia, agreeing to cut production. A record cut of nearly 10 million-barrels a day, about a tenth of the world's oil supply. Prices of oil this morning are fractionally higher, up 1.5 percent. There is speculation this cut could go even more than 10 percent. We're watching this.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The U.S. now leads the world in coronavirus deaths and confirmed cases but there are still signs the curve is leveling out. And, of course, we do not know the accuracy of China's numbers.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">President Trump saying America is winning the war against the virus. Meanwhile Dr. Anthony Fauci says at least part of the U.S. economy could reopen next month.</p><p>Checks are now getting deposited into Americans' accounts but over at the Capitol, the battle over additional funding for small business rages this morning. Congressional Republican looking to add $251 billion. Democrats looking for more money and a much broader use of that money.</p><p>Meanwhile sources are telling me that the Chinese government is instituting new rules interfering in the production and much-needed export of personal protective equipment to the United States.

More than half a million people do not have power this morning.</p><p>Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi -- all declaring states of emergency today. The storms killing at least eight people including a Mississippi deputy and his wife. In Alabama a woman is rescued after getting trapped in her car. And hundreds of homes are destroyed in Louisiana. Georgia now getting hit with the dangerous track moving north. Severe thunderstorms and strong winds expected to move across the northeast today.</p><p>President Trump delivering a message of hope meanwhile yesterday in his Easter address.

This as the FDA says that the virus is nearing a peak in the United States.</p><p>Over the weekend, the President approved the disaster declaration for Wyoming. This means all 50 states now and territories have received a federal disaster declaration. More than 22,000 people have died in the United States.</p><p>But there is hope as New York sees a slight flattening in new viruses -- new cases of the virus.

It is thanks to that courage, that devotion, that duty and that love that our NHS has been unbeatable.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: We're happy he is feeling better. It is not clear when Johnson will return to work. We will keep covering that, of course.</p><p>Meanwhile breaking news this morning, sources telling me that China is imposing new rules and regulations on a local level on all materials used to make personal protective equipment. You need the approval in order to export any of this.</p><p>The new regulations have resulted in major delays in sending the gear to the United States and across the world.</p><p>Gordon Chang, author of \"The Coming Collapse of China\", with me earlier reacting to the breaking news in the last hour.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GORDON CHANGE, AUTHOR, \"THE COMING COLLAPSE OF CHINA\": You know, Beijing has this constant anti-American propaganda which just even in the best of times exists. And so this is having consequences and it's certainly hurting sales to the United States of this equipment.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Chang is also telling me that Beijing is using its new approval powers to actually divert supplies away from America to countries that it considers friendlier.</p><p>Joe Biden meanwhile accused of sexually assaulting a former aide. Tara Reed was just a Senate staffer for Biden nearly 30 years ago. She is alleging that the assault happened in the basement of a Capitol Hill office building back in 1993.

Lawmakers from both sides of the aisle are devising with new plans to make sure that our workers' paychecks are covered during COVID-19 pandemic. The plans however differing on the level of government and aid involved.</p><p>Joining me right now is Georgia Congressman Doug Collins. And Congressman - - it's always great to see you. Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>REP. DOUG COLLINS (R), GEORGIA: Good morning -- Maria. Good to see you as well.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I know you have been able to secure hydroxychloroquine for the state of Georgia. I want to get to that in a moment.</p><p>But first let's talk about the paycheck program because I've been hearing from a lot of small business, Congressman -- and you know that there has -- it's been a messy start, if you will. And there are some small businesses that are asking, pleading to change the timeline where they can't take the money now to give it out over an eight-week period and then have to only be timed to that eight-week period because that's not going to stop them from going bankrupt because they don't have any demand. They are shut down.</p><p>COLLINS: You're right -- Maria. Maria -- you're right. And what we've got to look at -- President Trump made it very clear and Vice President Pence and the Congress made it very clear that the thing we needed to do was take care of the two parts, the health of our nation and the economy of our nation.</p><p>And by doing so, by putting the priority on making sure that our first responders, doctors and everyone got the help that they needed. Then also putting money in people's paychecks, making sure businesses can keep employees as long as they possibly can.</p><p>And those are the two priorities. And what -- what we're trying to do now is to get more money into that. But what you just talked about is very true. We took a program that was nonexistent a little less than two and a half, 3 weeks ago and started that program.</p><p>And there have been things that we have now found. I mean there's nothing a program this large, you will not find areas in which we need to make flexibility. And what I've been impressed with is the President and his team have tried to make it easy. As we have seen them come up, tried to make these arrangements the Small Business Administration with our banks so that they can have the flexibility so businesses can stay in business. So that when we do something for the health part, the economy is going to be able to start back sooner rather than later.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So how do you think we should reopen the economy -- Congressman? How should the country be balancing the scientific community's recommendations and the economic realities when it comes to reopening the economy? Do you have a plan?</p><p>And what about testing that we will know who has been testing? Who's been inoculated when we get to that point obviously. We don't have a vaccine yet in terms of making sure they know they're good to go back to work.</p><p>COLLINS: Well, several things there. One -- and it's amazing you made a comment earlier about it's been amazing how the American people have pulled together. I've been contacted by (INAUDIBLE) even here in Georgia and sort of an at-home plasma separator where you can get those antibodies and you could see those quicker.</p><p>Dr. Brix had talked about that, others they've talked about that as well. And they've been contacted and they're stepping forward, they're making the technology known. Others are doing that as well.</p><p>I think what we've got to see is what the President said is we're going to continue this process, I think through April. But we're seeing and as you said earlier, some flattening is occurring. The social distancing is working, making people aware of this and not getting too quick, so that you'll be able to get toward the end of this month, be able to take the moneys that have been put in for stimulus and then have our businesses start opening in certain areas.</p><p>I think you'll see some areas open up quicker than others. It just depends on where the virus is staging at. But I think you have to take both the science and the economics in display here as we continue this. We can't stay shutdown forever and I think we've gotten -- but we've also got make it sure that we're also taking care of people's health as well.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Is it realistic to think that we can start opening some parts of the economy next month?</p><p>COLLINS: I think it's a possibility. I think you're going to have to continue to look at how the virus is developing and the hot spots that are developing and are we still seeing growth in certain areas and how we can do it.</p><p>The economy in many areas is struggling because especially (INAUDIBLE) and Georgia is a prime example of it with tourism and service industries and those that are being killed.</p><p>I spoke to a hotelier the other day who normally has 90 percent -- 95 percent. He's in the business area. He's at 6 percent and 7 percent occupancy. These are the kind of things that's going to take time to get back up.</p><p>But also in light of these things we're also going to find new areas of growth in our economy that we didn't have before in the -- in our telecommuting and how we are talking, how we're communicating.</p><p>These are going to offer up new opportunities as well even as businesses get back into play. We may see a whole different economy verge out of this.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So Congressman -- what are you working on now in terms of this next stimulus package? Will there be a fourth relief package? Are you expecting that? And what should go in it?</p><p>COLLINS: There's probably going to be at least one more. What we are dealing with right now is very frustrating -- Maria. We need to make sure, as you talked about and we just talked about (INAUDIBLE). Small businesses in the payroll protection plan, we need to make sure these payrolls are protected, these businesses can have the money that they need keep to going and not just go out of business at this time. And we need to put the $251 billion that the President has asked for in this package right now so that some time this week we are not actually just getting to pay for it straight but have no money. We need to make sure it continues the process.</p><p>The Democrats however want to continue a negotiated process which we are adding money for other things that moneys are still available for. What we need to do is take this first step now.</p><p>They'll be more negotiations. Mitch McConnell, Kevin McCarthy, the President have always said there's other things that we're going to have to keep working on. But we need to get this money in here now. Otherwise businesses won't have the assurances after they get through the process that there'll be money available. We need to get that done now.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well -- there's so many important things that you need to address, in particular this supply chains issue. I know Peter Navarro at the White House is working on this in terms of getting companies to come back, bring their supply chains here.</p><p>This has been going on for three administrations and I guess, you know, with all due respect, and Nancy Pelosi and her colleagues have been looking for ghosts in the Russia collusion narrative for three years and while doing so they have completely missed the real bad actor here and that's China who's been eating our lunch for decades.</p><p>COLLINS: Well, think about what you just said there --</p><p>BARTIROMO: What are you going to do about it?</p><p>COLLINS: Well, I think you just brought up a great point. Think about the distractions of the last year before we ever got here. When the President was talking about trade deals after we had went through our time of getting our the tax plan done, getting our economy going as much as it was and then the President transitioning into tacks (ph) where we held the -- even we held the Mexican-Canadian trade agreement up for almost a year because of these investigations --</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's right.</p><p>COLLINS: -- and everything else. We held all that up. At the same point, we are missing the supply chain where the President was talking about this in his deals with China. He's talking about bringing those companies back and making sure our supply chain was secure.</p><p>Now we are seeing it. When you wake up one morning and you have a pandemic and you see that a vast majority of our pharmaceutical supply chain was based in China, when you see, as you talked about earlier, this PPE issue now of getting -- where China is clamping down on it, where you see that it makes it even more -- Peter is right about this. Navarro couldn't be more right.</p><p>We have to make sure that the incentive from the tax plan early or incentives earlier to bring the supply chains back. It's got to be one of the first and foremost things we do. It also will help us in our economic condition as we come out of this because you're growing jobs and growing manufacturing here in the United States.</p><p>But when it comes to our military supplies, when it and comes to our pharmaceutical supplies, when it comes to the various things that we are now seeing that are in danger, we have to put a priority on that.</p><p>The President has been talking this ever since he was sworn in. It's now time for Congress to put aside these kind of partisan squabbles and say look here is the real bad actors on the world stage. We have to take an aggressive stance towards them.</p><p>BARTIROMO: But will a supply chain element be in a fourth relief package -- Congressman?</p><p>COLLINS: I would like that. I think, you know, we need something addressed. I think we need to also make sure that we're making sure that American companies are not exporting things overseas that can be used here first.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>COLLINS: We've had some reports of that. I've made that issue very clear with the White House and others as we sign on to things. This stuff needs to stay here first because that's our first priority.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, of course. Congressman -- it's good to see you, this morning. Thanks so much.</p><p>COLLINS: Great to be with you -- Maria. Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Have a good Monday.</p><p>Doug Collins. Doug Collins joining us. We will be right back. Stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>Severe weather slamming parts of the United States, Fox News senior meteorologist Janice Dean with the details on the extent of this damage and what Americans can expect today. It's coming. Hey -- Janice.</p><p>JANICE DEAN, FOX NEWS SENIOR METEOROLOGIST: Yes. Here in the northeast -- Maria, we're going to have wind gusts in excess of 60 miles per hour, possibly hurricane-force winds. But the damage across Texas through Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, up towards the Carolinas is extensive. In some cases catastrophic. We had one tornado on the ground for 100 miles yesterday in Mississippi and these storms are packing a punch throughout the morning and the afternoon.</p><p>They will weaken but we are going to see that straight line wind damage potential especially over portions of the southeast up towards the mid- Atlantic and even the northeast where we have wind advisories for tens of millions of Americans here. D.C. up towards Philadelphia, New York back through the Great Lakes where again, it's going to be incredible as we go through the morning hours with the potentials for not only power outages but structural damage. So this is going to be a big deal.</p><p>There are your forecast winds coming this morning into this afternoon. And in some cases, yes, hurricane-force winds along the coast and that's going to be very problematic unfortunately. If we have power outages and people are in their homes, it's going to be trying to say the least.</p><p>There's your forecast throughout the day today. The storms will move offshore but in the meanwhile the damage is done with the incredible videos coming out of the south and the southeast. Our hearts and prayers -- Maria, out to all of those folks. This was a severe weather outbreak, a tornado catastrophe in some of these regions.</p><p>Back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. Janice -- thank you. Janice Dean with the latest on weather.</p><p>Meanwhile we've got breaking news. Goldman Sachs is saying that U.S. stocks have likely bottomed on policy support. They will not go lower because of the \"do whatever it takes policy\" approach by lawmakers.</p><p>And Dagen -- you're talking about now fiscal stimulus between the central bank and the government. $7.5 trillion dollars in fiscal stimulus. That's 35 percent of the GDP -- Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right and some of that is yet to come from the Federal Reserve. At least a couple of trillion dollars more potentially. That's what Goldman Sachs, David Kostin strategist, including him say about the U.S. stock market and the economy.</p><p>This unprecedented combination of fiscal and monetary policy support and then also the flattening of the viral curve. They don't think -- if the U.S. doesn't have a second surge in infections after the economy reopens, equity markets are unlikely to make new lows, but what is the low we are talking about?</p><p>These policy actions, their previous near-term downside was 2000 on the S&amp;P 500. However, we're -- right now as of Thursday's close, we are 25 percent above the recent low. The recent low was on March 23rd of 2237. So we are still significantly higher than the recent low but what Goldman Sachs is saying is it's wiping away that 2000 call and so it's sticking with it won't make a new low below that 2237. We've had a really big bounce-back since that March 23rd low which is worth noting.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. It's at least 23 percent or so from the lows just recently, so we will probably still see the 700 or 800-point moves up and down but we have seen the lows.</p><p>I like that. I'll take it.</p><p>Let's take a break. We've got a lot more to come this morning.</p><p>We are looking at a decline of about 300 point son the Dow Industrials.</p><p>Stay with us. Back in a moment.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>Small business in America struggling amid coronavirus shutdowns. Many businesses uncertain about the future. The government stepping in, of course, to help offering the Paycheck Protection Program which guaranties loans to small businesses with the goal of helping them keep their employees on the job during the pandemic. The goal is to get that money and give it to employees who are at home.</p><p>My next guest is small business owner who applied for that program and it has asked for a loan.</p><p>Joining me right now is Dog Tag Bakery CEO, Meghan Ogilvie. And Meghan -- thanks very much for joining us. Tell us about your story. You applied for the loan, and you got -- did you get the money?</p><p>MEGHAN OGILVIE, CEO, DOG TAG BAKER: You know, we are still, like many small business owners and nonprofits, we are still waiting to hear back on that as of now.</p><p>You know, as a small business and we are nonprofit based in Washington, D.C. that serves veterans, service connected to disabilities, no (INAUDIBLE) and no charge care givers, we have a mission behind our bakeries. It's a living business school to teach entrepreneurship and small business but also really rediscover purpose and community.</p><p>So we are doing everything we can in the sense that we have applied for the SBA disaster loan. We've submitted all of the documentation that we know of as of right now for the Paycheck Protection Plan. And we are doing our best obviously forecast to project the financial viability of our organization just like many others out there with the difficult part of not knowing the end date.</p><p>And so we are right now really navigating it the best we can and still maintaining our program and running our fellowship, providing tools for our alumni to understand how to navigate it as they are small business owners or employees who've lost their jobs during this time.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So you applied for the Small Business Administration disaster loan, $300,000. The Paycheck Protection Plan, $275,000. D.C. micro grant and then -- I want to ask you, I mean your business has gone through a series of stages, right, from reducing store hours, ceasing producing, now to closing your brick and mortar altogether and online store.</p><p>So what are the projected financial impacts from the coronavirus virus shutdown from your standpoint? And once you get this loan and you give that money, much of the money to your employees who are home, but you're still under shutdown, is that going to -- is that going to be enough for you or are you going to need to use other levers?</p><p>OGILVIE: You know, Maria, it's a great question. As of March 12th, we started limiting hours. From there we went to curb-side and pickup only. From there we went to shipping only. And by the 30th we had to shut down our full operation based on costs and based also on the safety and health and wellness of our team as well as our community.</p><p>And what we are seeing is right now we are just trying to fill the hole that is right now so we are at a minimum of $130,000 at least lost. And that's just by the normal orders that we have coming in through catering or retail or wholesale. So that's just at a minimum. That's what we know we've lost, what our projections are showing from last year.</p><p>And that does incur (ph) any other new business that would be coming in. So we know right now we are at a deficit already and that does not include the payroll that we are continuing to pay our entire team because our team is everything. And small business and nonprofit, you know, your team is what makes the special sauce to the organization and keeps it running.</p><p>So what we are seeing with this loan and from the SBA disaster loan, as well as the Paycheck Protection Plan, that's really just for the stop gap right now, that's to help stop the bleed. But you know, we are all hoping and wanting to get through this very difficult time, an unprecedented time but, you know, what's going to happen when we get back and the mandates start getting lifted and restrictions get eased?</p><p>You know, we don't know as a community how our community's going to react. You know, we are a bakery that is a living business school for veterans, that you know, you come in and have a cup of coffee and support a nonprofit.</p><p>But the concern is right now we don't know how the community is going to participate moving forward. The social distancing and everything that's going on right now -- so what we are also trying to obviously forecast for is, you know, what is going to happen when we go back into operation and the reaction of, you know, will business go back to usual or how -- what the implications will be.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Well, we are talking about testing and that's going to be one lever to get us back into the opening and reopening of the economy. We want to take a look at that coming up.</p><p>Meghan -- it's great to get your insights this morning. Thanks very much.</p><p>OGILVIE: Thank you so much for having us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Meghan Ogilvie joining us this morning.</p><p>Coming up, coronavirus and bail reform. We will take a look how it's ripping through the prison system as well.</p><p>Back in a moment.</p><p>MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Welcome back. Good Monday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Monday, April 13th. Hope you're having a good morning, your top stories right now 7:32 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>Markets are pointing to a lower opening this morning. We're kicking off a new week where we will get first quarter earnings beginning at the end of the week. Dow Futures down 140 points right now, the NASDAQ Futures lower by 35, and the S&amp;P Futures down 16 points.</p><p>There is an historic oil deal to report, the USA stepping in to broker a deal resulting in 23 countries including Saudi Arabia and Russia, agreeing to a record cut in production of nearly 10 million barrels cut a day, about a 10th of the world supply. The deal failing to excite investors, oil prices this morning are flat. A lot of investors out there writing in their morning notes today that they wanted more. The price of oil is up $0.16 a barrel, that's tree-quarter of one percent at 22.94.</p><p>Global Markets this morning look like this. In Asia, it was red across the board. Take a look and you will see Hong Kong closed for a holiday but the others down across the board. The Nikkei average in Japan, the worst performer, down 2-1/3 percent.</p><p>European markets are also closed this morning for Easter Monday, a holiday.</p><p>Meanwhile this, the FBI is investigating a COVID-19 scam. Cheryl Casone with the details there and yes, there are lots of scams lately. This is the latest that the bad guys are turning to COVID-19, Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Yes, Maria. And more and more are probably going to keep coming out. California's healthcare union says that it was conned over much needed supplies. The union thought it struck a deal to buy 39 million N95 masks but they never got them. FBI says that individuals in Australia and Kuwait had contacted the would be recipients through WhatsApp. Fortunately, no money was ever exchanged. But Yes, at this point, this is where we're at.</p><p>Well, a surge in food deliveries is forcing Amazon to put new online grocery customers on a waitlist that starts today. The company also is looking to shorten shopping hours at some Whole Foods stores that workers can fill online requests for Amazon Fresh and Amazon Prime now. Company also plans to hire more workers to meet the growing demand for food deliveries during the coronavirus pandemic. There's Amazon in the premarket, just down a fraction as you can see.</p><p>And Maria, how does Tampa Brady sound or maybe Tampa Bay. Tom Brady is hoping his new home is going to help him make a little extra cash. The six times Super Bowl champion wants to sell merchandise using those two phrases. Brady's company TEB Capital Management filed trademark applications last week for those phrases. Brady, Maria, signed a two-year deal with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers last month after 20 seasons with the New England Patriots. I know, shocker. Tom Brady's going to cash in on this new deal. You know, who knew? Back to you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It's true. It was a really shocker to everybody though, so we'll keep watching that. Cheryl, thank you.</p><p>CASONE: You bet.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We are taking a look at more implications of the coronavirus and how it is impacting bail reform and the prison system. Lawyer Michael Avenatti temporarily released from a New York City jail over concerns of coronavirus. Avenatti has to report back in 90 days. This as New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio has called for releasing hundreds of prisoners who are at risk of coronavirus.</p><p>On \"SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES\", I spoke with both New York Governor Andrew Cuomo and former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani about the bail reform issue, here's a look.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Will you propose or support that judges have the discretion to let out criminals as they see fit?</p><p>GOV. ANDREW CUOMO (D-NY): Bail reform for many years was based on how much money you had, Maria. That's what cash bail is. If you're rich, you get out. If you're poor, you sit. That's an injustice, not justice.</p><p>I understand the fear. I understand the criticism. I said that I'm working on it and I believe we're going to get something done.</p><p>RUDY GIULIANI, FORMER MAYOR OF NEW YORK CITY: The prisons are overwhelmed with COVID-19. We tell people stay home because there may be COVID-19 in your home and you don't want to bring it outside and we're letting the prisoners out so they can bring that COVID-19 that's ramping into prison. They could bring it to us. Are you crazy?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, joining me right now is Fox News Senior Judicial Analyst, Judge Andrew Napolitano. Judge, great to see you this morning. You know, I've got a very important source in law enforcement who told me that she is looking every day at requests, thousands of requests from families who want their family members out of prison, because of COVID-19. She's got to review all of these -- all of these applications because de Blasio wants them out. What do you think?</p><p>JUDGE ANDREW NAPOLITANO, FOX NEWS SENIOR JUDICIAL ANALYST: Well, this is a difficult problem for the government. It's a problem of resources. I mean, do they want to keep COVID-19 prisoners in jail and care for them and treat them in jail. And what is basically an unsafe unsanitary, hardly medical environment, or do they want to send them out on their own where they are free to infect other people or go to someplace? Many of them have no places to go.</p><p>So, Mayor Giuliani's comments are very well taken. You know, I'm a fan of Governor Cuomo. I think he's using his bully pulpit brilliantly, but he signed the bail reform law which takes discretion away from judges, and requires that people -- even people that are repeat offenders be set free as long as they don't reach a certain level of violence.</p><p>So somebody spits on you or slaps you in the face, as long as they don't break a bone or break the skin, they don't get bail, they immediately are released. So he's part of the problem for this.</p><p>The solution to the bail issue is the way the Feds do it, which is to give judges discretion to evaluate each person. What is the likelihood that this person will repeat the crime? What is the likelihood that this person will go home? What is the likelihood that this person will infect somebody else with COVID-19? You can't do it by a formula or a computer, you have to have a judge with a prosecutor and a defense lawyer resolving this together.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, well, look, in that interview with Governor Cuomo, he said to me that he's going to make a decision on this on whether to change or tweak this bail reform law by April 1st. So here we are on April 13th, we haven't heard anything. Obviously, he's been a little busy and he's been showing great leadership on the COVID-19 situation.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: But we will get -- we will get a resolution here at some point. He's got to look at this again. He's under pressure to do so.</p><p>And Dagen, as we watch all of this happened, the crime numbers in New York are going up, up and up because of all of those inmates and other reasons that had been let out and now we're just going to see more inmates coming out because of this latest problem of COVID-19.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Yes, it's only getting worse. New York has turned into an extremely scary place. It feels like Grand Theft Auto at times. There are -- I think it was Melissa Francis posted a video on Twitter yesterday of a gang of people on dirt -- motorized dirt bikes and motorcycles. A giant group of people riding not just up the street, but on the sidewalks.</p><p>I walk around my neighborhood and it's one car after another has had its window busted out. It might be vandalism, it might be theft. But there is - - there is mass at a -- at a very minimum civil disobedience going on, but criminal activity on every street in this city. And it's rampant, and it probably won't go away because of this bail reform.</p><p>BARTIROMO: In New York in general, it's up in the double digits, Lee Carter. And this is an issue that the governor and the mayor will have to deal with as they try to figure out how to isolate inmates who have COVID- 19.</p><p>LEE CARTER, PRESIDENT, MASLANSKY + PARTNERS: I mean, it's a really, really complicated issue. Obviously, as the judge was saying that there's no -- there's no way to really manage the health of all of these inmates in the prisons. You're putting all these other people at risk.</p><p>But is there a precedent here Judge, for why they would do it this way, handle it this way, let these people out. I mean, it doesn't seem to make sense to say go away for 90 days and then come back. This has happened elsewhere?</p><p>NAPOLITANO: There's no precedent Lee, of which I'm aware for letting people like, for example, Michael Avenatti out. Now, Avenatti is no longer presumed innocent because he's already been convicted. Technically, the conviction isn't finalized until sentencing. And in his case, sentencing is June 17th.</p><p>But a jury found him guilty of attempting to extort Nike for $25 million. We all remember the case because they taped him of trying to shake them down.</p><p>I was quite surprised that he was let a free, however, he's not a flight risk. Everybody knows what he looks like. He has a home to go to. He has the means with which to address any health issues that he may have. So he's an unusual but an easy case.</p><p>It is the poor person who's committed a violent crime who's sick with COVID-19 whom prison officials don't want to physically touch. That is the problematic and troublesome case that Mayor Giuliani was discussing with Maria yesterday.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, but this goes back to the -- to the same old issue that people have such problems with, it's the -- it's the successful rich guy who gets out. And the poor guy or gal who's in there, who -- I'm not -- I'm not talking about serious -- you know, I'm not talking about murder. But I'm talking about someone who had -- who is in there for a lot less of a reason and yet he's still in there and Avenatti gets out, why? Well, how come he got out?</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Well, Avenatti got out because a judge decided, not the judge who presided over his trial in white plains, but the judge was about to preside over his trial in Los Angeles that he's not a flight risk, and he's not a danger to society.</p><p>BARTIROMO: OK.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: And he will show up when needed. That really does not have to do with his wealth, that has to do with the fact that he's so well-known he couldn't harm a fly without somebody seeing him and reporting it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Alright, we will be watching that. Judge, great to get your insights as always, stay safe, stay strong. Judge Andrew Napolitano, we will see you soon.</p><p>Quick break and then we will be right back looking at markets on a Monday. Stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Well, we are starting the week off with a pretty good selloff. Futures indicating a decline at the start of trading. Take a look at markets right here with the Dow Futures down 181 points, the S&amp;P Futures down 19 and the NASDAQ Futures lower by 45.</p><p>This comes amid an historic oil deal. 23 countries including Saudi Arabia and Russia have agreed to a record production cut of nearly 10 million barrels a day. Oil prices this morning are flat, down as you can see, a fraction at $22.76 a barrel</p><p>Mitch Roschelle, are you surprised markets are not happier with this deal? You would expect more of a rally given we are going to see a production cut of almost 10 million.</p><p>MITCH ROSCHELLE, PARTNER, PWC: I think the big anxiety, Maria, over the market is that earnings start this week. You got the big banks, you got J&amp;J, you got UnitedHealthcare. And I think that that's the big stumbling block right now because we don't have earnings for these companies out and we don't have guidance more importantly. And I think it's what these companies say on conference calls about their forward look on guidance that's going to influence not just the equity markets, but even perhaps the oil markets because we'll know when these businesses going to start ramping up production again.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, I'm so glad you brought that up, Mitch, because I'm looking at a note from Peter Boockvar this morning from Bleakley Advisory Group. And he says, forget about the income statement, it's about the balance sheet in the coming weeks. He says the most important thing to watch this earnings season will be the balance sheet, not the income statement. Not only what is your debt to equity ratio or debt to total capital, but what is your interest expense coverage ratio. What debt covenants are you bumping up against? Have you tapped your credit line? And if so, what is left on it?</p><p>So all of these things with regard to the debt covenants are going to be much more important than what the company says about how the first quarter look, right, Mitch? Because we're not going back to January, we're not going back to February anytime soon. And we certainly know what happened in March.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: Having worked on many restructurings throughout my career, one of the things you start day one is you look at how much cash you have, what's coming in and what your burn rate is on cash. And some of those metrics that are typically only used in troubled companies. Analysts are starting to use on highly profitable companies to figure out how long they can go with the cash that have on hand and their lines of credit.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Maria, the --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, and Dagen, I don't think even the guidance is going to be very important because they don't know when the economy is going to reopen. And they don't know people's behavior when it does reopen.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right, these companies will give you a big oh when they're talking about what the future looks like. We've already had General Electric, FedEx and Starbucks amongst some of the biggest names warn that they can no longer forecast their own results in such a period of uncertainty.</p><p>What the finance chief said at companies far and wide have been doing is tapping the bond markets, extending credit lines, bolstering cash reserves.</p><p>The Wall Street Journal writing about this very thing today, but anecdotally, I talk to people in a bunch of different industries like in the fashion industry, in the clothing business, they're just trying to figure out which of the major retailers survive because a lot of them could go away and go away forever. And that would mean the permanent destruction of potentially millions of jobs. That is still the big unknown, despite all these rescues. How many of these jobs go away? And it's really distressing and upsetting to -- you know, not just executives clearly but all of us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, we'll see -- we'll see what they come out with later this week. But certainly, when you look at the earnings per share, it's absolutely irrelevant, because they're going to tell us January and February refine, but we don't know what the future looks like.</p><p>So we are going to get those big numbers later on in the week. The first quarter reporting season kicks off this week with JP Morgan and Johnson and Johnson.</p><p>Quick break and then how big tech can help keep you safe amid the coronavirus crisis. We'll take a look at that when we come right back. Stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Apple and Google teaming up to help curb the spread of coronavirus. The technology giant saying that they are building software with contract -- contact tracing. Those contact tracing tools will alert cellphone users if they've come close to anybody with the illness.</p><p>Joining us right now is the CyberGuy, Kurt Knutsson. Kurt, this is sure to raise privacy concerns. But it's an interesting take on what technology can do in the face of this pandemic.</p><p>KURT KNUTSSON, THE CYBERGUY: Isn't it? Good morning, Maria. You know, it's interesting that Chinese government, which you know, they just mandate whatever they want to mandate on their population. We don't do that here in the U.S. They were very effective with a mandatory app that tracks their population.</p><p>Well, what happened was they saw how effective that was. So the powers big tech here in California, Tim Cook along with Sundar Pichai at Google came up and said let's collaborate which is very, very rare for these companies.</p><p>And what they came up with is a standard by which in mid-May, we'll start to see what's called an API or the tools for people to develop upon a Bluetooth type of standard that keeps the privacy on your phone where you're not revealing who you are ever. But yet your phone when it comes close to somebody who may be have volunteered that they have COVID-19, it would alert you at some point in changing color saying hi, Maria, you've come close to, ambit expose to and therefore we think you should fill in the blank in terms of protocols health wise at that time to follow, pretty remarkable.</p><p>Remarkable that they got together to do this. And the possibilities that technology could actually be the key that unlocks future spread of this epidemic is pretty incredible.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, but you don't -- you won't be able to detect someone who may not have said that they have COVID-19 or somebody who doesn't show any symptoms, right? I mean, there's -- so there's that. I mean, I like the idea that at least --</p><p>KNUTSSON: There's a weakness right there, you're right -- you're right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You know who has already disclosed. But are there other apps? What are the best apps and maps to monitor the spread of coronavirus?</p><p>KNUTSSON: You know, the big warning right now, we've talked about it all morning on, we've talked about it for weeks now is don't click a link from anybody that shares you, hi, download this app. Don't ever click any of that stuff, you go directly yourself.</p><p>And some of the real winners here are the obvious ones, and stick with those, the CDC has an outstanding map that connects up with interactive live data. And then the John Hopkins dashboard, which now is embedded around the web is a remarkable tool to just keep your eyes on.</p><p>And then -- you know, ironically, private maps like health map, don't necessarily track COVID-19 but it tracks everything in terms of how are people feeling near you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>KNUTSSON: What other type of flu outbreaks are there going on near you? And that can be some beneficial information. At least see what's happening more immediately around you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, we'll watch that. Kurt, thank you. Kurt Knutsson.</p><p>We're going to take a break and when we come back, Congressman Steve Scalise is here. House Minority Whip joining us on the historic OPEC allies deal, next our MORNINGS WITH MARIA.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MRNGMA-2020041302cb231</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXBNT2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YN9-0XB1-DXH2-64DF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">437059</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7448\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>MORNINGS WITH MARIA</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"04\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>April 13, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"64\"><classCode>CC00027GQ</classCode><className>JOHNSON &amp;

Fundamentally, this is about control and information.\"</p><p>Alphabet, the parent company of Google, said on Sept. 6 that the Justice Department in late August requested information and documents related to prior antitrust probes of the company. Alphabet said in a securities filing that it expects similar investigative demands from state attorneys general and that it is cooperating with regulators. The tech giant has a market value of more than $820 billion and controls many facets of the internet.</p><p>On Sept. 12, the House of Representatives' antitrust panel will be holding a hearing on the effects of consumer data collection by big-tech platforms, such as Google and Amazon, on other companies and online competition. The hearing is the first of three sessions that will focus on antitrust issues.</p><p>The timing of the new probes is interesting, Alicandro said. The vocal and online pressure from President Donald Trump against such companies was \"making it newsworthy to the extent that it's very topical.\" But Alicandro also stressed that the probes will be based on merit and should \"not be viewed as politically motivated.\"</p><p>Last month, Trump brought up allegations that Google suppressed negative news stories about his 2016 presidential rival, Hillary Clinton. Trump said what the technology company did was illegal and said that his administration is watching Google \"very closely.\"</p><p>In 2016, Dr. Robert Epstein, senior research psychologist at the American Institute for Behavioral Research and Technology, conducted a secret monitoring project that showed Google hid negative auto-complete search results for Clinton months before the 2016 presidential election. His peer-reviewed research found Google's algorithms can easily shift 20 percent or more votes among voters, and up to 80 percent in some demographic groups.</p><p>\"Now the government, in a bipartisan effort, are figuring out how to regulate this new space,\" Alicandro said. \"It's going to take years-this is not something that's going to be resolved in weeks or months. Depending on the results ... it could have a material impact on these companies right now and similar companies going forward.\"</p><p>Current antitrust laws have had little impact on Google and other similar technology companies because the industries are still relatively new, according to Alicandro. He said the government has more experience in dealing with telecommunications or utility industries because they are much older and are highly regulated.</p><p>\"What are they?\" Alicandro said, referring to Google, Facebook, Apple, and Amazon. \"Are they technology companies? Are they internet companies?\" He said that how we view what category these companies fit under impacts how they are regulated.</p><p>\"If you look at Facebook right now, they are going to enter into the cryptocurrency market, and that's an unbelievable thing,\" he said. \"Every market they enter, they immediately will have an impact on because of their size.\"</p><p>Alicandro reiterated that it's more difficult for companies in these other, older industries to grow as large as Google through acquisitions, citing the high number of regulations and how the government is more active in jumping in to block potential mergers that could create a monopoly.</p><p>\"I don't think this happens in other industries any more,\" he said.</p><p>Earlier this year, however, the federal government failed to block a multibillion-dollar merger between AT&amp;T and Time Warner. The massive deal, worth a reported $85 billion to $105 billion, could have major implications in the broader media industry.</p><p>\"The [antitrust] laws aren't there, because these [tech industries] are relatively new industries,\" Alicandro said. \"Entrepreneurship and technologies are cutting-edge; it always leads, and then you often see a lawsuit or law-change to catch up with it.\"</p><p>Epstein, who has spent more than half a decade monitoring Google's influence, has been in regular touch with some attorneys general who are conducting the probe. He told The Epoch Times previously that Google's power needs to be curtailed in three main areas: surveillance, censorship, and manipulation.</p><p>\"The main thing they can do is to levy fines, and the problem is Google can just brush off fines,\" he said. \"Google has been subjected to more than $8 billion in fines by the EU in the last two years, approximately. But I don't think these fines will really have the impact that we need to have on Google.\"</p><p>When asked to comment on the new state probe announced against Google earlier this week, a spokesperson for the company didn't directly provide a response, instead referring The Epoch Times to a blog post by Kent Walker, Google's senior vice president of global affairs.</p><p>\"It's, of course, right that governments should have oversight to ensure that all successful companies, including ours, are complying with the law,\" Walker wrote in a Sept. 6 post.</p><p>Walker said that the company has answered many questions in this regard over the years in both the United States and overseas, adding that this was \"not new\" to them. \"We have always worked constructively with regulators and we will continue to do so.\"</p><p>He said Google is looking forward to showing the public how they are \"engaging in robust and fair competition.\"</p><p>A Facebook spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment by The Epoch Times.</p><p>This is historic scrutiny because it's bipartisan.</p><p>Manny Alicandro, attorney with expertise in antitrust matters</p><p>The new state investigations follow probes at the federal level by the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ENW-2292876801</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">1576348ENW</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X40-MHW1-DYR7-80MR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11341</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1131\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Epoch Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Epoch Times</publicationName><issueNumber>No. 532</issueNumber><aggregationName>Ethnic NewsWatch</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 12, 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Others</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Aggregate News Sources</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English UK</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Feature</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>US DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

If Apple's shares rise by 9% its market value will pass $1trn. It is an astonishing sum, supported by the iPhone-maker's staggering profits of $60bn a year, or $8 for every person on Earth. Yet it should prompt cold sweats among the firm's managers and investors. Relative to GDP, Apple's earnings are now so big that it is entering a danger zone that has been occupied by only a few other corporate colossi, including the East India Company and John D. Rockefeller's firm, Standard Oil. If history is any guide, Apple will not get bigger and other tech firms in America and China, such as Amazon and Alibaba, are testing the limits, too.</p><p>The $1trn mark has been passed once before, by PetroChina, a Chinese state firm, for 15 days in 2007. But that reflected a speculative frenzy on Shanghai's bourse. And in any case, what matters more than nominal market values is the size of a firm's profits relative to the economy. There are no iron laws, but common sense suggests that there are limits. Vast profits might reflect products that cannot possibly become any more popular, or a concentration of power that invites a competitive or political backlash.</p><p>Six cases of gigantism stand out most, with the firms becoming so big that governments intervened. In 1813 the East India Company, a British private empire involved in opium production, among other things, lost its long-standing legal monopoly over trade with India. In 1911 America's Supreme Court broke up Standard Oil, and, as a populist wave swept the country, the government also initiated legal action against US Steel, the other giant of the Gilded Age. Trustbusters went after IBM in 1969, and then in 1974 they sought to break AT&amp;T's grip on telecoms. And the Department of Justice sued to dismember Microsoft in 1998.</p><p>Measuring these mammoths is best done using the yardstick of profits relative to GDP. Earnings figures are fairly reliable and capture the size of the bounty these firms could trouser. The Economist has taken the peak figures during or just before each firm's regulatory showdown and compared that to the GDP of its country of domicile. Some caveats are in order: interpreting old accounts involves guesswork (the East India Company's books include an entry for \"booty\"). No official figures exist for GDP before the first world war, only academic estimates. For the East India Company and Standard Oil the sources are historical tomes and court and parliamentary documents, not company reports.</p><p>Three conclusions are clear. First, when the six firms got into trouble they had profits of between 0.08% and 0.54% of GDP, with a median of 0.24%. The East India Company is at the top end of that range and IBM and Microsoft at the bottom. Second, today's American and Chinese tech giants are already near, or within, the lower end of that danger zone, as are several non-tech firms, such as Berkshire Hathaway. Apple is larger than the rest, with profits worth 0.28% of GDP. Third, the dizzying valuations of big tech firms imply that their profits will soar still further. If investors' expectations are met, by 2027 Amazon, Apple, Alphabet and Microsoft will all have profits above the historical median of 0.24%. Facebook, Tencent and Alibaba will not be far behind.</p><p>Tech tycoons have some decent arguments as to why size does not matter any more. Today's firms are more global than in the past, so comparing their profits to America's or China's economy may exaggerate their clout (although by 2027 Amazon's profits are projected to be twice as big relative to world GDP as the East India Company's in 1813). Political institutions in America, and perhaps China, are less corrupt than in 19th-century Britain and America, so big firms may be less able to capture governments.</p><p>However, today's tech giants extract profits from customers more consistently than the earlier oligopolists did. Together the seven biggest firms make a 32% return on equity (ROE). Microsoft had high returns in 1998. Standard Oil also had an ROE rivalling today's tech giants\u2014this was a key plank of the prosecution's successful case that it was a monopoly that should be broken up. But at their zeniths the East India Company, US Steel and AT&amp;T made ROES of only about 10%, and IBM managed about 20%.</p><p>If today's giants were broken up, would it spell disaster? According to one big shareholder, break-ups sometimes benefit investors. The shares of Standard Oil's listed subsidiaries, after all, increased in value after the court decision in 1911 to dismember the firm. Yet overall, corporate whoppers had a mixed time of it. The East India Company shrivelled after it lost its monopoly. US Steel won its case and avoided being broken up but, after a brief surge during the first world war, it faded from view. By the 1990s IBM was making losses and today it is a shadow of its former self. The firms that resulted from breaking up Standard Oil, including Exxon and Chevron, have, in total, smaller profits than it did relative to GDP. Two firms have fared better. AT&amp;T's descendants, Verizon and AT&amp;T, have gobbled up many of their competitors and together now squeeze out similar profits to those their parent did in 1974. And though Microsoft had a rough patch after it escaped being dismembered, it has since almost doubled in size.</p><p>The past is not regarded as a meaningful guide to the future in Silicon Valley and Chinese tech circles. But at the height of their powers, giant companies make blinkered, unreliable guides to their own futures. In 1974 AT&amp;T's annual report dismissed the risks of antitrust and advised Americans that \"competition breeds a wasteful duplication\". In 1909 Standard Oil told the courts that its founders, with their \"infinite skill\", had succeeded as if they had developed \"a gold or diamond mine, and abundant revenue legitimately became theirs\"\u2014a piece of logic not dissimilar to how today's tech titans justify themselves. The fallibility of corporate superstars is worth bearing in mind as today's tech stocks cruise towards valuations that were almost unimaginable only two years ago.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ECON-CM79STO</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ECON2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SR4-9D01-JBKN-B2M5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">7955</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-07-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1035\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Economist Newspapers Ltd.

A growing animosity toward Google, Facebook, Apple, and Amazon has gained mainstream traction, seen by increasingly louder calls by activists[1] and politicians from across the political spectrum to regulate tech markets. This phenomenon\u2014commonly referred to as 'techlash'\u2014is a bipartisan policy concern albeit for vastly different reasons. US Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren[2] decried Big Tech as posing risks for American democracy due to public reliance on it, while Republicans such as Trump and Senator Ted Cruz have lambasted Big Tech for an inherent self-regulatory bias against conservatives. </p><p>But before we jump to the conclusion that government bureaucrats need to rein in Big Tech, we must constantly keep in mind and appreciate just how gargantuan of an impact the internet has had in ameliorating liberal democracies and human freedom.Democracy Before the InternetBefore the advent of the internet and social media, the scope of democratic participation for the average citizen was minimal. The pre-internet society was heavily constricted by the one-way information flows of traditional media models. The types of social issues that people rallied for and against were by and large filtered through agendas set by a class of elite journalists and political leaders. This hierarchical institutional structure that shaped how public discourse developed is best explained by the underlying economics of the media industry. To be in the business of information production i.e., a news organization, one used to require large up-front physical capital investment costs for setting up a broadcast station, printing presses and/or mainframe servers. Thanks to affordable technology, being able to participate in the production of information goods today are widely decentralized and owned by end-users. Thanks to gradual technological improvements and lower costs of computer parts, the material costs necessary to participate in the production of information goods today are widely decentralized and owned by end-users. We purchase our own computers and set up our own internet subscriptions through which we receive our news, rather than purchasing a newspaper from the stand. In other words, the old business model of high fixed costs and low marginal costs of news production is no longer dominant. This simple difference in the economic conditions of information production and distribution has made a great difference in shaping modern liberal democracies. In the past, the investigation of any given topic was the sole duty of full-time professional journalists. The average person interested in fulfilling their democratic duty of being politically-informed had to rely on the professional judgment of elite opinion leaders with little scope for scrutinizing their source claims or voicing their opposition.Accessible Public DiscourseToday, anyone with a social media platform or smartphone camera are themselves 'journalists,' able to voice one's outrage and expose scandalous affairs to a wide audience within a moment's notice of the incident happening. It is common practice on most forms of digital content to link and cross-reference to original materials, promoting a culture of healthy skepticism. The scope for evaluating the credibility and accuracy of claims in politics has also considerably widened. While the average news consumer may not possess the technical expertise to evaluate claims, open access to the information ensures that some group of people out there with the competence to do so can and will act as a safeguard against false claims. This is seen in the form of professional organizations such as Politifact[3] that verifies the truthfulness of claims made by politicians, as well as a politically-active citizenry on social media. In the era of the internet, information is conveyed to the end-user, along with an open invitation to report on, debate, question and collaborate. As Yochai Benkler succinctly puts it, thanks to the internet, the spirit of public discourse saw a patterned shift from 'trust the elites and professionals' to a participatory 'see for yourself' culture where consumers are encouraged to join the conversation, rather than receiving it passively. In the era of the internet, information is conveyed to the end-user, along with an open invitation to report on, debate, question and collaborate. The popular 'Someone is wrong on the Internet' joke, meant to playfully mock 'keyboard warriors' who spend too much time on online social media forums bickering with others, captures the participatory essence of the networked information economy that we live in today.In the networked information economy of today, the average person enjoys instant access to personal supercomputers that bridges us to a wealth of information at our fingertips, a reality unimaginable just a mere twenty years ago. The heightened extent by which the average citizen can play a role in the wider democratic process manifests in many ways: political discourse on social media, online citizen journalism, the empowerment of minorities and activists to voice injustices, and more. It is not hard to understand why authoritarian governments such as Myanmar and China have gone to such great lengths to control its digital spheres. They do it because the internet is the most anti-authoritarian tool to ever exist in the history of humankind. Case in point: the Arab Spring revolutions serve as arguably the best example of how internet access enabled the revolutionary efforts of domestic dissidents to topple their dictatorship governments.RationalizingRegulation of Big Tech TodayThose who advocate a larger government regulatory oversight over Big Tech must be reminded of mankind's recent history and how the internet has enabled civil freedoms (and continues to do so). It is exceedingly easy to infer that government regulation is necessary by pinpointing isolated instances of how social media has been used for undesirable purposes, or have led to problems of misinformation or data privacy. But this line of thinking lacks nuance if its baseline for justifying greater regulation of Big Tech is an ideologically utopian standard of tech platforms that are perfectly self-regulating and free of problems. If history is any guide to action, we would still be far better off in a world of imperfect self-regulation. That's a nice and grand ideal to strive for, but unrealistic if used as a benchmark for policymaking purposes. Against such a hard-to-achieve and flawless standard, there would be infinite reasons for regulators to interfere in tech markets and ever-present grounds for widening the scope of regulation. Instead, the right standard against which to assess the need for tech regulation should be based on a comparative analysis to the democratic realities in times past, and properly calculate whether alleged harms outweigh public benefits\u2014such as the historical improvements in democratic engagement I have briefly sketched out. Increasing government regulation of Big Tech is not a costless action. It would also spell higher potential risks of government manipulation of society's main communication channels as other tech policy analysts have pointed out here[4]. If history is any guide to action, we would still be far better off in a world of imperfect self-regulation.

It would also spell higher potential risks of government manipulation of society's main communication channels as other tech policy analysts have pointed out here.<br/>If history is any guide to action, we would still be far better off in a world of imperfect self-regulation.<br/>This article is republished with permission from the Adam Smith Center.\u00a0<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CETWEN-67949</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CETWEN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WHJ-CRF1-F03R-W529-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">468581</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1241\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 FEE, USA All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Foundation For Economic Education</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 6, 2019 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Yet if we asked them what branch of government should take the lead in adapting policy to a revolution in technology, they would say that's a job for Congress.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Alas, I reckon they would be gobsmacked by today's Congress, too. The august creation of Article I of the Constitution can't walk and chew gum at the same time. Often, Congress can't even walk. Gridlock in Congress stalls all causes: the bitterly divisive ones and the vital nonpartisan ones, too. The mobile digital age presents pressing issues, from privacy to the price of broadband. But Congress does, basically, diddly.</p><p> So the need for action falls to the executive branch and the courts - both of them problematic.</p><p> Relying on executive-branch regulators can result in radically shifting rules of the road. The Federal Communications Commission is a good example. Under Trump-appointed Chairman Ajit Pai, the FCC is preparing to reverse existing policy on \"net neutrality,\" which requires that broadband providers treat all data equally. A change of presidents produces a screeching U-turn.</p><p> As for the courts, their limitations will be on display Wednesday in Washington, when the Supreme Court hears arguments over cellphone privacy. You might not realize that your cellular provider keeps track of your travels even when you have your GPS switched off. Each call, text, email and alert that enters or leaves your phone must pass through a nearby antenna.</p><p> In the case before the court, Timothy Carpenter's cellular provider supplied investigators a record of his smartphone's whereabouts. The pings placed Carpenter in the vicinity of several armed robberies in Ohio and Michigan. Now behind bars, he is asking the justices to find this a violation of his Fourth Amendment right to be safe from warrantless searches of his private domain.</p><p> Lower courts ruled that pre-iPhone case law was adequate to uphold Carpenter's conviction. Under existing law, if a person passes information through another entity - a \"third party\" such as a phone company or shipping firm - the fact of the transaction is not private. If you send a letter, for instance, the writing on the outside of the envelope can be read. If you dial a phone number, the fact of the call (though not its content) is information owned by the phone company. And the carrier can share that fact with police.</p><p> Carpenter's appeal is supported by big tech firms, leading civil liberties groups and digital privacy advocates. They argue that the transformative capabilities of the smartphone demand new protections against search and seizure of our personal digital property. If our entire lives - not just conversations but also shopping, studying, dating, navigating, playing, dining and documenting our experiences - take place with and through these devices, should all of it be public? Yet we have no choice but to use these increasingly indispensable tools.</p><p> Justice Sonia Sotomayor saw this issue coming. Writing in 2012, she found existing law \"ill suited to the digital age, in which people reveal a great deal of information about themselves to third parties in the course of carrying out mundane tasks.\"</p><p> No doubt other justices share this insight. Judges are human, after all, and few humans with smartphones haven't fretted over the breadth and depth of the data collected by our digital overlords. And the problem doesn't stop with collection. The capacity to store nearly infinite amounts of data assures that our virtual trails will never go cold.</p><p> The need for new privacy protections seems clear. But in such an intricate web of issues, the courts aren't wellsuited to making policy. Their mandate is to decide the discrete legal questions presented one case at a time. A fully formed body of law from the bench may require decades of maturation through a series of cases.</p><p> Which brings us back to Congress - and, more hopefully, to state legislatures. The legislative branch is best equipped to define big issues, gather research, hold hearings, weigh competing interests and draft comprehensive reforms. Writing as a friend of the court in the Carpenter case, George Washington University law professor Orin Kerr, an authority on the Fourth Amendment and writer for the Volokh Conspiracy blog hosted by The Post, has urged the justices to restrain themselves. \"The Court should continue to allow legislatures to debate and decide how much protection cell-site records should receive,\" Kerr asserted, pointing out that California recently passed very strict new privacy laws.</p><p> Partisan game-playing and mutual suspicion in Congress come at a high price. Pressing decisions that ought to be made by elected representatives in open deliberation are instead pushed into the cloistered chambers of the Supreme Court. Lawmakers claim to resent judges who legislate from the bench - but they're making it a last resort.</p><p> -David Von Drehle writes a twice-weekly column for The Post. He was previously an editor-at-large for Time Magazine, and is the author of four books, including \"Rise to Greatness: Abraham Lincoln and America's Most Perilous Year\" and \"Triangle: The Fire That Changed America.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKPA-7308186</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F289A38EA1BA48B NWBKPA2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5R2V-R881-DXVP-V1HH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">401977</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"871\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 The Record Herald<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

But it's difficult because he owns eight computer and often gets calls from people needing computer help. He also has his own workshop where he experiments with computers.</p><p>At work, he's redesigning the network and expanding the number of servers so the company can handle more data while being able to back up essential information quickly.</p><p>Lately, he has been working on a more personal project.</p><p>\"These days I'm trying to keep my social life and work life separate,\" Rownd said. \"I'm trying to enjoy life and spend more time with my girlfriend.\"</p><p>FAMILY: Father, John Rownd 46, machine mechanic; Mother, Jackie Rownd, 46, Wal-Mart clerk; brother James Rownd, 20, car detailer; sister Amber Rownd, 16.</p><p>TECHNOLOGY EXPERTISE: \"Network design and server management,\" Rownd said. \"Basically, it means I work on all the stuff that you don't see, but it makes it possible for your computer to connect to other computers while you are working on it.\"</p><p>HOW I GOT INTO IT: When he was a freshman in high school, his uncle gave him spare computer parts and told him if he could build a computer he could keep the machine. \"I built that computer and learned a lot about computers \u2026 I never looked back and kept going forward.\"</p><p>FAVORITE TECH DEVICE: \"Right now, it is my Creative Labs wireless music device. This device allows me to play the digital music on my computer over my stereo.\"</p><p>FAVORITE TOOL: It's a program called Dameware Mini Remote Control. \"It allows me to run another computer on a network from my computer.\"</p><p>WHAT I'D TELL BILL GATES: \"Thank you. I'm thankful for the revolution he started. I'm working because of what he's done in a field I enjoy.\"</p><p>ADVICE FOR OTHER TECH HEADS: Don't stop learning, but also remember it's impossible to learn it all. \"Pick one part of the field and become an expert. Know a little about everything and know a lot about one thing.\"</p><p>ADVICE FOR NON-TECH HEADS: Take the time to read the messages that pop up on the computer screen instead of just pushing buttons to make the messages go away, he said. \"That's how so many people get Spyware and viruses. They need to learn to interpret the messages on the screen.\"</p><p>FUTURE PLANS: \"I would like to end up in San Diego because I love the weather. I would like to end up in a position where I can direct all facets of technology at a company. And I would love to teach technology.\"</p><p>WHAT'S THE NEXT BIG TECH ITEM?: New government regulations have recently been passed that require companies that deal with medical or financial data to keep backup records of all computer files. Because of that, he believes there are going to be a lot of new programs and computers designed specifically to keep track of massive amounts of information.</p><p>Do you know a tech head who should be recognized?

Start regulating, the argument ran, and you might as well regulate everything.</p><p>Well, now they want to. A white paper on internet regulation will soon be upon us, perhaps in a matter of weeks. \"The era of self-regulation of the internet is coming to an end,\" said the culture secretary, Jeremy Wright, and while the refrain may be subconscious it's impossible not to flash back to all that stuff about Fleet Street marking its own homework. Labour wants in on the act, too, as evidenced in a speech last week by Tom Watson, a man always keen to leap aboard passing bandwagons and use them to run people over.</p><p>Last time advocates rallied around the memory of Milly Dowler, whose phone was hacked after her death by The News of the World. This time, all cite Molly Russell, who died only a few months older, taking her own life after viewing images of self-harm on Instagram. Again, we hear of safeguards being required, of companies that have shown they are not to be trusted to police themselves. There is political capital to be made here, against a perfectly villainous industry that all rightthinking people already hate. One might almost say that Silicon Valley is drinking in the last-chance saloon.</p><p>The trouble is, the relationship between tech companies and the content they host is not exactly simple. For them, content means engagement, which means data, which means money, so their urge is indeed for more, not less. Yet unlike traditional publishers, they don't particularly care what that content is. Frequently they deny even being publishers, because that way lies responsibility. Without it, they are cavalier, but in both directions. Tech firms will tell you that they actually want rules, and the clearer the better, because they don't want to be the ones deciding what to take down. Yet the content they would be taking down, remember, is not only theirs. It is also yours.</p><p>Many countries try hard already to limit speech online. The firewalls of China or Iran are well known, but less so are the efforts of other nations to stay online while reining things in a bit. Every six months Twitter publishes a report of the demands to remove content deemed illegal worldwide. In the first quarter of 2018, Britain complained about 249 accounts, which is a bit more than America and a bit less than France. Turkey made 13,843 complaints, which was 73 per cent of the total worldwide.</p><p>Twitter was banned altogether in Turkey for a period in 2014. The experience led the company to develop ways of blocking content in some countries while permitting it elsewhere, which it still quietly does. And Twitter, in fairness, is more transparent about these things than most. When the next quarter of figures are revealed, expect a surge in demands from Pakistan. Towards the end of last year, many users - perhaps thousands - were emailed by the site with a warning that their tweets were in violation of Pakistani law, often after tweeting about Asia Bibi, a Christian woman accused of blasphemy, or just after criticising the government. Some consider this intimidatory. Yet with ignoble exceptions, big tech firms are still wary of bending over too overtly for illiberal regimes, fearing reputational backlash elsewhere. State regulation in a supposedly liberal country like Britain will change that calculation. Which side are we on? My aim here is not to defend the tech giants, any more than it was once to defend the tabloids. These companies have traduced our democracy and ravaged our mental health, and they should behave dramatically differently. Molly Russell, unquestionably, should not have been able to view what she did, and it's to the eternal shame of Mark Zuckerberg that she could. Move into the realms of state coercion, though, and I feel a familiar discomfort beginning to bubble.</p><p>On advertising, age protection, copyright and fraud, sure, pass laws and hit them hard. Data protection, too. On other content, by which I mean stuff that isn't illegal but we'd just rather wasn't there, I simply do not trust our politicians to get it right. Most are not even close to understanding the architecture of online freedom, such as the differences between the first and second categories I just mentioned, let alone the vast and vital difference between being free to post on a particular website (surely that's up to whoever owns it) and the ability to be online at all (which is something close to a human right).</p><p>Instead, I anticipate grandstanding speeches and self-satisfied moral certainty, just like last time, and supposedly liberal people completely forgetting what liberalism means, just like last time, too. In the end, it's not Facebook or Twitter whose speech they will blunder into curbing, because Facebook and Twitter aren't actually saying anything. Instead, it's yours. Remember, last time, where we said it could all lead? Well, this is it.</p><p>Here it comes.</p><p>Many countries are trying hard already to limit speech online</p><p>Our democracy has been traduced and our mental health ravaged</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TTIMES-146376467</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TTIMES2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VDF-3081-DYTY-C202-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">10939</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-02-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"931\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Times Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Times (London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"30374\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"02\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>February 12, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>National Edition</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009IZW</classCode><className>COMPUTER &amp;

Labour wants in on the act, too, as evidenced in a speech last week by Tom Watson, a man always keen to leap aboard passing bandwagons and use them to run people over.</p><p>Last time advocates rallied around the memory of Milly Dowler, whose phone was hacked after her death by </p><p>                   The News of the World                   </p><p>. This time, all cite Molly Russell, who died only a few months older, taking her own life after viewing images of self-harm on Instagram. Again, we hear of safeguards being required, of companies that have shown they are not to be trusted to police themselves. There is political capital to be made here, against a perfectly villainous industry that all right-thinking people already hate. One might almost say that Silicon Valley is drinking in the last-chance saloon.</p><p>The trouble is, the relationship between tech companies and the content they host is not exactly simple. For them, content means engagement, which means data, which means money, so their urge is indeed for more, not less. Yet unlike traditional publishers, they don't particularly care what that content is. Frequently they deny even being publishers, because that way lies responsibility. Without it, they are cavalier, but in both directions. Tech firms will tell you that they actually want rules, and the clearer the better, because they don't want to be the ones deciding what to take down. Yet the content they would be taking down, remember, is not only theirs. It is also yours.</p><p>Many countries try hard already to limit speech online. The firewalls of China or Iran are well known, but less so are the efforts of other nations to stay online while reining things in a bit. Every six months Twitter publishes a report of the demands to remove content deemed illegal worldwide. In the first quarter of 2018, Britain complained about 249 accounts, which is a bit more than America and a bit less than France. Turkey made 13,843 complaints, which was 73 per cent of the total worldwide.</p><p>Twitter was banned altogether in Turkey for a period in 2014. The experience led the company to develop ways of blocking content in some countries while permitting it elsewhere, which it still quietly does. And Twitter, in fairness, is more transparent about these things than most. When the next quarter of figures are revealed, expect a surge in demands from Pakistan. Towards the end of last year, many users - perhaps thousands - were emailed by the site with a warning that their tweets were in violation of Pakistani law, often after tweeting about Asia Bibi, a Christian woman accused of blasphemy, or just after criticising the government. Some consider this intimidatory. Yet with ignoble exceptions, big tech firms are still wary of bending over too overtly for illiberal regimes, fearing reputational backlash elsewhere. State regulation in a supposedly liberal country like Britain will change that calculation. Which side are we on?</p><p>My aim here is not to defend the tech giants, any more than it was once to defend the tabloids. These companies have traduced our democracy and ravaged our mental health, and they should behave dramatically differently. Molly Russell, unquestionably, should not have been able to view what she did, and it's to the eternal shame of Mark Zuckerberg that she could. Move into the realms of state coercion, though, and I feel a familiar discomfort beginning to bubble.</p><p>On advertising, age protection, copyright and fraud, sure, pass laws and hit them hard. Data protection, too. On other content, by which I mean stuff that isn't illegal but we'd just rather wasn't there, I simply do not trust our politicians to get it right. Most are not even close to understanding the architecture of online freedom, such as the differences between the first and second categories I just mentioned, let alone the vast and vital difference between being free to post on a particular website (surely that's up to whoever owns it) and the ability to be online at all (which is something close to a human right).</p><p>Instead, I anticipate grandstanding speeches and self-satisfied moral certainty, just like last time, and supposedly liberal people completely forgetting what liberalism means, just like last time, too. In the end, it's not Facebook or Twitter whose speech they will blunder into curbing, because Facebook and Twitter aren't actually saying anything. Instead, it's yours. Remember, last time, where we said it could all lead? Well, this is it. Here it comes.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TTIMWB-51665325</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TTIMWB2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VDC-17K1-F021-6265-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382503</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-02-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"918\"/><timeReceived>12:01 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 News International Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>thetimes.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"19719\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"02\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>February 12, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper;

Start regulating, the argument ran, and you might as well regulate everything.</p><p>Well, now they want to. A white paper on internet regulation will soon be upon us, perhaps in a matter of weeks. \"The era of self-regulation of the internet is coming to an end,\" said the culture secretary, Jeremy Wright, and while the refrain may be subconscious it's impossible not to flash back to all that stuff about Fleet Street marking its own homework. Labour wants in on the act, too, as evidenced in a speech last week by Tom Watson, a man always keen to leap aboard passing bandwagons and use them to run people over.</p><p>Last time advocates rallied around the memory of Milly Dowler, whose phone was hacked after her death by The News of the World. This time, all cite Molly Russell, who died only a few months older, taking her own life after viewing images of self-harm on Instagram. Again, we hear of safeguards being required, of companies that have shown they are not to be trusted to police themselves. There is political capital to be made here, against a perfectly villainous industry that all rightthinking people already hate. One might almost say that Silicon Valley is drinking in the last-chance saloon.</p><p>The trouble is, the relationship between tech companies and the content they host is not exactly simple. For them, content means engagement, which means data, which means money, so their urge is indeed for more, not less. Yet unlike traditional publishers, they don't particularly care what that content is. Frequently they deny even being publishers, because that way lies responsibility. Without it, they are cavalier, but in both directions. Tech firms will tell you that they actually want rules, and the clearer the better, because they don't want to be the ones deciding what to take down. Yet the content they would be taking down, remember, is not only theirs. It is also yours.</p><p>Many countries try hard already to limit speech online. The firewalls of China or Iran are well known, but less so are the efforts of other nations to stay online while reining things in a bit. Every six months Twitter publishes a report of the demands to remove content deemed illegal worldwide. In the first quarter of 2018, Britain complained about 249 accounts, which is a bit more than America and a bit less than France. Turkey made 13,843 complaints, which was 73 per cent of the total worldwide.</p><p>Twitter was banned altogether in Turkey for a period in 2014. The experience led the company to develop ways of blocking content in some countries while permitting it elsewhere, which it still quietly does. And Twitter, in fairness, is more transparent about these things than most. When the next quarter of figures are revealed, expect a surge in demands from Pakistan. Towards the end of last year, many users - perhaps thousands - were emailed by the site with a warning that their tweets were in violation of Pakistani law, often after tweeting about Asia Bibi, a Christian woman accused of blasphemy, or just after criticising the government. Some consider this intimidatory. Yet with ignoble exceptions, big tech firms are still wary of bending over too overtly for illiberal regimes, fearing reputational backlash elsewhere. State regulation in a supposedly liberal country like Britain will change that calculation. Which side are we on? My aim here is not to defend the tech giants, any more than it was once to defend the tabloids. These companies have traduced our democracy and ravaged our mental health, and they should behave dramatically differently. Molly Russell, unquestionably, should not have been able to view what she did, and it's to the eternal shame of Mark Zuckerberg that she could. Move into the realms of state coercion, though, and I feel a familiar discomfort beginning to bubble.</p><p>On advertising, age protection, copyright and fraud, sure, pass laws and hit them hard. Data protection, too. On other content, by which I mean stuff that isn't illegal but we'd just rather wasn't there, I simply do not trust our politicians to get it right. Most are not even close to understanding the architecture of online freedom, such as the differences between the first and second categories I just mentioned, let alone the vast and vital difference between being free to post on a particular website (surely that's up to whoever owns it) and the ability to be online at all (which is something close to a human right).</p><p>Instead, I anticipate grandstanding speeches and self-satisfied moral certainty, just like last time, and supposedly liberal people completely forgetting what liberalism means, just like last time, too. In the end, it's not Facebook or Twitter whose speech they will blunder into curbing, because Facebook and Twitter aren't actually saying anything. Instead, it's yours. Remember, last time, where we said it could all lead? Well, this is it.</p><p>Here it comes.</p><p>Many countries are trying hard already to limit speech online</p><p>Our democracy has been traduced and our mental health ravaged</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TTIMES-146376467</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TTIMES2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VDF-40X1-JCBW-N55G-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">10939</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-02-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"931\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Times Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Times (London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"30374\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"02\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>February 12, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>National Edition</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009IZW</classCode><className>COMPUTER &amp;

Start regulating, the argument ran, and you might as well regulate everything.</p><p>Well, now they want to. A white paper on internet regulation will soon be upon us, perhaps in a matter of weeks. \"The era of self-regulation of the internet is coming to an end,\" said the culture secretary, Jeremy Wright, and while the refrain may be subconscious it's impossible not to flash back to all that stuff about Fleet Street marking its own homework. Labour wants in on the act, too, as evidenced in a speech last week by Tom Watson, a man always keen to leap aboard passing bandwagons and use them to run people over.</p><p>Last time advocates rallied around the memory of Milly Dowler, whose phone was hacked after her death by The News of the World. This time, all cite Molly Russell, who died only a few months older, taking her own life after viewing images of self-harm on Instagram. Again, we hear of safeguards being required, of companies that have shown they are not to be trusted to police themselves. There is political capital to be made here, against a perfectly villainous industry that all rightthinking people already hate. One might almost say that Silicon Valley is drinking in the last-chance saloon.</p><p>The trouble is, the relationship between tech companies and the content they host is not exactly simple. For them, content means engagement, which means data, which means money, so their urge is indeed for more, not less. Yet unlike traditional publishers, they don't particularly care what that content is. Frequently they deny even being publishers, because that way lies responsibility. Without it, they are cavalier, but in both directions. Tech firms will tell you that they actually want rules, and the clearer the better, because they don't want to be the ones deciding what to take down. Yet the content they would be taking down, remember, is not only theirs. It is also yours.</p><p>Many countries try hard already to limit speech online. The firewalls of China or Iran are well known, but less so are the efforts of other nations to stay online while reining things in a bit. Every six months Twitter publishes a report of the demands to remove content deemed illegal worldwide. In the first quarter of 2018, Britain complained about 249 accounts, which is a bit more than America and a bit less than France. Turkey made 13,843 complaints, which was 73 per cent of the total worldwide.</p><p>Twitter was banned altogether in Turkey for a period in 2014. The experience led the company to develop ways of blocking content in some countries while permitting it elsewhere, which it still quietly does. And Twitter, in fairness, is more transparent about these things than most. When the next quarter of figures are revealed, expect a surge in demands from Pakistan. Towards the end of last year, many users - perhaps thousands - were emailed by the site with a warning that their tweets were in violation of Pakistani law, often after tweeting about Asia Bibi, a Christian woman accused of blasphemy, or just after criticising the government. Some consider this intimidatory. Yet with ignoble exceptions, big tech firms are still wary of bending over too overtly for illiberal regimes, fearing reputational backlash elsewhere. State regulation in a supposedly liberal country like Britain will change that calculation. Which side are we on? My aim here is not to defend the tech giants, any more than it was once to defend the tabloids. These companies have traduced our democracy and ravaged our mental health, and they should behave dramatically differently. Molly Russell, unquestionably, should not have been able to view what she did, and it's to the eternal shame of Mark Zuckerberg that she could. Move into the realms of state coercion, though, and I feel a familiar discomfort beginning to bubble.</p><p>On advertising, age protection, copyright and fraud, sure, pass laws and hit them hard. Data protection, too. On other content, by which I mean stuff that isn't illegal but we'd just rather wasn't there, I simply do not trust our politicians to get it right. Most are not even close to understanding the architecture of online freedom, such as the differences between the first and second categories I just mentioned, let alone the vast and vital difference between being free to post on a particular website (surely that's up to whoever owns it) and the ability to be online at all (which is something close to a human right).</p><p>Instead, I anticipate grandstanding speeches and self-satisfied moral certainty, just like last time, and supposedly liberal people completely forgetting what liberalism means, just like last time, too. In the end, it's not Facebook or Twitter whose speech they will blunder into curbing, because Facebook and Twitter aren't actually saying anything. Instead, it's yours. Remember, last time, where we said it could all lead? Well, this is it.</p><p>Here it comes.</p><p>Many countries are trying hard already to limit speech online</p><p>Our democracy has been traduced and our mental health ravaged</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TTIMES-146378147</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TTIMES2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VDF-3081-DYTY-C1MS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">10939</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-02-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"933\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Times Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Times (London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"30374\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, Ireland</edition><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"02\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>February 12, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Ireland</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009IZW</classCode><className>COMPUTER &amp;

Under the laws, online platforms like Google, Facebook and Twitter face fines of up to $50 million euros if they do not remove \"obviously illegal\" hate speech within 24 hours of notification. The laws had an immediate effect, prompting Facebook to hire 1200 additional staff to monitor its website in Germany.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Just days later, Amy Jayne Everett, a 14-year-old Australian girl, committed suicide after enduring protracted cyber-bullying. Her death spawned an outpouring of grief and with a grim irony, a social media campaign, #doitfordolly . In 2011, following the tragic death of a young hospitality worker, Brodie Panlock, a campaign for stronger laws against workplace bullying prompted the Victorian state government to act. Brodie's law, as it is now called, is one of the weapons deployed against workplace bullies. Regulating workplaces is one thing; the internet is quite another. To date, there has been no suggestion of legislative reform in the wake of the death of Amy Jayne Everett.</p><p>Big Tech monopolies have enormous financial muscle and political clout. Google was founded in 1998 and now enjoys 88 per cent of the online advertising market. Facebook is even younger, emerging in 2004. It now owns 77 per cent of mobile social traffic.</p><p>Their near monopoly control is prompting growing calls for legislators to break them up, just as natural monopolies like telephone company and utilities have been treated in the past. In an effort to thwart legislative intervention, the Silicon Valley giants are spending vast sums on political lobbying and swamping Washington with lobbyists.</p><p>Their platforms resemble the wild west but with more carnage. They don't just distort markets, harvest our personal data, disseminate fake news and damage political systems; like guns, they can be used to kill and injure. Literally, as the death of Amy Jane Everett shows. Cyber-hate, cyber-bullying and the use of online platforms to further terrorism all contribute to a global death and injury toll.</p><p>While Australian politics has regressed into examining the sex lives of its politicians and slut-shaming, Europe is leading the charge in moving to regulate the internet monopolies that dominate our lives. To date, the German laws are the high point of internet regulation. In the US, both conservatives and liberals are now arguing for legal intervention. In 2015, New Zealand created a suite of criminal penalties and civil remedies to address cyber violence.</p><p>Making cyberspace safe shouldn't be that hard. All that is needed is to provide companies like Facebook, Google and Twitter with a strong financial incentive to clean up their platforms.</p><p>The vastness of cyberspace means that no single regulator can hope to make it safe by reigning in its worst excesses. Even criminal acts in cyberspace are rarely prosecuted.</p><p>Any effective regulatory response must ensure that individuals who are harmed or threatened with harm are empowered to act quickly to seek a legal remedy including compensation and injuctions against the online platforms. Give victims of cyber-hate the legal tools to sue Google, Facebook, Twitter and others and the effect would be dramatic. Big Tech companies would be compelled to commit serious resources to cleaning up their platforms.</p><p>Any new laws would need to impose a duty of care on the big tech companies. They could be sued, along with the perpetrator of cyberhate, where they did not take reasonable care to protect the individual target.</p><p>Before the Wright brothers took flight, there were next to no laws about what could or could not be done in aerospace. Today there are thousands of laws related to aviation, changed all the time as technology changes and advances, varying from state to state and country to country.

Under the laws, online platforms like Google, Facebook and Twitter face fines of up to (EURO)50 million ($80 million) if they do not remove \"obviously illegal\" hate speech within 24 hours of notification.</p><p>The laws had an immediate effect, prompting Facebook to hire 1200 additional staff to monitor its website in Germany.</p><p>Just days later, Amy Jayne \"Dolly\" Everett, a 14-year-old Australian, took her own life after enduring protracted cyber bullying. Her death spawned an outpouring of grief and, with a grim irony, a social media campaign, #doitfordolly. In 2011, following the death of a young hospitality worker, Brodie Panlock, a campaign for stronger laws against workplace bullying prompted the Victorian state government to act. Brodie's law, as it is now called, is one of the weapons deployed against workplace bullies. Regulating workplaces is one thing; the internet is quite another. To date, there has been no suggestion of legislative reform after the death of Amy Jayne.</p><p>Big Tech monopolies have enormous financial muscle and political clout. Google was founded in 1998 and enjoys 88 per cent of the online advertising market. Facebook is even younger, emerging in 2004. It now owns 77 per cent of mobile social traffic. Their platforms resemble the Wild West but with more carnage. They don't just distort markets, harvest our personal data, disseminate fake news and damage political systems; like guns, they can be used to kill and injure. Literally, as the death of Amy Jayne shows. Cyber hate, cyber bullying and the use of online platforms to further terrorism, all contribute to a global death and injury toll.</p><p>Europe is leading the charge in moving to regulate the internet monopolies. To date, the German laws are the high point of internet regulation.</p><p>Making cyberspace safe shouldn't be that hard. All that is needed is to provide companies like Facebook, Google and Twitter with a strong financial incentive to clean up their platforms. The vastness of cyberspace means no single regulator can hope to make it safe by reigning in its worst excesses. Even criminal acts in cyberspace are rarely prosecuted.</p><p>Any effective regulatory response must ensure that individuals who are harmed or threatened with harm are empowered to act quickly to seek a legal remedy, including compensation and injunctions against the online platforms. Give victims of cyber hate the legal tools to sue Google, Facebook, Twitter and others and the effect would be dramatic. Big Tech companies would be compelled to commit serious resources to cleaning up their platforms.</p><p>Any new laws would need to impose a duty of care on the big companies. They could be sued, along with the perpetrator of cyber hate, where they did not take reasonable care to protect the individual target.</p><p>Before the Wright brothers took flight, there were next to no laws about what could or could not be done in aerospace. Today there are thousands of laws related to aviation, changed all the time as technology changes and advances, varying from state to state and country to country. If Australian politicians are going to strive for community safety, they must overcome their timidity in regulating cyberspace.</p><p>Josh Bornstein is a lawyer who will give evidence to the Senate's Legal and Constitutional Affairs References Committee Inquiry into cyber bullying today.</p><p>Lifeline 13 11 14</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SMHRLD-doc6z5dtcu9n4gtkczqfvj</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SMHRLD2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RT8-SN81-JD34-V14S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">314237</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"571\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Sydney Morning Herald (Australia)</publicationName><edition>Print &amp;
